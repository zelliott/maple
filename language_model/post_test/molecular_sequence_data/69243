The zzso forming zzso zzso is a key factor in zzso zzso To understand better the regulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso we set out to isolate and characterize a complementary DNA zzso zzso the zzso from zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso library was screened with zzso 13, a tomato zzso coding for the zzso A zzso clone zzso was zzso The zzso is 1200 zzso zzso in length and predicts a protein of zzso zzso The insert includes the complete open reading frame of zzso zzso and shows strong zzso with several reported zzso both at the zzso and zzso acid zzso In whole zzso expression of zzso was enhanced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso In contrast, heat shock had no effect on the zzso
