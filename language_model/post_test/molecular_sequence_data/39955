The zzso junction complex zzso plays a major role in zzso regulation of zzso in zzso The zzso is deposited onto zzso during zzso and is transported to the zzso where it influences translation, zzso and zzso of the spliced zzso The complex is formed by the association of four proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The zzso A resolution structure of the zzso reveals how it zzso locks onto zzso The zzso protein zzso encloses an zzso zzso and provides the binding sites for six zzso zzso wraps around zzso and stacks against the zzso zzso An intertwined network of interactions anchors zzso and zzso at the interface between the two zzso of zzso effectively stabilizing the zzso bound zzso zzso with the structure of the zzso zzso that we have also determined reveals that large zzso changes are required upon zzso assembly and zzso
