Among zzso cells, the gastric zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso accessory zzso of zzso zzso and pancreatic ducts exhibiting gastric zzso are unique in that they express class III zzso identified by paradoxical Con A zzso composed of zzso zzso sodium zzso reduction, Con A, and zzso zzso zzso Recently it was shown that these zzso cells zzso zzso having zzso at zzso terminals of the zzso zzso zzso we describe the expression cloning of a zzso zzso a human zzso zzso a key zzso for the formation of zzso zzso cells were thus zzso with a stomach zzso library and a zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were screened by using zzso zzso specific for zzso and enriched by zzso cell zzso zzso selection of recovered plasmids resulted in a zzso clone that directs the expression of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence predicts a type II membrane protein with 340 zzso zzso showing no significant similarity with any other zzso The zzso gene is located at zzso zzso and its transcripts are expressed in the stomach and zzso An in zzso zzso zzso zzso by using a soluble zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso are transferred most efficiently to core 2 zzso zzso zzso forming zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into gastric zzso zzso cells produced class III zzso indicating that zzso is responsible for the formation of class III Con A zzso These results indicate that the zzso is a zzso that forms zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso
