zzso of zzso sequence within a cell is maintained by mechanisms working at the DNA zzso The imperative to maintain zzso is thought to result from pressure to maintain the sequence of the zzso zzso We have investigated the extent of sequence variation within and between members of a species that is unable to zzso some standard mechanisms of zzso sequence zzso We have compared the sequence of the internal transcribed zzso zzso located between the 18 S zzso and zzso S zzso genes of five different zzso of a single zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences are identical at 80 to zzso of the positions among the three zzso expressed genes zzso and zzso between the two genes expressed during zzso zzso with only 42 to 57% identity between the zzso This is rather startling in that the differences described here for a single zzso are greater than those normally seen when comparing zzso units from zzso related zzso We observe an apparent conservation of secondary structure within zzso sequences from the different zzso units, which would reflect a level of selection at the zzso but the zzso seems to be quite tolerant of primary sequence zzso Investigation of the mature coding region within the 18 S zzso genes did not reveal sequence variation within A- and zzso from a single zzso However, comparison of the 18 S zzso coding region from 17 geographically distinct strains reveals up to zzso sequence variation within a 400 zzso zzso Hence zzso of zzso units within a species does not seem to be an imperative driven totally by selection at the zzso zzso The extraordinary maintenance of zzso within zzso units normally seen within a species appears to have significance beyond those that can be ascribed to the events involved in processing, assembly and function of the zzso
