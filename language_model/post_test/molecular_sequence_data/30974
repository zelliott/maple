A zzso portion of the zzso from the Chlorella virus, zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso five open reading frames zzso were identified on this zzso zzso analysis indicates that each zzso encodes complex patterns of zzso The total length of transcribed zzso exceeds that of the zzso indicating either zzso modification or multiple zzso zzso zzso The sequence zzso previously described as the zzso stop site for the early genes of zzso virus, is also found downstream of each of our zzso The regions zzso to each zzso were very A + zzso zzso zzso but distinct promoter sequences were not zzso zzso
