Alzheimer's disease zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory and cognitive impairment and is the leading cause of zzso in the zzso A number of zzso wide association studies and subsequent replication studies have been published recently on late onset zzso zzso These studies identified several new zzso genes including zzso zzso assembly protein zzso on zzso zzso The aim of our study was to examine the entire coding sequence of zzso to determine if the association could be explained by any previously zzso sequence zzso zzso we zzso 48 cases and 48 controls zzso for the risk zzso in the signal zzso zzso We did not find any new zzso however, zzso a known coding synonymous zzso that is part of an zzso zzso zzso region in zzso 5, is in strong linkage zzso with zzso and should be examined for functional significance in zzso zzso
