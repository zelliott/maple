The binding of two zzso zzso consisting of the zzso or zzso DNA binding domain of zzso zzso fused to zzso binding zzso to specific zzso zzso was analyzed by gel mobility shift zzso The zzso protein with the zzso domain formed two complexes of different zzso zzso The zzso complex, whose formation displayed no zzso contained two protein zzso bound to a single DNA zzso The zzso complex, whose formation involved cooperative binding zzso zzso zzso zzso contained four protein zzso bound to a single DNA zzso zzso interference experiments coupled with the analysis of protein binding to zzso zzso zzso showed that formation of the zzso complex containing two protein zzso required the presence of two zzso direct repeats (called zzso in direct zzso zzso of the zzso complex required only a single zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso could serve to position two zzso zzso on the DNA near each end of the zzso and assist in bringing together the ends of the zzso so that zzso can zzso The zzso protein with the zzso domain of zzso also formed two complexes of different zzso zzso The major, zzso complex, whose formation involved cooperative zzso contained two protein molecules bound to one DNA zzso This finding suggested that while the zzso domain of zzso can bind DNA as a zzso a cooperative interaction between two zzso of the zzso domain may help to bring the ends of the zzso together during zzso
