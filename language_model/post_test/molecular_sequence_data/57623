The complex zzso filaments of the zzso zzso member zzso coli zzso are composed of two highly related zzso proteins zzso by the zzso and zzso genes which share zzso zzso Using zzso zzso based on the known DNA sequence of both the zzso and zzso genes from zzso coli zzso in the zzso chain reaction, we have shown conservation of both zzso genes among zzso within the zzso zzso zzso by zzso of the amplified product with zzso and zzso restriction zzso zzso and subsequent restriction analysis of the zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso belonging to 13 different zzso zzso further identified 10 unique zzso zzso Within most of the zzso zzso zzso appeared to contain zzso genes with zzso primary zzso Only in zzso zzso and zzso did independent zzso possess zzso genes with different primary zzso Furthermore, by employing zzso specific for the zzso gene of zzso coli zzso all zzso examined contained a second zzso gene corresponding to zzso In all zzso except the zzso and zzso zzso which were identical to each other, the zzso pattern of this zzso gene was identical to that of the corresponding zzso zzso These data indicate that the presence of a second highly zzso zzso gene is widespread throughout zzso zzso and that in most instances, the primary structure of the two zzso genes is zzso within zzso belonging to the same zzso zzso zzso This may represent the presence of zzso evolutionary groups in zzso zzso
