zzso zzso are a highly zzso zzso of peptides which are primarily characterized by the ability to suppress contraction of visceral muscles in a variety of insect zzso We have isolated a zzso from the true zzso zzso zzso that encodes a zzso containing a zzso identical to zzso We have shown that this zzso gene appears to be expressed in late zzso and adult zzso In zzso zzso a number of zzso peptides have previously been zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two larger peptides zzso and zzso that contain the shorter zzso sequence at their zzso zzso with the true zzso zzso characterized here identifies zzso and zzso as partially processed products from the same zzso zzso in the true zzso was shown by in zzso zzso to occur in over 150 cells throughout the adult brain and nerve cord, and also to occur in both open and closed zzso type cells of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso in cabbage zzso zzso was used to assess the potential for zzso expression as a means of enhancing virus zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in raised levels of zzso products in the zzso of infected insects, but the products were found to be chemically distinguishable from authentic mature zzso and probably represent partially processed zzso
