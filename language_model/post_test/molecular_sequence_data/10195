zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso is almost ubiquitous in body zzso and its zzso labels the corresponding zzso zzso We have found that zzso alpha zzso is also expressed in human zzso We cloned the zzso alpha zzso zzso by screening our zzso library, derived from zzso zzso with a probe for prostate zzso alpha zzso It had complete zzso acid sequence zzso with that from zzso including the signal zzso Just as zzso alpha zzso expression is higher in more differentiated breast tumors, so in skin tumors the highest zzso levels occurred in the normal controls, the lowest in zzso cell zzso (the least differentiated zzso tumor zzso and intermediate levels in zzso cell zzso and Merkel cell zzso A similar increase in zzso alpha zzso gene expression with differentiation was observed when zzso zzso were cultured in media that varied in cellular maturation zzso
