Ten human zzso B cell lines that express the zzso associated Id zzso were analyzed using an zzso zzso Five of eight tested lines were also strongly positive for the zzso zzso We found that all the zzso positive lines expressed zzso light chain zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was also found on a cell line expressing a zzso light chain gene and on a line expressing a V light chain zzso The two zzso recognized a linear light chain zzso on zzso zzso light chains but also a zzso zzso on zzso zzso light chains that appeared to be dependent on the presence of a heavy zzso zzso zzso occurred on both zzso positive and zzso negative zzso Within this zzso system, the basis for zzso zzso and zzso zzso is complex, subject to both heavy and light chain gene usage and sensitive to small numbers of zzso zzso
