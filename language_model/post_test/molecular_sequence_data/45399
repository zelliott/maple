The land snail zzso zzso consists of six species and has a zzso zzso most of the species have a very narrow range and all of them except one zzso zzso which inhabits zzso zzso are strictly bound to zzso zzso One species zzso zzso is limited to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because the potential for zzso of these snails is low, the insular range of this species has been traditionally related to the zzso detachment of the zzso zzso from the zzso plate and its subsequent rotation towards the Italian zzso In this study, we used sequences of three zzso and one nuclear gene to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the zzso Our zzso results are consistent with the genetic relationships found using zzso but contrast with the zzso hypotheses based on zzso and zzso zzso clock estimates indicate that the main zzso events in the zzso occurred between the middle zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso relationships and geological considerations suggest that the zzso of the zzso can be explained by zzso zzso zzso Our zzso do not support a zzso relation between the split of zzso zzso from its zzso sister zzso and the initial zzso of the detachment of the zzso zzso from the zzso On the contrary, time estimates coincide with the very last phase of detachment of the zzso (from 5 to 3 zzso zzso Overall, our molecular clock estimates are in good agreement with the latest geological views on the zzso evolution of the zzso zzso
