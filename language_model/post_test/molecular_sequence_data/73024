Type II zzso help regulate DNA zzso during transcription, replication and zzso by zzso DNA strand transfer through transient zzso zzso All type II zzso described so far are members of a single protein zzso We have cloned and zzso the genes zzso the A and B zzso of zzso II from the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is the first of a new zzso It has no similarity with other type II zzso except for three motifs in the B zzso probably involved in zzso binding and zzso We also found these motifs in proteins of the zzso and zzso zzso The A zzso has similarities with four proteins of unknown zzso One of them, the zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for the initiation of zzso zzso zzso performed on zzso of the single zzso zzso between the five zzso shows that this zzso acid is essential for zzso zzso By zzso with the mechanism of action of known type II zzso we suggest that zzso zzso the formation of zzso breaks that initiate zzso zzso in zzso zzso
