zzso and zzso are both proteins that interact with zzso and enhance its ability to induce zzso by selectively zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a third member of the family that is the most zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso Here, we have described zzso a longer form of zzso which at 828 zzso acids is more than twice the size of zzso Using two zzso that recognize both zzso and zzso we report that this longer form of zzso is the zzso form of the zzso expressed in zzso Like zzso zzso also binds to zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso However, whereas zzso is predominantly zzso the zzso of zzso is entirely zzso and the longer zzso is located in both the zzso and the zzso The effect upon zzso zzso of the longer zzso of zzso means that this new, longer form of the zzso may be subject to greater regulation and provides another layer in the control of zzso zzso
