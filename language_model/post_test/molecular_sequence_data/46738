zzso proteins zzso comprise a functionally distinct group of incompletely characterized members in the zzso family of zzso zzso We took advantage of the zzso binding characteristics of human zzso to develop a specific, high affinity binding zzso that allowed the zzso of a novel zzso zzso A zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso was identified and zzso from bovine brain zzso zzso binding is specific to zzso with high affinity but does not interact with zzso or activated zzso or zzso zzso Based on zzso sequences of zzso bovine zzso the human zzso sequence was zzso The zzso pair zzso open reading frame encodes a novel zzso acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to bind zzso in a manner indistinguishable from native zzso Northern and Western analyses indicated zzso is expressed in all zzso zzso The lack of zzso membrane association of zzso or zzso upon zzso of zzso is suggestive of actions quite distinct from those of the zzso The lack of zzso zzso protein activity in zzso led us to conclude that the specific interaction with zzso is most consistent with zzso being the first identified zzso zzso
