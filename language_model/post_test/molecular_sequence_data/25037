We characterized the zzso 1 ( zzso locus in two nonhuman primates species, zzso zzso and Pan zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso several zzso generated through alternative zzso were observed in both zzso zzso acid alignment between the five species in which zzso has been characterized to date - human, zzso orangutan, zzso and rat - reveals a very high degree of conservation specially in the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso The main differences concentrate in the zzso and zzso zzso In the three primates species there is a zzso zzso inside the putative zzso domain which is not present in zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso region is longer in zzso with a zzso zzso motif that could be involved in zzso zzso this motif is absent in the three zzso zzso We also describe the presence in the zzso of a sequence zzso to the zzso zzso previously found in zzso
