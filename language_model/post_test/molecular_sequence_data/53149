Four novel zzso zzso peptides containing zzso zzso acid zzso named zzso zzso have been isolated from the zzso zzso tropical plant zzso zzso Their primary structure, including zzso acid composition and zzso was determined by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso and by zzso zzso of reduced zzso followed by zzso degradation and mass zzso All of the zzso contain six zzso which are present as three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed high degrees of sequence zzso to the known zzso A and zzso A and B from the zzso family but much less zzso to the zzso peptides from zzso a member of the same family zzso
