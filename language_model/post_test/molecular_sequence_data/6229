We have cloned a zzso from the plant zzso zzso which encodes a novel zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso to lycopene when expressed in zzso coli cells accumulating zzso or zzso This zzso is unable to zzso either zzso or zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence suggests that this zzso encodes a zzso whose mature size is zzso 59 zzso and which is zzso as a precursor with a zzso extension resembling transit peptides for zzso zzso zzso comparison reveals zzso similarity with previously cloned plant or zzso zzso zzso In contrast, only limited sequence similarity is found with a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso
