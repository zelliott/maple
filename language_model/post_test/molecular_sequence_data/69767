zzso zzso A zzso is an acute phase protein and the precursor of zzso protein A zzso in deposits of secondary zzso Several zzso exist in zzso but previous studies suggest that mink AA is derived from only zzso To assess the effect of repeated episodes of inflammation and induction of zzso qualitative and quantitative changes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Young female mink received subcutaneous zzso injections for zzso zzso Studies were performed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso specific for each of two zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels increased dramatically after inflammatory zzso and were subsequently maintained at elevated levels, showing considerable zzso variation, but only a slight decrease during repeated inflammatory stimuli and the early stages of zzso zzso No preferential zzso of zzso specifying a particular zzso was found during the zzso zzso expression of mink zzso zzso during repeated inflammatory stimulation does not seem to explain why only zzso AA is found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seemed to be independently regulated and may thus represent another, yet not zzso zzso zzso
