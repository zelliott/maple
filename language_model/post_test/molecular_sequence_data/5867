zzso is associated with formation of skeletal muscle and the neural tube in developing zzso Interestingly, in adult mice, zzso of zzso are associated with differences in the efficiency of skeletal muscle regrowth between mouse zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that zzso is expressed in skeletal muscle or other zzso from adult zzso Total zzso was isolated from adult mouse zzso and the zzso chain reaction was performed on reverse transcribed zzso using zzso specific for regions that zzso the paired and zzso of zzso At least four different zzso transcripts were zzso A full-length transcript similar in sequence to that published previously was identified in skeletal muscle, brain and zzso cells of adult zzso Further putative full-length zzso zzso including one that contains a zzso zzso in the paired box and one in which approximately 10 zzso have been deleted in the zzso were found to be expressed in skeletal muscle and brain of adult mice, zzso A truncated zzso zzso product zzso the paired box only was found to be expressed in most adult zzso except zzso zzso of these studies demonstrate that there are alternate transcripts of zzso some of which are expressed exclusively in adult skeletal muscle and zzso It is possible that one of these transcripts may specify an alternate zzso zzso involved in zzso of damaged skeletal muscle in adult zzso
