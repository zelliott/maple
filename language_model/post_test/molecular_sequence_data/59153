zzso III of the basement membrane zzso zzso was produced as three overlapping fragments in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso These zzso fragments zzso zzso were obtained in zzso form and showed complete zzso zzso with zzso indicating their native zzso zzso zzso electron zzso of each zzso demonstrated a small zzso structure connected to a short zzso These data were interpreted to indicate that domain III has an zzso shape of 30 zzso in length and consists of alternating zzso zzso zzso zzso and short connecting segments attributed to tandem zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso which form zzso segments in zzso zzso analyses of zzso fragments were consistent with the zzso patterns known for these zzso from studies with zzso fragments, but two additional zzso zzso were also zzso Several cell lines which attached to mouse zzso and/or human zzso failed to adhere to the domain III fragments, despite the fact that one of them contained an zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso Furthermore, no significant binding was observed in solid phase binding zzso with alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha v beta 3 zzso zzso the low activity or accessibility of the zzso zzso
