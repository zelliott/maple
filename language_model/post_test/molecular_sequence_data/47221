Basic nuclear proteins were isolated from the zzso of the Syrian zzso zzso zzso and characterized by gel zzso zzso acid analysis, and zzso zzso of the proteins by gel zzso show that zzso of this species contain both zzso 1 and zzso The two proteins were zzso by zzso and the complete primary sequence of zzso zzso 1 was determined by automated zzso acid sequence zzso The protein sequence was subsequently confirmed by sequencing the zzso zzso 1 zzso The first zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 2 sequence were obtained by zzso acid sequence analysis of the isolated zzso and this sequence was also confirmed and extended by sequencing the zzso Total basic nuclear protein was also isolated from zzso of six other species of zzso the zzso were identified by zzso and zzso acid analysis, and the proportion of zzso 1 and 2 in each species was zzso zzso differences in the zzso 2 content of zzso were observed among the different species of zzso This variation and the high level of sequence similarity between mouse and zzso zzso provide insight into how the two zzso may be organized in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Published 1999 zzso zzso
