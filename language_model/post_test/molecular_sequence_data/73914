zzso an zzso zzso expressed on the surface of activated zzso cells, is essential for zzso rolling on zzso which leads to zzso in the process of zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso stimuli such as zzso or zzso is reduced markedly in the presence of zzso a synthetic zzso and potent zzso zzso We have investigated the molecular mechanism underlying zzso zzso repression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression is paralleled by a decrease in zzso zzso and is based on changes in zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter revealed that induction by zzso stimuli as well as repression by zzso are zzso by the same promoter region containing three closely spaced binding sites for nuclear factor zzso and an element, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occupied by zzso and zzso zzso contributes to zzso promoter activity, but does not zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso directed by the zzso zzso elements is reduced strongly in the presence of zzso thus identifying zzso as the primary target for zzso zzso zzso
