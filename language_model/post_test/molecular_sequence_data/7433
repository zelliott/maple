We isolated zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso and studied their expression pattern during zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence with the zzso soybean and alfalfa zzso sequences showed that the sequences contain two zzso regions, called region I and region zzso zzso of all the potential open reading frames zzso showed that all the five different zzso clones zzso a highly zzso small zzso of 12 or 13 zzso acids zzso by an zzso located in region zzso zzso we studied with in zzso zzso the expression pattern of zzso zzso and zzso during zzso zzso zzso Although the expression of these genes is largely similar to that of the pea counterparts, differences where found for the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso is expressed in the whole zzso zone II, whereas in pea zzso is only expressed in the zzso part of this zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso cells of zzso zzso while in pea zzso is expressed in both the zzso and infected cells of this zzso
