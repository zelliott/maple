The present study describes the characterization of an African zzso fever virus gene zzso to zzso The zzso designated zzso is located within the zzso B zzso in the central region of the virus zzso and encodes a zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso The protein is characterized by the presence of a putative zzso zzso domain at the zzso zzso The gene is expressed at the late stage of virus infection, and zzso is initiated at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso relative to the first zzso of the translation start zzso zzso zzso presents a zzso arrangement of the four highly zzso regions and the two zzso motifs characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso Throughout these regions, the percentages of identity between protein zzso and various zzso range from zzso to zzso The gene was cloned in zzso zzso without the zzso zzso region and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso essentially to zzso by affinity zzso zzso the sequential zzso of zzso zzso with different zzso zzso zzso zzso being the best zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso containing 3-13 zzso units are zzso which identifies the zzso protein as a zzso
