zzso specificity in avian zzso and zzso viruses zzso maps to the central region of the envelope surface zzso zzso Two zzso regions, zzso and zzso within this region of zzso are the principal zzso of zzso zzso The cellular zzso for zzso A zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso sequence for viral binding and zzso This domain in zzso is closely related to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bind to zzso via the interaction of clustered basic zzso in the zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Analysis of the zzso envelope sequences revealed a cluster of basic zzso within zzso that is unique to the zzso A zzso suggesting a possible role for these zzso in zzso zzso zzso the effects of altering these basic zzso on zzso A envelope zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Most of the zzso proteins were transported to the cell surface and processed zzso zzso binding was diminished approximately 50% by zzso substitution at zzso acid zzso or zzso whereas substitution by zzso at zzso zzso or zzso had no zzso However, when coupled with zzso at zzso or zzso changes at zzso reduced envelope binding by zzso zzso of all five basic zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso infection did not parallel the effect on zzso zzso zzso 210, zzso zzso and 224 were important for efficient infection, while zzso at zzso 227 had little effect on zzso These results demonstrate that the basic zzso in the zzso envelope have roles in both zzso recognition and zzso binding events during viral zzso
