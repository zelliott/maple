The genetic zzso in muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease) was zzso Six zzso for muscle zzso including a full-length zzso were isolated from a zzso library of muscle from a zzso By sequence analysis of these zzso a zzso zzso deletion was zzso The rest of the sequence was identical to that of the normal zzso except for a silent base transition at position 516 zzso zzso to zzso zzso The deletion was located in the zzso region of zzso 13 zzso with reference to the rabbit muscle zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso French, zzso zzso zzso and Chang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA of the patient was amplified by zzso chain zzso zzso analysis of the amplified DNA revealed a point zzso from G to T at the zzso of zzso zzso This zzso changed the normal zzso site of zzso to zzso A cryptic zzso site of zzso located 75 bases upstream from the normal zzso site was recognized and spliced in the zzso
