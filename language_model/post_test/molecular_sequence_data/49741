The nuclear import of zzso zzso its capacity to produce zzso from zzso zzso However, the molecular zzso of its nuclear import are zzso Recently, we used structural and functional criteria to identify a novel import sequence at zzso on human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Brock, zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, this analysis also indicated that other import sequences must zzso Here, we identify two additional sites, at zzso and zzso as nuclear import zzso Both sites were found to be common to zzso from different species but not found on other zzso Both sites also appeared to be a part of structures that were predominantly random zzso zzso sequences at these sites were sufficient to direct nuclear import of green fluorescent zzso zzso of basic zzso in these sites impaired nuclear import and combinations of zzso at different sites were additive in zzso zzso in all three sites were required to zzso nuclear zzso of zzso in all zzso zzso zzso in these sites did not inhibit zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that nuclear import of zzso may reflect the combined functional effects of three discrete import zzso zzso of individual sites can, by itself, impair nuclear import, which in turn could impact zzso acid zzso
