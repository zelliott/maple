zzso zzso zzso zzso the transfer of a zzso group from zzso to the zzso position of the outer zzso base in the DNA sequence zzso zzso zzso when expressed and zzso as a zzso fusion with zzso shows all of the properties of the zzso zzso We report the kinetic analysis of zzso binding to DNA, which suggests a zzso zzso process, whose initial DNA binding rate is governed by the presence of a positively charged zzso zzso on the zzso zzso are also presented that indicate that zzso binds zzso to zzso DNA and that full zzso of either zzso on both strands significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the importance of the zzso group of the inner zzso for zzso zzso interactions is demonstrated by substituting zzso with zzso In addition, we detail the intrinsic structural elements of a zzso required to enhance the binding of zzso to its recognition zzso by using zzso and a range of zzso
