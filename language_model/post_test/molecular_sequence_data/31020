The zzso 1 zzso family of proteins has a central role in modulating immune and inflammatory zzso Two major zzso zzso designated alpha zzso zzso and beta zzso zzso are produced by activated zzso and other cell zzso In an effort to understand the similarities and differences in the zzso and functional properties of these two zzso a program was initiated to determine their zzso zzso of zzso alpha were grown, and the three-dimensional structure at zzso resolution was zzso The technique of zzso anomalous zzso zzso with the zzso form of zzso alpha was zzso in combination with a single mercury zzso to provide the starting zzso zzso refinement of the zzso alpha model has been performed as zzso The overall structure is composed of 14 zzso and a zzso zzso The core of this structure is a capped zzso that possesses zzso symmetry and displays a zzso similar to that observed for zzso beta zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1988) zzso zzso 7, zzso and soybean zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, the overall structure of zzso alpha and the nature and zzso of the internal zzso symmetry are zzso Comparisons with zzso beta and zzso are made within these zzso
