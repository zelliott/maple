In an attempt to explore unknown zzso channels in zzso cells, especially zzso zzso zzso channels, we compared the sequence zzso of zzso and zzso two zzso zzso of zzso zzso channel zzso with bacterial genes that code for selective proteins with confirmed or putative zzso transport zzso zzso analysis revealed that a zzso gene zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso strain shared zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso we cloned and zzso zzso gene from zzso coli zzso and zzso expressed it in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso technique was used to record zzso channel currents generated by zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso gene in zzso cells yielded a novel zzso channel current that was inwardly zzso and had a reversal potential close to zzso equilibrium zzso The expressed zzso channel was blocked zzso by low concentration of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso or zzso did not alter the zzso current generated by zzso expression alone or zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso of zzso channel zzso Furthermore, this zzso zzso channels were not inhibited by zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso currents were inhibited by zzso (a zzso zzso channel zzso but not by zzso (a zzso channel zzso In zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso gene formed a novel functional zzso channel in zzso zzso
