Tomato mosaic virus zzso causes a serious loss of yield and fruit quality in tomato zzso To control zzso three resistance zzso zzso zzso and zzso from wild tomato species were introduced into commercial tomato zzso Soon after, however, single and, rarely, zzso virus strains for zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso virus, designated zzso revealed 30 zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Of these, six zzso result in zzso acid zzso Two exchanges are in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso proteins zzso to zzso zzso to zzso two exchanges are found in the zzso movement protein zzso zzso to K, zzso to zzso and two exchanges are in the coat protein zzso to zzso zzso to zzso Construction of zzso full-length viral zzso clones containing the base zzso resulting in altered zzso zzso either in the zzso zzso proteins or the zzso revealed that the zzso acid exchanges in the zzso proteins enable zzso to break the zzso resistance, while those in the zzso enable zzso to overcome the zzso zzso Furthermore, a novel zzso zzso virus was generated by combining the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso of a new virus, zzso containing the zzso acid exchanges zzso to K and zzso to zzso Together, the data suggest that zzso zzso may have resulted from zzso between zzso and zzso single zzso virus zzso
