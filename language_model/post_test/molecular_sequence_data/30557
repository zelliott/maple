In the course of an zzso zzso screening program of zzso dried blood samples from zzso 17 genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso were found and structurally zzso The following defects were identified by the combined use of high performance liquid zzso zzso secondary zzso mass zzso and sequence analysis: zzso (1 zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso (4 zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso (4 zzso and zzso (1 zzso The distribution of point zzso in the zzso gene leading to these 9 and 11 other zzso of zzso reported previously was statistically zzso zzso are overrepresented in the 10 zzso zzso acids zzso less than zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso less than zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso less than zzso zzso zzso zzso We further noted the zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso or zzso zzso at a frequency much higher than expected on the basis of random zzso zzso (5 out of 18 zzso zzso zzso acid zzso p less than zzso zzso zzso These zzso are the result of zzso of zzso contained within stretches of at least 5 consecutive zzso in the zzso zzso The observed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso therefore, might be caused by a hot spot for zzso formed by the 7 subsequent zzso in zzso 3, 4, and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso affected by zzso transitions (5 out of 18 zzso zzso zzso acid zzso p less than zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso domain might therefore be caused by zzso zzso predominantly occurring in zzso zzso of zzso (82 out of zzso zzso zzso of zzso sites in the human zzso gene with sites of zzso zzso revealed that zzso acid zzso found in human zzso were predominantly localized in areas that were little zzso during zzso zzso These regions may therefore represent areas of less structural constraint for the function of zzso
