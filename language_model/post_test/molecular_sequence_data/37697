zzso and zzso cells zzso incorporate the unusual zzso acid zzso at a zzso zzso which conventionally serves as a termination zzso zzso of zzso gene transcripts in zzso depends upon a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso protein B specifically binds this sequence zzso We now report the identification of zzso as a partner in the zzso translation zzso In zzso zzso shift zzso zzso binds the zzso zzso sequence from the human cellular zzso zzso zzso competes with binding activity from zzso cells, and shows diminished affinity for zzso with zzso in functionally important, zzso sequence zzso zzso to zzso interferes with the gel shift activity of zzso cell zzso zzso to zzso protein B zzso zzso from zzso cell zzso and the two proteins zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso high salt zzso Thus, zzso appears to join zzso protein B and possibly other partners to form a large complex that links the zzso zzso sequence in the zzso region to other elements in the coding region and zzso to translate the zzso zzso zzso as zzso
