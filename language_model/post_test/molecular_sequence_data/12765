The synthesis of a full series of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso containing systematic variations in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso is zzso The agents zzso which are not accessible through structural modification of 1 or zzso constitute key zzso zzso incorporating zzso structural modifications in the zzso domain capable of zzso the contribution of the individual backbone zzso to the DNA zzso efficiency, characteristic DNA zzso zzso and double strand to single strand DNA zzso zzso The comparative examination of the DNA zzso properties of the zzso and zzso complexes of zzso upon zzso by zzso or zzso respectively, revealed several characteristic features and zzso First, none of the zzso affect the characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso selectivity of zzso zzso In contrast, an exceptionally prominent role for the zzso zzso and an important role for the zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso were observed on the DNA zzso efficiency of the zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso was found to substantially increase the ratio of double strand to single strand DNA zzso events zzso zzso In a zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso the zzso region by two zzso resulted in an exceptionally large reduction in DNA zzso efficiency zzso zzso and provided an agent that was only zzso times more effective than zzso indicating that this zzso modification essentially destroys the DNA zzso capabilities of the zzso The zzso zzso contributes in an exceptional manner, and its removal resulted in a 25 times reduction in DNA zzso zzso A substantial contribution was observed for the zzso group on the zzso acid zzso and its removal resulted in a 7 times reduction in DNA zzso zzso Little effect for the zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso zzso acid zzso was observed zzso zzso and even their inversion of zzso had little impact on DNA zzso efficiency or zzso zzso the magnitude of the previously unappreciated zzso zzso contribution to the DNA zzso efficiency and on the ratio of double to single strand DNA zzso events is the largest effect observed to date including the well recognized zzso zzso (6 zzso of the DNA zzso zzso zzso the past role and relative importance of the zzso zzso and zzso has been zzso Moreover, the cumulative effect of the two important zzso chain zzso clearly illustrate that the functional role of this domain is much more important than its simply serving as a zzso
