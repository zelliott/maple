The differential zzso of mouse strains to zzso and zzso zzso leukemia viruses zzso and zzso zzso are poorly understood but may involve multiple zzso Recent evidence has demonstrated that these viruses use a common cell surface zzso (the zzso for infection of human zzso We describe the properties of zzso zzso with distinct sequences cloned from five laboratory and wild strains of mice and from zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso in resistant cells zzso zzso to the same viruses that naturally zzso the animals from which the zzso were zzso Thus, a laboratory mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but not to zzso whereas those from humans, zzso and several wild mice zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso infections by both zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso from the resistant mouse strain zzso zzso and from zzso were inactive as viral zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso are a primary cause of zzso of mice to members of the zzso family of zzso and are responsible for the zzso of zzso in laboratory zzso By zzso zzso we zzso sequences between the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Swiss zzso The zzso Swiss protein contains two key differences zzso in zzso zzso loop 3 zzso zzso and a zzso deletion in zzso 4) that are both required to block zzso zzso zzso a single inverse zzso in the zzso Swiss protein zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of an zzso envelope zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso efficiently with zzso and zzso infections zzso by zzso that contained zzso and/or zzso but had no effect on zzso infections zzso by zzso that lacked these zzso zzso In contrast, moderate expression of a zzso zzso envelope zzso did not cause substantial zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso zzso interfere zzso with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso have become adapted to zzso zzso that lack zzso and zzso A penalty for this adaptation is a reduced ability to interfere with zzso Because failure of interference is a hallmark of several exceptionally zzso zzso we propose that it contributes to zzso zzso
