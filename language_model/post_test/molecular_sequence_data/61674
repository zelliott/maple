Human colon zzso differ in amounts of zzso zzso zzso However, it is unclear whether zzso encodes a single zzso When clones of human colon cancer cells were zzso with zzso against the zzso zzso repeat or zzso zzso differences in relative expression of zzso proteins suggested multiple zzso zzso zzso analysis detected the established zzso zzso zzso and a novel form zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso DNA indicated that zzso results from an alternate zzso zzso zzso with zzso spanning zzso confirmed the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso stained colon cancer cells and normal colon in a pattern different from zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso may help us to explain previous conflicting reports that have attempted to correlate the relative abundance of zzso protein and/or zzso with the biological behavior of colon cancer zzso
