During the development of synthetic zzso for therapeutic use in bone disease, a zzso zzso effect was observed, particularly with salmon zzso The effect was attributed by some to zzso of insulin zzso We have recently reported zzso zzso zzso zzso sites in certain areas of rat brain, and found that these sites also bind salmon but not rat zzso with comparable high zzso zzso zzso and salmon zzso have been determined to have significant structural zzso In zzso and in zzso studies indicate that rat zzso can exert zzso effects on zzso and on plasma zzso Here we report that salmon zzso mimics the actions of rat zzso on skeletal muscle zzso metabolism in zzso it stimulates zzso and zzso incorporation of zzso zzso into zzso zzso effective concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso log and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso rats, salmon zzso like rat zzso rapidly increases plasma zzso zzso followed by a slower increase in zzso zzso Like zzso salmon zzso also zzso the insulin response to 2 zzso infused zzso zzso increments suppressed by zzso and 57% at 10 minutes for salmon zzso and zzso Other shared actions, such as suppression of zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso of gastric acid zzso and zzso of gastric zzso further affirm our proposal that the zzso zzso salmon zzso is a mimic of zzso zzso in the zzso
