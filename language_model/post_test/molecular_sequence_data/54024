The number of genes in the human zzso is unknown, with estimates ranging from 50,000 to 90,000 zzso 1, zzso and to more than 140,000 according to unpublished zzso We have developed zzso a procedure based on zzso searches, to identify human genes quickly and zzso This method relies on the sequence of another zzso the zzso zzso zzso to detect zzso sequences with a very low zzso Similar to zzso zzso a marine zzso proposed by Brenner et zzso as a model for zzso studies, zzso zzso is a more practical alternative with a zzso also eight times more compact than that of zzso Many comparisons have been made between zzso zzso and human DNA that demonstrate the potential of comparative zzso using the zzso zzso Application of zzso to the December version of the working draft sequence of the human zzso and to zzso showed that the human zzso contains zzso zzso and that zzso contains less than zzso of the zzso fraction of the human zzso
