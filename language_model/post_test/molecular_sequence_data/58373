A fundamental problem in zzso and molecular biology is understanding the spatial structure of zzso and then analyzing their zzso In this study, the three-dimensional structure of a zzso protein zzso was predicted using a neural network method and molecular dynamics zzso A zzso neural network with the zzso learning zzso were trained on model class of zzso proteins including zzso and zzso The distance constraints for the C alpha atoms in the protein backbone were zzso to generate a folded crude zzso of zzso by model building and the zzso descent zzso zzso The crude zzso was refined by molecular dynamics techniques and a simulated zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and its analogous zzso zzso was also simulated to understand its action zzso
