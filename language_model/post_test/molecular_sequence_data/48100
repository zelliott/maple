zzso zzso 1 zzso from a zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that was first found to have zzso activity when injected into zzso zzso zzso Recent studies demonstrated that zzso also zzso the spreading and zzso of a blood cell type called zzso and inhibited bleeding from zzso We determined the solution structure of zzso by two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso to begin to understand zzso relationships of this zzso zzso has an ordered structure, which is composed of a short zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso three beta turns at zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a half turn at the zzso zzso zzso The zzso secondary and zzso structure was stabilized by hydrogen bonding and zzso zzso zzso In comparison with two related insect zzso whose structures have been solved recently, the zzso region of zzso is substantially more zzso The short zzso zzso of zzso has a folding pattern similar to the zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso may interact with zzso zzso molecules to trigger its different biological zzso
