The zzso axis in leaf zzso is thought to be established first and is necessary for the expansion of the leaf zzso along the zzso zzso To understand axis information in leaf development, we isolated the zzso zzso zzso zzso in rice, which forms zzso rolled zzso zzso leaves are covered with zzso cells, which are normally distributed only on the zzso zzso An zzso double zzso with the zzso snowy leaf zzso which has zzso cells that specifically appear in the zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso leaves show zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso genes in zzso zzso increased in mature leaves, but not in the young zzso or the zzso This indicated that zzso may not be directly involved in determining initial leaf zzso but rather is associated with the maintenance of axis zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we identified intermediate and strong zzso of the zzso zzso that generate zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso layer loss, zzso We propose that zzso plays an important role in pattern formation of the leaf and zzso by promoting proper zzso zzso
