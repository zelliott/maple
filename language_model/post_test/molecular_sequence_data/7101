We have described previously three mouse zzso coding genes zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA, zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed the expression of one of them, termed zzso and renamed zzso and demonstrated that zzso zzso and its translation product are present in specific stages of mouse zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein has been found to consist of 16 zzso motifs clustered at the zzso zzso and subdivided into two groups by a zzso finger zzso At its zzso zzso zzso shares with other members of the zinc finger gene family two additional zzso zzso acid zzso A and B, described as either zzso zzso or zzso zzso By means of Northern zzso Western zzso analysis, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and its translation product were shown to be zzso specifically during the zzso phase of male germ line zzso By zzso zzso the zzso protein has been shown to accumulate in the zzso of mature zzso in association with the nuclear zzso
