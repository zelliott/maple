The zzso zzso was first identified as a zzso C virus zzso zzso by its ability to bind the soluble zzso of envelope zzso zzso zzso More recently, it has been suggested that zzso is necessary but not sufficient for zzso entry into target zzso Here we present further evidence that putative human zzso factors act in concert with zzso to mediate zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso zzso entry zzso zzso binding to zzso in the large zzso loop as well as molecular events zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The concept that zzso zzso function zzso in stages is further supported by our finding that zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso entry by different zzso The zzso of zzso binding was determined to be approximately 17 zzso and we propose that binding is followed by zzso zzso zzso into zzso membrane zzso or other, lateral zzso zzso This results in the formation of a zzso complex that zzso zzso and zzso membrane zzso
