zzso takes a toll of one million people a year worldwide, especially in developing zzso As the so far applied vaccines were not able to control this disease, novel approaches to this problem are zzso In this study, we investigated the possibility of zzso of zzso virus zzso infection through zzso interference zzso namely the interference with the second but main zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso in an zzso virus zzso zzso B cell line zzso Three potential target sequences in the zzso gene were chosen and cloned into the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were used for zzso of zzso cells in which zzso was then detected by flow zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso both at zzso and expression zzso One of the zzso zzso was found to block effectively the zzso expression as well as zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso could silence zzso expression and inhibit the zzso infection of host zzso
