The zzso of zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso from human liver zzso resulted in the isolation of two zzso zzso forms zzso and zzso These two forms were zzso to near zzso zzso with zzso zzso the resulting peptides zzso and the zzso of two of the peptides partially zzso zzso sequences were obtained for zzso and zzso for the two zzso These sequences were used to design zzso for screening a human liver zzso zzso This resulted in the isolation of two overlapping zzso Using these sequences we were able to design zzso zzso that resulted in the isolation of a full-length zzso from a human zzso zzso The zzso contained zzso zzso of open reading frame and coded for a zzso zzso This protein bears zzso zzso acid zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the bovine zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the bovine zzso zzso The zzso could be expressed in zzso cells, and the expressed zzso had greater zzso activity than zzso activity, which is consistent with the known zzso specificity of zzso
