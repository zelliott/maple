Many zzso marine zzso like zzso have a zzso zzso stage whose primary purpose is zzso How these species colonize suitable zzso is fundamental to understanding their evolution, population biology, and wider community zzso Unlike zzso zzso settlement occurs on a relatively small spatial scale and involves zzso behavior in response to physical and chemical characteristics of the zzso zzso chemical cues have been implicated in this zzso Their zzso however, has proven challenging, no more so than for the chemical basis of zzso zzso which was first described zzso years zzso We now report that a biological cue to gregarious settlement, the zzso protein complex zzso of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso is a previously zzso zzso The zzso shares a zzso sequence zzso with the zzso family of proteins that includes the zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso encodes a protein precursor zzso zzso zzso with a zzso signal zzso zzso A number of structural characteristics and the absence of a zzso bond in the zzso suggest that this zzso is a previously zzso protein that may have evolved by zzso from an ancestral zzso zzso Although the zzso is regarded as an adult cue that is recognized by the zzso at settlement, it is also expressed in the juvenile and in larvae, where it may function in zzso settlement zzso
