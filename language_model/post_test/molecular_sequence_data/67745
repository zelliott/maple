zzso zzso viruses require host zzso zzso for replicating their zzso zzso In this study, we determined the zzso and critical zzso acids in zzso of Red zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso required for its association with and targeting of zzso zzso in zzso zzso plants using a zzso zzso and biologically functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using an zzso expression system showed that a stretch of 20 zzso acids in the zzso region of zzso is essential for the association of zzso with zzso We identified the zzso acids in this domain required for the association of zzso with zzso using zzso zzso We also found that this domain contains zzso acids not critical for the membrane association but required for the formation of viral zzso replication complexes and zzso zzso zzso Our results extend our understanding of the zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso
