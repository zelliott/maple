Patients with zzso zzso zzso typically develop night zzso early in life due to loss of rod zzso The remaining cone zzso are the mainstay of their zzso however, over years or decades, these cones slowly zzso leading to zzso We created transgenic pigs that express a zzso zzso gene zzso Like zzso patients with the same zzso these pigs have early and severe rod zzso initially their cones are relatively zzso but these surviving cones slowly zzso By age 20 months, there is only a single layer of zzso abnormal cones and the cone zzso is markedly zzso Given the strong similarities in zzso to that of zzso patients, these transgenic pigs will provide a large animal model for study of the protracted phase of cone zzso found in zzso and for zzso treatment zzso
