We have investigated functional common zzso zzso between human zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso in zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in which 5 zzso acid zzso are identical to those of zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso relevant to zzso were zzso Among these zzso only zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were highly zzso and both peptides shared the common zzso zzso In addition, when the zzso cells from mice zzso with mouse zzso zzso were zzso in zzso by zzso or zzso as well as by zzso these cells transferred zzso to zzso recipient zzso These findings indicate that this common zzso zzso between zzso and zzso is zzso and related to the development of zzso experimental zzso zzso
