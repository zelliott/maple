zzso along with other zzso bone zzso protein zzso zzso plays a crucial role in neural induction and neural tube patterning as well as in zzso cardiac zzso and formation of the skeleton in zzso The zzso zzso zzso is one of the seven fundamental pathways that drive embryonic development and pattern formation in zzso zzso its evolutionary origin and role in pattern formation is, therefore, important to evolutionary zzso biology zzso We have studied the evolutionary origin of zzso antagonism in zzso which is a powerful zzso model to study evolution of zzso mechanisms because of the unusual cellular dynamics during its pattern formation and its remarkable ability to zzso We cloned and characterized the zzso gene from zzso and found it to exhibit considerable similarity with its zzso at the zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso led to zzso of the zzso axis in zzso zzso demonstrating its functional conservation across the zzso Our data, along with those of others, indicate that the zzso zzso antagonism between zzso and its zzso predates bilateral zzso This article reviews the various roles of zzso in different organisms and some of our recent work on zzso zzso in the context of evolution of zzso zzso zzso
