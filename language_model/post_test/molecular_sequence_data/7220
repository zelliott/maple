The invasive ability of zzso zzso is correlated with the expression of several zzso zzso including invasion zzso zzso C zzso By characterizing the zzso structure of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso it may be possible to determine the physical location of specific zzso as well as the involvement of zzso in a protective immune response or the zzso zzso to zzso By using overlapping zzso synthetic zzso which together represent the entire zzso zzso the precise linear sequence of four zzso zzso was defined for four zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, 17 unique zzso zzso of zzso were mapped by using zzso serum samples from 13 zzso monkeys challenged with zzso zzso zzso Each individual recognized a somewhat different array of zzso zzso zzso after infection with zzso However, the zzso were clustered within three regions of the zzso region I (between zzso acid zzso 1 and zzso region II (between zzso acid zzso 177 and zzso and region III (between zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso Region II was recognized by zzso of zzso zzso individuals and was considered to be a highly zzso zzso Animals zzso for zzso after challenge with zzso zzso recognized zzso zzso within all three zzso regions of zzso whereas symptomatic animals recognized peptides in only one or two of the zzso zzso zzso from monkeys challenged with zzso zzso recognized zzso zzso zzso which fell within and outside the three zzso zzso zzso zzso While numerous potential zzso exist on the zzso zzso the identification of three regions in which zzso are clustered suggests that these regions are significant with respect to the immune response and to subsequent zzso zzso
