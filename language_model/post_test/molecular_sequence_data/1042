zzso zzso zzso carries out an essential zzso modification of nascent proteins by removing the zzso zzso and is recognized as a potential target for developing zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have established an zzso coli expression system for human type I zzso zzso and characterized the full length zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso of several zzso and zzso zzso and zzso by a series of zzso zzso Although the zzso extension with zinc finger motifs in zzso is not required for zzso activity, it has a significant impact on the interaction of the zzso with zzso and zzso In zzso of the zzso zzso a relaxation of stringent specificity for the terminal zzso was observed in the truncated zzso However, this relaxation of specificity was not zzso in zzso of zzso or zzso zzso Several zzso zzso showed potent zzso of the zzso zzso but exhibited only weak or no zzso of the full length zzso With the zzso zzso available, we have identified several zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso against zzso coli zzso zzso that do not affect zzso These results have demonstrated the possibility of developing zzso zzso as zzso agents with minimum human zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso identified in this study can serve as tools for investigating the functions of zzso in zzso and pathological zzso
