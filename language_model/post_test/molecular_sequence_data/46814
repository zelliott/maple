Alternative zzso of chicken zzso zzso zzso ensures that in zzso cells, only zzso zzso is zzso whereas in skeletal muscle, zzso zzso is zzso zzso We have previously shown that efficient zzso of the zzso zzso zzso requires two zzso zzso enhancers zzso and zzso that are present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we examined the function of the zzso and zzso elements by replacing them within zzso zzso by other zzso and zzso sequence elements and analyzing zzso in zzso quail zzso and muscle zzso Several features of these zzso regulatory elements were revealed by this zzso First, a wide variety of zzso sequences can replace the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso rather than sequence zzso determines activity for this zzso Second, one type of zzso sequence zzso normally found within zzso can also replace the zzso zzso zzso Third, the diverse elements tested exhibit differential zzso of the zzso sites zzso zzso zzso and different zzso zzso Fourth, the strength of the zzso zzso zzso is appropriately set to obtain proper regulation of the transition from zzso zzso zzso in zzso to zzso zzso zzso in zzso but this zzso regulatory element is not the target for zzso zzso zzso
