zzso zzso catalyze the formation of zzso by the reduction of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso each of the larger, alpha zzso possesses binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso and each of the smaller, beta zzso contains a zzso iron zzso The iron complex interacts with a specific zzso zzso to form a zzso free radical which is essential for zzso Previous work has identified two genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that zzso alpha zzso and one zzso zzso that encodes a beta zzso Here we report the identification of a second gene from this zzso zzso that encodes a protein with significant similarity to the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is consistent with that expected for a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and display an zzso arrest at their restrictive zzso zzso zzso extracts are deficient in zzso zzso activity, and this zzso can be zzso by the addition of zzso zzso As is the case for the other zzso zzso zzso is induced by agents that damage zzso However, zzso lacks a number of sequence elements thought to be essential for iron zzso and zzso of the critical zzso zzso does not affect zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is zzso inactive but, nonetheless, does play a role in the zzso zzso zzso
