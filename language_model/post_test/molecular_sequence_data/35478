A novel zzso with zzso zzso activity was previously described in the marine zzso zzso zzso This zzso differs from other zzso acid zzso in not being a zzso but containing a zzso zzso It is zzso by an zzso with two genes zzso and zzso The first one codes for the zzso while the second one encodes a protein required for the expression of the zzso Genome sequencing of zzso zzso has revealed that it contains two additional zzso zzso proteins with sequence similarity to zzso In this study, it is shown that the product of one of such zzso zzso encodes a protein with zzso zzso zzso This activity shows important differences in terms of zzso range and sensitivity to zzso to other zzso zzso previously described which are zzso zzso by zzso The results presented in this study indicate that the products of the genes with different degrees of similarity to zzso detected in bacterial zzso could constitute a zzso of different zzso
