We describe a new technique by which single base changes in human genes can be zzso zzso In this method the DNA zzso of interest is first amplified using the zzso chain reaction with an zzso primer zzso at its zzso The amplified zzso DNA is immobilized on an zzso zzso and rendered zzso The variable zzso in the immobilized DNA is identified by a zzso primer extension reaction directed by a detection step zzso which zzso to the DNA immediately upstream of the site of zzso In this reaction a single labeled zzso zzso complementary to the zzso at the variable site is zzso The method is highly sensitive, allowing the use of zzso zzso labeled with zzso of low specific activity zzso as well as zzso markers zzso The procedure consists of few and simple operations and is thus zzso to the analysis of large numbers of zzso Here we applied it to the analysis of the zzso zzso of the human zzso E zzso We were able to correctly identify all possible combinations of the three zzso E zzso
