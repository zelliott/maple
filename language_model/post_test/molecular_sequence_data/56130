The zzso gene and its upstream region isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA were zzso The zzso gene was preceded by a potential zzso zzso The zzso gene product, zzso zzso displays a typical zzso bacterial signal zzso sequence and both an active site zzso sequence and zzso repeats typical of zzso The signal sequence is similar to those of other known zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso sequence of this zzso was zzso which was different by one zzso acid from the zzso zzso sequence derived from two different types of the zzso zzso zzso reported previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene product has three repeated sequences of 51 to 52 zzso acids and a partial repeat of 18 zzso zzso Another open reading frame zzso was detected in the region immediately upstream of the zzso zzso The upstream zzso showed substantial DNA zzso with the zzso gene isolated from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the upstream zzso has four repeating units and has extensive zzso with the repeated peptides coded by the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that the zzso gene was a typical zzso gene isolated from the zzso zzso and that the two zzso genes were located in tandem on the zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso
