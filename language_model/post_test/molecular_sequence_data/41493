In zzso cells, components of zzso zzso zzso are often detected in zzso zzso such as processing bodies zzso and stress zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is an zzso binding component of zzso acts as a zzso zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso We found here that a zzso protein zzso also localized to zzso when expressed in human cultured zzso When zzso or zzso was highly expressed in the cells, they induced the formation of zzso large zzso zzso zzso that contained both zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso is important for the assembly of zzso zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso associated with protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso Multiple zzso zzso of zzso were indeed zzso zzso in the cell and zzso was shown to be a component of large zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso Although zzso did not accumulate in zzso zzso zzso of zzso impaired the zzso of zzso to zzso while other components were still retained in these zzso Thus, our data indicate that zzso is important for the assembly of zzso zzso zzso and that zzso is required for zzso to zzso to zzso
