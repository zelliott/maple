The importance of zzso in biological processes makes their zzso an essential component of any zzso zzso The identification of zzso in zzso requires specific expertise and tools that are distinct from the traditional protein gene zzso zzso Here, we describe the assembly of two automatic zzso zzso zzso publicly available tools, for zzso and de zzso zzso search in zzso We applied both pipelines to 10 zzso zzso and were able to find and zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso of the zzso expected for those zzso assuming the number of zzso in zzso zzso as a zzso Several new zzso not yet known in the zzso zzso were also zzso The results show the feasibility of automatic search for zzso in full zzso and the utility of such approaches in large zzso sequencing and zzso zzso
