In zzso selection was used to isolate zzso zzso zzso from random zzso zzso of representative clones revealed the emergence of at least 12 classes of zzso that adopt distinct secondary structure zzso Only one class zzso to a previously known structural zzso that of the naturally occurring zzso zzso Each zzso promotes zzso via an internal zzso transfer reaction involving the adjacent zzso group with a chemical rate enhancement of between zzso and zzso greater than the corresponding zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso can form a multitude of secondary and zzso structures that promote zzso by internal zzso zzso Upon further in zzso selection, a class I zzso that adopts an zzso zzso structure dominates over all other zzso in the zzso Thus, zzso zzso isolated by in zzso selection from zzso populations can rival the zzso efficiency of natural zzso
