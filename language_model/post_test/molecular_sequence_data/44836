zzso zzso zzso is a central intermediate for the bacterial degradation of aromatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the key ring zzso step in the metabolism of zzso by the Gram zzso zzso zzso zzso to yield zzso zzso zzso A zzso DNA library of zzso zzso was constructed in zzso coli using a zzso zzso and screened by zzso the cells with zzso One clone was found to contain the gene for zzso based on its ability to convert zzso into the zzso zzso This zzso clone was further zzso and the gene for zzso was localized and zzso The open reading frame codes for a protein with 365 zzso acids and zzso zzso zzso in zzso with the characteristics of the previously zzso zzso zzso The gene for zzso was zzso in zzso coli to approximately zzso of the total soluble zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso to apparent zzso was achieved by a zzso zzso Iron was the only abundant metal found in the zzso zzso zzso and the specific activity per iron was comparable to that observed for the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso has a very high level of zzso zzso identity in the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The basis for the difference in metal selection by zzso and zzso was investigated by zzso of a zzso region of the zzso gene containing three frame shifts relative to the zzso zzso The zzso triple zzso of zzso did not exhibit a significant change in the metal zzso therefore, other factors must contribute to the selection of the active site zzso
