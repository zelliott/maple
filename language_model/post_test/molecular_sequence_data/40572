We have determined the zzso structure of the zzso protein from the human gastric pathogen zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso formation and zzso It functions as a zzso for zzso zzso and also controls the stability and translation of zzso for the major zzso zzso zzso The protein is composed of a highly zzso and zzso zzso hairpin domain zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso The zzso domain is rich in aromatic and positively charged zzso acid zzso zzso mobility shift zzso identified zzso in a positively charged region of the zzso domain of zzso whose zzso alters the mobility of an zzso zzso zzso zzso of surface zzso in the zzso domain did not result in an zzso change in the mobility of the zzso transcript zzso The data thus suggest the arrangement of zzso into distinct structural and functional zzso
