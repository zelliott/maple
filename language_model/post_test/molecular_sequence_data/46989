To understand the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso we have identified the dominant functional zzso that regulate the activity of the promoter domain zzso to zzso zzso from zzso zzso demonstrated that the promoter activity was dependent on two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a transformed normal zzso cell zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Both elements zzso with zzso zzso and zzso factors but not with zzso or zzso In zzso zzso cells, the promoter was activated by either zzso or zzso An zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso was zzso (by zzso but was unresponsive to zzso and did not bind the zzso zzso or orphan receptors zzso and zzso The zzso upstream sequence zzso to zzso zzso inhibited promoter activity in zzso by zzso but only minimally in zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso promoter through zzso factors is zzso regulated through zzso and upstream sequences to exert control of gene zzso
