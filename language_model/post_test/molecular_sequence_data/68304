This paper shows that zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso bacteria elicit the induction of zzso early zzso genes zzso and zzso in pea root zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a mixture of zzso factors containing a zzso fatty acid chain with 4 zzso or 1 double bond zzso zzso zzso factors zzso either a zzso or a zzso zzso zzso induce the expression of the pea early zzso zzso zzso and zzso but the zzso of induction are zzso The expression of both early zzso genes is induced in a transient manner by the zzso zzso factors while a mixture of the zzso factors extends the period during which these genes are zzso In spite of the zzso nature of the infection process, zzso zzso factors of zzso zzso also induce the expression of zzso and zzso zzso though with a marked delay compared with the zzso zzso
