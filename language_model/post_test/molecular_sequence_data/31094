The zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso a zzso with zzso zzso action isolated from black widow zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso from bovine brain zzso and zzso by affinity zzso on alpha zzso The zzso zzso preparation contained four major zzso of molecular masses 200 zzso 160 zzso 79 zzso and 43 zzso zzso according to zzso zzso with molecular ratio alpha 1 zzso 1 beta 2 gamma zzso The zzso and zzso are zzso binding to wheat germ zzso and can be separated under zzso conditions by zzso exchange zzso zzso to zzso both of them, though differing in the zzso zzso retain the alpha zzso activity and give closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso recognize the zzso as zzso These results suggest that alpha zzso zzso is present in zzso preparations in two very close forms containing the zzso or zzso zzso and gamma proteins do not specifically bind alpha zzso and their zzso role is zzso They form a complex with zzso zzso and zzso independently of alpha zzso zzso The zzso proteins were zzso to zzso by high performance gel zzso in the presence of zzso their zzso acid composition was zzso
