The zzso zzso zzso zzso is the essential zzso route for degradation of zzso products derived from zzso by zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso carrying the genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a part of zzso zzso zzso we found the zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was located zzso zzso upstream of zzso and transcribed in the same direction as zzso We also found the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso which was located 174 zzso upstream of zzso The zzso gene consists of a zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed 57 to zzso identity with those of the corresponding genes recently reported in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli, and the gene product zzso was zzso to near zzso zzso mass zzso indicated that zzso zzso not only the conversion of zzso to zzso and zzso but also that of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso and its zzso point is zzso The zzso for zzso and zzso are zzso and 136 zzso M, zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso resulted in the growth zzso of zzso and zzso indicating that zzso encodes the essential zzso zzso for zzso of these zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso consisted of four zzso units, including the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
