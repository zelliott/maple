Human zzso proteins are editing zzso that can interfere with the replication of zzso zzso such as human zzso virus zzso zzso such as zzso B virus zzso and with the zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso nuclear elements zzso and zzso Here, we show that zzso but not other zzso family members, binds zzso zzso the common zzso of zzso zzso that is specifically recruited into zzso zzso Our data further indicate that zzso recognizes zzso zzso and zzso zzso by its common structure, the zzso domain, suggesting a mechanism for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, we also demonstrate that zzso and zzso are normally recruited into and inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso zzso when zzso is prevented from zzso particles by zzso interference against zzso or by over expression of zzso both components of the signal recognition zzso We thus conclude that zzso zzso is not an essential zzso of the zzso packaging of these zzso zzso zzso
