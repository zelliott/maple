zzso protein zzso zzso a part of the zzso small zzso is one of the proteins that is a part of the zzso machinery and is a potential new target for the discovery of zzso zzso zzso screening of microbial extracts using zzso zzso zzso zzso strain led to the isolation of a new zzso compound, zzso zzso zzso 2 showed zzso zzso activity against zzso bacteria, exhibiting zzso values ranging from 8 to 64 zzso zzso showed the highest sensitivity for zzso zzso (8 zzso and inhibited the growth of zzso zzso with an zzso of 8 zzso zzso showed a modest selectivity for the zzso of zzso synthesis over DNA and protein synthesis in zzso zzso
