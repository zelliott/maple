Many species of the zzso zzso zzso including the soybean pathogen zzso zzso produce the zzso zzso zzso zzso production is induced by zzso Previously, we identified several zzso clones of zzso transcripts that exhibited zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso disruption of the zzso copy of one of these, now designated zzso zzso zzso zzso results in a drastic reduction in zzso production, greatly reduced zzso of the fungus to zzso and increased sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso reveals an zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso protein similar to several members of the major zzso zzso zzso of integral membrane zzso proteins known to zzso resistance to various antibiotics and toxins in zzso and zzso We propose that zzso encodes a zzso zzso that contributes resistance to zzso by actively exporting zzso thus maintaining low cellular zzso of the zzso
