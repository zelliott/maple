zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was applied to investigate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a competitive multiplex zzso method in which zzso amplification is successfully performed only by using the sequence of 3' zzso ends as a DNA template in order to obtain an absolutely complementary zzso I was able to produce zzso zzso whose 3' ends had the base specific to zzso I zzso located within the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso of the products showed that bands derived from common zzso products, zzso C1 and zzso were clearly separate from each other due to the difference in the size of the zzso I tested 102 unrelated Japanese individuals, and the results of both restriction zzso length zzso zzso by zzso I or zzso I and direct sequencing were in complete agreement with those of zzso These results lead me to conclude that zzso is a simple and useful technique for investigating zzso zzso
