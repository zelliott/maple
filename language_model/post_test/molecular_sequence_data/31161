The following DNA fragments were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and RV zzso The zzso zzso were run on zzso zzso zzso The PAGE anomaly was measured by the zzso Under standard conditions R is maximum for zzso and zzso (R zzso zzso R has intermediate values for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits unusual zzso temperature dependence of the zzso which reaches its maximum at 35 degrees zzso Based on this fact we make two zzso zzso PAGE anomaly is highly sensitive to the DNA winding angle zzso zzso zzso zzso 36 degrees for zzso under these zzso For zzso zzso and RV the temperature dependence of the zzso is zzso R zzso zzso zzso zzso less than 36 degrees for these zzso In the presence of 10 zzso of zzso the anomaly increase for all fragments, except for zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso to the moderate zzso of zzso The results of the zzso were interpreted on the basis of the wedge AA and junction zzso zzso To get a better agreement with the experiment these models should be supplemented with the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed into the major groove and with the zzso in AT directed into the minor zzso
