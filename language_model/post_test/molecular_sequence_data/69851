The ability to routinely and specifically amplify and detect zzso products ranging in size from zzso 1 to zzso 10 zzso regardless of target template sequence or structure, would facilitate several tasks in human zzso zzso Generation of a wide size range of zzso products would potentially zzso isolation of zzso DNA zzso represented in physical maps and provide a means for maintaining order and orientation of closely linked zzso during zzso zzso zzso offers an alternative to isolation of zzso or zzso clones from zzso or species where appropriate libraries are zzso This methodology also provides a powerful strategy to pursue directed zzso mapping and sequencing of templates of 100 zzso or zzso Further development of basic zzso technology has been necessary in order to make it feasible to use large DNA targets as primary templates for zzso zzso Application of these extended zzso capacities would potentially save time, materials, and zzso
