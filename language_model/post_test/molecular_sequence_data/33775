zzso analyses have contributed substantially to our understanding of diverse cellular zzso zzso in the sensitivity of mass zzso approaches are enabling more in-depth analyses of zzso networks and, in some cases, are providing surprising new insights into well established, longstanding zzso Here, we describe such a zzso analysis that exploits zzso mass zzso and has led to the discovery of a physical and functional link between the orphan nuclear zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso A systematic characterization of the zzso link revealed that the zzso zzso domain binds directly to the zzso zzso protein zzso and, through this interaction, can target zzso or zzso to promoters containing zzso sites in zzso Supporting the functional significance of this interaction, an zzso zzso that blocks binding of zzso to zzso interferes with zzso zzso activity in zzso These findings identify an unexpected role for the zzso zzso domain in zzso key regulatory interactions and provide new insights into the roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso II zzso
