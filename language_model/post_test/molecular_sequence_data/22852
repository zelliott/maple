We report carbon zzso network zzso zzso zzso that function as selective detectors of DNA zzso and zzso zzso with immobilized synthetic zzso have been shown to specifically recognize target DNA zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso discrimination in the zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso The electronic responses of zzso upon zzso DNA zzso and subsequent DNA zzso events were confirmed by using zzso zzso and then were further explored for zzso DNA detection at zzso to zzso zzso We have also observed a strong effect of DNA zzso on the electronic response, thus suggesting a zzso mechanism of DNA detection using zzso zzso Implementation of zzso electronic detection zzso using zzso constitutes an important step toward low-cost, zzso highly sensitive and accurate molecular zzso
