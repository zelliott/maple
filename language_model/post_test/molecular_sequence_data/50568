zzso from zzso human zzso was measured to estimate the extent of binding of zzso surface proteins to immobilized zzso zzso of the zzso was bound with zzso of this amount apparently zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso chemical modification of zzso with zzso zzso or zzso resulted in a variable reduction of the amount of zzso zzso When zzso modified with zzso zzso zzso was coupled to the zzso there was no difference in the binding of zzso membrane proteins when compared to a control zzso preparation while zzso modified with zzso zzso zzso coupled to the zzso did not bind zzso any more effectively than zzso which served as the zzso However, when zzso was modified with zzso after zzso to the zzso zzso ability to bind zzso was zzso zzso bound to zzso remained zzso active when zzso with a zzso zzso zzso These results suggest tight binding between zzso and zzso that is not only not dependent on active site integrity but leaves the bound zzso zzso zzso
