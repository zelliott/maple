Studies on zzso disease virus zzso 2 zzso are important for understanding the natural zzso zzso of zzso This study reports a zzso zzso zzso sequence of part of the zzso zzso located in the central unique long zzso zzso The analysis revealed 11 complete zzso with high zzso acid sequence identities to the products of other zzso The zzso zzso were arranged zzso with the zzso sequence of zzso zzso virus type 1, ranging from the zzso to zzso zzso zzso that were particularly well zzso among zzso were the putative functional domain of the DNA zzso zzso and the zzso zzso large and small zzso zzso and zzso On the other hand, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso did not contain the zzso zzso region in the zzso zzso All the genes identified were confirmed to be transcribed as zzso zzso and/or unique transcripts in zzso zzso
