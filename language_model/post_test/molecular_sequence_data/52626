Factor zzso is a zzso for a plasma zzso Factor zzso in plasma is a zzso zzso held together by zzso bonds, and the A zzso contains the active zzso Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the A zzso has been determined by zzso zzso To understand the zzso relationships of the factor zzso zzso and its clinical implications in factor zzso zzso we characterized its genetic defects and closely examined its gene products, including zzso and protein zzso A variety of zzso and nonsense zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with or without zzso zzso termination and zzso abnormalities zzso deletion with zzso T zzso at the zzso zzso D boundary with zzso zzso zzso deletion at the zzso zzso A zzso has been identified in cases demonstrating A zzso zzso In some cases, the A zzso zzso levels were severely zzso Their molecular and cellular bases have also been explored by expression experiments in zzso cells and by molecular zzso In most cases, impaired folding and/or zzso changes of the zzso A zzso lead to both zzso and zzso instability, which is responsible for the A zzso zzso in the zzso
