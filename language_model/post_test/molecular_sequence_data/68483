An in zzso zzso zzso zzso has been developed to demonstrate the binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso region zzso and 30 zzso of the adjacent zzso zzso tail zzso of zzso virus zzso The binding of zzso to the zzso zzso was specific since four other unrelated proteins including an zzso zzso did not zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or pure zzso zzso with zzso zzso for zzso Surprisingly, zzso failed to bind to the zzso of zzso virus zzso lacking the zzso zzso The results together show that zzso virus zzso template specificity depends only on zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso is essential for viral zzso template selection by the zzso virus zzso zzso
