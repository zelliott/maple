zzso sorting complexes required for transport zzso recognize zzso cargo and catalyze diverse budding processes including zzso body zzso enveloped virus zzso and zzso We present the crystal structure of an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in complex with the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso folds into an zzso zzso long zzso assembly that includes an unusual zzso zzso zzso is zzso in solution and zzso in complex with zzso revealing a novel zzso domain interacting motif zzso that does not overlap with the zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate an unusual zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests a regulatory role for the zzso zzso segment of zzso and its zzso leads to a loss of function during zzso zzso Our results indicate a tight zzso of zzso zzso and zzso functions and provide insight into the regulation of zzso
