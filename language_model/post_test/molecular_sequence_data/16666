zzso are highly cooperative giant zzso respiratory complexes found in zzso where they serve the same function as red blood zzso Our previous zzso resolution crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso organization of 144 zzso zzso chains that are assembled into 12 zzso arranged at the periphery of the complex around a central scaffold formed by 36 zzso zzso We present here the zzso resolution crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which provides the first atomic models of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a molecular zzso axis of symmetry that relates three zzso each of which is composed of two tightly associated zzso The structure reveals details of the zzso including key zzso interactions likely to contribute to zzso zzso zzso and shows the crowded nature of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with similar ones from zzso and zzso suggests plausible zzso zzso transitions that may occur in response to zzso binding and zzso zzso Thus, these results provide the first step towards zzso the structural basis for the strong zzso properties of zzso zzso
