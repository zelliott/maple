The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso was isolated from zzso zzso brain zzso The gene encodes a precursor of 231 zzso acids containing nine (or zzso zzso peptides that are zzso arranged in three zzso The comparison of the zzso A precursor with the respective precursor genes from two other zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso shows high zzso in size, sequence zzso and zzso respectively), and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis using a zzso zzso to zzso probe shows that the gene is not only expressed as one transcript in the brain and zzso of larvae and adults in a zzso and zzso manner, but also in the zzso zzso of adult zzso zzso Data confirm the nature of the zzso zzso peptides as zzso zzso hormones, whereas their zzso in zzso zzso and zzso still have to be zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso as demonstrated by whole mount in zzso zzso confirms the overall distribution of the zzso A zzso as shown by zzso and supports the zzso functions of the zzso
