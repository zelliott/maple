Previous zzso studies showed that the repetitive DNA sequence zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound specifically to the zzso and not to the A- or zzso of zzso zzso We amplified a zzso of zzso from zzso zzso by zzso cloned and zzso this zzso and confirmed that it was a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso techniques were used to confirm that the zzso zzso was zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso was present on all eight zzso zzso zzso and absent from the A- and zzso zzso The zzso repeat was zzso to the zzso region of each zzso zzso FISH clearly distinguished the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso in the zzso species zzso zzso This is the first known report of a zzso repetitive marker that is present on all zzso zzso It will be a useful tool for the detection of B zzso in zzso hybrids and may prove useful for zzso studies in zzso zzso
