zzso zzso class 5 proteins are major outer membrane proteins that share many properties with the proteins II zzso of zzso zzso We generated two zzso zzso zzso each of which bound specifically to one of the two identified class 5 proteins produced by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso also bound to class 5 proteins of a limited number of other zzso zzso Using the zzso activity of the zzso zzso we demonstrated that expression of both class 5 proteins was subject to zzso phase variation in zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of a zzso class 5 protein revealed striking similarity to the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso Using a cloned class 5 zzso we identified three potential class 5 gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso These class 5 sequences also had zzso with zzso zzso gene sequences and contained the zzso repeat sequence believed to be important in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
