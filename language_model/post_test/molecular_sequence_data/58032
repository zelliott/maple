The zzso gene can potentially zzso zzso and zzso proteins that differ only in their zzso tails because of an alternative zzso zzso The larger of these proteins contains a zzso zzso domain within its zzso zzso resides (at least in part) in zzso zzso and has been shown to prolong cell survival by blocking programmed cell death (also termed zzso To explore the function of the shorter zzso zzso protein that lacks a zzso domain, zzso zzso zzso or zzso were expressed in an zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso In contrast to zzso alpha that markedly prolonged cell survival, zzso did not extend the survival of zzso cells when cultured in the absence of zzso zzso in zzso cells of a zzso DNA that fused portions of the open reading frame common to zzso and zzso zzso zzso with sequences zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein resulted in production of a zzso fusion protein that was capable of zzso zzso cell survival in the setting of zzso zzso Based on zzso of cells to produce crude heavy zzso light zzso zzso and zzso zzso much of the zzso protein appeared to reside in the zzso whereas zzso and the zzso zzso proteins were found exclusively in zzso that also contained the inner zzso membrane protein zzso Taken together, these findings demonstrate the importance of membrane association for the function and zzso targeting of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, despite the strong evolutionary conservation of the zzso regions of zzso proteins observed previously for zzso and avian species, these data suggest that a zzso zzso domain can be zzso without loss of zzso
