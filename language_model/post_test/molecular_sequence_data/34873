In humans an estimated zzso of genes are alternatively zzso A large number of genes also show alternative initiation or zzso zzso of these processes is still poorly zzso For alternative zzso it is believed that the relative concentration of certain proteins and the presence of certain regulatory elements are the key factors determining zzso in zzso zzso However, there is evidence that zzso zzso might be part of the regulatory zzso zzso zzso molecules could bind to the target zzso in a zzso fashion, zzso blocking targeted zzso sites and zzso the zzso to available and zzso zzso zzso Here we describe an in zzso investigation to identify human zzso pairs with alternative initiation or termination in the sense gene and where only one of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso spliced genes with zzso transcripts covering the alternatively used zzso site are also zzso Our analyses are based on the zzso zzso zzso database from zzso the zzso transcripts data from zzso et zzso 2003, and the zzso full-length zzso database from zzso zzso These data gives new insight into the complexity of zzso organization and provide candidate zzso for zzso to study zzso zzso regulation of alternative zzso zzso and zzso Our result contains zzso clusters with this characteristic zzso organization and can be found at zzso
