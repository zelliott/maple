New Zealand Black zzso mice spontaneously develop a severe zzso zzso anemia due to the production of zzso red blood cell zzso zzso The contribution of variable region genes and zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso was investigated by zzso sequencing of eight zzso zzso zzso zzso among which five are capable of inducing anemia in zzso zzso Here we report that at least three zzso gene families zzso zzso and zzso and five zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, 9, 19, 21 and zzso in combination with several D, zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso whether zzso or not, are zzso by a large number of zzso gene elements and by members of known zzso and zzso gene families with preferential usage of zzso gene families most zzso to the D zzso The presence of several zzso in the zzso gene segments of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso whether zzso or not, strongly suggests that their zzso regions may be highly zzso and that the mechanism of zzso diversification might be important in the generation of zzso zzso Our results support the idea that zzso zzso responses are likely to be generated by an zzso zzso
