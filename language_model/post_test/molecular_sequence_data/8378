A gene zzso zzso a new zzso factor was isolated from zzso zzso using a zzso zzso probe designed from the zzso motif lying within the zzso region zzso of the zzso zzso 70 zzso zzso were present in other zzso zzso and that of the genetically well studied zzso zzso zzso was also zzso The zzso sequences of the two zzso genes were determined and shown to zzso primary translation products of zzso zzso zzso and 295 zzso zzso zzso acid zzso both showing greatest similarity to zzso B of zzso zzso However, while zzso B is involved in zzso gene expression and in the general stress response in zzso zzso zzso F affects zzso differentiation in zzso zzso of zzso did not affect zzso growth but did cause a zzso zzso zzso zzso examination showed that the zzso zzso produced spores that were smaller and zzso compared with those of the wild type, that the spore walls were thinner and sensitive to zzso and that in zzso zzso spores the zzso failed to zzso zzso F is proposed to control the late stages of spore development in zzso
