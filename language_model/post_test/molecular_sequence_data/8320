We have characterized the zzso and zzso sequences that zzso zzso from the zzso red zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is present as a single zzso Northern analysis shows that, like the zzso zzso the zzso gene is well expressed in zzso but zzso in zzso Compared to zzso genes of animals, zzso green plants and zzso that of zzso zzso displays a higher evolutionary rate and does not show any of the zzso signatures characteristic of the other zzso As previously described for zzso zzso is interrupted by a single zzso at the beginning of the coding zzso The site of initiation of zzso was characterized by zzso zzso The promoter region displays a zzso box but lacks a zzso zzso zzso Other noticeable features, such as a high content of zzso as well as a zzso motif found in both the zzso region and the zzso were zzso
