zzso zzso zzso zzso located at the cell surface and in the zzso zzso of most animal zzso are zzso zzso that carry zzso zzso zzso and play a vital role in infections of many zzso zzso are classified as zzso zzso zzso and zzso according to different core zzso zzso zzso is one of the four coding genes of zzso while zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is for zzso In this study, we cloned the zzso of zzso zzso and analyzed its zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were mapped to zzso and zzso by the zzso panel respectively, further zzso panel analysis showed that they were most closely linked to the marker zzso and zzso One special domain named the zzso m domain zzso band zzso zzso binding zzso was found in the prediction zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso showed that both of zzso zzso and zzso were expressed widely in detected zzso heart, liver, zzso zzso zzso stomach, muscle, fat and zzso Upon stimulation in healthy zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso did not induce a prominent change in the zzso while zzso zzso displayed a dramatic zzso In addition, synonymous zzso zzso of the zzso gene was detected and confirmed to be significantly associated with zzso mean zzso volume and zzso concentration in the peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso A single zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso gene and the association analysis showed that it was significantly associated with mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results confirmed the relation of zzso zzso and zzso to the immunity in zzso and these two genes could be used as candidate genes for improving immune traits in industrial pig zzso
