Our recent studies suggested that the zzso zzso protein is a cell surface zzso with a zzso zzso zzso However, the sequence of its zzso lacked an zzso signal sequence characteristic of membrane zzso In the present study we have isolated and zzso an additional zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso obtained indicated that the zzso terminal 330 zzso differs from the published sequence of the zzso zzso In addition, the sequence contains an open reading frame with an zzso signal zzso
