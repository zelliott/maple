The zzso P zzso P) zzso is an zzso that binds precursor zzso and zzso the removal of zzso leader zzso zzso and zzso studies have identified sites of contact between the mature zzso domain of zzso and the zzso however, relatively little is known about the location of the zzso leader in the zzso zzso To investigate the local three-dimensional environment of the zzso leader, we employed the short-range zzso agent zzso zzso The zzso zzso was incorporated into a series of zzso zzso containing unique zzso zzso in the zzso leader sequence at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The modified zzso formed zzso complexes with the zzso and produced discrete zzso zzso to zzso P zzso from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso were determined by reverse zzso primer zzso zzso incorporated into the zzso leader detected discrete elements of zzso structure in a progression from zzso to zzso to zzso zzso all of the zzso species retained the ability to cleave the zzso attached zzso indicating that the zzso reflect the native structure of the zzso zzso Together with available structural and zzso data, the zzso results suggest a model for the position of the zzso leader within the zzso zzso zzso
