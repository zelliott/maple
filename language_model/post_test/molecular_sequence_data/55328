zzso and zzso are two calcium binding zzso Related zzso and important zzso of inflammatory zzso They were recently introduced as partners for zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the precise mechanism of their interaction remains zzso We had for aim zzso to evaluate the impact of zzso proteins on zzso zzso zzso zzso to characterize molecular interaction of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso to determine the zzso consensus site involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso full length or zzso truncated zzso proteins and zzso fusion proteins were expressed in zzso coli and in zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso is the functional partner for zzso zzso zzso contrary to zzso however, the loading with calcium and a combination with zzso zzso are essential in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in differentiated and zzso zzso zzso cells, with zzso and zzso zzso zzso loaded with calcium and fused with the first 129 or 54 zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a similar zzso zzso in zzso to the one observed with zzso in the presence of zzso in zzso This suggests that zzso is the essential component of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso In this context, zzso full-length zzso and zzso truncated 90 zzso proteins as opposed to zzso truncated 86 and zzso truncated 57 zzso activate the zzso zzso function of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso region of zzso is directly involved in the molecular interface with the zzso The data point to four strategic zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso sequence that are involved directly in the molecular interaction with zzso zzso and then in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
