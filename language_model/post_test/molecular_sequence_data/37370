A proportion of zzso individuals in both familial and zzso contexts has been shown to carry zzso zzso in either zzso or, rarely, zzso zzso is a complex locus that encodes two unrelated proteins from alternately spliced transcripts that are read in different zzso The alpha transcript zzso zzso 2, and 3) produces the zzso zzso zzso zzso while the beta transcript zzso zzso and 2) is translated as zzso a stabilizing factor of zzso levels through binding to zzso zzso in zzso 2 can impair both zzso and insertions and deletions in zzso zzso zzso and 2, which can theoretically generate zzso fusion zzso No online database currently takes into account all the consequences of these zzso a situation compounded by some problematic previous zzso of zzso sequences and descriptions of their zzso As an initiative of the international zzso zzso zzso we have therefore established a database of zzso zzso observed in all zzso implicated in familial melanoma zzso Such a comprehensive, publicly accessible database is an essential foundation for research on melanoma zzso and its clinical zzso Our database serves two types of data as defined by zzso The core zzso includes the zzso zzso on the zzso and transcript levels, zzso acid zzso and zzso The ancillary zzso includes zzso description of events at the zzso and translation levels and zzso zzso The application that handles users' queries was designed in the zzso architecture and was implemented in zzso The zzso database zzso was deduced using functional dependency zzso We hereby present our first functional zzso of zzso The service is accessible via the zzso zzso
