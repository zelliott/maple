C1 inhibitor zzso was zzso in eight zzso patients presenting with consistently low levels of intact zzso zzso zzso levels were normal in all zzso however, the function of the zzso tested against zzso and zzso was variable and outside the normal functional range in seven of the eight zzso The molecular weight of patients' zzso protein was 105 zzso corresponding to the size of the intact zzso The zzso gene was zzso in all zzso zzso fragments generated with zzso zzso and zzso gave no indication of a major zzso gene zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso VIII revealed three zzso point zzso but there were no changes from the normal gene in or around the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, we found no evidence for a zzso zzso in patients which could affect normal zzso function in zzso These results indicate that the zzso of zzso dysfunction in zzso is zzso and distinct from that reported in either zzso or acquired zzso
