zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso by catalyzing the conversion of zzso to the active zzso zzso via the zzso of a zzso zzso When localized to the external cell surface it contributes to tissue zzso and cellular zzso zzso of its activity zzso the spread of zzso zzso has three zzso an zzso zzso growth factor domain, a central zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The biological roles of the zzso zzso render them therapeutic targets, however, until now no structure of the zzso domain has been zzso zzso of the structure of the zzso zzso zzso was undertaken to provide such zzso 

The crystal structure of the zzso domain of zzso zzso human zzso zzso with the inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined at a nominal resolution of zzso A and refined to a zzso zzso of zzso on all data zzso on data zzso 3 zzso The zzso has the expected zzso of a zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso has an zzso specificity pocket similar to that of zzso a zzso less accessible, zzso zzso pocket and a zzso zzso pocket which is capable of accommodating a wide range of zzso The zzso inhibitor binds zzso at the active site to form a zzso zzso zzso Although the overall structure is similar to that of zzso zzso zzso at six positions insertions of extra zzso in loop regions create unique surface zzso One of these loop regions is highly mobile despite being anchored by the zzso bridge which is characteristic of a small subset of zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso Factor zzso and zzso Factor zzso
