The two zzso pathogens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cause powdery zzso specifically in wheat or zzso They have the same life cycle, but their growth is restricted to the respective zzso Here, we compared the sequences of two zzso in both cereal zzso to determine their divergence time and their relationship with the evolution of their zzso We zzso a total of zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso sequences and compared them with the zzso regions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso and well zzso In contrast, the zzso regions showed very low conservation mostly due to different integration patterns of zzso zzso To estimate the divergence time of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we used zzso zzso sequences including zzso zzso zzso This revealed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso have zzso about 10 million years ago zzso two million years after wheat and barley (12 zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso zzso have zzso with their hosts during most of their evolutionary history after host zzso possibly after a short phase of host expansion when the same pathogen could still grow on the two zzso zzso
