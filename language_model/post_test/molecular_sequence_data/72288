In this paper we report a detailed comparative and evolutionary analysis of the sequences of constant zzso zzso zzso C gamma delta genes of zzso compared to the zzso sequences of zzso and zzso Because of the frequency and zzso distribution of gamma delta zzso in different animals, zzso and humans are defined as zzso delta zzso species and zzso as zzso delta zzso zzso Such a characteristic seems to be due to an zzso role of gamma delta zzso zzso By analyzing the zzso gene zzso of zzso C gamma we were able to estimate the distance between cattle and sheep at 18 million years ago, a time that is in agreement with other zzso zzso For zzso C gamma delta genes a peculiar zzso relationship was found, with human and mouse zzso together and leaving zzso zzso By using appropriate zzso the same zzso pattern was obtained with other zzso related zzso zzso zzso C alpha chain, zzso gamma and delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha chain and zzso beta with the exception of zzso C beta chain and zzso zzso In contrast, the analysis of all other zzso zzso zzso available in primary databases reveals a different tree, where primates and zzso are sister zzso and zzso are apart in accordance with the current view of zzso zzso These data are relevant to important evolutionary zzso They show how misleading a zzso based on a single or on a few zzso genes may zzso In addition they demonstrate that genes with correlated functions may evolve in a lineage specific manner probably in relation to environmental zzso
