Two house mouse subspecies occur in Europe, eastern and northern zzso zzso zzso zzso and western and southern zzso zzso zzso zzso A secondary hybrid zone occurs where their ranges meet, running from zzso to the Black zzso In this paper, we tested a hypothesis that the zzso zzso species zzso zzso has zzso with the house zzso More specifically, we assessed to what extent the evolution of this zzso mirrors divergence of the two zzso In order to test this hypothesis, we zzso sequence variation at five genes zzso zzso zzso wall protein zzso zzso adhesive protein of zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso sampled along a zzso across the hybrid zone from the Czech Republic to zzso zzso samples were supplemented with mice from New zzso We found two distinct zzso of zzso zzso each occurring exclusively in one of the mouse subspecies zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition to genetic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly smaller than zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were susceptible to experimental infection with both zzso zzso zzso however, the zzso were not zzso for the zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Overall, our results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso is zzso with zzso and zzso
