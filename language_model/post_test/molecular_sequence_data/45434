zzso zzso is the major source for transfer of genes to impart insect resistance in transgenic zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso are promising candidates for management of resistance development in insects zzso to their difference from the currently used zzso zzso in structure and zzso zzso The zzso gene was found to lack a functional promoter and, zzso is cryptic in zzso The zzso gene was cloned from a new indigenous zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso gene cloned from zzso zzso strain zzso revealed an open reading frame of 1902 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso showed a variation in three zzso acid zzso in comparison to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the newly cloned zzso gene was studied in an zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso by fusing the zzso gene downstream of zzso promoter and zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of a zzso mixture obtained from zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso showed production of zzso protein of about 65 zzso zzso zzso zzso protein showed toxicity against zzso zzso zzso
