We have expressed truncated forms of zzso and zzso in zzso coli and investigated the zzso properties of the two zzso The two proteins as well as their zzso proteins protected the same DNA region in the zzso sequence (a zzso box in the zzso zzso as examined by zzso zzso The region overlapped nearly perfectly with the zzso box consensus zzso zzso interference zzso revealed that all the zzso within the region and two other zzso in the close vicinity zzso with the zzso Competitive gel mobility shift zzso using various synthetic zzso of the zzso box sequences as the competitors demonstrated that zzso and zzso have similar sequence zzso for DNA zzso We have zzso the zzso expressed zzso and measured the zzso constant of the zzso complex using gel mobility shift zzso The zzso constant was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M and was comparable to that of zzso binding to a zzso zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that the binding modes of zzso and zzso to the zzso box are similar to each zzso
