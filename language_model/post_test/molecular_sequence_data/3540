zzso which encodes an zzso zzso is closely linked to the zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are considered to have originated from one common zzso However, the expression pattern of zzso is distinct from that of zzso being restricted to the adult male zzso zzso To zzso the evolutionary process of zzso we have zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso and its closely related zzso In zzso zzso the zzso diversity of zzso is remarkably low compared to that of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso are conspicuously frequent between zzso From zzso Southern analysis, zzso genes are present in at least the zzso species zzso The series of present results suggests that zzso was born in the course of constructing the zzso zzso gene family and then started to evolve zzso in contrast to zzso
