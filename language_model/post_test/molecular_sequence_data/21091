zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Kaohsiung zzso 1), a zzso zzso shares a zzso zzso zzso domain zzso with other zzso but contains a zzso zzso extension zzso The structure of the zzso complex and the domain interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso have not been zzso We resolved the crystal structure of the zzso complex at resolution zzso Surprisingly, the structure of the zzso complex in a zzso of zzso could be built, with no zzso zzso Only two remnant zzso of zzso could be built in the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is easily zzso by zzso To further characterize the interaction between zzso and zzso three segments of zzso including the full-length zzso zzso and zzso were used to analyze the zzso interaction and the zzso zzso The results from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicated the existence of an intrinsic flexibility in the region linking zzso and zzso for most zzso zzso In the zzso activity zzso the zzso zzso FL showed the highest zzso ability without residual zzso activity, and zzso and FL showed almost the same zzso ability, which was higher than with zzso zzso On the basis of the structures, the zzso flexibility and zzso activity of zzso we propose that the zzso from the zzso domain may enhance the zzso ability of the zzso domain against zzso
