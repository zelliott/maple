zzso zzso is used as a model to investigate zzso virus zzso and to evaluate zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso L zzso was characterized along with its association with zzso H zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes a predicted 175 zzso acid zzso that shares zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence lacks a consensus zzso site and a typical signal zzso but does possess an zzso zzso targeting sequence found commonly in zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso and the zzso DNA zzso zzso genes share a common zzso zzso start site and are zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso cells was demonstrated by zzso and zzso analyses using specific zzso generated against zzso and zzso zzso Similar to other zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso form a complex within infected zzso zzso and zzso transcripts and zzso were detected in zzso of monkeys with acute zzso zzso The zzso zzso model offers an opportunity to investigate the role of the zzso and zzso in viral zzso
