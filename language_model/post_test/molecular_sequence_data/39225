The zzso zzso major zzso protein zzso was modified in its zzso region by consecutive zzso and single zzso acid zzso The ability of zzso zzso zzso to form zzso particles zzso strongly depended on the size and position of the zzso zzso zzso lacking 21, 69, and 79 zzso acid zzso zzso in their zzso region efficiently formed zzso similar to those formed by the unmodified zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso derivatives with zzso zzso of 35 to 56 zzso zzso failed to form zzso zzso zzso with a single zzso zzso exchange or internal deletions of zzso 335 to zzso zzso and zzso 335 to zzso zzso resulted in the formation of zzso of a smaller size zzso 20 zzso These data indicate that certain parts of the zzso region of zzso are not essential for zzso interactions in the zzso at least in the zzso expression system zzso
