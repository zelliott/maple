We present a DNA library preparation method that has allowed us to reconstruct a zzso zzso zzso sequence of a zzso an extinct relative of zzso The quality of this zzso allows a direct zzso of zzso zzso indicating that genetic diversity in these archaic zzso was extremely zzso It also allows tentative dating of the zzso on the basis of zzso zzso in its zzso detailed zzso of zzso and zzso zzso into zzso human zzso and the generation of a near-complete catalog of genetic changes that swept to high frequency in modern humans since their divergence from zzso
