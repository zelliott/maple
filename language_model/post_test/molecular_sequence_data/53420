zzso may substitute for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Using the recognition properties of an zzso Y zzso zzso zzso as a model system, we establish a molecular perspective for zzso mimicry by comparing the three-dimensional basis of zzso binding to zzso with the binding of the same zzso to zzso The peptides compete with zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The computer program zzso was used to zzso map the zzso site, zzso zzso zzso zzso This approach identified zzso acids interacting with the same zzso functional zzso groups that recognize the zzso zzso of zzso zzso modeling indicates that the peptides adopt an extended turn zzso within the zzso combining site, serving to overlap the peptides with the zzso spatial zzso zzso binding is associated with only minor changes in zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso serum zzso the zzso from the zzso linkage, therefore zzso zzso zzso zzso These results further confirm that peptides and carbohydrates can bind to the same zzso site and that peptides can structurally and functionally mimic salient features of zzso zzso
