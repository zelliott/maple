zzso transcripts in which all zzso zzso are replaced by zzso are zzso at a highly accelerated rate when incubated in extracts from zzso cells, sheep zzso or pig zzso We report here the partial zzso and characterization of a novel zzso referred to as zzso that is responsible for the degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso dependent and specifically degrades zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso for zzso with the Ki for zzso by normal zzso suggests a approximately zzso preferential binding to zzso which can account for the specificity of zzso The site of zzso by zzso is zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso generating zzso as zzso The presence of alternative unconventional zzso in zzso does not result in degradation unless zzso zzso are also zzso We show that zzso is able to degrade zzso that previously have been modified by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso destabilize zzso by converting zzso to zzso and some of these zzso are zzso zzso We therefore speculate that zzso in concert with zzso may form part of a novel cellular zzso zzso mechanism that acts to degrade zzso
