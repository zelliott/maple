The region of the zzso resistance zzso zzso that encodes the zzso transfer gene zzso has two zzso aligned promoters separated by 145 zzso The principal transcripts are zzso and zzso zzso zzso Minor transcripts are zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcript appears to zzso an 11 zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcript does not zzso a zzso zzso When zzso on short fragments, the promoter for the zzso transcript zzso efficiently but that for the zzso site does zzso The 3' ends of the zzso and zzso base transcripts end inside the zzso zzso Thus they provide additional sense zzso to compete with zzso for zzso the zzso zzso regulator of zzso A model is proposed for the participation of these sense and zzso transcripts in the control of expression of the zzso zzso
