In an effort to characterize genes expressed in the zzso we have isolated two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that zzso to a zzso zzso zzso Using a panel of zzso zzso cell hybrids, zzso clone zzso was mapped to human zzso 16, and clone zzso was mapped to human zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified with both clones and were used for linkage analysis in the zzso zzso zzso was tightly linked to several markers near zzso zzso and zzso was tightly linked to several markers on zzso zzso zzso zzso sites or expressed sequence tags were generated from the 3' untranslated regions of both zzso zzso
