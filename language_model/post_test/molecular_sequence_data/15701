Both zzso and zzso employ zzso zzso peptides zzso as an essential component of their innate immune zzso However, evolutionary relation of these immune molecules remains zzso zzso as key weapons of zzso zzso for prey and defense, receive increasing recognition as an emerging source of such zzso From a zzso library prepared from the zzso zzso of the scorpion zzso zzso clones zzso precursors of two new zzso named zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso The precursor of zzso consists of a signal zzso a mature zzso and an zzso zzso in which zzso zzso as the typical processing signal are located between the mature and zzso zzso is an zzso of several previously described zzso from scorpion zzso and has also zzso sequence similarity to zzso a large family of zzso from zzso skin, whereas zzso displays some similarity to zzso from diverse origin including zzso zzso fish mast cells, and zzso zzso These two zzso peptides form zzso structure in the presence of 50% zzso zzso a zzso environment, as identified by circular zzso zzso zzso This finding is further verified by their zzso structures that show a typical zzso zzso design, a structural prerequisite for zzso zzso zzso exhibit extensive zzso effects on both zzso and zzso cells zzso and zzso bacteria, zzso zzso rabbit zzso and rat zzso root zzso zzso at zzso zzso It is remarkable that zzso was zzso to zzso more potent than zzso against nearly all the cells zzso zzso differences in zzso balance and zzso zzso acid location between two zzso could account for their differential zzso Despite these differences, zzso at precursor organization, three-dimensional structure, and biological function suggests that zzso are two zzso related zzso and likely originated from a common zzso by gene zzso Our work presented here also provides new insights into an evolutionary link among zzso from zzso and zzso and clues for evolutionary convergence between zzso and virus fusion zzso
