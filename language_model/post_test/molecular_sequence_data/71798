The reasons why zzso disease develops in only a small proportion of individuals carrying the zzso bacteria are zzso zzso in host responses to bacterial zzso are thought to be involved, since people with deficiencies in the terminal components of the complement pathway, or of zzso are susceptible to zzso zzso We zzso that genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso a plasma zzso that zzso another zzso of complement zzso might similarly cause zzso to zzso zzso 

The frequency of zzso of the zzso gene was zzso in children with zzso disease and controls from two independent zzso one zzso zzso patients and 272 controls zzso with zzso zzso and one community-based zzso patients and 110 controls zzso zzso by means of zzso and zzso zzso with confirmation by DNA zzso 

The proportion of people zzso for zzso zzso was higher in patients with zzso disease than in controls in the hospital study (15 zzso vs four zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the community study (six zzso vs three zzso zzso zzso The population attributable fraction of cases attributable to zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso 

The zzso zzso is a critical zzso of zzso zzso and genetic zzso of zzso might account for a third of all disease zzso
