Alternative zzso plays an important role in the expression of genetic zzso Among the best understood alternative zzso factors are zzso and zzso which regulate sexual differentiation in zzso Like the zzso zzso the recently identified zzso zzso are subject to alternative zzso Using an zzso directed against the major human zzso beta zzso we show that it has a widespread expression in the rat zzso zzso zzso activity changes the alternative zzso pattern of the human zzso gene in the zzso After zzso zzso a zzso bearing high similarity to a zzso zzso zzso zzso is switched off in the zzso and is zzso in the zzso In addition, the ratio of another short zzso zzso zzso to zzso is zzso zzso is not translated into zzso and probably helps to regulate the relative amounts of zzso to zzso We also observe zzso changes in alternative zzso of the zzso light chain B, zzso and zzso zzso indicating that the coordinated change of alternative zzso patterns might contribute to molecular plasticity in the zzso
