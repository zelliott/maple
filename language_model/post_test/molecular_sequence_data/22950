zzso of cells by the highly zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso C zzso is zzso by the zzso exporter zzso a cell surface protein containing 12 potential zzso segments with six zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify zzso zzso critical for zzso zzso infection, we first independently isolated a human zzso zzso the zzso protein that shares zzso identity to human zzso and we show that zzso does not function as a zzso for zzso Then, by generating specific hybrids between zzso and zzso and testing zzso of mouse cells expressing these hybrids to zzso zzso zzso we identify zzso zzso 1 and 6 as critical for zzso zzso zzso Mouse cells expressing a hybrid protein containing zzso backbone with the zzso sequence from zzso were highly susceptible to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we show that a single zzso of zzso in zzso zzso to an zzso zzso zzso (a zzso present in the corresponding position zzso in zzso zzso is sufficient to render zzso functional as an zzso zzso However, an zzso zzso in zzso zzso or substitution of the entire zzso zzso sequence for zzso zzso sequence does not disrupt zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso within zzso zzso also contribute to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that zzso regions that mediate zzso surface unit binding are distinct from zzso and zzso Our results are consistent with previous conclusions that infection of cells by zzso involves interaction of virus with multiple zzso zzso
