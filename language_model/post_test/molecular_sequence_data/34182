zzso contamination of tuberculosis zzso cultures is a problem in that it allows the overgrowth of another zzso present in the zzso zzso which can potentially mask the presence of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the bacterial organisms responsible for such overgrowth and contamination, and to examine their zzso to zzso various chemical selective decontamination steps and zzso antibiotics in liquid culture media, in an attempt to develop a method to help alleviate contamination problems associated with the conventional isolation of zzso tuberculosis from routine patient zzso zzso zzso zzso from 102 routine zzso cultures were identified zzso by zzso zzso gene zzso and direct sequencing from contaminated zzso zzso slopes and zzso liquid zzso It was found that the zzso from zzso slopes belonged to 11 different zzso and were composed largely of zzso organisms zzso zzso whereas the liquid culture zzso belonged to 13 different zzso with zzso zzso zzso being zzso zzso zzso was the dominant contaminant in both zzso The effect of six different selective decontamination protocols was zzso Four of the six methods were effective at eliminating all zzso organisms zzso these were zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at a concentration of 2 or zzso was less effective as it was unable to eliminate all organisms of each species tested, with the exception of zzso zzso In conclusion, breakthrough contamination of zzso cultures is due to a diverse range of at least 17 different bacterial zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso accounting for the dominant zzso zzso Employment of chemical zzso protocols solely involving zzso may lead to higher rates of zzso Where such contamination is encountered, zzso laboratories should consider the reprocessing of such zzso samples with an alternative decontamination method such as zzso zzso
