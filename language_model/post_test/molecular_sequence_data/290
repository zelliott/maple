The zzso zzso leukemia zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the multiple lineage leukemia gene in a substantial proportion of patients suffering from acute forms of zzso Studies show that zzso indirectly zzso zzso by serving as a regulator for zzso zzso as well as for zzso zzso and steroid zzso zzso Our in zzso and in zzso data demonstrate that zzso could also serve as a zzso factor to directly induce zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso deletion zzso established that full-length zzso is required for the zzso zzso and that the zzso domain likely resides in the zzso zzso Moreover, the DNA binding domain may zzso to the first 45 zzso acids of zzso Not surprisingly, multiple lineage zzso which lacks these zzso zzso did not induce expression from the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso element appears to zzso in the zzso to zzso region of the zzso zzso Finally, studies using zzso confirmed that zzso regulates zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso could inhibit zzso zzso at least in part, through zzso zzso Given the importance of zzso as an zzso zzso our findings may have important ramifications for better understanding zzso
