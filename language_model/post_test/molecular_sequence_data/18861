Novel molecular data are presented to resolve the long-standing issue of the zzso of the zzso zzso order zzso relative to the other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of various combinations of full zzso and full or partial zzso zzso sequence data, which included zzso species representing 97 zzso across the 15 zzso orders, were zzso New zzso data were generated for 82 species, partial zzso data for 53 species, and full zzso data for 29 zzso The zzso of each of the zzso orders zzso zzso zzso and zzso was confirmed, as was the zzso of the zzso Two relatively stable groups of zzso zzso emerged and are hereby designated as new zzso The zzso zzso zzso is established to zzso the integrated nature of one zzso and 10 described zzso of zzso zzso previously placed in the family zzso with the members of the order zzso The zzso zzso zzso is established for a subset of 12 zzso zzso zzso by zzso bearing four zzso each with an anterior accessory zzso most zzso zzso and have been assigned to the zzso at one time or zzso zzso zzso zzso are suggested for eight additional zzso zzso for the remaining zzso zzso have not yet zzso We propose that these 17 zzso remain in the zzso Among these, particularly zzso across analyses were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The unique association of zzso with zzso rather than with zzso appears to represent a zzso zzso Both of the zzso hosted zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso appear to have had their origins with zzso zzso Across zzso the sister group to the zzso of zzso zzso orders was found to be an zzso zzso as was the sister to the freshwater zzso and zzso zzso zzso further data are required to resolve outstanding zzso and zzso issues, the present analyses contribute significantly to an understanding of the evolutionary radiation of the entire zzso Clearly, zzso zzso comprise the backbone of zzso zzso
