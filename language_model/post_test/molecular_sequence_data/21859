Four bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated from a crude zzso saline soil of zzso zzso China, were investigated using a zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso in the order zzso with the highest sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of strain zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and produced deep red zzso in artificial seawater zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a single polar zzso and often formed zzso The strain contained zzso as the zzso respiratory zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso as the major fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and belonged to the zzso zzso in the family zzso of the order zzso with the highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarities with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Ben zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and oval to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These three novel strains had zzso acid zzso as the diagnostic zzso acid in the zzso zzso zzso as the only zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso as the major cellular fatty zzso The zzso contents of the zzso DNA of strain zzso and strains zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
