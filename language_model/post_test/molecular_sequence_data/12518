zzso Using the recently published crystal structure of a bacterial zzso namely 102 (also termed zzso as a template molecular models of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso interaction studies demonstrated that in keeping with known zzso activities the putative binding sites of mouse zzso zzso and zzso oriented testosterone for 15 zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction studies with the putative binding site of human liver zzso demonstrated that zzso was oriented for zzso However, in keeping with previous zzso zzso studies with zzso and zzso changing a single zzso zzso to zzso in zzso gave rise to a zzso zzso which could bind testosterone as a zzso for 15 zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso interaction studies with the putative binding site of rat zzso zzso suggested that this zzso would zzso zzso at the 3- rather than at the zzso zzso The results of these molecular zzso studies demonstrate that apparently minor modifications to zzso zzso zzso acid sequences can result in major zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is thus a useful technique that can aid in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and species differences in zzso zzso The technique can also be zzso to complement zzso zzso studies in order to identify critical structural features of zzso and other zzso
