zzso of functional peptides is a powerful tool for spatial and zzso control of cell signaling zzso We show that the genetically zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso can be used to zzso zzso the affinity of peptides for their binding zzso zzso analysis and molecular modeling were used to zzso two peptides into the zzso zzso of the zzso domain while maintaining zzso structure in the dark but allowing for binding to zzso proteins when the zzso zzso unfolds in the zzso Caged versions of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind their targets with zzso and zzso enhanced affinity in the light, zzso These switches can be used as general tools for zzso zzso which we demonstrate with zzso gene zzso in zzso
