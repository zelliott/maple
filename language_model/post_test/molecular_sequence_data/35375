zzso are a class of short, zzso zzso zzso that act as zzso regulators in gene zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso with a total of zzso good quality reads representing zzso and zzso coverage of the short zzso and long zzso arms of the zzso zzso In zzso and structural analyses revealed a total of 55 zzso 48 and 42 zzso were found to be present on zzso and zzso respectively, of which 35 were common to both zzso arms, while 13 zzso were specific to zzso and 7 zzso were specific to zzso In total, 14 of the predicted zzso were identified in wheat for the first zzso zzso (the copy number of each zzso was also found to be higher in zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso were predicted for each zzso while expression analysis gave evidence of expression for 6 out of 55 zzso zzso of the same zzso were also found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences to identify zzso zzso coding zzso Based on this analysis, two other zzso zzso and zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso region of wheat zzso Five of the predicted zzso coding regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso verified to be located to the zzso zzso and three of them : zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be expressed in Chinese Spring adult zzso zzso genes identified in this study will expand our understanding of gene regulation in bread zzso
