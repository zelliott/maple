Previous studies on zzso gene related zzso zzso have demonstrated that it has the characteristics of an zzso zzso and from an examination of the zzso we have proposed that it contains an zzso zzso We have zzso two zzso of zzso which have different lengths of idealized zzso zzso secondary zzso The first model, zzso has been zzso with zzso generating an idealized zzso zzso in the region between zzso 8 and 25, equivalent to approximately five turns of an zzso This zzso is not an zzso in any of our zzso but it does bind with low affinity to zzso receptors in crude liver zzso Our second model, zzso has an idealized zzso zzso between zzso 8 and 18, which is equivalent to approximately three turns of an zzso In an in zzso rat zzso zzso zzso this zzso is an zzso with a potency zzso that of the native zzso However, the potency of zzso in an zzso zzso zzso is much lower, only zzso the potency of zzso Both model peptides display zzso characteristics commensurate with their zzso We conclude that there is an zzso zzso in zzso between zzso 8 and 18 and that this zzso zzso in the vicinity of zzso zzso
