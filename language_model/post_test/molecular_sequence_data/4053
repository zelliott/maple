The activity of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso depends on several factors, such as zzso stability, and accessibility of zzso to its target zzso Among these factors, accessibility is believed to be the zzso factor for zzso zzso in zzso As zzso and its zzso zzso are zzso charged, we examined whether cellular zzso proteins or artificial zzso might improve the accessibility of zzso to its zzso zzso Specifically, we examined the effects of two kinds of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a cellular zzso zzso on the accessibility of zzso to a model structured zzso in zzso The zzso activity of zzso was slightly enhanced by zzso probably due to an acceleration of the zzso zzso And also, the zzso zzso zzso could cleave the target zzso at a significantly higher rate due to its unwinding activity for the duplex zzso zzso These approaches should be useful in the development of efficient zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
