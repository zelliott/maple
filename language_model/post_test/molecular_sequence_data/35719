zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso coat to zzso and represents a stable single zzso chain forming the entire zzso The zzso can be activated by various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso G, zzso and zzso and by different mercurial zzso zzso conversion of the zzso zzso to the active form by zzso is accompanied by a molecular weight reduction to an apparent zzso zzso This active zzso lacks the first 79 zzso zzso zzso by zzso leads to a zzso intermediate of apparent zzso zzso lacking 48 zzso zzso The active zzso is therefore generated upon prolonged incubation with zzso by further zzso of 22 zzso zzso Another zzso intermediate form with apparent zzso zzso is generated from the zzso upon incubation with zzso zzso by zzso zzso of 53 or 64 zzso zzso However, zzso zzso cannot be activated by zzso zzso by different mercurial compounds finally results in the formation of active zzso with apparent zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso active zzso can zzso to give active zzso 57,000 and 45,000 zzso and two zzso 28,000 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso yields three final products with apparent zzso zzso 125,000 and zzso zzso non zzso Upon reduction, only the zzso zzso form can be zzso The zzso zzso can be activated in a similar manner as zzso zzso zzso by zzso leads after zzso zzso to an active zzso with sequence zzso to zzso zzso
