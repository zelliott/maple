The zzso organization of the zzso a zzso zzso complex produced by zzso bacteria, depends on specific interactions between zzso zzso double zzso zzso carried by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso individual zzso zzso zzso arranged within a zzso scaffolding zzso zzso complexes with distinct zzso are also thought to mediate the attachment of zzso to the cell zzso We report here the crystal structure of a single zzso domain from the scaffolding protein of zzso zzso The zzso domain folds into a zzso zzso with an overall zzso zzso zzso similar to that observed in bacterial zzso zzso zzso patches of zzso zzso promote extensive zzso contacts in the zzso and suggest a possible binding target for the zzso pair of the zzso zzso zzso Comparative studies of zzso zzso indicate that, in spite of low sequence similarities and different functional roles, all zzso zzso share a common zzso zzso fold stabilized by a zzso zzso zzso The formation of stable zzso complexes requires the presence of zzso However, the structure of the zzso domain reported here reveals no obvious zzso site, and previous experiments have failed to detect high affinity binding of zzso to the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso Based on structural and zzso evidence, we propose a model of the zzso complex in which the zzso domain requires zzso with its zzso partner for protein stability and zzso zzso zzso
