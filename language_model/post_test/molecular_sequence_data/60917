Small zzso zzso zzso were zzso to express zzso sequences inside the zzso and to test whether they are zzso for Rev binding and zzso We show that zzso zzso containing the minimal binding site for Rev zzso accumulates inside the zzso maintaining the interaction with the basic zzso zzso zzso Upon Rev zzso the zzso zzso is exported to the zzso where it remains bound to Rev in a particle devoid of zzso zzso These data indicate that Rev can elicit the functions of zzso binding and transport inside the zzso
