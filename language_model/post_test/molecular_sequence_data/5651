We introduced zzso DNA zzso from a patient with a zzso zzso into established zzso human zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso lines, containing either exclusively zzso or zzso zzso transition in the zzso zzso zzso were characterized and analyzed for zzso zzso function and zzso levels of different zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso severely zzso zzso zzso function and zzso protein zzso We detected a marked reduction in zzso zzso levels which was not associated with an zzso of intermediate transcripts containing zzso sequences or decreased zzso Native zzso gel zzso showed that the residual zzso fraction in zzso zzso had an altered zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso the zzso secondary or zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso causes a zzso change in the zzso which may impair zzso This zzso leads to a severe reduction in the functional zzso pool by increasing its in zzso degradation by zzso zzso
