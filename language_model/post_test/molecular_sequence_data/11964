zzso development was studied in male African zzso by zzso examination of zzso zzso and by monitoring the responsiveness of zzso zzso zzso to salmon zzso analogue zzso in zzso zzso were carried out with fish from 9 to 28 zzso of zzso Fish were assigned to four groups, according to the stage of zzso I, zzso alone; II, zzso and zzso III, zzso zzso and zzso IV, all germ cell zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso II increased 3- to zzso from stage I to II and from stage II to III, whereas a zzso increase was recorded from stage III to zzso The zzso values of zzso varied between zzso and zzso zzso stages II and III being less zzso The highest dosage of zzso zzso zzso led to a reduction of zzso zzso In the first three zzso the zzso zzso large amounts of free zzso while free zzso II zzso was not detected at any stage of zzso zzso against zzso II and its zzso and zzso were used for zzso zzso In stages I and II, two zzso of zzso which differed in the size and labeling intensity of their zzso zzso were zzso Both types of zzso were zzso for the two zzso of zzso zzso In stages III and IV, only zzso of the zzso with the larger zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso masses zzso probably arising through fusion of zzso zzso appeared in the zzso in stage III and became more prominent in stage zzso zzso and zzso were zzso for the zzso but negative for the zzso We conclude that the two zzso of zzso represent different zzso stages of zzso zzso cells, as they shared zzso for the zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso II zzso may be zzso for the amount of intact zzso II available for zzso particularly at early stages of zzso In contrast, at more advanced stages when the readily zzso pool of zzso II has greatly increased, the amount of zzso II also appears to be controlled by modification or elimination of the zzso from zzso and zzso
