Upon reaching their intermediate target, the zzso zzso zzso acquire responsiveness to repulsive guidance cues, allowing the zzso to exit the zzso and adopt a zzso zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms that regulate this switch from attraction to zzso remain poorly zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required as a zzso for the zzso induction of zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso In turn, zzso is required for zzso zzso to respond to a repulsive zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a cue with dual zzso In zzso zzso it acts as an attractive guidance zzso in a zzso zzso At the same time, zzso binds to zzso to induce the expression of its own zzso zzso which mediates the repulsive response of zzso zzso to zzso Our study characterizes a molecular mechanism by which navigating zzso switch their responsiveness at intermediate zzso
