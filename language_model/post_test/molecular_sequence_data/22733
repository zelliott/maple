A probe consisting of zzso red fluorescent protein zzso and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein zzso linked by a zzso chain containing the zzso zzso site zzso was developed to monitor zzso zzso in living zzso The expression of the tandem construct in zzso cells yielded a strong red zzso when excited with zzso to zzso light or with a zzso zzso zzso laser line as a result of zzso resonance energy transfer zzso from donor zzso to zzso zzso The advantage over previous zzso using zzso fluorescent protein is that our construct can be used when zzso zzso lower than zzso are not zzso To validate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were triggered to undergo zzso zzso zzso An increase in zzso activity was demonstrated by a reduction of zzso in cells zzso with the zzso This was zzso by a zzso of zzso zzso leading to an increase in zzso zzso and a corresponding decrease in zzso fluorescence, which correlated with an increase in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was readily detected at the zzso level using the zzso zzso zzso making this a useful technology to monitor zzso activity in living zzso
