In zzso algae, very rapid zzso streaming is generated by sliding movement of an unconventional zzso on fixed zzso zzso The speed of this sliding movement is the fastest among many molecular zzso known so zzso We have cloned a set of overlapping zzso zzso the heavy chain of this zzso by zzso with zzso raised against zzso zzso The molecular mass of this heavy chain is 248 zzso and the protein has a zzso motor domain, six zzso zzso an extensive zzso zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that this zzso belongs to class zzso
