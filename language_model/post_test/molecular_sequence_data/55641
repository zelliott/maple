We demonstrate here that the nuclear zzso B zzso zzso binding site in the zzso zzso virus zzso long terminal repeat is essential for efficient virus replication in primary zzso zzso but zzso for efficient replication in primary T zzso zzso of the zzso B site does not seriously impair replication of a zzso zzso or a zzso zzso in peripheral blood zzso or established zzso cell zzso however, zzso of the zzso B site prevents efficient zzso replication in primary zzso zzso These data suggest that efficient replication in primary zzso requires both envelope and long terminal repeat zzso
