Experience gained through investigations on zzso disease makes it possible to propose a screening method based on zzso of isolated zzso cells to evaluate the occurrence in food protein of zzso acid sequences that are able to adversely affect zzso and related zzso zzso The method consists of in zzso sequential zzso and zzso zzso of food protein zzso under optimal zzso temperature and time conditions and in zzso incubation of the digest with zzso zzso the toxic potential is detected as an zzso of K zzso zzso cells after a short zzso Other in zzso test systems, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and rat fetal zzso can be used to confirm the results obtained with the isolated zzso A zzso step of the zzso digest on a zzso column before exposure of the in zzso systems to the separated zzso zzso adds to the sensitivity of the zzso This screening method is not only very useful to investigate action mechanisms in zzso disease, but also to assess the safety of zzso plant foods and novel foods for zzso zzso
