zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso partner zzso zzso zzso zzso are important in allocating significant amounts of carbon from zzso into zzso zzso in zzso It has been proposed that zzso complexes zzso containing PAL and zzso are functionally important at this entry point into zzso zzso To evaluate the zzso model, two zzso PAL zzso presumed to be involved in either zzso zzso or in zzso zzso zzso were independently expressed together with zzso and zzso in zzso zzso creating two zzso strains expressing either zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso and zzso When zzso was zzso the majority of zzso zzso was incorporated into zzso and zzso metabolism was highly reduced by zzso zzso zzso PAL alone zzso zzso very little zzso into zzso zzso To test for intermediate channeling between PAL and zzso we fed zzso and zzso simultaneously to the triple zzso but found no evidence for channeling of the zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso efficient carbon flux from zzso to zzso via reactions zzso by PAL and zzso does not appear to require channeling through a zzso in zzso and instead zzso zzso of PAL and zzso is sufficient to drive carbon flux into the zzso zzso This may be the primary mechanism by which carbon allocation into zzso metabolism is controlled in zzso
