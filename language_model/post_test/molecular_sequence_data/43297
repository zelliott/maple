zzso extract from zzso cells growing zzso in saline medium was separated by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso zzso with the separation in the first dimension on a wide range immobilized pH zzso zzso From one zzso zzso gel a number of previously identified proteins were used as test material for our initial zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso efforts on large scale rapid protein spot zzso Sample preparation via zzso zzso zzso was slightly modified to be compatible to zzso analysis, and via this modified procedure zzso generated zzso mass profiles could, in most cases with good precision, identify the protein in zzso zzso zzso was tested on a zzso zzso zzso zzso and it was shown that the zzso of some peptides was clearly suppressed by the presence of zzso Roughly 50% of the observed zzso masses was found by the search routines in the database, and the mass measurement accuracy of the peptides was within zzso zzso zzso gels could be used with good results for the generation of peptides to be analyzed by zzso For one of the zzso resolved zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso spectrum proved crucial in zzso
