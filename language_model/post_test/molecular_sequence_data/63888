To study the mechanisms involved in membrane fusion, we zzso the fusion process of giant zzso in real time by optical zzso zzso To induce membrane fusion, we used zzso influenza zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso derived from the zzso fusion zzso region of the zzso zzso and zzso two synthetic analogue peptides of zzso a zzso zzso and positively zzso charged zzso We were able to zzso membrane fusion caused by zzso or by zzso alone, as well as by the mixture of these two zzso The zzso zzso however, did not induce membrane fusion, even at an zzso zzso which has been described as the optimal condition for the fusion of large zzso zzso Surprisingly, before membrane fusion, the shrinkage of zzso was always zzso Our results suggest that a zzso of zzso zzso which probably resulted from zzso in the zzso folds of zzso is a critical factor in fusion zzso
