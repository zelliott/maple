The zzso binding domain of G zzso receptors for zzso zzso consists of a pocket formed by zzso and zzso domain zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso however, previous studies have suggested that the binding cavity of the zzso analog zzso zzso is lined by zzso in zzso zzso The additional involvement of the zzso zzso for binding zzso or the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso Using a cassette construct zzso for the human zzso 5 zzso zzso we systematically examined the role of zzso structures in zzso binding by creating a series of zzso in which the zzso portions have been altered by conservative segment exchange zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and by deletion (for the zzso zzso or zzso analysis zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with wild type or zzso human zzso zzso and zzso binding was assessed using membrane binding zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso and zzso produced minor zzso decreases in affinity for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso to mimic the size of this loop in zzso and zzso (the two zzso that do not bind zzso did not interfere with the binding of zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, both zzso zzso failed to bind zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells with a human zzso zzso revealed that the zzso receptors were targeted to the plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also failed to bind to the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest a potential contribution of zzso (in addition to the previously identified zzso in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso binding zzso
