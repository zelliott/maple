zzso 2 and 15 zzso and zzso are highly differentiated but related zzso with zzso yet also distinct functions, and established benefits for medical drug zzso The present study identified a gene for an ancient third zzso family member in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso was only reported in zzso zzso genes with intact open reading frames zzso and evidence of transcription, and a recent past of zzso selection, were found for zzso zzso zzso pig and zzso In human and mouse the zzso zzso is zzso Although deduced zzso proteins share only zzso overall zzso acid identity with zzso they share many of the zzso zzso important for binding to zzso chain zzso and zzso bovine zzso was shown to interact with zzso zzso zzso of sequence motifs indicates that capacity for binding zzso is an ancestral characteristic of the zzso family, in accordance with a recent study which showed that in fish both zzso and zzso can bind zzso Evidence reveals that the species lineage leading to zzso started out with three similar zzso zzso zzso and zzso and that later in evolution zzso zzso and zzso zzso chain acquired a new and specific binding mode and zzso zzso was lost in several but not all groups of zzso The present study forms an important step forward in understanding this potent family of zzso and may help to improve future strategies for their application in veterinarian and human zzso
