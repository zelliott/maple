The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had been previously zzso from the zzso culture media of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of an internal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso determined the 26 zzso zzso zzso This sequence was used to amplify a DNA fragment, which was used as a probe to clone the gene zzso the zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis showed the zzso insert to be zzso zzso corresponding to a predicted open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The 26 zzso zzso acids of the zzso zzso were located within the zzso immediately downstream of a putative zzso recognition region, zzso This is consistent with this zzso insert representing an internal zzso zzso of the full length zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis confirmed that the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso was unique and did not possess a high degree of zzso to sequence in the zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso that possess limited zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso include several zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso showed that the DNA zzso the zzso zzso zzso to a single zzso zzso zzso This DNA probe also zzso to a single species of human zzso zzso zzso of a zzso protein was detected by coupled zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of this zzso zzso reaction detected a zzso zzso using an zzso raised against the zzso sequence that was originally used to clone the zzso zzso These data indicate the successful zzso cloning and expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Future studies that zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso may allow the characterization of the role of zzso in calcium zzso zzso zzso crystal deposition zzso
