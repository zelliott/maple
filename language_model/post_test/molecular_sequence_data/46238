zzso and zzso were located in zzso imprinted zzso They all affected muscle growth and meat zzso The functional importance of zzso and zzso imply that the variation of the genes could affect the growth traits of zzso zzso and sequencing were used to analyze the four zzso of zzso gene and zzso gene in zzso individuals, which belong to eight zzso of zzso including zzso buffalo and zzso A synonymous zzso zzso was detected in zzso 5 of zzso in zzso zzso but didn't change significantly with zzso zzso Three zzso zzso AB and zzso of zzso were identified in zzso zzso The associations analyst of different zzso showed that the individuals with zzso AA and zzso had a greater body weight and longer body length than those with zzso AB zzso and zzso zzso the AA individuals were different from those AB zzso in the circumference of cannon zzso No zzso was observed in the other populations at other zzso These results were in agreement with the zzso analysis: zzso and zzso genes were in a highly zzso
