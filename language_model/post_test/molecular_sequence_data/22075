zzso zzso can degrade zzso an abundant zzso in plant cell walls, by the coordinate action of a group of zzso zzso Among these, zzso carry out the initial breakdown by zzso internal bonds in the zzso zzso We have isolated and characterized a zzso zzso coding for an zzso belonging to family 11 of zzso zzso zzso was shown to be induced by zzso and zzso by zzso and to be expressed in zzso The disruption of zzso caused only a moderate decrease, about zzso in the level of zzso zzso activity and in the growth rate, with zzso zzso as the only carbon zzso However, deletion of the gene had a more pronounced effect on zzso delaying the appearance of secondary zzso and reducing the average zzso size by more than zzso zzso the zzso gene into the zzso strains reversed this zzso back to wild zzso
