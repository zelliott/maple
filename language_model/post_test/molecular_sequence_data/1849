Because copper is both an essential zzso and a toxic metal, different strategies have evolved to appropriately regulate its zzso as a function of changing environmental copper zzso In this report, we describe a zzso protein from zzso zzso that maintains the delicate balance between zzso and zzso This zzso designated zzso has four distinct zzso zzso activity zzso reveal that the first three zzso of zzso are necessary and sufficient to deliver copper to its target, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain IV, which is absent in zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso zzso eight pairs of which are in a potential metal coordination arrangement, zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing the full-length zzso zzso are resistant to copper zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the zzso domain IV enhances copper resistance of the zzso cells by an order of magnitude compared with that observed in the same strain expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We consistently found that zzso zzso cells disrupted in the zzso gene exhibit an increased sensitivity to copper and zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso is associated with increased copper resistance in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso activates zzso under zzso conditions through the use of its first three zzso and protects cells against metal zzso toxicity via its fourth zzso
