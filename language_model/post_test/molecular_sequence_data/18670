Recent studies have demonstrated that the zzso external region zzso of human zzso virus 1 zzso zzso 41 contains a series of zzso for human zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were isolated from zzso individuals and show broad zzso zzso This suggests that zzso is a good target for the development of effective zzso zzso However, many studies have shown that it is difficult to induce zzso with similar broad zzso activities using zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso with effective zzso activity were readily induced using a precisely designed zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso fused to zzso zzso from zzso toxin zzso which showed a significantly stabilized zzso structure after a series of zzso including substitution with an zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with the unmodified zzso zzso The stabilized zzso structure of zzso did not affect its capacity to bind the zzso zzso as evaluated with an zzso linked zzso zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance binding zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso vaccines were evaluated after a standard vaccination procedure in which the experimental mice were primed with either the zzso or zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso Higher zzso of zzso zzso were induced by zzso than that by zzso More importantly, the zzso induced by zzso showed enhanced zzso potency against zzso strains with both zzso and zzso zzso and a greater degree of broad zzso activity than the zzso induced by zzso These results indicate that a zzso zzso zzso zzso can elicit zzso zzso when used as a vaccine zzso
