zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined at the zzso zzso of zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso of the spontaneous zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso plates were deletions of two bases at the same site zzso hotspot zzso whereas the respective figures were zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Other zzso observed in the TNT treatment were complex zzso consisting of either a zzso hotspot deletion and a base zzso or a zzso addition and base substitution at the stop zzso In addition, different kinds of deletions were recovered in the spontaneous zzso The elevated zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso resulting in enhanced zzso of zzso did not seem to have an effect on the spectrum of zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso which also have a higher spontaneous zzso yield than the parental strain zzso seemed to differ from zzso in their spontaneous zzso The increase consisted of zzso containing the zzso hotspot zzso possibly indicating elevated zzso of zzso or zzso zzso by the higher zzso activities of the zzso zzso
