zzso zzso is a zzso agent of zzso media in children and lower respiratory tract infections in adults suffering from chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso This strict human pathogen continues to be a significant cause of disease in this broad spectrum of patients because there is no available zzso Although numerous putative vaccine zzso have been zzso little is known about the human immune response to zzso zzso infection in zzso Human serum zzso are directed at a number of surface zzso and zzso zzso and zzso LOS may be an effective zzso in zzso In this study, we used a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the three major zzso zzso zzso together with a complete series of truncated LOS zzso to detect the development of new zzso to specific regions of the zzso zzso We compared serum samples from COPD patients who had recently cleared an zzso zzso infection to serum samples collected prior to their zzso zzso in the zzso response to LOS was observed, as some patients developed zzso zzso others developed zzso to the LOS of each zzso others developed broadly zzso zzso and some did not develop new zzso These newly developed human zzso are directed at both side chains and core structures in the LOS zzso This zzso zzso can be used to dissect the human zzso response to both internal and external zzso zzso thus providing a better understanding of the zzso immune response to zzso zzso LOS zzso developed during natural zzso
