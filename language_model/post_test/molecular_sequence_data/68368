A model based on the solution of the zzso potential for a geometry of three zzso regions associated with a zzso A channel zzso is zzso The model includes a zzso zzso layer to represent the zzso backbone and zzso rings to account for zzso side zzso Image potential and zzso contributions for different zzso and positions along the channel are zzso The zzso of zzso and two zzso obtained by substituting the zzso acid at position 1 are zzso The zzso simulation reproduces experimental results zzso et zzso 1986, zzso J 49, zzso and supports the idea that zzso zzso interactions are of primary importance in zzso channel zzso
