zzso in zzso cells is characterized by the continuous and regulated formation of prolific numbers of membrane zzso at the plasma zzso These zzso come in several different zzso ranging from the zzso formation of zzso involved in particle zzso to smaller zzso zzso responsible for the zzso of zzso fluid and zzso zzso In general, each of these zzso types results in the delivery of their contents to zzso for zzso The membrane components of zzso zzso on the other hand, are subject to a series of highly complex and zzso molecular sorting events resulting in their targeting to specific zzso In recent years, much has been learned about the function of the zzso zzso and the mechanisms responsible for the molecular sorting of proteins and zzso This review attempts to integrate these new concepts with long-established views of zzso to present a more coherent picture of how the zzso zzso is organized and how the zzso transport of zzso membrane components is zzso Of particular importance are emerging concepts concerning the zzso signals responsible for molecular sorting and the zzso complexes responsible for the decoding of these zzso
