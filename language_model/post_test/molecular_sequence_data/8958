zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso is a potent survival factor for many cell types, and its expression is widespread both within and outside of the nervous zzso The regulation of zzso expression has been extensively investigated but is not fully zzso 

Using a zzso reporter zzso we identified the role of the zzso region zzso of the mouse zzso gene in the regulation of gene zzso We focused on a zzso A- and zzso region zzso 200 zzso in zzso which is located approximately 1000 zzso downstream of the stop zzso in zzso 4 of the gene and contains three typical zzso elements zzso zzso Interestingly, these zzso are well zzso in several zzso zzso By testing reporter zzso containing various regions and lengths of the zzso fused to the end of the zzso zzso we demonstrated that the zzso decrease in zzso activity zzso with the zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that several regions around the zzso in the zzso suppressed the zzso zzso Moreover, the expression level of the zzso protein was negligible in zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso expression zzso 

Our study is the first characterization of the possible role of zzso and other zzso regions in the zzso in regulating the amounts of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
