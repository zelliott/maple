We examined zzso zzso concerted evolution in an zzso zzso zzso hybrid zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso We show that the zzso zzso genes are organized as dispersed zzso zzso zzso gene sequences revealed two zzso exhibiting zzso sequence zzso with zzso forming zzso pairs that maintain secondary structure and presumably zzso zzso sequence patterns are not fully consistent with either concerted or classical zzso The zzso zzso genes are zzso with the zzso arranged zzso zzso despite residing outside the zzso zzso We also examined zzso concerted zzso zzso has zzso sequence from only one zzso and contains multiple zzso zzso Using zzso zzso genes as zzso zzso we propose that zzso homogenization has replaced all zzso zzso sequence with zzso sequence in the zzso This zzso homogenization appears to have been rapid and efficient and is the first demonstration of hybrid zzso homogenization in the zzso
