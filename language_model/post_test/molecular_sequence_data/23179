zzso factors of the Fox zzso head zzso family are involved in cellular zzso and determination zzso Here, we report on the isolation and first zzso of two members of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso These sequences exhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso identity to their mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso upon insulin zzso are zzso zzso from frogs to zzso zzso and zzso genes are zzso zzso but transcripts disappear during early zzso zzso zzso zzso of both genes starts at the late zzso stages and transcripts accumulate at the end of zzso While maternal transcripts of both genes are found within the animal half of the early zzso zzso transcripts show distinct zzso zzso expression is observed in the zzso within head zzso in front of the eye, within the zzso arches and in the liver zzso At the late zzso zzso is found to be specifically expressed in the anterior neural plate and in neural crest zzso Later, expression of zzso is observed in a variety of zzso and zzso like the head, the zzso arches and the zzso
