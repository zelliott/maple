The previous notion that the zzso acid side chain at position 104 of zzso is involved in the binding of the side chain at position zzso of the zzso has been zzso The zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso 309 has been replaced by Ala, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso It is shown that the zzso specificity of this zzso is not determined solely by the zzso acid zzso occupying position 104, as the zzso exhibits a marked preference for aromatic groups in zzso regardless of the nature of the zzso zzso With zzso zzso acid zzso at this position, no involvement is seen in binding of either zzso or zzso zzso acid zzso at position zzso of the zzso The zzso with zzso in zzso is an exception, as the preference for this zzso is increased dramatically by introduction of an zzso zzso at position 104 in the zzso presumably due to a zzso zzso zzso However, when position 104 is occupied by zzso zzso it is highly involved in binding of zzso zzso acid zzso either by increasing the zzso of zzso or by determining the size of the zzso The results suggest that the zzso acid zzso at position 104 is mobile such that it is positioned in the zzso binding site only when it can interact zzso with the zzso side chain at position zzso
