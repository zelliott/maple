The zzso zzso comprises the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which convert zzso to zzso via zzso zzso of zzso within the cell has been suggested to contribute to the progression of secondary complications of zzso High levels of zzso accumulate within the cell due to inadequate regulation of blood zzso zzso It has also been suggested that zzso in either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso genes might contribute to zzso zzso The human zzso zzso gene zzso has been described previously and a range of putative zzso zzso were zzso Further analysis of human zzso zzso artificial zzso clones has now shown that there is a second zzso sequence in man, which is extremely similar in sequence to zzso itself and which also maps to zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis suggests that this zzso gene cannot be expressed as a full-length zzso zzso zzso However, knowledge of the presence of this highly similar sequence in the human zzso is essential to ensure that sequence variations identified during genetic analysis of zzso are not attributed to zzso within that gene zzso
