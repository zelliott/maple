The alpha zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been characterized to investigate its role in zzso regulation in one of the few known zzso zzso zzso The highly zzso zzso shares zzso similarity with its zzso coli analogue zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene coding the alpha zzso does not complement the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso show similar folding patterns as determined by circular zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso promoter region (probably to a zzso and zzso appears to be crucial for DNA zzso The zzso protein is also able to interact with zzso regulatory zzso like zzso from zzso zzso or zzso from zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso alpha zzso might play a crucial role in the zzso of gene expression in zzso
