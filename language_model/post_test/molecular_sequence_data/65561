In our previous work, we identified 94 putative genes zzso zzso zzso regulators from zzso zzso All of these putative zzso genes were zzso using zzso insertions to determine their zzso Six zzso regulators, zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed similar zzso acid sequences zzso and shared the zzso zzso domain with zzso zzso or zzso zzso analysis of these gene zzso indicated that the regulators control the swimming behaviors of the bacteria, production of zzso signals, and zzso of zzso zzso These characteristics are very similar to those of zzso zzso and zzso Thus, we refer to this group as the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that a great number of zzso genes of the zzso zzso were distributed in the zzso zzso and gamma subdivisions of zzso and a few in zzso These findings could provide new clues to the roles of the zzso gene zzso
