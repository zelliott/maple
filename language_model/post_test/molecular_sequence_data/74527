zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso catalyzing the conversion of zzso to zzso and CO2 The zzso found in zzso and bacteria belong to functionally diverse protein zzso known as the zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso However, most bacterial zzso are localized in the zzso and may be involved in energy zzso In zzso zzso zzso a locus for a putative zzso zzso is zzso In the study reported here, an zzso was zzso in zzso coli and showed zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a signal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso into the zzso that was supported by expression of zzso and full-length versions of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso Further zzso zzso experiment demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is most likely zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso
