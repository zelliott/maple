The zzso zzso zzso locus was isolated by zzso zzso zzso in a screen for zzso affecting eye zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso and the putative expression pattern of the zzso gene suggested that it has multiple zzso zzso in the zzso gene lead to irregular spacing of zzso an increase in the number of zzso cells, as well as abnormal zzso projections to the zzso and disrupted structure of the zzso zzso in the adult zzso The zzso zzso also causes abnormal head zzso a change in a number of zzso in the zzso complex in the embryonic stage and abnormal zzso of the zzso zzso and wings in later zzso We examined the zzso expression of the zzso gene during development by zzso zzso for zzso expression from zzso trap elements inserted within the zzso zzso During zzso expression of zzso showed a zzso pattern in the zzso and in the nervous zzso In the eye zzso discs, zzso was expressed in zzso cells beginning a few rows zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso was also expressed in the wing zzso In the adult, zzso was expressed in the zzso and zzso We cloned the zzso gene by zzso tagging and found that it encodes a putative zzso protein containing a zzso region similar to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso On the basis of the loss of functional zzso the expression pattern and the predicted structure of its product, we propose that zzso encodes a zzso protein acting as a signal involved in lateral zzso within the developing nervous system and also as a factor involved either directly or indirectly in zzso guidance and zzso lobe zzso
