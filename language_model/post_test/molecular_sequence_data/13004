zzso a protein zzso found in zzso cells, presents a challenging problem in zzso protein expression because it is both zzso and zzso zzso In this paper, we describe the cloning of both zzso zzso A and regulatory zzso of zzso from a human zzso library and their expression at high levels in zzso zzso The zzso A zzso is expressed as an zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso while the zzso B zzso is soluble upon direct zzso zzso active zzso is derived from the separately expressed zzso using a three-step zzso zzso First, the fusion protein is zzso then it is zzso at the fusion junction with zzso and, finally, a zzso competent zzso zzso zzso complex is zzso by zzso the separately zzso zzso In addition, we show that a similar zzso protocol can be applied to a zzso truncated form of zzso A, which lacks an zzso and zzso zzso
