zzso in zzso and zzso and its bacterial zzso zzso is the only zzso factor zzso in all three zzso of life and plays many key roles in zzso regulation and in recruiting other factors to the zzso zzso zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of zzso as well as the structure of zzso zzso complex using zzso zzso reconstruction and single particle zzso The zzso binds in the middle of zzso zzso claw and encloses the DNA, reminiscent of the DNA zzso clamp and ring zzso The zzso zzso complex model reveals that the zzso is an upstream DNA holder and contacts the zzso DNA in the zzso zzso These structures reveal that the cellular zzso zzso also use a strategy of zzso DNA to enhance its zzso as commonly observed for many zzso acid processing zzso including DNA zzso and zzso
