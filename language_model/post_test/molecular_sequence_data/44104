zzso has been implicated in the invasive process of zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso zzso To identify zzso zzso related zzso we used a method termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to walk through a large zzso gene zzso The major advantage of this approach over other zzso walking methods is that it employs a secondary zzso amplification of cloned fragments which can be readily zzso and zzso Starting with a primer specific to zzso we identified and zzso 14 open reading frames zzso spanning 11 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso The genes identified include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Twelve of the deduced proteins shared extensive zzso with zzso proteins from other zzso The gene products and order of genes within this cluster are most similar to those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso One of the unique genes identified, zzso demonstrated zzso to an zzso from the same zzso of zzso Another ORF, zzso showed similarity to genes from both zzso and zzso zzso and primer extension analysis revealed that this gene cluster is transcribed as a single unit indicating that it is part of a large zzso zzso spanning more than 21 zzso zzso to zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reacted with proteins of the predicted molecular weights in cell zzso of zzso The results suggest that the zzso system is highly zzso in evolution and thus underscore the importance of zzso in bacterial survival and zzso
