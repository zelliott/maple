zzso zzso can selectively inhibit the expression of individual genes and thus have potential applications in zzso and zzso zzso A critical prerequisite to their use as therapeutic agents is the understanding of their zzso interactions with biological structures, zzso zzso In this study we examined the interactions of zzso zzso zzso with several zzso The zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso were used independently as competitors of the binding of a probe, zzso zzso bearing a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso These zzso were also used as competitors of the binding of a zzso probe zzso zzso zzso to zzso The average values of and quantitative estimates for the zzso of competition and the constant of competition zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of several zzso and zzso zzso were determined and zzso Surprisingly, in the proteins we zzso the values of zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso were essentially zzso Thus, the ability of the zzso zzso we zzso to bind to the proteins studied in this work, is virtually independent of zzso Our results also imply that the role of the zzso and zzso bases in zzso zzso as well as the nature of the contact points zzso versus zzso between the zzso and the zzso may be relatively zzso
