Box zzso small zzso and zzso body zzso particles comprise the most complex zzso zzso and are essential for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso mechanism remains only partially zzso Here we report a crystal structure at zzso A of a zzso functional zzso zzso containing three of the four zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a box zzso zzso that reveals detailed information about the zzso active zzso The zzso zzso containing zzso at the modification position, is fully zzso and zzso rearranged by the zzso in a manner similar to that seen in two zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis provides a mechanism for plasticity in the diversity of guide zzso sequences used and identifies a zzso loop of zzso that also interacts with zzso in zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso proteins and zzso support the structural findings and further suggest a role of the zzso loop in regulation of zzso zzso
