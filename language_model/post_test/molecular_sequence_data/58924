We identified a 50-year-old Japanese woman with a novel zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene causing zzso zzso zzso zzso The patient had extremely low HDL cholesterol and zzso zzso levels zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but no evidence of coronary heart zzso However, she had bilateral zzso of the Achilles tendon, elbow, and knee joint as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of serum followed by zzso revealed that the patient's zzso zzso had a lower molecular weight zzso than normal zzso zzso A partial gene zzso encompassing 23 zzso was found by DNA sequence analysis, resulting in a tandem repeat of bases zzso to zzso from the zzso end of zzso zzso This tandem repeat caused a zzso zzso with premature termination after zzso acid zzso The zzso gives rise to a predicted protein sequence that contains two zzso We designated this zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso formed zzso with zzso zzso and zzso E in the patient's plasma and was associated with both the zzso zzso and HDL zzso The patient's cholesterol zzso rate and zzso zzso activity were reduced to about zzso of normal, although specific zzso activity was zzso suggesting that it remained functionally zzso In addition, zzso zzso transfer activity was reduced to about half of zzso Thus, zzso zzso was associated with complex zzso of zzso zzso
