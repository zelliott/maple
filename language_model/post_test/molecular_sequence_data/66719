zzso zzso box zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso bind three core proteins in sequential order at both terminal box zzso and internal zzso motifs to assemble two zzso protein zzso complexes active in guiding zzso zzso zzso have investigated the process of box zzso zzso assembly and the zzso changes in zzso structure or zzso as a consequence of zzso core protein zzso zzso assembly of the zzso zzso zzso box zzso zzso is a zzso process with binding of zzso and zzso core proteins to the zzso requiring elevated temperature to facilitate necessary zzso structural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed an increased order and stability of zzso folded structure as a result of zzso zzso zzso binding of the zzso and zzso core proteins to the zzso complex further remodeled zzso zzso Assessment of zzso guide region accessibility using complementary zzso zzso zzso revealed significant changes in guide region structure during zzso zzso A second zzso box zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso also exhibited zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso although core protein binding was affected by zzso distinct folded zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso followed an alternative assembly pathway, with both guide regions being continuously exposed during zzso zzso Further experiments using zzso zzso possessing alternative guide regions demonstrated that zzso folded structure induced by specific guide sequences impacted the zzso assembly zzso Nevertheless, assembled zzso were active for zzso zzso independent of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso appears to be a common and requisite feature of zzso zzso box zzso zzso assembly and formation of the mature zzso can follow different assembly pathways in generating zzso active zzso
