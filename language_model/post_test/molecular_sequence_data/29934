Several point zzso in the zzso virus 40 zzso zzso zzso have been analyzed for their effects on protein stability, zzso zzso and binding of two cellular zzso All zzso which affected zzso zzso in two zzso clusters produced highly unstable zzso zzso Four point zzso outside these clusters and one zzso deletion zzso zzso produced stable proteins but reduced transformation zzso These were able to zzso the zzso promoter and bind the cellular zzso suggesting that these activities are not sufficient for zzso enhancement of zzso
