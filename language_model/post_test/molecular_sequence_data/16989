There has been increasing interest and efforts devoted to developing zzso technologies for identifying zzso particularly in the zzso zzso In this study, a universal set of short 12- and zzso zzso zzso was derived independently of a zzso zzso sequence information and used to generate unique zzso zzso zzso zzso The probe set sequences were zzso generated to be zzso distant in sequence space and not dependent on the sequence of any particular zzso The probe set is universally zzso because it is unbiased and independent of zzso predictions based upon simplified assumptions regarding zzso duplex formation from linear sequence zzso Tests were conducted on zzso containing zzso unique zzso zzso using an in zzso zzso synthesis zzso The zzso DNA zzso intensity patterns zzso differentiated various organisms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pneumonia, zzso zzso and Homo zzso including the correct identification of a blinded zzso zzso zzso of this method include not only pathological and forensic zzso identification in medicine and basic science, but also potentially a novel method for the discovery of unknown targets and associations inherent in dynamic zzso acid populations such as represented by differential gene zzso
