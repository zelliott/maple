Typical programmed cell death zzso requires de zzso zzso synthesis and shares common zzso changes referred to as zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso we isolated zzso clones that are induced in differentiated zzso cells deprived of zzso by differential display zzso Among such zzso zzso searches revealed that the one clone encodes the rat zzso factor zzso a component of zzso and a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Northern analysis of various zzso in human showed one band in heart, brain, skeletal muscle and zzso whose size is approximately zzso zzso which identical to that of human zzso zzso although the size of rat human zzso zzso is approximately zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the rat zzso was zzso identical to that of the human zzso Northern analysis of various zzso in adult mice showed that expression levels of zzso zzso were strong in heart but weak in zzso although this gene is zzso zzso
