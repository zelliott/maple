External guide sequences zzso are zzso that consist of a sequence that is complementary to a target zzso and recruit zzso zzso P for specific degradation of the target zzso Recent studies indicate that increasing the targeting activity of zzso in directing human zzso P to cleave an zzso in zzso can lead to better zzso of the zzso in inducing zzso zzso zzso of the expression of the target zzso in cultured zzso This chapter will describe the procedure for the generation of highly functional zzso by in zzso zzso We also describe protocols for in zzso evaluation of the activity of the zzso These methods should provide general guidelines for using in zzso selection for generating highly active zzso for zzso zzso
