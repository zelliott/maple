zzso zzso that are strong T cell zzso represent potential candidates for vaccines against pathogens susceptible to T zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso of zzso extracts contain components that are major T cell zzso in natural zzso infections in humans and might contribute to the induction of human protective immunity against this zzso In the present study, we report on the molecular cloning and on the zzso characterization of the active components of these zzso The screening of a zzso zzso expression library with zzso raised against the zzso allowed the cloning of a zzso that zzso to a zzso zzso of zzso and adult zzso This zzso contains an open reading frame of 267 base pairs zzso which encodes a zzso zzso The analysis of the zzso sequence revealed zzso zzso with the sequences of previously reported proteins of unknown zzso The native molecules in the active zzso were analyzed by mass zzso after additional zzso by reverse phase zzso liquid zzso zzso This procedure revealed two components in the zzso of molecular mass zzso zzso 2 Da and zzso zzso 9 zzso Both zzso zzso immune T cells and yielded zzso peptides whose sequences matched the sequence of the cloned zzso These two zzso probably zzso to different zzso modified forms of the zzso zzso by the cloned zzso
