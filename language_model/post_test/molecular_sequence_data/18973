The goal of this study was to improve the development of bovine zzso nuclear transfer zzso zzso by zzso the combination of DNA zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso design of different drug combinations zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 0, 5, zzso and zzso zzso was used to identify an optimal combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso that improved the zzso competence of bovine zzso zzso Further experiments using this combination revealed that zzso levels of zzso islands near zzso 1 of the zzso gene zzso the zzso gene zzso and zzso imprinted genes zzso and zzso as well as zzso genes zzso and zzso were returned to levels similar to those of in zzso zzso zzso zzso after treatment, which also zzso transcript levels for these zzso This combination also returned global DNA zzso to a normal level, correcting zzso levels while enhancing zzso zzso Thus, the combined application of zzso zzso and zzso zzso can significantly improve the zzso of bovine zzso zzso by stabilizing how zzso zzso their zzso
