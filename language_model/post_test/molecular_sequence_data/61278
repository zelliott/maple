To facilitate structural studies of the zzso binding region from the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have developed methods for the high-level expression and zzso of an important functional portion of the zzso zzso domain zzso of the zzso Two soluble zzso fragments zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso which contains a zzso tag, and zzso which includes the first zzso region, zzso of the zzso Both proteins demonstrate zzso zzso zzso zzso binding with an apparent equilibrium zzso (3 zzso that is comparable to the affinities reported for preparations zzso the entire zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso required for zzso recognition of the zzso are entirely specified by zzso zzso The binding of small zzso was demonstrated in competition zzso with zzso yielding zzso values of 58 and 105 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso protein revealed considerable secondary zzso Furthermore, a zzso two-state folding transition was observed upon zzso zzso To circumvent zzso zzso of the zzso protein at the zzso zzso needed for zzso study, we zzso the zzso zzso domain to anchor the zzso zzso zzso onto zzso zzso zzso preparations of zzso in zzso zzso demonstrate zzso zzso binding and considerable secondary structure by zzso The structural features revealed in the CD profile appear to undergo a zzso two-state folding transition upon zzso zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso preparations of the zzso zzso are amenable to further high-resolution zzso zzso zzso
