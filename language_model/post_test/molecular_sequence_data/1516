zzso in zzso zzso involves coordination between zzso ring contraction and zzso formation and/or targeted membrane zzso We show that zzso a light chain for zzso zzso V zzso and zzso zzso is the essential light chain for zzso the only type II zzso in zzso zzso However, disruption or reduction of zzso interaction by deleting the zzso binding site on zzso or by a point zzso in zzso zzso did not cause any obvious zzso in zzso In contrast, a different point zzso zzso displayed defects in zzso and in interactions with zzso and zzso These data suggest that the major function of the zzso interaction is not to regulate zzso activity but that zzso may interact with zzso zzso and zzso to coordinate zzso ring formation and targeted membrane deposition during zzso We also identify zzso as the regulatory light chain for zzso and demonstrate its role in zzso ring zzso a function likely zzso among zzso
