The zzso protein is a central component of the zzso zzso machinery and of the zzso system in most zzso In performing these functions, it is involved in DNA repair processes and plays an important role in natural transformation zzso This may be especially important in zzso zzso where an unusually high degree of zzso among strains is generated by zzso zzso We have suggested previously that the zzso zzso zzso protein is subject to zzso modifications that result in a slight shift in its zzso zzso Here we show that at least two genes downstream of zzso are involved in this modification and that this process is dependent on genes involved in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of a putative zzso site results in production of an unmodified zzso zzso This zzso modification is not involved in membrane targeting or cell division functions but is necessary for the full function of zzso in DNA zzso Thus, it might be an adaptation to the specific requirements of zzso zzso in its natural zzso
