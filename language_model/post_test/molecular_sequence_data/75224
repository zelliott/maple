The cells in the zzso lens are zzso and metabolically coupled with each other by a network of gap zzso These are clusters of zzso channels by which the zzso cells situated deeper in the lens communicate through the zzso with the zzso zzso the source of nutrients for the zzso Hence gap junctions are important for lens zzso The gap junction proteins in the zzso lens have not yet been identified with zzso A putative zzso gap junction protein of relative molecular mass 26,000 zzso is not related to those from other zzso such as the liver zzso junction zzso Another lens membrane protein with Mr zzso zzso has also been localized in the lens zzso gap zzso Here we demonstrate by zzso sequence analysis that zzso and its in zzso form, zzso zzso zzso belong to a wider family of gap junction zzso With this new data on the zzso zzso between gap junction proteins now extend to zzso derived from all three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (heart) and zzso zzso
