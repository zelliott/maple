The high affinity zzso for human zzso zzso factor zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso and a common zzso zzso zzso that is shared with the zzso and -5 zzso We have previously identified a zzso active zzso point zzso of zzso zzso that can zzso factor independence on zzso zzso cells but not zzso or zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14, zzso This restricted activity suggested the involvement of cell zzso signaling molecules in the zzso of this zzso We report here that one such zzso is the mouse zzso zzso zzso since introduction of zzso but not zzso into zzso or zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso utilizing zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the species specificity lies in the zzso domain of zzso zzso the requirement for zzso correlated with the ability of zzso (but not zzso zzso to zzso associate with zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso cells also led to zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso surface zzso Taken together, these findings suggest a critical role for association with zzso in the zzso activity of zzso
