We have examined binding of the nuclear protein zzso to the human zzso zzso We find that zzso binds zzso to the more 3' of a pair of zzso motifs in the zzso zzso this paired motif is bound by the zzso factor zzso A naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso in the area bound by zzso results in zzso of zzso in adult red blood cells zzso and zzso of the zzso promoter in in zzso expression zzso zzso does not bind to this zzso zzso A survey of zzso motifs from other zzso zzso demonstrates zzso binding to most of zzso These findings zzso zzso in the zzso zzso we speculate that it may participate in the formation of zzso complexes that regulate zzso gene zzso
