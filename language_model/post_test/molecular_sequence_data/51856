A zzso DNA zzso cloned from zzso zzso the largest zzso zzso of four plasmids detected in zzso zzso was found to zzso resistance to zzso ring zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso revealed the presence of an zzso frame, the deduced product of which was identical to one of the two zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso The observation that a zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso is capable of zzso zzso resistance in the absence of the zzso region is of significance both to the evolution and functional activity of members of the zzso transport zzso zzso
