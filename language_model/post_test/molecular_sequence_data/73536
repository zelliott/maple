Based on parameters governing promoter activity and using regulatory elements of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso control sequences were composed which permit the regulation in zzso coli of several gene activities independently and zzso The novel promoter zzso allows the regulation of gene expression over an up to zzso range with zzso zzso whereas with zzso and zzso the activity of zzso may be controlled zzso zzso coli host strains which produce defined amounts of the regulatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso from zzso located expression units provide highly zzso in zzso zzso Controlling the expression of the genes zzso zzso the low abundance zzso protein zzso and restriction zzso zzso not only demonstrates that high levels of expression can be achieved but also suggests that under conditions of optimal repression only around one zzso every 3rd generation is zzso This potential of quantitative control will open up new approaches in the study of gene function in zzso in particular with low abundance regulatory gene zzso The system will also provide new opportunities for the controlled expression of zzso zzso
