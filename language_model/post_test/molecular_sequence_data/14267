The zzso zzso alcohol zzso is a major component of the aromatic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and serves as a valuable zzso material for the fragrance zzso Using zzso zzso zzso sequencing and zzso profiling of zzso zzso bark zzso we identified candidate zzso zzso sequences for full-length zzso cloning and functional zzso We discovered a zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso along with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all of which are members of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso formation of zzso proceeds via zzso and zzso at carbon zzso of a zzso zzso intermediate in the class II active site, followed by zzso of the zzso group and termination of the reaction sequence without further zzso in the class I active zzso This reaction mechanism is distinct from that of zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso type, which employ zzso reactions in the class II active site and secondary zzso in the class I active site, leading to zzso zzso Comparative zzso modeling suggested the active site zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as potentially important for the specificity of zzso As a class zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising target for zzso engineering of zzso zzso
