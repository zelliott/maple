In contrast to the extreme conservation of zzso zzso organization of the zzso zzso zzso gene family in zzso is highly dynamic and rapidly zzso While gene zzso and loss, gene zzso zzso and zzso have occurred sporadically in several zzso zzso little is known regarding the pattern of their zzso Comparisons of zzso zzso zzso at a generic level can be extremely helpful in investigating evolutionary patterns of variation, as intermediate stages of the process may be zzso Variation of zzso zzso organization among zzso clams provides good materials to investigate zzso zzso zzso We characterized the complete zzso zzso of the zzso zzso hard clam zzso zzso zzso zzso of four previously zzso zzso clams, and undertook an intensive comparison of zzso gene families in these zzso Our results 1) provide evidence that the commonly observed zzso of zzso may have occurred independently in different zzso lineages and, based on the higher degree of zzso gene zzso may have occurred more recently than zzso 2) suggest that zzso evolution may have played an important role in zzso gene family evolution based on frequent gene zzso and gene recruitment zzso and 3) reveal the first case of zzso zzso zzso gene recruitment zzso and present the first clear evidence that zzso allows rapid evolution of zzso We identify the zzso gene in zzso clams, previously considered missing in this zzso and speculate that zzso lacking the zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso may represent the ancestral zzso zzso analysis based on 13 zzso zzso genes provided opportunities to detect rapidly evolved zzso genes via zzso and gene zzso zzso This study suggests that evolution of the zzso zzso gene family in zzso is more complex than previously thought and that comparison of several zzso species is a useful strategy in investigating evolutionary patterns and dynamics of zzso zzso zzso
