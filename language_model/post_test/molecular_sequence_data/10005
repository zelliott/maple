zzso zzso and zzso consist of zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso In this report, we identify the minimum segment responsible for the zzso function of zzso After chemical analysis and zzso study of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso region between zzso and zzso we found a unique zzso sequence zzso in zzso in which the zzso zzso is identical with that of the zzso segment of a protein zzso by protein zzso zzso To zzso whether the zzso segment is essential for the zzso function, we created plasmids containing a series of zzso genes corresponding to the zzso sequence and expressed them in zzso zzso The zzso proteins were zzso and zzso for their zzso activity with zzso The zzso zzso in which the zzso in the zzso sequence was replaced by zzso showed zzso activity 10 times higher than that of the intact zzso However, neither zzso zzso nor zzso in which zzso was replaced by Y or A, respectively, showed zzso zzso The zzso segment was found to be deleted in zzso The zzso of zzso in which the zzso segment was inserted at the position that the segment is deleted, showed zzso zzso The boiled zzso zzso and zzso were strongly zzso with zzso in the presence of protein zzso A in a zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that the zzso segment zzso is the pivotal segment of zzso responsible for the zzso function of zzso zzso
