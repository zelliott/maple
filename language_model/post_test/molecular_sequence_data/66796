To investigate the system used by insects to recognize invading zzso we examined proteins from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso that bind to the cell surface of zzso Two zzso proteins that bound to the cell surfaces of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were shown to be zzso This protein bound to all 11 zzso zzso zzso bacteria, 3 zzso bacteria, and 3 zzso was consequently designated zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that it was a zzso zzso with two dissimilar zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso related to known insect zzso zzso zzso and zzso were prepared as zzso proteins and their binding properties were investigated using zzso zzso Each domain had zzso dissimilar binding zzso to zzso These properties enable zzso to bind to two sites on a zzso zzso zzso binding to many types of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso M, zzso zzso triggered the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso larvae in zzso and zzso recognized by zzso were surrounded by zzso zzso in zzso forming a zzso which is the typical cellular reaction in insect immune zzso These observations suggest that zzso functions as a trigger for the zzso reaction and that the zzso characteristic of zzso plays an important role in the early stages of infection by a variety of zzso
