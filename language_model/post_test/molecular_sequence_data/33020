Recent investigations clearly indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be incorporated into vegetables to obtain innovative zzso foods whose marketing has been authorized by the Italian Ministry of zzso In this study, strain zzso was characterized at a molecular level in order to define its zzso position and to develop a zzso test for zzso zzso zzso methods, such as zzso zzso gene sequencing and multiplex zzso have provided evidence that strain zzso indeed belongs to the zzso zzso zzso In addition, a cluster analysis of fluorescent amplified zzso length zzso zzso data strongly indicated that strain zzso and nine other zzso zzso strains (including strain zzso zzso belong to the same species and are definitely differentiated from the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso technique was also used to identify a zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso - zzso an zzso acid sequence similar to a zzso of zzso strain zzso zzso zzso - which enabled us to develop a rapid zzso test for zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso test was assessed by comparison with a total of 73 bacterial strains mainly isolated from vegetable products that did not produce any amplified zzso These strains belonged to the zzso zzso species, to 6 additional species of zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A method similar to the one used in this study can be adopted to develop easy, rapid detection techniques for monitoring other bacteria in complex zzso
