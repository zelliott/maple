zzso zzso strain zzso produces an zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso site in an zzso zzso were identified, and 21 genes zzso were predicted to participate in zzso synthesis on the basis of the features of the primary zzso Gene disruption analyses revealed that zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso are not zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso with zzso zzso length zzso and zzso zzso zzso of group 1 zzso zzso coli, suggesting that zzso was zzso via a zzso zzso zzso This possibility was supported by the fact that the putative zzso profiles of zzso and zzso were similar to those of zzso and zzso which are also involved in the flipping of the repeating unit in the zzso membrane and the zzso of the capsule in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are probably zzso involved in the synthesis of the repeating unit onto the zzso zzso In particular, zzso appeared to zzso the initial transfer of the zzso zzso On the basis of their predicted location in the cells, it is proposed that zzso and zzso are involved in zzso export to the cell zzso zzso coli strains expressing zzso zzso and zzso showed enhanced activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, revealing that they were responsible for the production of the activated compositional zzso of zzso zzso contains a zzso a zzso zzso zzso indicating that it could participate in the degradation of zzso zzso and zzso which have zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were deduced to be zzso zzso In particular, zzso seems to positively regulate the zzso of zzso synthesis zzso since the zzso expression of zzso in strain zzso increased the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso showed zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso the folding of proteins following zzso across the zzso zzso
