zzso zzso zzso localized in the zzso of zzso zzso was partially zzso The zzso is specific for zzso and is similar in most of its zzso properties to zzso zzso from other zzso Its sensitivity to zzso acid is similar to levels observed in zzso from zzso and two orders of magnitude lower than those observed for zzso zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso was derived from the zzso sequence of the zzso protein and the deduced sequence of a zzso zzso It showed great similarity to other zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso displayed a zzso zzso The overall sequence was more similar to zzso sequences than to zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso trees obtained with distance zzso and zzso methods zzso zzso zzso clustered with its zzso zzso zzso of other zzso zzso belonging to early branches of the zzso lineage zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso unpublished data in zzso showed typical zzso signatures and clustered with other zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso occupies an anomalous position, possibly due to horizontal gene transfer from a zzso
