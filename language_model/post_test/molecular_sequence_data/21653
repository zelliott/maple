zzso zzso which causes zzso zzso attacks a wide range of plant zzso To understand the infection process, the role of a putative zzso regulator, zzso zzso 1), in zzso was zzso This zzso regulator shows similarity to the zzso switch regulators zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso and zzso studies revealed that zzso is required for zzso The zzso zzso is able to penetrate plant tissue but is not able to cause zzso zzso In addition, the zzso is blocked in zzso formation and does not produce zzso levels of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Based on transcript expression levels, it can be concluded that zzso is a downstream target of two zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso
