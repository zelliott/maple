The zzso has served as a model zzso for zzso zzso zzso its zzso has expanded zzso research into physiology and zzso zzso Several zzso pharmaceuticals are in development, but expression of zzso receptors and zzso remains unknown in this zzso We conducted a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso using 17 human zzso genes as a reference zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in filtered zzso searches as zzso best zzso zzso was confirmed by three in zzso zzso zzso testing, zzso analysis, and functional zzso zzso expressed zzso of zzso zzso 1, transient zzso potential channel zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso D, zzso zzso protein 4, and zzso zzso alpha and zzso and paired zzso of zzso zzso 2, fatty acid zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, and transient zzso potential zzso channel zzso zzso zzso mapping suggested the zzso of transient zzso potential zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso gamma lack specific zzso acids critical for zzso zzso zzso No zzso of zzso acid zzso or protein zzso zzso zzso type 22 were zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso expresses a shifted repertoire of zzso zzso In zzso analyses are warranted before using zzso for zzso development zzso
