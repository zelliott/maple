To determine the extent of zzso chain diversity in the zzso repertoire early in development, zzso zzso libraries were analyzed from zzso old fetal zzso zzso fetal liver, and zzso old bone zzso An anchored zzso chain reaction approach was used to avoid bias for particular V zzso zzso From the sequence analysis of 27 bone zzso zzso 10 different families and 20 unique V zzso genes were zzso In contrast, the V zzso expression in the fetus is highly restricted and clearly differs from the broader distribution see in zzso bone zzso Although several V zzso families were represented in the fetal library including V zzso 9, V zzso 10, V zzso zzso V zzso 8, and V zzso 1, one or two members of individual families were observed zzso The fetal liver and zzso libraries were found to be largely zzso Given the V zzso zzso identified in the fetal zzso the mechanism of zzso zzso in the early repertoire appears to occur predominantly by zzso zzso the fetal repertoire was further restricted by dominant V zzso zzso combinations such as V zzso zzso zzso 5, V zzso zzso zzso 4, and V zzso zzso zzso zzso Since in some cases independent zzso could be established, the results indicate a bias for particular V zzso zzso zzso The results also suggest that zzso zzso in the fetal repertoire takes place after light chain zzso as opposed to at the zzso cell level in the bone zzso The restriction observed in zzso light chain expression together with known restrictions in gene usage and zzso diversity at the heavy chain level indicate a remarkably zzso fetal zzso
