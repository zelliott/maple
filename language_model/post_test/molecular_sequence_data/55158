zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso field soil sample by selecting zzso from one-fifth strength modified zzso zzso medium after a long incubation zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that the strain is related to members of the zzso zzso (formerly called candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso strictly zzso zzso and zzso It only grows in low zzso zzso The major respiratory zzso are zzso zzso and zzso and the main fatty acids are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso content is zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequences in public databases belonging to the zzso zzso were clustered here into 6 zzso Five of these groups constituted a coherent cluster distinct from the sequences of other zzso in zzso trees that were constructed using zzso sequences from 49 different zzso On the basis of zzso zzso zzso it is proposed that strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso should be placed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the cultured representative of the zzso zzso zzso corresponding with Group 4 of the zzso zzso
