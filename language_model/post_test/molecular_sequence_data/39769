The complete zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso named zzso isolated from the zzso of a Chinese snake zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso The zzso zzso was composed of 236 zzso acid zzso and zzso the zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso The zzso had four sites of zzso zzso at 81, 99, 148 and zzso and contained zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence exhibited considerable similarities with other zzso zzso isolated from the snake zzso of the zzso zzso However, the zzso characteristics of zzso distinct from that of zzso and the other zzso from the zzso of zzso family may be derived from the structural difference of the sequence in the functional regions, especially corresponding to zzso zzso 1, 2 and zzso zzso
