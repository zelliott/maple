The alpha zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso by multiple genes that display zzso and zzso zzso The alpha 1 zzso gene is expressed predominantly in the adult brain stem and spinal cord, whereas the alpha 2 zzso gene is expressed in fetal brain and spinal zzso We wished to determine the zzso organization of the human alpha 2 zzso gene as well as to define the zzso ends of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso zzso Gene structure can be defined rapidly from zzso artificial zzso zzso DNA sources by the use of zzso zzso chain reaction zzso However, zzso frequently contain small deletions that complicate the determination of the complete zzso structure of a zzso and this often zzso the isolation of additional zzso In this study we have used zzso zzso from zzso DNA to define zzso of the zzso zzso alpha 2 zzso zzso To define those zzso that were absent in the isolated zzso we used zzso zzso on zzso DNA, using zzso zzso to obtain specificity in the zzso zzso The alpha 2 zzso gene was found to contain nine zzso varying in size from 68 zzso zzso 3A and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso All of the zzso boundary sequences conform to consensus zzso donor and zzso zzso In addition, we have defined the zzso end of this gene as well as that of the alpha 1 zzso gene by zzso The structures of the alpha zzso zzso zzso genes in humans are very similar to each other and to the alpha zzso genes in zzso
