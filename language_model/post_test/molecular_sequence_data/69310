A zzso zzso donor compound, zzso is formed from zzso and zzso by zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso that is essential for zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is located in a zzso segment near the N zzso of the zzso The possibility that this zzso sequence zzso defines the zzso site of the zzso as does a zzso zzso or zzso binding sequence zzso found in several other zzso was tested by zzso zzso Thus zzso and zzso were changed to zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso to zzso or zzso zzso activity was markedly decreased by zzso of zzso to zzso and abolished by zzso of zzso to zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso did not substantially alter the zzso zzso and zzso values, whereas the zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase in the zzso zzso value compared with that of the wild zzso zzso binding properties of the zzso zzso were determined using zzso or zzso and gel zzso zzso labeling of the proteins with zzso showed that all zzso zzso could be labeled with the zzso analog except those in which zzso or zzso were replaced with zzso
