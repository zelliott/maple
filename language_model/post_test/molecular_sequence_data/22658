The zzso zzso particle of human zzso type 3, composed of the viral zzso base and fiber zzso shares an important characteristic of the entire zzso it can attach to cells and penetrate zzso zzso determination of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso to 9 zzso resolution reveals tightly bound zzso zzso with only minimal zzso between zzso bases stabilizing the fragile zzso The internal cavity of the zzso is approximately 80 zzso in diameter, and the interior surface is accessible to zzso through zzso of approximately 20 zzso diameter between the zzso zzso We observe weak density beneath zzso that we attribute to a zzso base zzso including zzso zzso The intact zzso domain appears to interfere with zzso interactions and its absence by zzso or zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso between the 9 zzso zzso structure and the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso model correlate closely with differences in zzso The zzso structure of the zzso including fibers at 16 zzso resolution reveals extra density on the top of the zzso base that can be attributed to the fiber N zzso The fiber itself exhibits zzso that correlate with features of the atomic structure of the partial zzso fiber and that represent a repeat motif present in the zzso acid zzso These new observations offer important insights into particle assembly and stability, as well as the practicality of using the zzso in targeted drug zzso The structural work provides a sound basis for manipulating the properties of this particle and thereby enhancing its value for such therapeutic zzso
