Researchers have described zzso water channels from diverse zzso and zzso species but not from the third division of life, zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso under zzso conditions at 65 degrees zzso After transfer to zzso media, zzso zzso sustained zzso shrinkage that could be prevented with zzso We amplified zzso by zzso from zzso zzso zzso Like known zzso the open reading frame of zzso encodes two tandem repeats each containing three zzso zzso and a zzso loop with the signature motif zzso zzso Unlike other known zzso the putative zzso zzso was found zzso to the first zzso motif in zzso rather than the zzso Moreover, zzso acids distinguishing zzso zzso from zzso zzso were not zzso in zzso A fusion zzso zzso was expressed and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso was shown by zzso light scattering zzso to have elevated zzso water zzso zzso zzso 57 zzso zzso zzso versus 12 zzso zzso zzso of control zzso that was zzso inhibited with zzso zzso initial zzso zzso was also zzso zzso remained functional after zzso at temperatures above 80 degrees C and formed zzso zzso Our studies of zzso zzso demonstrate the ubiquity of zzso in nature and provide new insight into protein structure and transport zzso
