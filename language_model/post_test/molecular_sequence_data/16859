We have identified and analyzed the zzso sequence of 20 new zzso peptides from 11 Australian zzso species of zzso and from an zzso zzso zzso The sequence was amplified by reverse zzso zzso with a zzso primer designed from zzso an zzso zzso previously characterized from the zzso zzso zzso All 20 genes show high sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso and have duplicated repeatedly during the radiation of zzso zzso of the relative fixation rates of synonymous zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso indicates that the zzso zzso are positively zzso This positive selection appears to drive a decrease in zzso zzso In termites with two zzso the decrease in charge is predominantly restricted to one zzso Furthermore, the spread of charge is significantly greater within species than across species among zzso acid sites that appear to be under strong positive selection and this spread is attributable to only three zzso Our results suggest that after zzso duplication, certain critical sites have maintained a positive charge in one duplicate and evolved towards neutrality in the other and that positive selection has directed these changes repeatedly and zzso This diversification among duplicated genes may be a zzso to the evolution of zzso resistance in social insects that are particularly vulnerable to zzso zzso
