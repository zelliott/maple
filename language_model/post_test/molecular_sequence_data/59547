zzso zzso an zzso zzso is a component of the zzso zzso To investigate potential functions of the zzso we used transient zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso We observed that the zzso zzso formed zzso structures that were significantly longer and more variable in length than those observed in the native zzso zzso The zzso filaments were distinct from conventional zzso in zzso composition and pharmacology as demonstrated by the absence of zzso of these filaments with an zzso zzso by resistance to treatment with the drug zzso D, and by the inability to bind zzso We examined the zzso cells for evidence of specific associations of the novel zzso filaments with cellular zzso or zzso zzso Using zzso we observed the zzso of zzso marker proteins with the zzso zzso Additional zzso analysis using zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso I zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso with the zzso filaments in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was present in zzso cellular zzso was zzso from rat brain zzso using zzso to zzso zzso and was zzso with zzso using affinity zzso zzso and affinity zzso also revealed that zzso is not a bona fide component of zzso Our results indicate that zzso is associated with the zzso zzso We suggest a model in which zzso associates with the zzso through an interaction between the zzso filament of the zzso complex and a zzso zzso zzso
