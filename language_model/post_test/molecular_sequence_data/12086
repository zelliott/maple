A detailed restriction map of the zzso zzso 1 locus zzso transforming growth factor beta 1) was established and the precise zzso sequences of its seven zzso and corresponding zzso were zzso While the zzso ranged in size from 78 to zzso zzso the zzso ranged from about 1 to zzso zzso The zzso segment contains many putative regulatory motifs which may dictate zzso 1 gene zzso in response to varied zzso zzso
