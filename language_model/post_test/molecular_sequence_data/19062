Multiple sclerosis zzso is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system zzso and is characterized by the destruction of zzso and zzso leading to progressive zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso possess promising zzso potential for treating zzso however, their instability and poor zzso is a major impediment for their use zzso To overcome this problem, we used molecular zzso to incorporate zzso sequences from the zzso zzso onto a zzso which is a zzso zzso scaffold that has been shown to be zzso zzso Using this approach, we designed novel zzso peptides that retained the structure and stability of the parent zzso One of the grafted zzso zzso displayed potent ability to prevent disease development in a mouse model of zzso These results demonstrate the potential of zzso zzso peptides for the treatment of zzso
