The zzso pathway, which is zzso in response to zzso treatments with zzso zzso plays a critical role in inducing long-term zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso We characterized the structure of the zzso gene of zzso and studied its zzso At least six zzso coding units exist in tandem, one of which encodes a protein with an zzso acid sequence identical to human zzso Although the synthesis of zzso is induced by strong stimuli in many organisms, we found that the expression of zzso in zzso is not affected by protocols that produce zzso
