The zzso mechanism of zzso was investigated using zzso coli and zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso Neither of the zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso activity alone, but the zzso zzso was able to extend a zzso indicating that this zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso cooperated with the zzso zzso in binding the initiating zzso to form the initial zzso After zzso the zzso zzso alone was sufficient to extend the growing zzso but both the rate of zzso primer extension and its stability were influenced by the zzso zzso The zzso in primer synthesis on zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex was zzso higher than the zzso of the single zzso zzso in a zzso primer extension zzso In addition, labeled zzso zzso to both of the individually zzso zzso but with a striking difference in zzso zzso was zzso more efficient to the zzso zzso The interaction of the two zzso zzso with zzso alpha was also zzso zzso experiments indicate that only the zzso zzso directly contacts the zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso Competition experiments in the coupled zzso zzso with a zzso inactive zzso of DNA zzso alpha and the zzso zzso suggest that the DNA zzso zzso complex does not zzso from the primer during the transition from zzso to DNA zzso
