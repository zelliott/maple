To assess the capacity of major zzso complex zzso class zzso competitor peptides in zzso zzso disease zzso we studied experimental zzso zzso zzso in Lewis zzso Experimental zzso zzso zzso a disease model zzso by T zzso zzso against zzso zzso was induced by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in complete zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso was recognized by T cells in the context of zzso class II zzso The disease zzso capacity of zzso peptides not related to the zzso zzso was determined upon zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a strong zzso competitor zzso resulted in complete disease zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso T cell response was not fully zzso the zzso of the response was zzso Moreover, besides a drastic reduction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a shift in zzso distribution was zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso processes can be suppressed by zzso class II competitor zzso Furthermore, the administration of such peptides in zzso not only passively zzso T cell zzso but also functionally alters the immune zzso
