To evaluate the ability of genetically modified zzso zzso cells to deliver zzso proteins to the systemic zzso we used our previously described zzso zzso ex zzso gene therapy zzso zzso primary zzso zzso cells, isolated from zzso zzso by zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso with the zzso zzso to express a zzso reporter gene product, human growth hormone zzso Such zzso zzso cells were zzso on the zzso zzso surface of zzso recipients and delivery of the reporter gene product to the systemic circulation was monitored by analysis of serum samples for the presence of zzso at various times after zzso cell zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso areas and remained attached there for at least 12 zzso Moreover, these genetically modified zzso cells continued to express the reporter gene product in zzso and zzso zzso in sufficient quantity to be detected in the systemic circulation zzso statistically significant amounts of zzso could be measured in the serum of zzso zzso rats for at least 2 zzso zzso test, P zzso zzso Our results demonstrate the successful, zzso systemic delivery of a zzso protein by genetically modified zzso zzso cells following their zzso to the zzso surface, and suggest the potential of ex zzso zzso zzso gene therapy for the treatment of inherited or acquired disorders requiring delivery of therapeutic proteins to the zzso
