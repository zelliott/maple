zzso zzso VI is the major zzso responsible for zzso zzso by zzso but the zzso surface of zzso is zzso To address this issue we zzso from insect cells, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of human and zzso zzso called zzso and zzso zzso Both proteins bound specifically to zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso but zzso bound zzso more strongly than did zzso zzso modeling and sequence comparison identified key differences between zzso and zzso Ten zzso zzso were zzso of which 4 had human zzso replaced by their zzso counterpart, and 6 had replacements by zzso zzso binding studies with these zzso demonstrated that the exchange of zzso at position 59 for the corresponding zzso zzso substantially reduced binding to zzso The position of zzso on the zzso surface of zzso suggests a mode of zzso binding analogous to that used by the related killer cell zzso receptors to bind zzso This surface was confirmed as critical for collagen binding by zzso mapping of an zzso zzso zzso against zzso This zzso clone zzso gave zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of zzso by zzso and collagen in zzso and zzso formation by the latter in whole blood zzso zzso zzso showed significantly reduced binding to the zzso and, on that basis, the zzso interface was zzso
