zzso are expected to be one of the potential signal molecules for controlling drug zzso or long-term circulation of zzso However, the effect of the carbohydrates of artificially zzso derivatives on in zzso dynamic distribution profiles after intravenous injection of model animals remains unclear due to the lack of standardized methodology and a suitable zzso We report zzso an efficient and versatile method for the preparation of zzso quantum dots zzso displaying common synthetic zzso with excellent zzso and long-term stability in zzso solution without loss of quantum zzso Combined use of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso provided zzso with novel functions for the chemical zzso of zzso compounds and the prevention of zzso protein zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displaying various simple zzso zzso after administration into the tail vein of the mouse revealed that distinct long-term zzso over 2 h can be achieved in cases of zzso modified with zzso acid zzso zzso and control zzso while zzso bearing other common zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso accumulated rapidly zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso modifications of zzso gave zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in quantitative yield as monitored by direct zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso Live animal imaging uncovered for the first time that zzso also distributed rapidly in the liver after intravenous injection and almost zzso over 1 h in similar profiles to those of zzso and zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were still retained zzso in the whole body after 2 zzso while they showed significantly different in zzso dynamics in the tissue distribution, suggesting that zzso of the neighboring sugar zzso in the individual zzso zzso might influence the final zzso zzso The present results clearly zzso the evidence of an essential role of the terminal zzso acid zzso for achieving prolonged in zzso lifetime and zzso of various zzso as a novel class of functional platforms for zzso drug zzso A standardized protocol using zzso zzso should facilitate live animal imaging of zzso zzso using versatile zzso zzso zzso without influence of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso diameter by the zzso
