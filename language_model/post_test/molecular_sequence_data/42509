The complete three-dimensional structure of the bean seed storage protein zzso was generated from zzso coordinates by using molecular mechanic zzso This structure was used as a template to simulate modifications aimed at increasing the zzso content of zzso A zzso zzso looping insert sequence was zzso zzso zzso shows that the insert might be zzso in turn and loop regions of the zzso but not within an zzso zzso content was also increased by the replacement of zzso zzso acids with zzso in the central core zzso of the zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso can effectively replace zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso were much more sensitive to zzso and demonstrated high zzso in the effects of zzso zzso Introduction of multiple zzso in the barrel interior demonstrated that the replaced zzso could interact favorably to relieve local zzso caused by individual zzso zzso dynamics simulations were also zzso to study the structural organization of zzso The calculations indicate that there are extensive packing interactions between the major zzso of zzso which have important implications for protein folding and zzso Since the proposed zzso proteins can be produced and zzso the results presented here provide an ideal test to determine if there is a correlation between the effects obtained by computer simulation and the effects of the zzso on the protein structure expressed in zzso
