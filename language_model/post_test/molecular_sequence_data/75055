zzso intrinsic factor zzso has been zzso and zzso fragments were zzso A zzso library was constructed from zzso gastric zzso zzso and screened for zzso clones by zzso and synthetic zzso probe zzso An IF clone was isolated and zzso revealing a predicted primary zzso acid sequence in the coding region of zzso zzso acids and a putative signal sequence of 22 zzso zzso The primary translation product of IF produced in a zzso translation system displayed zzso zzso activity without zzso processing or zzso The zzso region of IF showed significant secondary structural and zzso zzso with the zzso domain in zzso zzso zzso of the first 80 zzso of zzso following the signal zzso demonstrated zzso with the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso Based on these data, we propose a model of IF zzso structure in which the zzso domain resides in the zzso half of the zzso
