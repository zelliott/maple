The detection of zzso proteins that are produced due to zzso gene expression in zzso tumors can provide important diagnostic information influencing patient zzso The use of small zzso targeting proteins would enable zzso zzso imaging of zzso expressing such zzso if adequate binding affinity and specificity could be zzso Here, we describe a zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with 22 zzso affinity that can be used for the zzso of zzso expression in tumors in zzso using gamma zzso A library for affinity maturation was constructed by zzso of relevant positions identified after the alignment of first-generation zzso of zzso affinity zzso zzso One selected zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso increase in affinity achieved through a zzso affinity maturation zzso When zzso the zzso zzso zzso showed clear, zzso zzso of zzso zzso in mice as early as 6 hours zzso The tumor zzso at 4 hours zzso was improved zzso zzso to increased zzso with zzso of the injected dose per gram of tissue in the zzso zzso molecules represent a new class of affinity molecules that can provide small zzso high affinity zzso zzso which may be well suited for tumor zzso
