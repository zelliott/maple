Previous studies have characterized the zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso as strong zzso which are possibly involved in the zzso of cardiovascular zzso Whereas zzso and zzso have been characterized using a number of approaches, little is known about the function of zzso The aim of this study was to define the role of zzso in physiology and zzso using a transgenic zzso zzso rats expressing a zzso construct of the human zzso gene were generated by zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso Two transgenic lines were generated, and one line was further characterized in zzso Studies on zzso expression demonstrated that the zzso is expressed predominantly in zzso gastrointestinal zzso adrenal zzso zzso and zzso Plasma zzso levels were elevated zzso and zzso levels were elevated zzso Despite these zzso blood pressure in transgenic rats remained zzso Further analysis of transgenic animals revealed that zzso receptors were not zzso and that infusion of zzso human zzso results in an enhanced blood pressure zzso These observations suggest the presence of zzso mechanisms influencing the effects of zzso on blood zzso One of these mechanisms may involve the zzso oxide system since infusion of an inhibitor of zzso oxide zzso resulted in a greater blood pressure response than in zzso zzso Despite unchanged blood pressure, zzso were observed in organ development and function, namely of hearts and zzso indicating an interference between zzso expression and growth zzso Male rats seem to be more susceptible to zzso zzso These data show that the zzso in zzso expression in this transgenic model does not induce hypertension but leads to changes at the zzso zzso zzso is most likely due to zzso mechanisms such as increased zzso oxide zzso
