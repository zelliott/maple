In contrast to our understanding of the roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso virtually nothing is known of the role of the second cellular zzso termed host cell factor zzso or of its zzso zzso We show that the majority of the internal region of zzso including the repeats involved in zzso zzso is zzso for complex assembly with zzso and zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso had only weak zzso binding and complex promoting activity, while the zzso region zzso had no intrinsic zzso However, the zzso region strongly enhanced complex formation and reduced zzso zzso when linked to the zzso domain zzso The potent activity of the zzso fusion in complex assembly was zzso in zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso could promote increased complex formation when the zzso zzso domain of zzso was zzso Restoration of the zzso domain strongly inhibited complex formation with zzso but the addition of the zzso domain of zzso restored strong stable complex formation with intact zzso The results indicate that this zzso domain is critically required to alter the presentation of the zzso domain of zzso Additional results are consistent with the interpretation that this zzso in zzso domain presentation for complex assembly also zzso the zzso function in zzso The sequence of an zzso zzso from zzso zzso shows it to be a natural zzso zzso reinforcing the conclusions from our functional zzso
