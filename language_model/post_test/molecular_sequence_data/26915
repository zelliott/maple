zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the three original sources of zzso zzso specified in the Chinese zzso zzso and have been traditionally used for zzso and zzso zzso zzso variations in zzso composition and content, as well as different degrees of zzso activities were found among zzso In order to identify the genuine sources of zzso zzso accurately in genetic level, we determined the zzso sequences of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions of the species recorded in zzso and zzso zzso as well as the common zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The results revealed that the sequences of zzso and zzso regions, showing relatively high substitution rate, were more zzso than those of zzso and zzso zzso The sequences from all the four regions provided useful information to discriminate the three zzso species from each other and from zzso zzso and the zzso A zzso tree reconstructed by the zzso sequences for 9 zzso species distributed in China and Thailand showed that the three zzso species belonged to the same zzso among which zzso zzso and zzso zzso formed a sister group, showing closer relations to each other than to zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso was genetically far from the three zzso zzso zzso variations were observed in the three zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso two types of zzso sequence and four types each of zzso zzso and zzso sequences resulted in 6 zzso zzso these differences had no relation with the different chemical types, but seemed to be consistent with geographical zzso
