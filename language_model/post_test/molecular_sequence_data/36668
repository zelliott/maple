The role of zzso zzso in the development of zzso has been studied in a culture system that initially contains the zzso cell for zzso and type 2 zzso The zzso cells, derived from mixed zzso primary cultures of newborn rat zzso were studied under culture conditions that we have shown previously to induce zzso zzso zzso was used to inhibit processing of zzso zzso by its zzso action on zzso I, the zzso responsible for the initial trimming of zzso zzso from the zzso high zzso core zzso derived from the zzso zzso Exposure to zzso had no effect on the initial commitment of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of both control and zzso cells became zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of a network of fine zzso processes were prevented by the zzso zzso No effect of zzso on cell number was zzso A major effect of the inhibitor on zzso processing was zzso by an zzso of high zzso zzso of abnormal zzso structure, compatible with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
