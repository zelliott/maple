A full-length zzso clone coding for zzso pancreatic zzso A1 zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso of the zzso sequence was zzso zzso in length and zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso The zzso included a short signal zzso of 16 zzso and a 94 zzso zzso zzso The calculated molecular mass of the mature zzso was zzso zzso in accordance with that of the zzso zzso pancreatic zzso The deduced zzso sequence of the corresponding zzso differed from that predicted by the three-dimensional structure by 40 zzso and showed zzso identity and zzso identity to that of zzso A1 and zzso zzso zzso the sequence was identical to that of several independent zzso zzso suggesting that it is the major transcribed zzso No evidence for a second zzso was observed in the zzso library and zzso is apparently absent from the zzso zzso The zzso was expressed in zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The signal zzso of the zzso protein efficiently directed its zzso into the culture medium zzso zzso as a protein of the predicted zzso The zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso Its zzso behavior was comparable with that of the native form and led to a zzso active zzso
