We have cloned the full-length zzso zzso the rat zzso of type I zzso zzso a protein product of a gene linked to zzso type zzso zzso type I zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso acid zzso and shares about zzso zzso acid identity with the human zzso By zzso zzso mapping analysis of the alternatively spliced zzso zzso in adult rat zzso we showed that type I zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in the brain, zzso and zzso while type II zzso carrying a zzso zzso in the region coding for the domain related to zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in most other zzso such as heart, zzso and zzso Furthermore, type II zzso is zzso in the zzso at age 1 week, while type I zzso becomes zzso at 3 weeks and is subsequently expressed at higher levels, as seen in the adult zzso In contrast, type I zzso is the zzso form in the brain throughout the zzso zzso Thus, the relative expression levels of type I and type II zzso may be specific to the zzso and to the zzso stage of certain zzso
