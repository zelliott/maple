The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso play a central role in signaling pathways initiated by zzso stimuli such as growth factors, zzso and various forms of environmental zzso Full zzso of the zzso zzso requires dual zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso motif of the zzso loop by zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso activity can be initiated by multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This would inevitable lead to the formation of zzso zzso zzso However, in much of the literature investigating zzso zzso zzso there has been the implicit assumption that the zzso forms are zzso Thus, the significance for the need of multiple zzso in regulating zzso zzso activity is not clear, and the biological functions of these zzso zzso zzso are currently zzso We have prepared zzso zzso protein zzso 2 zzso in all zzso forms and zzso characterized them using two proteins (the zzso basic protein and zzso and zzso as zzso Our results revealed that a single zzso in the zzso loop of zzso produces an intermediate activity zzso Thus, the zzso efficiencies of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso are approximately 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the zzso zzso and are only 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the fully active zzso zzso This raises the possibility that the zzso zzso may have distinct biological roles in zzso Different zzso states in the zzso loop could be linked to graded effects on a single zzso zzso zzso they could be linked to distinct zzso zzso Although less active than the zzso species, the zzso zzso may zzso zzso zzso zzso
