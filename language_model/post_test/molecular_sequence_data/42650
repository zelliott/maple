A capture zzso technique in zzso has been developed for the identification of zzso chain reaction zzso amplified zzso DNA zzso in clinical zzso The amplified 104 zzso zzso DNA fragment, located in the gene coding for structural zzso was directly zzso during the amplification reaction by incorporation of zzso zzso The amplified product was then captured by a probe immobilized on zzso zzso The capture zzso reaction was zzso as an zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso Thirty-five serum samples were tested by our capture zzso zzso and the results were in accordance with the results obtained by Southern zzso analysis of zzso amplified zzso Our zzso capture zzso zzso showed a high sensitivity and zzso and appears to be a practical and reliable test for routine screening of zzso zzso DNA in clinical zzso
