The present paper describes the zzso characterization and determination of the partial primary structure of the first zzso inhibitor isolated from the family zzso A highly stable, potent zzso inhibitor zzso was zzso to zzso zzso analysis revealed that the protein consists of a zzso chain with molecular masses of approximately 15 and 3 zzso The zzso inhibitor inhibited bovine zzso at a zzso M zzso zzso analysis revealed that the protein is a competitive inhibitor with an equilibrium zzso constant of zzso M for zzso The partial zzso terminal sequence of 36 zzso acids in zzso indicates zzso with other members of the zzso family from different zzso This inhibitor is highly stable in the presence of zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso activity against zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
