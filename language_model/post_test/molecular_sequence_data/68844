A synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso of zzso zzso K strain zzso has been studied by one and two-dimensional zzso zzso This zzso exists in two zzso forms which arise as a result of the zzso zzso zzso An ensemble of solution zzso for the trans form of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been generated using a simulated zzso procedure in conjunction with distance and zzso angle restraints derived from zzso zzso One major class of backbone zzso has been identified for this potential synthetic vaccine and indicates the presence of two zzso in the region zzso The region that has been established as the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso is consistent with the region of the major zzso that exhibit the most definition in the ensemble zzso and also includes a type I zzso from zzso zzso to zzso The generated structures are also consistent with observed zzso characteristic of zzso and zzso zzso temperature zzso data, which indicate the presence of two turns between zzso zzso and zzso The presence of secondary structure within the zzso zzso the theory that zzso regions of proteins are those which contain zzso structural elements such as zzso Further implications of the structure on zzso and zzso are zzso
