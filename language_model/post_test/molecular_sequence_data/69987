The zzso preferences of a zzso zzso zzso zzso beta 4, in water at 1, 4 and 14 degrees C, and at pH zzso and zzso were studied by zzso zzso showed that zzso beta 4 lacks a uniquely folded zzso in zzso However, some preferential zzso zzso of zzso beta 4 can be observed in zzso zzso The segment at zzso zzso showed characteristic interactions for zzso in both the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso space, based on strong C alpha zzso interactions and zzso C alpha zzso and C alpha zzso beta zzso zzso zzso At zzso degrees C, another segment at zzso zzso also shows both beta and alpha zzso forming however a less zzso zzso than the segment at zzso zzso At 14 degrees C, the zzso population of the zzso at positions zzso is shifted more towards the random and zzso structures, whereas the segment at positions zzso becomes exclusively a random zzso
