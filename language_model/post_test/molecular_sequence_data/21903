The zzso DNA in zzso zzso is contained in a single highly condensed structure consisting of thousands of zzso and approximately 25 zzso The zzso structure is termed zzso DNA zzso and is located in the zzso zzso near the zzso zzso We have previously identified a zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso that zzso to zzso sites zzso the zzso disk where several other replication proteins are zzso We describe here a second zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso primarily in cells that have completed zzso and contain either a dividing zzso or two newly divided zzso Essentially all dividing or newly divided zzso show zzso of zzso zzso The zzso is present on both faces of the zzso disk and at a high level in the zzso zone of the zzso zzso zzso containing a single nucleus show zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso but at a much lower zzso The zzso level of zzso zzso varies during the cell cycle out of phase with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript levels are zzso during the phase when cells contain two zzso whereas zzso zzso transcript levels are zzso during S zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso with a zzso of 100 zzso in the absence of protein zzso The periodic expression of the zzso zzso transcript and the instability of the zzso zzso protein suggest a possible role of the zzso in regulating zzso zzso
