zzso are zzso acid bacteria that can produce zzso which may offer an additional hurdle to control the growth of food-borne zzso moreover, these zzso may have great potential as natural zzso The aim of this work was to characterize a zzso zzso substance zzso with zzso activity produced by an zzso zzso 

The zzso strain was isolated from Mexican fermented sausages and identified as zzso zzso with zzso sequence zzso zzso activity was detected at 16 zzso where bacterial growth was in middle of the stationary zzso The producer strain was not inhibited by its own zzso zzso zzso showed a strong zzso activity and was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 15 zzso induced some zzso but zzso was higher at acid pH zzso The yield obtained with a zzso zzso process was zzso showing a band with an estimated molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation showed the following zzso zzso 

zzso characteristics of zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso suggested that it belongs to Class zzso of the zzso zzso and could be considered as a natural food zzso although further studies need to be zzso
