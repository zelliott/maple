zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso A putative zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was identified in the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso has no sequence or structural similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso found in zzso it may represent an attractive zzso drug zzso In the present study, zzso cloned and expressed in zzso coli was mostly zzso and zzso However, the protein was successfully produced in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso showed typical zzso zzso Our results provide a foundation for further development of zzso as a promising new drug target for novel zzso therapies that selectively target the zzso
