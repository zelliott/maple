A novel factor, which is a membrane component of the protein zzso machinery of zzso coli, was zzso This factor was found in the zzso zzso fraction of zzso zzso zzso The factor was zzso to zzso by zzso exchange column zzso and found to be a zzso protein with a molecular mass of approximately 12 zzso The factor caused zzso zzso stimulation of the protein zzso when it was zzso into zzso together with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were essential for the zzso stimulation of the zzso The factor zzso the zzso of all three precursor proteins zzso including authentic zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso a model zzso zzso was especially zzso since no zzso was observed unless zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso factor was zzso An zzso raised against a synthetic zzso of this sequence inhibited the protein zzso into zzso membrane zzso indicating that the factor is playing an important role in protein zzso into membrane zzso The partial zzso acid sequence was found to coincide with that deduced from the reported DNA sequence of the upstream region of the zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of the upstream region revealed the presence of a new open reading frame, which encodes a zzso protein of zzso zzso We propose that the factor is a general component of the protein zzso machinery of zzso zzso
