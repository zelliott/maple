The structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been characterized in several species including zzso fish, zzso birds, and zzso Although zzso has been shown to stimulate zzso zzso and adrenal cell activity, the structure of the zzso precursor and the expression of its gene have not yet been reported in any zzso zzso In this study, we have characterized two zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso one of which encodes a second zzso exhibiting strong zzso to growth zzso hormone zzso of fish and zzso Northern zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso zzso are predominantly expressed in the brain and spinal zzso and, to a lesser extent, in the zzso lobe of the zzso Other zzso including the zzso and the zzso lobe of the zzso do not express the zzso precursor zzso The distribution of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso brain has been determined by in zzso zzso zzso High levels of expression were found in the accessory zzso bulb, the zzso zzso the zzso part of the zzso zzso nucleus, the zzso zzso nucleus, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These data contribute to the understanding of the evolution of the zzso and zzso genes in zzso and provide the anatomical bases to zzso the roles of zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso
