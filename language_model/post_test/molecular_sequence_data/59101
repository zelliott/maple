The pea genes zzso and zzso are expressed in the root hairs shortly after infection with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or after application of zzso zzso zzso A 199 zzso promoter zzso of the zzso gene contains sufficient information for zzso zzso zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso that interacts with the 199 zzso zzso zzso Two different zzso zzso were identified in zzso A domain containing six zzso interacts specifically with an zzso sequence located between positions zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso A second domain in zzso is a zzso region that binds to the zzso promoter in a sequence zzso but zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the same cell types as zzso However, additional expression is observed in the zzso zzso and zzso The presence of three small overlapping zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso indicates that zzso expression might be regulated at the zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with a zzso zzso element within the zzso promoter and the presence of the zzso transcript in cells expressing zzso strongly suggest that zzso is a zzso factor involved in the regulation of zzso Finally, the zzso region of zzso shows strong zzso to a protein from rat that is specifically expressed in zzso zzso
