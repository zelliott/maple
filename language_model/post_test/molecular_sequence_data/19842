zzso proteins are essential regulators of zzso in zzso zzso In this report, we investigate the role of two previously zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was found to contain one zzso zzso shutdown experiments using a zzso zzso zzso revealed a strong cell polarity zzso and a partially zzso zzso zzso zzso growth after promoter shutdown was abolished in zzso zzso even in the presence of a zzso active zzso zzso and existing germ tubes became zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso indicated that it is a zzso gene and that zzso zzso were zzso different from zzso Two distinct zzso of zzso cells were zzso cell zzso and an unexpected cell separation zzso generating chains of zzso Colony zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso smooth zzso cell cycle zzso or zzso (short cell cycle zzso zzso This zzso was additionally dependent on the zzso cell separation zzso and was also found in a zzso zzso zzso that shows a strong zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso but not zzso suppressed the cell separation zzso of zzso but could not suppress the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both zzso to zzso sites in zzso and zzso cells but not to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso produced similar zzso zzso Based on the zzso of zzso and on the zzso zzso zzso we propose a model in which zzso may function as a regulator of cell zzso breaking the initial axis of polarity found during early bud growth to promote the construction of a zzso
