zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein with a short zzso zzso domain, a zzso acid zzso anchor domain, and a large zzso zzso region containing two zzso zzso zzso An active soluble form of zzso zzso in human plasma and is produced in culture medium of Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the full-length human zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso release in zzso cells involves a zzso zzso zzso occurring in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was established by zzso zzso and zzso to a zzso site between zzso and zzso Two independent studies confirmed this proposed zzso zzso zzso acid analysis of a zzso zzso derived from soluble zzso and zzso of zzso and soluble zzso with zzso raised against three peptides located along the zzso zzso zzso In order to assess the importance of zzso this zzso acid was zzso to a zzso zzso This zzso did not prevent the zzso of zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso can accommodate this change or can use an alternative zzso zzso Finally, the production of soluble zzso in zzso cells appears to be zzso to the level of cellular zzso zzso that the zzso zzso is not a limiting zzso In addition, the zzso sequence of the human plasma zzso was identified as zzso thus supporting the fact that a similar mechanism could operate in human vascular zzso
