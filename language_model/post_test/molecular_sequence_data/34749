zzso zzso using zzso against zzso B surface zzso zzso has been advocated in certain cases of zzso B zzso We had earlier reported on the cloning and expression of a high affinity zzso derived from a mouse zzso zzso against zzso However this mouse zzso cannot be used for therapeutic purposes as it may elicit zzso immune zzso zzso by replacing mouse constant zzso with human ones can reduce the zzso of this zzso 

We cloned the zzso and zzso genes of this mouse zzso and fused them with zzso domain of human zzso and zzso domain of human zzso chain zzso These zzso genes were cloned into a zzso zzso After initial screening using the zzso display system, the zzso zzso was expressed in soluble form in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was zzso from the bacterial zzso zzso We characterized the zzso zzso using several in zzso techniques and it was observed that the zzso zzso retained the high affinity and specificity of the original mouse zzso This zzso zzso zzso was further expressed in different strains of zzso coli to increase the zzso 

We have generated a zzso zzso zzso against zzso without any significant loss in binding and zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso can be further modified to generate a full-length zzso zzso for therapeutic zzso
