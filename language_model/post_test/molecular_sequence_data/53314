zzso S functions as a zzso with activated protein C in the zzso of the blood zzso zzso In zzso studies have historically produced conflicting data with regard to the extent of various protein S activity in zzso zzso which typically involve adding zzso to initiate zzso We report here that protein S zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso experiments showed a transition in zzso zzso from zzso to zzso S with a transition zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso for intact protein zzso Studies of zzso zzso zzso protein S revealed similar results with a transition in zzso zzso from zzso to zzso S with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso This transition is zzso with the addition of 10 zzso zzso zzso equilibrium data suggest at a zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were also performed on zzso of protein S and zzso which showed no zzso formation in either zzso or zzso zzso These data suggest that previous interpretations of protein S structure and function may have been zzso by the zzso behavior of protein S in zzso zzso
