The zzso zzso zzso zzso complex is a member of a family of zzso zzso that share a zzso zzso zzso proteins recruit zzso to the zzso complex and are linked to zzso via zzso zzso zzso has been implicated as a zzso zzso but lacks a zzso sequence zzso of the BC zzso of the zzso zzso We now show that zzso specifically interacts with zzso zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso proteins associate with zzso We also identify zzso and zzso as proteins that share a region of zzso with zzso (the zzso box, including the BC box and downstream zzso and associate with zzso zzso complexes can thus be classified into two distinct protein zzso that is, those that contain a zzso with a zzso box zzso of the BC box and a downstream zzso zzso that interacts with zzso and those that contain a zzso with a zzso box zzso box and downstream zzso zzso that interacts with zzso zzso analyses showed that the specificity of interaction of zzso and zzso proteins with zzso zzso is determined by the zzso and zzso boxes, zzso Finally, zzso zzso of the zzso inhibited the zzso degradation of zzso whereas zzso of zzso did not affect zzso These data suggest that the functions of the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso
