Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified from a zzso zzso library for the identification of zzso zzso zzso genes using suppression zzso zzso methods in the brown leaf spot fungus zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes zzso predicted proteins of zzso and 304 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso transcript is expressed zzso in zzso under dark conditions but shows enhanced expression after zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso transcript is zzso expressed at a high level in zzso under dark conditions but is only zzso enhanced after zzso zzso These enhancement patterns of zzso and zzso gene expression after zzso zzso did not occur in the zzso regulator 1 zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso gene expression of zzso and zzso could be controlled by the zzso in zzso zzso
