zzso zzso gene 1 zzso and zzso are the essential and zzso components of zzso zzso We have characterized the zzso organization of the human zzso zzso mapped the zzso initiation sites, and partially zzso and performed functional reporter zzso on the zzso zzso regions of human zzso and zzso zzso initiation sites were mapped by rapid amplification of zzso zzso ends, primer extension, and/or zzso protection in normal zzso three zzso cell lines, and a mature B cell zzso A single promoter region was used for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso at two distinct regions of the zzso The zzso region of the human zzso gene is zzso however, there is a zzso consensus at position zzso with respect to the major zzso initiation site of zzso zzso regions of human zzso and zzso are active in both zzso and zzso cell lines, suggesting that an outside regulatory element is probably involved in the zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso
