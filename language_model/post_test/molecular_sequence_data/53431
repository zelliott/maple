All organisms respond to zzso chemical and zzso stresses by enhanced synthesis of an zzso zzso family of proteins known as heat shock proteins zzso or stress zzso Certain zzso are also expressed zzso during cell growth and development, and they function as molecular zzso The zzso regulation of zzso genes is zzso by the heat shock zzso factor zzso The stress response has been studied mostly in zzso cell lines or organisms normally maintained under constant laboratory zzso There is much less information on the regulation of the stress response of animals, such as fish, that have to tolerate large fluctuations in environmental and internal zzso To characterize the regulation of the heat shock response in fish, we have cloned the first heat shock zzso factor from fish, zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirms that the isolated zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family and is therefore designated zzso Analysis by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso shows the presence of two zzso zzso forms that are expressed in a zzso fashion upon exposure to heat zzso Both forms are expressed in zzso under all zzso in liver and to a lesser extent in the zzso the longer zzso form of zzso disappears upon heat zzso We present evidence for a unique zzso regulation of zzso upon exposure to elevated zzso
