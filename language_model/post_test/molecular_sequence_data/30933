We have identified two repetitive element families in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with extensive sequence identity to the zzso zzso zzso element zzso Five members each of the zzso zzso known as zzso and zzso families were isolated by zzso to a zzso zzso zzso repetitive elements were grouped into either the zzso or zzso family based on zzso zzso among the zzso zzso zzso The zzso copy number of the zzso family is 15 and the zzso family copy number is 33 in the zzso zzso strain zzso The two zzso element families show numerous zzso zzso pattern differences between two zzso zzso zzso suggestive of zzso zzso Two members of the zzso family, zzso and zzso were zzso Each of these two elements had suffered an independent single large zzso zzso had a zzso internal deletion and zzso had lost zzso zzso of one zzso The two zzso zzso elements were highly zzso over the sequences they zzso A zzso composite zzso element was constructed from zzso and zzso The composite zzso element has zzso terminal zzso repeats with three zzso zzso and two open reading frames zzso on opposite zzso zzso and the zzso zzso share zzso overall zzso sequence identity, and the greatest similarity occurs in their zzso and zzso repeat zzso
