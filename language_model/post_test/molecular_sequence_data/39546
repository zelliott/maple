In the rat there is a large family of zzso genes related to zzso zzso Members of the zzso family are expressed in zzso and zzso patterns in the anterior zzso zzso and zzso An overriding feature of the zzso family is its association with zzso In this investigation, we used information derived from the public rat zzso database as a tool for identifying new members of the rat zzso zzso The entire rat zzso gene family locus spans approximately zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso Genes possessed either zzso or zzso organization zzso We provide information on three newly identified genes zzso to previously identified members of the mouse zzso gene family zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a new member of the zzso family, termed zzso zzso zzso Information is also presented on the existence of multiple zzso zzso which are generated by alternative zzso Expansion of the zzso family has occurred independently in zzso versus the cow and does not exist in the human and zzso zzso of the rat zzso gene family locus provides tools for studying the zzso and biology of the rat zzso family and new insights into zzso gene family zzso
