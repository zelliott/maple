Human zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is involved in undermining many cellular processes including cell cycle regulation, zzso nuclear architecture, and gene zzso The zzso nature of zzso suggests that zzso modifications may zzso its zzso zzso is a zzso and has intrinsic zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Black, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now demonstrate that zzso is zzso zzso to the small zzso modifier zzso zzso is an zzso protein that is zzso to multiple proteins and has been reported to exhibit multiple effects, including zzso of protein stability, zzso zzso and gene zzso A zzso modified protein zzso at approximately 92 zzso which is stabilized by a zzso zzso zzso is revealed by Western zzso with zzso of zzso from cells infected with zzso or cells expressing zzso zzso modification of zzso was confirmed by zzso with zzso and zzso followed by Western zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso 450 is within a zzso consensus site zzso changing zzso 450 to zzso by point zzso zzso zzso modification of zzso zzso of protein zzso 1 and zzso which increases the zzso of zzso suppresses the formation of zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso to nuclear zzso zzso zzso and disrupt zzso Studies of protein stability, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso have revealed no significant differences between zzso zzso and zzso
