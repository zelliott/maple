zzso are zzso regulated proteins found in chicken brain and are classified into two forms of the embryonic type zzso and zzso and one form of the adult type zzso Although the time courses of their appearance are different from each other, the structures of the 3 forms are closely zzso Two kinds of zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso library of the chicken zzso and their zzso sequences were zzso Their sequences were entirely identical except for a deletion of an internal zzso zzso and the zzso insert contained an open reading frame capable of zzso 607 zzso zzso These zzso seemed to zzso to two embryonic forms of zzso zzso The predicted zzso molecules are highly zzso and have zzso sequences and long stretches of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using the zzso zzso as a probe demonstrated that the amounts of zzso zzso were also zzso regulated as those of zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that the chicken zzso has a single copy of the zzso gene per zzso zzso These findings suggest that the multiple forms of zzso result from alternative zzso of the single zzso gene during neural zzso
