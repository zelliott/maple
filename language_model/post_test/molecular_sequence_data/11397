zzso available zzso mostly zzso zzso were labeled at their zzso zzso group with zzso zzso zzso to obtain fluorescent zzso markers for zzso zzso focusing with zzso zzso The labeled peptides were zzso by zzso zzso They were well separated on zzso focusing in a zzso gel slab and their zzso were determined by zzso with zzso zzso The fluorescent markers could be detected as sharp zzso in zzso zzso focusing with zzso zzso detection zzso laser, 1 zzso zzso zzso The detection limit was found to be around 3 zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso pea zzso (3 zzso was subjected to zzso zzso focusing and the zzso of the fluorescent derivatives of the zzso were determined by using the zzso peptides as zzso zzso
