When zzso zzso mass zzso zzso was used to analyze zzso bovine gamma E zzso zzso it yielded a relative molecular mass zzso of zzso zzso zzso This mass is significantly different from that calculated from the published sequence zzso zzso zzso HE et zzso 1989, J zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso analysis of the protein after it had been reduced and zzso indicated the presence of five zzso zzso whereas the published sequence contains six zzso zzso et zzso 1995, zzso Mass zzso zzso The entire protein sequence of gamma E zzso has therefore been studied via a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso The corrected sequence gives an zzso of zzso which matches that obtained by zzso analysis of the zzso native zzso The corrected sequence is also in agreement with a recent zzso sequence obtained for a bovine zzso by zzso Hay zzso zzso
