The zzso protein zzso is essential for proper zzso segregation and cell viability in the budding zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that the zzso growth zzso of conditional zzso zzso can be suppressed by a partial zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso 1, thus suggesting that this zzso acts in opposition to the zzso protein zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso We report here that the zzso zzso which is related in primary sequence to zzso inhibitor 2, also zzso in this zzso Like inhibitor 2, the zzso protein is heat stable, exhibits anomalous zzso mobility, and functions in zzso as an inhibitor of zzso as well as rabbit skeletal muscle zzso Interestingly, zzso as well as deletion of the zzso gene results in a partial suppression of the zzso growth zzso of zzso zzso and also moderately reduces the amount of protein zzso 1 activity which is zzso in crude zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso caused by an increase in the dosage of zzso is totally suppressed by the zzso zzso deletion zzso These findings together suggest that the zzso protein is involved in zzso in the zzso of zzso and that when the zzso protein is zzso it may also inhibit zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso studies of zzso suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso which is equivalent to zzso of inhibitor 2, may play a central role in the ability of this protein to activate and/or inhibit zzso in zzso
