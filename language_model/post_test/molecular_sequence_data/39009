zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via an zzso zzso The initial steps in the zzso zzso lead to formation of zzso which serves as the zzso for the ring zzso zzso The zzso zzso differs from the usual zzso zzso found in pathways for aromatic compound zzso To determine whether the characteristics of the zzso zzso reflect the unusual ring zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso and ring zzso activity determined from zzso bacteria carrying the cloned zzso The findings were compared to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso and to other previously described ring zzso zzso The comparison revealed that only zzso identity was shared by the two zzso zzso but the zzso acid zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso and protein folding were zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, results from zzso zzso indicated a strong preference for zzso zzso that it was the native zzso for the zzso The apparent zzso zzso its similarity to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso and the distant genetic relationship to other ring zzso zzso suggest that zzso evolved expressly to carry out zzso zzso
