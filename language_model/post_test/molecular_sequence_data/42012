zzso coding for three types of zzso of zzso proteins zzso and zzso (a short form of alpha s with zzso in positions 71 and 72, a long form of alpha s with the zzso of 16 zzso acid zzso instead of zzso zzso from bovine brain, and alpha 0 from bovine zzso as well as some zzso alpha zzso 0 genes were cloned into a modified zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso All the genes were in zzso transcribed and zzso and some functional properties of the resulting proteins were determined, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso limited zzso zzso zzso Parts of the alpha s zzso chain necessary for the zzso of zzso zzso were zzso The alpha s domain interacting with zzso zzso is formed by the alpha s zzso chain fragments zzso and zzso zzso as of the alpha s long zzso
