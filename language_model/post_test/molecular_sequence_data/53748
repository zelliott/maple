zzso zzso repeat mapping by zzso chain reaction zzso reveals an enormous degree of variation in the human zzso zzso The original approach involved the use of zzso zzso to detect the zzso products zzso To date, the zzso mapped include zzso zzso and zzso However, the most zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been used in forensic analysis, has presented technical difficulties, initially due to its short 9 zzso repeats that are much shorter than any conventional primer zzso This was overcome by using the method of zzso zzso zzso employing zzso at the zzso zzso The difficulty of cloning highly repetitive DNA was overcome by zzso zzso competent zzso zzso We report the cloning and sequencing of selected short zzso zzso to determine the variety of repeat zzso This survey revealed nine types, four of which represented greater than zzso of the zzso zzso The reported zzso system maps the zzso locus for these four common repeat types by zzso zzso
