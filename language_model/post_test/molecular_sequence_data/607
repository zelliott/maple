Despite the importance of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso migration, the expression of zzso marker protein zzso is not well understood in zzso of Pacific salmon zzso zzso In this study, salmon zzso was characterized in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso salmon zzso zzso by molecular biological and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso salmon zzso were isolated and zzso These zzso both contained a coding region zzso 173 zzso acid zzso and the molecular mass of the two proteins was calculated to be zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso acid sequences showed marked zzso zzso The protein and zzso sequencing demonstrates the existence of high-level zzso between salmon zzso and those of other zzso By in zzso zzso using a zzso salmon zzso zzso probe, signals for salmon zzso zzso were observed zzso in the zzso regions of the zzso By zzso using a specific zzso to salmon zzso zzso were noted in the zzso of those zzso The present study is the first to describe zzso cloning of zzso in salmon zzso zzso and indicate that zzso is a useful molecular marker for the detection of the zzso in Pacific zzso
