The isolation and characterization of zzso zzso from zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso was obtained in four steps with a zzso yield and zzso zzso utilizing zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso is quite similar but not identical to the spinach zzso as judged by zzso zzso molecular weight determination, and zzso acid zzso zzso sequence analysis allowed identification of 28 of the first 33 zzso zzso with the corresponding sequences from spinach and zzso zzso preparations was zzso A higher degree of zzso was found with the zzso zzso than with the spinach zzso Small differences with the spinach zzso were also shown by zzso and circular zzso spectral zzso zzso potential zzso of the bound zzso zzso show an zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH 7 for the zzso zzso Complex formation between the zzso and zzso from the same zzso was observed by difference zzso zzso with a zzso zzso 4 zzso Similar zzso and difference zzso properties were observed on complex formation with spinach zzso
