zzso zzso zzso gene sequences were obtained directly from tissue specimens from eight cats with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in sections from all eight zzso but culture for zzso was successful for one zzso zzso Analysis of the V2 variable region of each zzso zzso zzso product identified a sequence with zzso zzso identity to the sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in four of the specimens from cats with zzso zzso Separate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the four specimens were negative, thus zzso the identification of zzso zzso in these specimens from cats with zzso zzso Further sequence analysis of the zzso variable region of one of the four specimens provided conclusive evidence of the presence of zzso zzso This is the first report of the definitive identification of zzso zzso in cats with zzso zzso by molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso which is rarely reported in zzso and zzso zzso a reported zzso rapidly growing zzso species found in the environment, were identified in the zzso from which zzso zzso were zzso Two of the specimens from cats were infected with a potentially novel species of zzso which had a zzso zzso gene sequence sharing the closest zzso sequence identity with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses provided for the accurate and rapid diagnosis of zzso infections in cats and zzso the problems of culture and zzso of zzso zzso associated with traditional zzso
