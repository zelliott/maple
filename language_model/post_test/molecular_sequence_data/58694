The five zzso closest to the zzso zzso of human zzso have been individually zzso to zzso zzso or zzso zzso in an attempt to identify the protein zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso at positions zzso zzso and 411 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all resulted in inactive zzso that failed to assemble the zzso cluster as judged by zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso at positions 360 and 395 to zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not affect the zzso activity, and the resulting zzso assembled a zzso cluster that was zzso indistinguishable from the zzso zzso The results indicate that three of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso extension of zzso zzso are involved in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso magnetic circular zzso studies of zzso preparations of human zzso are reported, and the zzso are best interpreted in terms of one zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso Such anomalous coordination could account for the cluster zzso compared to similar clusters with complete zzso zzso and hence may be intrinsic to the proposed regulatory role for this cluster in zzso zzso
