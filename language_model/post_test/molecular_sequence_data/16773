zzso gene complexes determine the zzso body axis in zzso The expression pattern and function of zzso genes along this axis is zzso with the order in which they are organized in the zzso This zzso organization and functional zzso is zzso in all zzso zzso zzso sequences covering the zzso complex from several zzso species are now zzso This offers a comparative zzso approach to identify zzso regions linked to this zzso Although the molecular basis of zzso of zzso complexes is not yet zzso it is possible that there are control elements within or in the proximity of these complexes that establish and maintain the expression patterns of zzso genes in a coordinated zzso 

We have compared DNA sequence zzso the zzso complex of several zzso zzso and fish zzso This analysis revealed an unprecedented conservation of zzso DNA sequences adjacent to the zzso complex from fish to zzso zzso of hundreds of base pairs in a 7 zzso region, upstream of zzso complex, show zzso conservation across the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso from the human zzso these zzso regions could be amplified from other zzso species, including other zzso birds, zzso zzso and zzso Our analysis of these sequences also indicates that starting from the zzso core regions, more sequences have been added on and maintained during evolution from fish to zzso 

Such a high degree of conservation in the core regions of this 7 zzso DNA, where no variation occurred during approximately 500 million years of evolution, suggests critical function for these zzso We suggest that such sequences are likely to provide molecular handle to gain insight into the evolution and mechanism of regulation of associated gene zzso
