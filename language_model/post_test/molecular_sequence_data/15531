The zzso zzso proteins zzso comprise an abundant and widely expressed set of zzso domain zzso zzso zzso regulate the expression of a number of cellular and viral zzso at the levels of zzso stability, and zzso Previous surveys have identified 160 zzso that are bound by zzso in the human zzso cell line, zzso To explore the functions of these zzso zzso we identified zzso whose levels are altered in zzso cells acutely depleted of the two major zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis identified 27 zzso that are zzso and 14 zzso that are zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso zzso was also noted to inhibit cell proliferation and trigger a zzso cell cycle zzso zzso analysis of genes involved in cell cycle control revealed a marked increase in zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso complexes in zzso cells demonstrates in zzso association of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso In zzso binding zzso indicate that a zzso region of the zzso region of zzso interacts with both zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso results in a marked increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso induction and zzso arrest in the zzso cells occur in the absence of zzso and are not observed in cells depleted of the individual zzso zzso The apparent zzso in the actions of zzso and zzso upon zzso expression zzso with a parallel zzso in their effects on cell cycle zzso These data reveal a pivotal role for zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso of zzso control and cell cycle zzso
