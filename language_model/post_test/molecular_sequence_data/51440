Most oral zzso zzso contain a zzso in combination with an estrogen, and the zzso component in OC includes one of the following zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso It is well known that zzso promote the growth of breast zzso However, zzso have recently also been implicated in the development of breast zzso We have compared and contrasted the ability of synthetic zzso to stimulate the proliferation of cultured human breast cancer cells and examined their possible mechanism of zzso We found that some zzso used in OC were able to stimulate the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso human breast cancer cells but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso human breast cancer zzso However, two other zzso zzso and zzso which are not used in zzso were either not able to stimulate or only slightly zzso zzso The potency of zzso zzso effective dose zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso was greater than zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso was an even more potent zzso of zzso More importantly, the zzso growth stimulation was blocked by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not the zzso 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso action of zzso was zzso through the zzso cells were zzso with a zzso zzso reporter gene containing an zzso response element derived from zzso 2A zzso The zzso which zzso the growth of breast cancer cells also increased zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso activity was blocked by the addition of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso This study provides direct evidence that the zzso derivatives in OC have zzso properties and suggests that zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso is the zzso mechanism for these synthetic zzso Our results may help to explain the conflicting evidence linking OC and breast cancer zzso A rigorous evaluation of the zzso zzso potential of OC might produce a better correlation with breast cancer zzso
