zzso is a zzso surface protein zzso on zzso zzso zzso that binds zzso and zzso receptors on human zzso We isolated and analyzed a clone of zzso zzso to characterize this key adherence mechanism of the zzso The zzso insert contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso and no zzso The zzso acid sequence of native zzso matches the deduced sequence of zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso and zzso demonstrating the cloned gene is authentic zzso The complete coding sequence has 30 highly zzso repeats of 24 zzso acids arrayed in tandem in two zzso regions of the zzso The repeat sequence is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso the C zzso displays an zzso growth zzso domain, and the N zzso has a short zzso sequence that may be a zzso zzso The tandem repeats are predicted to be at the exposed surface of the zzso thereby explaining the adhesive properties of zzso The zzso promoter contains a zzso box zzso positions zzso zzso box zzso and CT motif zzso zzso is initiated within the CT motif at zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing the full coding sequence of zzso was expressed as a zzso fusion protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso has the expected molecular mass of 120 zzso is strongly recognized in Western blots by rabbit zzso zzso and binds human zzso receptors in the same manner as native zzso This work zzso a key adherence mechanism of zzso zzso and will permit further analysis of zzso attachment to host cells, zzso and zzso zzso
