Gap junction communication in some cells has been shown to be inhibited by zzso a protein zzso zzso zzso by the viral zzso zzso The gap junction protein zzso zzso has been shown to be zzso on zzso in the absence of zzso and on both zzso and zzso in cells expressing zzso However, it is not known if the effect of zzso expression on communication results directly from zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso for example, by zzso of other zzso zzso In addition, the effect of zzso expression on communication based on other zzso has not been zzso We have used a functional expression system consisting of paired zzso zzso to examine the effect of zzso expression on the regulation of communication by gap junctions comprised of different zzso zzso of zzso completely blocked the communication induced by zzso but had only a modest effect on communication induced by zzso zzso zzso acid analysis showed that zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso A zzso replacing zzso 265 of zzso with zzso abolished both the zzso of communication and the zzso zzso induced by zzso without affecting the ability of this protein to form gap zzso These data show that the effect of zzso on gap zzso communication is zzso specific and that the zzso of zzso zzso communication by zzso requires zzso zzso of zzso
