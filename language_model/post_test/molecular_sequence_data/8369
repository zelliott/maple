In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by two zzso zzso and zzso The activity of the zzso increases as cultures enter the stationary phase of zzso Using a zzso fusion zzso we have demonstrated that the increase in zzso zzso activity resulted, at least in part, from an increase in the level of the protein rather than simply from a change in its zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a parallel increase in the level of the zzso zzso which is consistent with zzso zzso of zzso zzso analysis identified three regions upstream of zzso which are involved in zzso expression: regions A zzso to zzso relative to the start of zzso B zzso to zzso and C zzso to zzso Region A or C independently activated expression of zzso In contrast, region B alone yielded only modest zzso zzso of zzso is induced by growth to stationary phase, heat shock or nitrogen zzso Response to these zzso is zzso by elements within regions A and zzso These elements appear to be related to the zzso elements found in other zzso zzso
