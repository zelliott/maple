zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein of zzso properties and plays an important role in regulating zzso zzso and zzso production associated with inflammatory processes and zzso zzso Here we developed and characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for human zzso This zzso could inhibit zzso zzso zzso migration and zzso zzso mapping showed that zzso could specifically recognize the zzso displayed zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could block the binding of zzso to zzso and significantly inhibit the zzso zzso zzso migration and zzso Moreover, zzso on the zzso motif of zzso also markedly diminished its activity for zzso zzso Interestingly, this novel zzso is located in the extremely retained domain in all zzso The functioning zzso indicates that this novel zzso is critically involved in the zzso migration and survival through zzso zzso and the zzso factor zzso pathway, which can be inhibited by the motif zzso blocking zzso zzso These results suggest that this novel zzso of zzso may provide a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of T zzso immune zzso
