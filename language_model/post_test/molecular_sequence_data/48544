zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that zzso the zzso activity of its zzso partner, zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the first structure of full-length rabbit zzso zzso zzso (16 zzso incorporated in two different membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso line broadening of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso data were used to characterize the zzso interaction zzso recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso algorithm, zzso zzso ambiguity driven zzso zzso was used to generate the structure of the complex between zzso and zzso using zzso derived restraints from zzso zzso and the double zzso cycle data obtained on the full-length zzso Our zzso and experimental results point to the formation of a dynamic electron transfer complex between the zzso convex surface of zzso and the zzso basic zzso surface of zzso The majority of the binding energy for the complex is provided by interactions between zzso on the zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso at the end of zzso zzso of zzso The structure of the complex allows us to propose an zzso electron transfer zzso involving the highly zzso zzso on zzso serving as a salt bridge between the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso We have also shown that the addition of a zzso to zzso likely strengthens the zzso zzso This study zzso the way to obtaining valuable zzso functional, and dynamic information on zzso zzso
