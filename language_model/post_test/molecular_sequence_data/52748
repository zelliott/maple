The budding zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso of bacterial zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and has been suggested to participate in zzso cluster formation or zzso To test the function of zzso zzso and zzso single or zzso disruptions were introduced in zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso were viable but exhibited a dependency on zzso and zzso for growth and a respiratory zzso due to an zzso of zzso in zzso zzso As with other zzso genes proposed to function in zzso cluster zzso zzso iron concentration was significantly elevated in the zzso zzso and the activities of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were dramatically zzso An inspection of zzso proteins from bacteria to zzso revealed three zzso zzso zzso which in the case of zzso and zzso are essential for function and may be involved in iron zzso As predicted, zzso is targeted to the zzso zzso However, zzso is present within the zzso space of the zzso Our deletion analyses revealed that zzso harbors a zzso zzso leader sequence containing a zzso import signal linked to a second sequence that targets zzso to the zzso zzso Both signals are needed for zzso zzso A model for the zzso roles of zzso and zzso in delivering iron to sites of the zzso cluster assembly is zzso
