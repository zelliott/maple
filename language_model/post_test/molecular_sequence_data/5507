zzso are members of a zzso of zzso zzso that have been shown to be zzso expressed in zzso zzso To examine the neural functions of zzso rat zzso clones zzso zzso 1, 2, and 3 were isolated, and their expression patterns in the brain were zzso Among the three rat zzso only zzso 2 was found to be specifically expressed in the zzso Furthermore, its expression was zzso increased during brain development, zzso zzso days after zzso Within the brain, zzso 2 was concentrated in the zzso layers of the zzso and zzso bulb, which mostly consist of zzso zzso In an zzso experiment, zzso for zzso 2 was detected in the cell bodies and extended zzso of zzso but not in zzso The zzso 2 protein was recovered in the particulate fraction and resistant to zzso with zzso zzso suggesting that zzso 2 might be present as a component of a large protein zzso An zzso zzso revealed that the zzso 2 was associated with zzso activity for zzso zzso and that its activity depended on association with a regulatory partner that can be released under zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso 2 is a zzso zzso that might play a unique role in terminally differentiated zzso
