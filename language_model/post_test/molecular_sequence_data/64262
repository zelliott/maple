The ability to taste zzso zzso is a classic zzso that has long been known to vary in human zzso This zzso is of zzso zzso and evolutionary interest because the ability to taste zzso is correlated with the ability to taste other bitter zzso many of which are zzso Thus, variation in zzso perception may reflect variation in dietary preferences throughout human history and could correlate with zzso to zzso diseases in modern zzso To test zzso zzso zzso long-standing hypothesis that zzso in zzso perception has been maintained by balancing natural selection, we examined patterns of DNA sequence variation in the recently identified zzso zzso which accounts for up to zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso We analyzed the entire coding region of zzso zzso zzso in a sample of 330 zzso collected from African zzso Asian zzso European zzso and North American zzso populations by use of new statistical tests for natural selection that take into account the potentially zzso effects of human population zzso Two zzso zzso corresponding to zzso and zzso zzso were zzso These zzso had similar zzso across Africa, Asia, and zzso zzso differentiation between the zzso population samples was low zzso in comparison with estimates based on other zzso In addition, zzso D and zzso and zzso D and F statistics demonstrated a significant zzso from neutrality because of an excess of zzso zzso when human population growth was taken into account zzso These results combine to suggest that balancing natural selection has acted to maintain zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso locus in zzso
