zzso is a key tumor suppression mechanism that can be initiated by zzso of the zzso factor zzso The zzso DNA zzso protein has recently been shown to suppress zzso by zzso zzso from zzso The mechanism by which zzso is regulated remains zzso Here, we identify eight zzso in zzso that are targets for zzso in zzso Five of these, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lie in the zzso zzso domain of zzso adjacent to the zzso interaction zzso We show that zzso and zzso efficiently zzso zzso in zzso and associate with zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso or treating cells with zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso to suppress zzso zzso We demonstrate that increased zzso of zzso zzso the zzso interaction and zzso with zzso zzso of zzso These results shed light on the role of zzso as tumor zzso
