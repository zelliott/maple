Human zzso cell lines immortalized by zzso virus zzso produce low levels of zzso zzso zzso that differs in composition from zzso produced by the same cell type after virus zzso We use three approaches to study the zzso zzso produced by the zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the single protein obtained after zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso clones obtained by screening a zzso library with an zzso 2 zzso Our data show that more than zzso of the zzso zzso results from expression of a single gene coding for zzso zzso The significance of these results is zzso
