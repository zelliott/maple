We have studied the DNA from 170 individuals affected with familial zzso zzso and from 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of zzso chain reaction amplified DNA from the zzso zzso coli zzso gene demonstrated three major patterns consistent with the existence of two different sequences in zzso 13 of the gene in the human zzso zzso sequencing of the amplified product from zzso producing these three patterns confirmed the presence of a zzso in the coding region of the zzso zzso
