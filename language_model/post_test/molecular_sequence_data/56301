The zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to members of the zzso an zzso site corresponding to zzso as well as the equivalent of the regulatory zzso in zzso are missing in the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso zzso zzso other members of the zzso of zzso zzso at their regulatory zzso By regulating the activity of these zzso zzso may play an important role in cell growth and zzso Here we describe the structure of the human zzso zzso The entire coding region spans a zzso distance of only zzso zzso It encompasses 12 zzso ranging between 66 and 220 zzso in zzso The zzso between coding zzso vary between 76 and 920 zzso in zzso An zzso coding for the zzso region of zzso is separated from the first coding zzso by an zzso of more than zzso zzso Based on comparisons of sequence zzso within the zzso zzso the zzso zzso are divided into the zzso the zzso and the zzso The zzso structure of four members of the zzso revealed nearly identical zzso boundaries within the zzso domain of this zzso They differ from those described for zzso Comparing the zzso structure of zzso with the zzso zzso of both, it is obvious that the zzso boundaries are in common either with those of the zzso or the zzso zzso This intermediate zzso structure of zzso between zzso and the zzso agrees with the position of zzso in a zzso tree based on sequence zzso within the zzso zzso
