Using the zzso tandem affinity zzso zzso method, we have zzso the zzso zzso U2 zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso While zzso zzso revealed only the expected zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found to contain only six zzso including previously known components zzso zzso zzso zzso the recently identified zzso factor and a new small essential protein zzso zzso by an zzso split zzso in the zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso the proposed zzso zzso of the seventh human zzso zzso zzso was not found in the zzso zzso TAP zzso revealed that zzso together with zzso and a newly identified factor, zzso form a novel zzso zzso zzso of this complex were not essential for zzso However, they are required for efficient zzso in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, zzso of this complex causes zzso leakage from the zzso The corresponding complex was named zzso zzso and zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso in numerous zzso suggests that its function is zzso zzso
