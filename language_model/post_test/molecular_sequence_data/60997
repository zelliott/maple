The plasma complement system comprises several zzso pathways that share a common terminal route involving the assembly of the terminal complement complex zzso formed by zzso The order of emergence of the zzso components of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been determined by zzso analyses of their zzso acid zzso Using all the sequence data available for zzso zzso as well as for zzso the results suggested that these zzso components originated from a single ancestral gene and that zzso and zzso were the earliest to zzso Our evidence supports the notion that the ancestral gene had a complex modular zzso A series of gene zzso in combination with a tendency to lose zzso resulted in successive complement proteins with decreasing modular zzso zzso and zzso apparently are the result of different selective conditions to acquire zzso zzso Thus zzso and zzso are examples of evolutionary zzso
