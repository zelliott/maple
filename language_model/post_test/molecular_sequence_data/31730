zzso zzso zzso proteins primarily function as zzso zzso zzso that regulate the innate immune response to zzso zzso zzso known as zzso zzso finger zzso has been implicated in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the regulation of innate immune zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso senses zzso viral zzso and is subsequently zzso by zzso at its zzso zzso zzso recruitment zzso leading to type I zzso zzso The interaction with zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso domain, a zzso domain composed of the zzso and zzso tandem sequence zzso In the present study we describe the zzso zzso crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain, which exhibits a typical zzso domain fold zzso two zzso zzso thirteen zzso arranged into two zzso and loop regions of varying zzso A comparison with other zzso structures and an analysis of the loop regions identified a putative binding pocket, which is likely to be involved in binding target zzso This was supported by zzso and functional zzso which identified two key zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso domain as being critical for binding to the zzso zzso
