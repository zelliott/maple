The zzso zzso zzso has both positive and negative regulatory effects on the expression of a variety of host zzso Both type of effects have been reported for certain cell cycle genes such as zzso To study the potential role of zzso in zzso zzso we have assessed the zzso levels of zzso zzso after serum stimulation in genetically related transformed or zzso cell lines in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of stable zzso zzso only in cell lines which did not express zzso Therefore under the present zzso conditions, zzso had a negative effect on the zzso level of zzso zzso Surprisingly, this effect was independent of the transformed zzso
