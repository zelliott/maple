zzso of zzso II zzso with chemical and zzso zzso showed that double- and zzso regions were distributed zzso along the zzso except for a large zzso zzso zzso region containing the translation stop zzso Secondary structure models constrained by the experimental data were made by varying the distance (along the zzso over which base pairing was zzso Four prominent secondary structures were seen with restrictions of zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that such structures from via local interactions over distances of zzso zzso zzso long range interactions involve only 2-3 base pairs while local interactions involve zzso of zzso base zzso zzso zzso of greater than or equal to 4 base pairs occur primarily within zzso raising the possibility that prominent secondary structures in zzso may be largely due to zzso base zzso Tests of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso H zzso and primer extension were in zzso with the structure model and with zzso and chemical modification zzso The model predicting base pairing between the coding and the 3' zzso regions was tested by zzso H zzso followed by zzso zzso to separate zzso and 3' zzso zzso Most zzso of the zzso zzso remained associated with the 3' zzso region in a structure with a zzso zzso 50 degrees C in zzso M zzso suggesting that this stem could be stable in zzso This stem may be stable in the isolated zzso but would likely occur zzso in zzso zzso II zzso due to zzso transit through the zzso side of the zzso zzso structures may occur in this region during zzso transit and play a role in translation termination or in determining the zzso of the zzso to zzso
