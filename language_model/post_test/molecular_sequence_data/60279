In plants, the zzso coat covers the zzso wall of the zzso and is the zzso layer that makes the initial contact with the zzso surface during sexual zzso Little is known about the constituents of the zzso coat, especially in zzso zzso The zzso coat was extracted with zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso protein of 35 zzso was zzso On the basis of the zzso sequence of this zzso a zzso clone of the zzso gene was obtained by reverse zzso chain zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein shared similarities with the sequences of many microbial zzso and a barley zzso zzso The zzso protein in the zzso extract was zzso to zzso by fast protein liquid zzso and determined to be an zzso zzso that was most active on zzso zzso zzso Northern and in zzso zzso showed that zzso was specifically expressed in the zzso of the zzso after the zzso zzso had become individual zzso Southern zzso and zzso reconstruction studies showed only one copy of the zzso gene per zzso zzso zzso of the zzso DNA sequence of zzso and zzso protection studies with the transcript revealed many regulatory motifs at the promoter region and an zzso at the zzso leader region of the zzso The zzso transcript had a zzso zzso zzso leader, a zzso sequence zzso a putative signal zzso a zzso coding zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The unusually long zzso leader had an open reading frame zzso a putative zzso protein whose sequence was most similar to that of a microbial zzso The zzso zzso is the first zzso documented to be present in the zzso zzso Its possible role in the zzso of the zzso type II primary cell wall zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the major zzso of the zzso cells and the zzso surface is zzso
