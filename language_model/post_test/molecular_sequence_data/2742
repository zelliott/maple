Several proteins from bovine zzso zzso bound to type I collagen immobilized to the beads of zzso derivatives of zzso Among these zzso a protein of about 100,000 zzso was zzso to zzso by two additional affinity zzso an zzso and a lentil zzso This protein consisted of a single zzso chain which contains zzso zzso and many zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso this protein was present in plasma and cultured zzso cells but not in red blood cells, zzso and smooth muscle zzso Furthermore, it was released from zzso upon stimulation by various zzso The zzso zzso protein was labeled with zzso to zzso its binding to zzso type I zzso The protein specifically bound to zzso collagen with the apparent zzso constant of zzso zzso zzso M for the high affinity site and zzso zzso zzso M for the low affinity zzso zzso of zzso acid sequences of both intact and zzso fragments of this protein revealed that it had strong zzso to the zzso of human von zzso factor, which is also known as von zzso zzso zzso Various properties of this protein listed above also strongly suggest that it was indeed the zzso of bovine von zzso zzso
