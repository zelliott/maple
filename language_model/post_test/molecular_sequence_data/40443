The formation of zzso zzso architecture in the zzso layer of the zzso shell involves the participation of a number of different zzso One protein family, zzso has been identified as a participant in zzso calcium zzso stabilization and zzso architecture in the zzso layer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the functional zzso of this protein family are not fully understood due to the fact that insufficient quantities of these proteins are available for zzso To overcome this problem, we employed zzso zzso synthesis to recreate one of the 10 members of the zzso family, the 61 AA single chain zzso zzso zzso We find that the zzso zzso protein zzso the formation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso the formation of round calcium zzso deposits in zzso that contain zzso and zzso calcium zzso zzso This zzso behavior does not occur under control conditions, and the formation of zzso and zzso is similar to that reported for the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies reveal that zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso predominantly random zzso zzso with zzso zzso content, a small percentage of zzso and little if any zzso zzso This protein is not zzso stabilized by zzso zzso but can be stabilized by zzso to form a structure consisting of zzso and random zzso zzso This finding suggests that zzso zzso may require other zzso interactions zzso with mineral or zzso clusters or other zzso to achieve zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso possesses in zzso functional and structural qualities that are similar to other reported for other zzso protein zzso
