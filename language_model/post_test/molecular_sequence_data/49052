zzso have retained the bacterial zzso for division, whereas zzso lack zzso except in some lower zzso Instead, zzso division involves a zzso zzso suggesting that zzso retained the bacterial division system, whereas a zzso system replaced the bacterial system in zzso during zzso In this study, we identified a novel zzso group of zzso from the primitive red zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso division and zzso analyses showed that the protein zzso associates with the zzso only during zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso appears in zzso patches just before zzso division and is recruited to the zzso side of the zzso division site to form a ring in the late stage of zzso The ring zzso until division is complete, after which it zzso These results show that a zzso protein also zzso in zzso division and that its behavior differs from that of zzso and zzso rings that form before zzso at the site of zzso Combined with the results of a recent study of zzso division in zzso our findings led us to zzso that when first established in lower zzso zzso and zzso divided using a very similar system that included the zzso ring, the zzso ring, and the zzso zzso
