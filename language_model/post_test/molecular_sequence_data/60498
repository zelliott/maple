Although zzso interactions are known to be essential for zzso of cell fate in many zzso zzso the signals and receptors responsible for zzso this information remain largely zzso Mice with zzso in the zzso zzso gene have defects in hair zzso zzso lack sweat zzso and have zzso zzso These structures originate as zzso zzso which zzso into the underlying zzso and differentiate to form specific zzso zzso cloning of the zzso gene began with identification of the transgenic family zzso One branch of the family, zzso carries an approximately zzso deletion at the zzso locus caused by zzso zzso The zzso locus has been physically mapped in this family, and a zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified and shown to rescue the zzso zzso in the spontaneous zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso dominant zzso zzso Here we report the zzso cloning of the zzso zzso which encodes a novel member of the zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso expression pattern suggests that this gene encodes a zzso that specifies hair zzso zzso Its zzso is likely to be the product of the zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso have a zzso identical to that of zzso zzso and zzso encodes a zzso zzso
