zzso N zzso from human zzso actively zzso various zzso peptides from their zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso factor gamma 2, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso N also actively zzso zzso hormones zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso peptides zzso and zzso zzso from their zzso In addition, zzso II, zzso zzso II zzso fragment, zzso zzso and insulin were tested for zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso values for the zzso zzso acid, zzso a liberation from zzso were 267 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the human zzso membrane fraction was almost completely neutralized by zzso N zzso Our present study suggests that possible roles for surface zzso zzso N in the human zzso would be to zzso the action of zzso peptides as well as zzso and zzso hormones, and to control both zzso and zzso of zzso
