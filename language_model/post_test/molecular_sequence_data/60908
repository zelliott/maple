Fruit fly species of the zzso zzso show a remarkable variation in zzso zzso Some of them produce gigantic zzso several times the total male body zzso zzso of zzso zzso for example, are more than 20 zzso zzso Little is known about the advantage of such zzso zzso or about the proteins that stabilize their thin zzso zzso Recently, two members of a novel gene family zzso and zzso whose gene products are associated with the zzso tail, were isolated and zzso Here a third member of this gene family, zzso is zzso It was previously demonstrated that all three genes are located in a single small cluster on zzso 5 of zzso zzso They are located within 15 zzso of zzso DNA, oriented in the same direction and transcribed zzso The zzso zzso zzso proteins are mainly composed of zzso arranged repeats of a highly charged, zzso motif of 16 zzso acids with the consensus sequence zzso zzso with synthetic repeat zzso and zzso have demonstrated a tendency for zzso rod formation, which increased strongly with an increase in repeat zzso zzso zzso proteins with zzso repeats with regularly spaced zzso are thus expected to form long zzso rods zzso by numerous zzso zzso Here we apply zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso to investigate the distribution of zzso proteins within the zzso tail of zzso zzso We show that zzso proteins are part of the outer sheath of the zzso tail where they presumably help to provide a tight but elastic envelope for the extremely extended zzso of zzso zzso
