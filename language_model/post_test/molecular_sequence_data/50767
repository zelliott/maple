Recently we reported the presence of both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors in the rat zzso Since zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso production in zzso and because zzso has previously been shown to mimic the actions of zzso in regulating zzso zzso zzso studies were performed to investigate the effects of zzso II on zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, employing zzso of zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which bind only the zzso zzso the role of the zzso receptors in the zzso actions of zzso II was zzso In zzso zzso of fed rats zzso II, but not zzso and analog I, inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, analog I did not alter the ability of zzso II to inhibit zzso zzso zzso II, but not zzso and analog I, also zzso zzso production in zzso rat zzso Furthermore, while zzso II inhibited the activity ratio of zzso zzso by zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, in rat zzso zzso II zzso the synthesis of zzso from zzso by 50% and this effect of zzso II was zzso by the zzso supplied zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso II increases zzso zzso and zzso zzso in part by zzso zzso zzso activity, and the effects of zzso II are zzso via zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors which elevate zzso zzso
