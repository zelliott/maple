Wild zzso zzso zzso zzso is an attractive model system for studying zzso in zzso fruit, because of its small zzso zzso its short zzso cycle, and its capacity for zzso We have isolated eight zzso zzso from this species after differential screening of a zzso zzso The predicted zzso of seven of the clones exhibit similarity to database protein zzso including zzso carrier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso major latex zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso A ninth zzso clone that was zzso expressed is predicted to zzso a zzso zzso None of these proteins appear to be directly related to events generally associated with zzso such as cell wall metabolism or the zzso of zzso and zzso rather, their putative functions are indicative of the wide range of processes zzso during fruit zzso
