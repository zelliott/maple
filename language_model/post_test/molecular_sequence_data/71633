zzso zzso a major research model in zzso molecular biology, has been zzso through six generations of sibling zzso Though viability initially zzso as described earlier, the zzso line now consists of healthy, fertile zzso These are intended to serve as a zzso resource in which the level of zzso is decreased with respect to wild zzso zzso To zzso the zzso animals eight simple sequence zzso repeats were isolated, in context, and zzso zzso were generated against the zzso zzso zzso Distribution and zzso of these regions of the zzso were studied in the zzso of 27 wild individuals and in a sample of the zzso animals at zzso and F3 zzso All eight regions were zzso though to different zzso and their zzso was increased by zzso as zzso The eight markers suffice to identify zzso the cellular DNA of any wild or F3 zzso zzso zzso
