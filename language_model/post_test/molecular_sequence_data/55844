Blood and zzso zzso from a zzso girl were submitted to the Australian Animal Health zzso Clinical signs and zzso zzso had suggested a diagnosis of zzso but, an unusually long incubation period of at least 5 years did not encourage such a zzso zzso examinations by the rapid fluorescent focus zzso test revealed a dramatic increase in rabies zzso zzso during the 10-day period of zzso The results of a fluorescent zzso test on brain zzso and an zzso test on zzso sections of brain were also consistent with a diagnosis of zzso Attempts to isolate virus were zzso zzso chain reactions zzso were conducted on a zzso suspension of a zzso sample from the patient's brain, using zzso based on the published sequence of the zzso virus strain of rabies zzso 413 and zzso zzso fragments from the zzso gene and a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso gene were zzso zzso sequencing of these fragments, and comparison with equivalent regions of known rabies zzso confirmed that the fragments originated from a virus belonging to the rabies virus zzso This case demonstrated the advantage of using a range of laboratory techniques to obtain a definitive zzso In particular, a zzso test may allow a diagnosis, even in the face of conditions that zzso virus isolation such as apparently occurred in this zzso Finally, this case demonstrated that an unusually long incubation period should not discourage a tentative clinical diagnosis of zzso
