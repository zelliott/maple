We have previously reported that the accessory protein zzso from human zzso virus type 1 forms zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso and is able to zzso intact cultured zzso by causing an inward sodium zzso resulting in cell zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso and synthetic peptides to identify the structural regions responsible for the above zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso were found to affect channel activity, whereas this activity was not affected by zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso acids 53 to zzso Analysis of zzso containing changes in the basic C zzso confirmed previous results that this region, although not necessary for zzso channel function, was responsible for the observed zzso of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso the first 40 zzso zzso acids of zzso zzso was found to be sufficient to form zzso channels similar to those caused by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was able to cause zzso of the zzso and cell death in cultured zzso zzso with a time course similar to that seen with zzso zzso supporting the idea that this region is responsible for zzso zzso channel function and zzso zzso Since zzso is found in the serum and zzso zzso of AIDS patients, these results may have significance for AIDS zzso
