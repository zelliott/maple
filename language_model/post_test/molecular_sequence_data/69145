Recently, a pair of zzso zzso have been described that make it possible to amplify a highly zzso zzso locus zzso zzso zzso products range in size from approximately 650 to zzso zzso zzso X zzso from unrelated Caucasian subjects were zzso zzso of the zzso products with zzso revealed the presence of a zzso zzso restriction site within the product 200 zzso from the zzso This restriction site is present on zzso and absent on zzso of all zzso but the absence is confined solely to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, there is a strong zzso association between the most frequent zzso zzso zzso and the absence of the zzso restriction zzso zzso of this zzso within the zzso zzso region increases the expected zzso at the zzso locus from zzso to zzso This increases the fraction of zzso A families where this marker is zzso for indirect prenatal diagnosis and carrier zzso
