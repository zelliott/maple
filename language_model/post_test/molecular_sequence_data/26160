A mouse zzso zzso designated zzso has been cloned based on its zzso by serum in zzso zzso zzso Here we report the full-length complementary DNA sequence and a partial zzso There are about five copies of the gene in the mouse zzso zzso analysis of the zzso coding region reveals 94 and zzso zzso acid identity to human and rat zzso zzso Although the coding region has been highly zzso during evolution of the zzso and human zzso the untranslated zzso sequences differ zzso A protein of Mr about 8000 was produced by in zzso translation of the zzso transcribed in zzso from zzso complementary DNA in a zzso zzso An zzso raised against a portion of the predicted human zzso protein zzso with this mouse zzso zzso zzso was found in greatest amount in zzso containing zzso cells, zzso zzso skin, stomach, zzso of pregnant zzso zzso and zzso zzso liver, mature zzso and skeletal muscle had little or no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were higher in cells treated with zzso and zzso than in their normal counterparts, suggesting a role in zzso In addition, high zzso zzso levels were associated with zzso ability in a series of zzso cells, in proportion to levels of zzso zzso expressed by the cells, implicating zzso even more deeply in zzso
