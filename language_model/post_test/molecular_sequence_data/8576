We have characterized a so-called D zzso specific repetitive DNA sequence zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14, zzso zzso with respect to its DNA sequence and its distribution among zzso zzso The clone consisted of three units of a repetitive DNA sequence of 336 or 337 base pairs, and was AT rich zzso DNA analyses revealed the presence of the zzso sequences in other zzso of zzso species, although the repetition was greatly (as much as zzso variable among the zzso The repetitive sequences from 10 zzso species were amplified using zzso with specific zzso and the sequential zzso was analyzed by the zzso pattern obtained with five restriction zzso Since the zzso site was the most conservatively present in the unit of the repetitive zzso we named them zzso zzso The analysis clearly displayed the variation of the repetitive sequences regardless of the uniformity of the size of the amplified zzso These results indicated that zzso amplification events of these repetitive sequences happened independently in the zzso evolution of zzso
