zzso zzso is an zzso drug used extensively for the treatment of tuberculosis caused by zzso zzso zzso targets the zzso of the cell wall, zzso the synthesis of both zzso and zzso zzso and is assumed to act via zzso of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are required for the synthesis of zzso and at least one zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso is essential in zzso zzso zzso is also essential for the viability of zzso tuberculosis but is involved in the synthesis of zzso We show that zzso in zzso that reduce its zzso activity result in increased sensitivity to zzso and the production of smaller zzso species in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was not tolerated in zzso zzso but zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso led to zzso resistance and the production of larger zzso species in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso tuberculosis strains with zzso led to zzso of zzso zzso resulting in the production of smaller species of zzso In contrast, no change in zzso production was seen in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso tuberculosis also resulted in zzso resistance, but at a lower level than that caused by zzso zzso of zzso in zzso tuberculosis had no effect on zzso zzso Thus, there is a direct correlation between zzso activity and zzso resistance, as well as between zzso activity and the size of the zzso species produced, confirming that zzso is one of the cellular targets of zzso zzso
