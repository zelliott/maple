zzso is a highly zzso zzso gene found in all zzso zzso that have been fully zzso to zzso The putative zzso protein contains a zinc finger domain and has been previously described as a major early zzso We generated an zzso zzso zzso as well as a repair virus zzso carrying zzso with a zzso zzso zzso tag, under the control of its native early and late promoter zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso resulted in a zzso reduction in zzso zzso production compared to both the parental zzso zzso multiple zzso virus and the repair zzso demonstrating that although zzso is not essential for zzso replication is compromised in its zzso Our data also suggest that zzso does not affect DNA zzso Cell zzso showed that zzso is found in both the nucleus and the zzso as early as 6 h zzso zzso of the early zzso start site resulted in a zzso to zzso reduction of zzso zzso however, deletion of the late promoter zzso resulted in a zzso to zzso reduction, suggesting that, in the context of zzso production, zzso is required both early and late in the infection zzso Additional Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso from the repair virus revealed that zzso is associated with both zzso and zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso although not essential for viral zzso is required for efficient zzso zzso
