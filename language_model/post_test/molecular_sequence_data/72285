A study of zzso and species divergence of the zzso gene of zzso has been zzso zzso lines from a population of zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso coding for the zzso zzso A comparison was made with sequence from zzso zzso zzso silent zzso and three zzso acid replacement zzso were zzso The overall silent zzso zzso is low, but zzso diversity zzso for effectively silent sites and zzso for all zzso is in the range found for zzso zzso zzso acid variation is absent in the zzso signal zzso the zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso half of the zzso zzso At the zzso level there is strong conservation in the middle half of the zzso and in the 3' untranslated sequence of the last zzso The 3' untranslated zzso which is perfect for 110 zzso among all the divergent species, is zzso There is strong positive linkage zzso among zzso sites, with stretches of apparent gene conversion among originally divergent zzso The population apparently is a migration mixture of divergent zzso
