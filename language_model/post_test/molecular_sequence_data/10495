The three-dimensional zzso of proteins is a useful tool to fill the gap between the number of zzso proteins and the number of zzso known zzso zzso However, when the degree of zzso between the protein and the available zzso templates is low, model building becomes a difficult task and the reliability of the results depends critically on the correctness of the sequence zzso For this reason, we have undertaken the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso starting by a careful analysis of several sequence alignment strategies (multiple sequence alignments and the zzso zzso zzso The best results were obtained using zzso followed by a manual refinement to avoid unlikely zzso Because zzso uses secondary structure predictions, several methods that are available for this purpose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have also been evaluated on zzso zzso with known zzso zzso More reliable predictions on zzso have been obtained with zzso which is the method implemented in zzso Thus, a zzso model for human zzso zzso zzso has been built using the known crystal coordinates of zzso zzso as the zzso The model was refined using molecular mechanics zzso The model obtained shows a consistent location of the zzso recognition segments previously zzso for the zzso family zzso The interaction of caffeine and a zzso aromatic zzso zzso which are characteristic zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso were zzso taking into account their molecular zzso potential zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso in the active site of the model was explored with the zzso zzso followed by molecular mechanics zzso of the most interesting zzso zzso complexes were obtained that could explain the zzso of the considered zzso by zzso zzso zzso and could offer an insight into the role played by water zzso
