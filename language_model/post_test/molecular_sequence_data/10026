zzso restriction zzso zzso zzso on zzso DNA between the first and second bases to generate a four base zzso zzso restriction zzso was zzso from the native zzso zzso zzso cells and its zzso zzso acid sequence was zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to amplify the first 20 zzso of the zzso restriction zzso zzso The zzso restriction zzso gene zzso and the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were cloned in zzso coli by amplification of zzso zzso zzso DNA using zzso and inverse zzso zzso zzso zzso contains all 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso but motifs IX and X zzso motifs zzso Thus, the zzso motifs of zzso zzso are zzso zzso relative to the motif organizations of other zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et al zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso share zzso identity in zzso acid sequences from motifs zzso and zzso identity in motifs zzso A zzso zzso is located upstream of a TV zzso in the zzso of zzso that may be responsible for the recognition of the zzso zzso of the target zzso The zzso restriction zzso gene was expressed in zzso via a zzso expression zzso
