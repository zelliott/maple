It has been reported that decreased zzso expression leads to zzso zzso zzso in human retinal pigmented zzso cells, and zzso may process the zzso zzso zzso (the zzso equivalent of the zzso zzso zzso into small interfering zzso zzso In this study, we aimed to address whether zzso can process zzso zzso and their common zzso zzso zzso Using zzso sequencing technology, we showed that zzso small zzso accounted for zzso of the total cellular small zzso in zzso cells, and the abundance decreased when zzso was knocked zzso However, zzso small zzso showed different characteristics from zzso and zzso the classic zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that small zzso derived from zzso zzso accounted for zzso of the total cellular small zzso in the control cells, and the abundance dropped about zzso folds in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso small zzso was validated by northern zzso In zzso zzso zzso using the zzso human zzso protein also showed that synthetic zzso zzso was processed by zzso into fragments of different zzso Further functional analysis suggested that zzso zzso small zzso do not function like zzso neither do they regulate the expression of zzso zzso In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that zzso can process zzso zzso however, the biological significance remains to be zzso
