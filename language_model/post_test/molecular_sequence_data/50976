We have produced zzso zzso zzso fragments in bacteria specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used for the cloning and modification of the heavy and light variable regions zzso and zzso of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso acid zzso was used in the synthesis of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso regions were amplified from zzso by zzso using zzso end zzso and 3' end constant region zzso and then zzso zzso was then amplified by zzso using an exact zzso end zzso zzso and a zzso zzso 3' end primer for zzso that also zzso the first 7 zzso acids of the zzso zzso was amplified with a zzso zzso end primer for zzso also zzso the remaining 7 zzso acids of the zzso and a 3' end primer for zzso plus a stop zzso and a zzso restriction zzso The fragments were zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3' end zzso The zzso structure was zzso into expression zzso bearing the zzso promoter and zzso or zzso signal zzso zzso Culture zzso bacteria zzso and zzso preparations were zzso in Western zzso and a protein of about 27 zzso was identified with rabbit zzso specific for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso preparations also inhibited the recognition of zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso preparations were zzso by affinity zzso with specific zzso zzso The Western zzso of the zzso identified a protein of approximately 27 zzso that blocked the recognition of zzso by zzso zzso in zzso The zzso structure was cloned into a zzso bearing the zzso promoter and the zzso signal zzso The zzso bacterial clones also expressed about 27 zzso zzso specific for zzso
