As part of a study carried out for detecting zzso zzso in zzso three zzso zzso that were zzso slightly curved zzso zzso zzso showed a new zzso zzso pattern with a specific identification method for the species of this zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene and those of the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso provided evidence that these zzso strains belonged to an unknown genetic lineage within the zzso zzso The similarity between the zzso zzso gene sequence of the representative strain zzso and type strains of the other zzso species ranged between zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with the recently proposed species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results between strain zzso and the type strain of the latter species were below zzso zzso zzso characteristics together with zzso mass zzso differentiated the new zzso strains from all other zzso zzso All the results indicate that these strains represent a new species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
