Three muscle zzso zzso T zzso genes are present in zzso to zzso a number of protein zzso via alternative zzso zzso While the zzso structures of cardiac and fast skeletal muscle zzso genes have been zzso this study cloned and characterized the slow skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso Complete zzso sequence and zzso organization revealed that the mouse zzso gene spans zzso and contains 14 zzso which is smaller and simpler than the fast skeletal muscle and cardiac zzso zzso Potentially representing a zzso of the zzso gene family, the zzso of the zzso gene contains fewer zzso large zzso among which two alternatively spliced zzso are responsible for the zzso variation of three zzso zzso The zzso gene structure shows that the alternatively spliced central segment found in human zzso zzso may be a result from zzso using an alternative zzso site at the zzso zzso 12 zzso Together with the zzso protein structure, the highly specific expression of zzso in slow skeletal muscles indicates a differentiated function of this member of the zzso gene zzso The determination of zzso structure and alternative zzso pathways of zzso gene lays a foundation to further understand the zzso zzso evolution as well as zzso characteristics of different types of muscle zzso
