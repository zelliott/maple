The receptors for human zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso consist of an alpha zzso specific for each zzso and a beta zzso common to zzso zzso and zzso We cloned zzso DNA covering zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region of the zzso alpha gene and identified multiple zzso start sites by zzso and primer extension zzso By use of transient zzso experiments, two regions zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso of the zzso alpha promoter appeared to have significant zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed the binding of zzso and unidentified proteins to these zzso zzso of a putative zzso binding site did not affect the promoter zzso We then analyzed zzso zzso of the zzso alpha gene and found the zzso zzso binding site to be important for zzso activity, as previously zzso These results suggest that different zzso zzso mechanisms are employed for the zzso regulation of zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso
