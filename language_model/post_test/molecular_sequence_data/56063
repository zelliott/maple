zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso present in zzso from a group of patients with zzso zzso are directed against zzso Previous work, using zzso constructions spanning most of the zzso protein defined the main zzso site between the zzso acids zzso zzso and predicted the presence of other putative zzso sites in the zzso Fusion proteins from new zzso zzso spanning zzso regions between zzso zzso and zzso were not recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso representing sequences from putative zzso regions or previously untested regions, allowed a precise definition of four zzso sites located between peptides zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were zzso respectively, by 14, 8, 1 and 2 out of 15 zzso zzso zzso The minimal sequence of the main zzso site zzso zzso recognized by the zzso was established to be zzso zzso zzso In addition, deletion and replacement experiments showed that zzso 263 zzso was essential for the binding of the zzso to zzso zzso Analysis of the second most frequently recognized zzso between zzso zzso was performed using peptides zzso and zzso in competitive zzso zzso Complete elimination of zzso binding to zzso zzso obtained by zzso of both shorter peptides indicated that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reacting against zzso zzso recognized either both the shorter peptides or just one of them zzso zzso of the present study suggest that the production of zzso zzso is an zzso zzso or zzso B cell zzso The identification of zzso sites will zzso zzso the development of specific diagnostic tests and zzso further studies on the zzso value of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
