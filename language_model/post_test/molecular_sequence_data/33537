Human zzso is an emerging food-borne public health problem, with the number of cases increasing worldwide, especially in mainland zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of this severe zzso However, little is known about the zzso and basic biology of zzso zzso 

A zzso library of zzso zzso zzso larvae was constructed, and approximately 1,200 clones were zzso zzso analyses revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso of which matched known genes at a zzso expectation value of zzso Of these zzso unique zzso zzso contained open reading frames zzso proteins containing an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the functions of these zzso proteins by Gene zzso analysis showed enrichment in proteins with binding and zzso zzso The observed pattern of zzso involved in protein zzso zzso metabolism and zzso may reflect the central nervous system habitat of this zzso Four proteins were tested for their zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The specificity of each of the four proteins was superior to that of crude zzso and zzso zzso of larvae, although their sensitivity was relatively zzso We further showed that mice zzso with zzso zzso a product of one of the four zzso candidate zzso were partially protected from zzso zzso zzso 

The data presented here substantially expand the available genetic information about the human pathogen zzso zzso and should be a significant resource for zzso zzso As such, this work serves as a starting point for molecular approaches for diagnosing and controlling human zzso
