zzso zzso plays a critical role in cellular metabolism of zzso by serving as a major regulator of zzso This zzso zzso is zzso regulated by different zzso zzso mainly zzso In response to binding of zzso molecules and zzso significant structural changes have been identified in various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is exceptional among known zzso of zzso origin in that it exhibits no zzso property in the presence of commonly known zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been solved by molecular replacement techniques and refined to zzso zzso zzso In the active site a zzso zzso is located near the zzso site of zzso and the protein structure displays a partially closed active zzso However, unlike other structures where the active site is closed, the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and assumes an extended zzso In the crystal structure a zzso zzso is found at a site that is occupied by a zzso of the zzso zzso in many zzso zzso zzso A new feature of the zzso zzso zzso zzso structure is the presence of a zzso bond zzso the two zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso bond is formed between zzso zzso 26 in the short zzso of one zzso with zzso zzso 312 in a long zzso zzso zzso of the second zzso at the interface of these zzso Both zzso zzso are unique to zzso zzso and the zzso bond remained intact in a reduced zzso However, the significance of this bond, if any, remains unknown at this zzso
