zzso the genetic changes driving zzso variation in natural populations is key to understanding the origins of zzso The mosaic of zzso wing patterns in zzso butterflies makes an excellent system for exploring zzso variation using next-generation zzso In this study, we use a combination of techniques to zzso the zzso zzso modulating red color pattern variation, identify a narrow region responsible for zzso divergence and convergence in zzso wing color patterns, and explore the evolutionary history of these zzso zzso We use whole zzso zzso from four hybrid zones between divergent color pattern races of zzso zzso and two hybrid zones of the zzso zzso zzso to examine genetic variation across zzso zzso of a partial reference zzso In the zzso region near zzso the gene previously shown to be responsible for the complex red pattern variation in zzso population genetic analyses identify a shared zzso region of divergence that includes several sites perfectly associated with zzso within each zzso This region likely contains multiple zzso elements that control discrete expression zzso of zzso The parallel signatures of genetic differentiation in zzso zzso and zzso zzso support a shared genetic architecture between the two zzso related zzso however, zzso analysis suggests zzso patterns in each species evolved zzso Using a combination of next-generation sequencing zzso we have refined our understanding of the genetic architecture of wing pattern variation in zzso and gained important insights into the evolution of novel zzso zzso in natural zzso
