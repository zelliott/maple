An zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from dust samples collected in the high atmosphere above zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the strain was within the radiation of zzso zzso The major zzso zzso acids were zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso Strong resistance to zzso zzso and gamma radiation and high DNA zzso content also supported the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity value zzso to the type strain of zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that it was further separated from zzso zzso than from zzso zzso indicating that strain zzso was not a member of these two zzso zzso In addition, zzso differences were found between strain zzso and the type strains of these two zzso zzso zzso a novel species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate this zzso
