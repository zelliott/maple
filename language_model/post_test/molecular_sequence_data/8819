We have identified and characterized the gene for a novel zinc finger zzso factor which we have termed lung zzso factor zzso zzso was isolated through the use of the zinc finger domain of zzso zzso factor zzso as a zzso probe and is closely related to this zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a limited number of zzso with the zzso expression seen in the lungs and zzso The gene is zzso controlled, with expression noted in the zzso zzso followed by a zzso at 11 days and subsequent zzso A high degree of similarity is noted in the zinc finger regions of zzso and zzso Beyond this domain, the sequences diverge significantly, although the putative zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso are zzso zzso In the zzso domain, the three zinc finger motifs are so closely zzso that the predicted DNA contact sites are zzso suggesting that both proteins may bind to the same core zzso This was further suggested by zzso zzso in which mouse zzso were zzso zzso with a human zzso reporter gene in the absence and presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene activates this human zzso promoter containing the zzso sequence previously shown to be a binding site for zzso zzso of this potential binding site results in a significant reduction in the reporter gene zzso zzso and zzso can thus be grouped as members of a unique family of zzso factors which have discrete patterns of expression in different zzso and which appear to recognize the same zzso zzso
