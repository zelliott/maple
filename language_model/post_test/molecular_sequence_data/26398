When a human fetal muscle zzso library was screened with the human zzso hormone zzso alpha 2 zzso at low zzso we found a zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the insert was zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids and a predicted molecular mass of 64 zzso The zzso domain and the zzso domain are similar to those of steroid and zzso hormone zzso Moreover, this zzso is highly zzso to mouse zzso and rat zzso which are early response genes induced by nerve growth factor and other serum growth zzso We designated this gene zzso The zzso of expression of zzso during stimulation of cell growth was zzso The zzso of zzso was induced rapidly and zzso by zzso agents, such as zzso zzso in monkey kidney cells zzso by zzso in human zzso and by serum stimulation of arrested zzso It is expressed in human fetal muscle and adult liver, brain, and zzso zzso could be a nuclear zzso It will be of great interest to determine the zzso for zzso and the genes that are regulated by zzso
