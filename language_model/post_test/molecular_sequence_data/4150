zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are important zzso for the metabolism of zzso zzso from the family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that are targets of current zzso zzso Very limited information exists on the levels of genetic zzso of these zzso in natural populations of any zzso zzso We present results of a survey of zzso variation in the genes coding for those zzso in a large sample of strains from zzso zzso the agent of zzso zzso We discuss the results from an evolutionary zzso A sample of 31 strains show 39 silent and five zzso acid zzso in zzso and 35 silent and 11 zzso acid zzso in zzso No zzso acid replacements occur in regions that are important for the zzso activity of these zzso but some zzso occur in sites previously assumed to be zzso The sequences from both genes cluster in four major groups, a result that is not fully consistent with the current zzso of zzso zzso in two major groups of zzso Most zzso zzso to fixed differences among the four sequence zzso Two tests of neutrality show that there is no evidence of zzso divergence or of selective events having shaped the distribution of zzso and fixed differences in these genes in zzso zzso However, one nearly significant reduction of variation in the zzso sequences from one sequence group suggests a recent selective event at, or close to, that zzso
