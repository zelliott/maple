The origin and demographic history of the ethnic populations of China have not been clearly zzso In this study, we examined the zzso segment I sequences zzso of the zzso DNA control region in zzso individuals from nine Chinese populations and one northern Thai zzso A relatively high percentage of individuals was found to share sequences with those from other populations of the same zzso In general, the populations of southern or zzso tribal origin showed high zzso diversity and zzso diversity compared with the populations of northern or zzso tribal zzso zzso zzso from these populations showed zzso zzso All except the northern groups zzso zzso Tibetan, and Mongolian showed typical signatures of ancient population expansions in the mismatch zzso and neutrality zzso zzso of extreme size reduction in the past are one of the likely explanations for the absence of evidence of expansion in northern zzso Small sample sizes as well as samples from isolated zzso contributed to the bumpy mismatch zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso sharing among populations suggest that current zzso variation in these ethnic populations could reveal their zzso to some extent, but in general, linguistic and geographic zzso of the populations did not agree well with zzso by zzso zzso
