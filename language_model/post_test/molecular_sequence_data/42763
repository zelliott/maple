To assess the usefulness of zzso modeling of zzso as an aid in design of zzso DNA, the efficiency of zzso of translation of rabbit zzso zzso by various zzso sequences was compared with calculated structures of the zzso The model obtained by consideration of 30 zzso zzso structures is consistent with the high accessibility of the zzso initiation zzso region known from zzso with zzso and with previous zzso zzso studies reported in the zzso Additional zzso zzso data were obtained with zzso zzso zzso targeted to regions of zzso zzso differing moderately in their degree of participation in zzso zzso The efficiency of translation arrest by the zzso in zzso expression systems zzso germ extract and rabbit zzso zzso was obtained by measuring incorporation of zzso into total zzso and corrected for zzso zzso using zzso mosaic virus zzso In the presence of zzso H zzso germ zzso the zzso activity of the zzso showed correlation with the calculated secondary structure of zzso in particular at low zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso No correlation was observed in the zzso zzso system, in which the zzso is zzso by zzso zzso
