Water and zzso transport across the plasma membrane of cells is a crucial biological function that is zzso mainly by zzso and zzso The regulation of these membrane proteins is still incompletely zzso Using the male zzso tract as a model system in which water and zzso transport are critical for the establishment of zzso we now report a novel zzso for the regulation of zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso of the zzso liver, and peripheral zzso and its zzso portion contains a putative zzso binding motif zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso membrane of principal cells of the zzso and the zzso zzso and that both zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso binds to both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso with an apparently higher affinity for zzso versus zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso motif is essential for interaction with zzso zzso zzso on isolated zzso zzso in zzso showed a high zzso of the zzso membrane to zzso which is inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso and is markedly activated by zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all significantly reduced the zzso zzso cell zzso We propose that zzso is an important regulator of zzso and that the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso may facilitate the zzso of zzso by zzso
