The genes that zzso the five known zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso The genes for zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso these genes and that for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Powers, zzso zzso & Kenyon, zzso zzso (1988) zzso 27, zzso are organized in an zzso zzso zzso zzso has regions of sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso I and II from zzso zzso zzso zzso is predicted to be zzso zzso acids in length and to have a molecular weight of zzso it has regions of sequence similarity to zzso zzso from spinach and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is predicted to be zzso zzso acids in length and to have a molecular weight of zzso it has regions of sequence similarity to zzso that zzso zzso with zzso zzso as zzso These observations support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso evolved by recruitment of zzso from zzso zzso zzso The gene for zzso zzso has been expressed in zzso coli with the zzso promoter, and homogeneous zzso has been isolated from induced zzso
