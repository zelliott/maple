A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a soil sample collected near zzso zzso power plant in zzso The isolate could grow at temperatures between 35 and 70 zzso zzso 55 zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The strain formed zzso circular colonies and tolerated up to 70 zzso zzso Its DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The zzso contained zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with small amounts of zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene revealed zzso sequence similarity with all recognized species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the greatest sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso both had zzso similarity to strain zzso as well as to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed low levels of zzso with the closest relatives of strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the results obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the isolate is proposed to represent a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso
