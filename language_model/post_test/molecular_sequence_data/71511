The zzso zzso protein zzso is required for spore zzso in zzso zzso In contrast to the multiple zzso spore wall assembly patterns seen even within a single zzso zzso zzso different zzso zzso zzso block in a coordinated fashion at intermediate zzso One zzso zzso forms zzso in which the four spores are surrounded only by zzso zzso structures, while another zzso zzso forms zzso in which the spores are surrounded by inner but not outer spore wall zzso zzso increases in gene dosage of a zzso zzso zzso allow for the completion of progressively later zzso and zzso events and for the acquisition of distinct zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso spore zzso can be zzso by reducing zzso zzso zzso The data demonstrate that zzso is required for the execution of multiple steps in spore zzso that require increasing thresholds of zzso zzso These results suggest that quantitative changes in zzso protein zzso signaling play a role in zzso multiple events of a single cellular differentiation zzso
