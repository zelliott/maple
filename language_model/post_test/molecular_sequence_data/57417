To gain insight into mechanisms underlying local immune responses in zzso arthritis zzso we analyzed the zzso of zzso heavy chain zzso diversity zzso and joining zzso gene segments expressed in zzso tissue of a patient with zzso 

An unrestricted complementary DNA zzso library was generated from zzso cells extracted from zzso tissue obtained at the time of joint zzso Southern zzso analysis for zzso zzso and C gamma zzso zzso was performed on the first 50 C zzso and zzso zzso for which zzso DNA was zzso zzso of the clones were selected at random for sequence zzso The zzso gene segments were compared with an extensive database of zzso and zzso zzso 

All transcripts zzso gene segments from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso There was a predominance of zzso zzso and zzso gene segment zzso Fourteen of 18 randomly zzso clones contained sufficient zzso information for zzso Eight zzso were most closely related to zzso gene segments that are zzso expressed in human fetal liver or that zzso zzso with zzso The variable zzso were heavily zzso and zzso substitution ratios zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso regions zzso were disproportionately zzso zzso lengths were quite zzso due to extensive zzso addition and zzso activity in the zzso zzso 

Plasma cells in this zzso tissue sample appear to express zzso gene segments that are zzso zzso during fetal development or in zzso The zzso repertoire is similar to that seen in adult peripheral blood zzso but much different from that found during fetal zzso The large number of zzso zzso and the high zzso ratios in the zzso suggest an zzso zzso
