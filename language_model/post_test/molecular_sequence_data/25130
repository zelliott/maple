A zzso DNA zzso probe targeting the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was developed and its high specificity demonstrated by zzso zzso Even under relaxed zzso and washing conditions (20 degrees C below zzso the probe was highly selective in that positive signals were only detected with zzso zzso about half of the zzso and one of the fast-growing reference zzso and zzso zzso At more stringent washing temperatures (6 degrees C below zzso only the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso
