zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently identified and described as a major novel zzso zzso in zzso In this study, we aimed to study the zzso and zzso expression pattern of zzso zzso zzso and the effect of zzso zzso on expression of zzso in zzso The full-length zzso sequence of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso protein (the predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the deduced AA sequence with the zzso zzso zzso dog, and human zzso zzso zzso showed 87, 84, 83, 81, and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso was highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso to a lesser degree in zzso heart, and muscle, and least but zzso in zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was low at birth (1 zzso of zzso and then increased, reaching a zzso value at 20 zzso of zzso zzso 8 zzso old; P zzso zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso the greatest expression of zzso was observed at 40 zzso of zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso In zzso exposure of cultured zzso to 40 and 80 zzso zzso for 24 h increased the zzso levels of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was decreased by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When treated with zzso for 48 zzso the zzso levels of zzso were increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As expected, zzso zzso was decreased by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results add to our understanding of the role of zzso in zzso tissue development and as a potential target for regulating fat deposition and meat zzso
