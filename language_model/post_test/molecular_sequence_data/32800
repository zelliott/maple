zzso capture zzso zzso offers many advantages over the more traditional fragmentation techniques for the analysis of peptides and zzso although the question remains: How suitable is zzso for incorporation within zzso strategies for the identification of zzso Here, we compare zzso and zzso as techniques for the identification of zzso zzso were performed on a hybrid linear zzso zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso zzso analyses of a zzso zzso serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso and zzso zzso digest were performed and the results analyzed on the basis of overall protein sequence coverage and sequence tag lengths within individual zzso The results show that although protein coverage was lower for zzso than for zzso zzso resulted in longer zzso sequence zzso providing greater confidence in protein zzso
