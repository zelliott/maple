zzso on the same zzso as the zzso Growth Factor II zzso an important factor regulating fetal growth, the zzso zzso is believed to play a role during zzso and to share similar regulatory elements with zzso possibly by an zzso competition zzso This study was designed to characterize the zzso of zzso in sheep and the effect of maternal zzso on the expression of fetal zzso and zzso zzso A partial zzso clone for the zzso zzso gene was isolated and used as a probe for zzso protection zzso The zzso of zzso in liver, skeletal muscle and heart of zzso fetuses at zzso and 130 days, zzso at 1 month and adult sheep revealed high tissue levels of zzso zzso during fetal life that decreased significantly after zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased fetal liver zzso zzso expression but did not alter fetal zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso like zzso may play an important role in the regulation of fetal growth and define an environmental condition zzso these two genes are regulated zzso
