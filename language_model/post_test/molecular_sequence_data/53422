The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso plays a major role in zinc zzso by inducing the expression of several genes under zzso growth zzso This zzso of gene expression is zzso by binding of the protein to one or more zzso elements present in the promoters of its target zzso To better understand how zzso functions, we mapped its DNA binding domain using a combined in zzso and in zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso DNA binding domain maps to the zzso zzso zzso acids of the zzso this region contains five of its seven potential zinc finger zzso zzso this region to the zzso zzso domain zzso a zzso zzso for low zinc growth and also zzso high level expression on a zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso bound to DNA with a high affinity zzso constant in the low zzso zzso similar to that of longer fragments of zzso Furthermore, by deletion and zzso zzso we demonstrated that each of the five zzso zinc fingers are required for high affinity DNA zzso
