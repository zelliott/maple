The development of zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso with balanced zzso to zzso bands zzso and zzso has recently been significantly related to previous treatment with several zzso drugs poisoning DNA zzso zzso A similar association was suspected for other balanced zzso aberrations such as the zzso characteristic of acute zzso leukemia zzso 

Two cases of acute zzso leukemia were observed following treatment for zzso with zzso zzso and zzso and treatment for breast cancer with zzso and subsequent zzso methotrexate, and zzso followed by zzso Both cases presented a zzso zzso and were examined for the characteristic zzso zzso of the zzso alpha and zzso genes observed in acute zzso leukemia zzso 

In both cases the characteristic zzso zzso was zzso Case zzso 2 in addition to the zzso showed an inversion of the long arm of a zzso zzso 5 and a zzso in all abnormal zzso zzso Despite these findings the patient obtained a complete zzso and zzso zzso of the leukemia following treatment with zzso zzso 

Based on these two cases and a review of the literature it is concluded that the development of zzso with the balanced zzso zzso is related to previous treatment with zzso drugs targeting DNA zzso II and that additional abnormalities of the long arms of zzso zzso 5 and zzso 7 do not interfere with the induction of zzso with zzso zzso
