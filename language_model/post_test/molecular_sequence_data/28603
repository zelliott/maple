zzso zzso necrosis virus zzso and viral zzso zzso virus zzso are two zzso zzso replicating at low temperatures zzso to 20 degrees zzso Both viruses belong to the zzso zzso but they are only zzso related and do not cross zzso By using a recently developed zzso system based on zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 2000), we investigated the ability to exchange zzso zzso G with that of zzso Thus, the zzso zzso was modified so that the zzso G gene replaced the complete zzso G zzso A zzso virus expressing zzso G instead of zzso G, zzso was generated and was shown to replicate as well as the zzso zzso in cell zzso This study was extended by exchanging zzso G with that of a fish zzso able to replicate at high temperatures (up to 28 degrees zzso the spring zzso of carp virus zzso zzso was successfully zzso however, its growth was restricted to 14 to 20 degrees zzso These results show the zzso sequence requirement for the zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso and also demonstrate that an zzso protein other than the G protein is responsible for the zzso restriction on zzso To determine to what extent the zzso zzso protein interacts with G, a series of zzso zzso zzso in which all or part of the M gene was replaced with the zzso counterpart was engineered and used to recover the respective zzso zzso Despite the very low percentage zzso of zzso acid identity between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso viable zzso zzso harboring either the zzso protein or both the zzso and the zzso protein from zzso were recovered and zzso Altogether, these data show the extreme flexibility of zzso to accommodate zzso structural zzso
