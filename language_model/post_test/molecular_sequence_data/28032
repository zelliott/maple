A zzso zzso clone for human zzso zzso was isolated and zzso which zzso an zzso active zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence comprises zzso zzso acids with an zzso signal zzso of 21 or 23 zzso and four potential zzso zzso Two of the zzso sites are zzso and were localized to the zzso zzso 47 and zzso zzso has the zzso properties of an integral membrane zzso The resistance of zzso toward zzso K after zzso into zzso suggests that most, if not all, sequences of zzso are exposed at the zzso side of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence predicts two zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso separated by a zzso zzso zzso We propose for zzso a zzso zzso Two zzso zzso oriented zzso of 161 and zzso zzso are separated by a zzso domain spanning the membrane twice in opposite zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells is located predominantly in the zzso zzso smaller zzso are found in the zzso at the cell surface, zzso zzso as well as in zzso The stability of zzso in zzso may be related to the high zzso of the two zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso zzso In spite of its similarity with these two zzso zzso zzso does not contain zzso zzso zzso and is transported to zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso
