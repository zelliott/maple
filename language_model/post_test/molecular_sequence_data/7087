zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso can be monitored by the zzso signal zzso arising from the induced release of a zzso dye in the course of the elapsed zzso time zzso We present a basic theoretical analysis of pertinent experimental data allowing the quantitative evaluation of information on the pore zzso and zzso This implies an investigation of the zzso zzso factor zzso exhibited by that fraction of dye which is still being retained inside the zzso at zzso It is shown how zzso depends on the mode of release which could be zzso or more gradual as expressed by a zzso zzso zzso or zzso 1 zzso to the pore zzso zzso the average dye retention factor in a zzso after a single pore zzso A fit to measured values of zzso at a sufficient extent of zzso may be applied in order to determine zzso Then the pore formation rate per zzso zzso can be derived from the registered zzso We give a practical demonstration of the procedures with zzso zzso zzso of two different sizes to which the zzso zzso zzso zzso X had been zzso
