Genes located on the zzso Y zzso outside of the zzso region do not recombine with those on the X and are predicted to either undergo selection for male function or gradually zzso because of an zzso of deleterious zzso Here, zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso among 26 zzso species indicate two ancestral episodes of directed genetic exchange zzso gene zzso from X to zzso once during the evolution of zzso cat and once in a common predecessor of zzso lineage zzso Replacement of the more rapidly evolving Y zzso with the zzso constrained X copy may represent a mechanism for zzso editing of functional genes on the zzso region of the zzso Y zzso
