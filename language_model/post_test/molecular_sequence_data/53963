An extremely diverse group of human zzso zzso types consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso types and other zzso zzso types zzso zzso types 2 and 3) is associated with zzso zzso and benign zzso of the zzso The frequent presence of multiple zzso types in single skin biopsy specimens of zzso transplant recipients prompted us to develop zzso techniques for the detection of distinct zzso of zzso related zzso zzso types, zzso three zzso of zzso zzso types and two groups zzso and zzso of other zzso zzso zzso This approach generally allowed a reliable identification of zzso zzso by direct sequencing of the zzso products, despite the frequent occurrence of multiple zzso The targeted spectrum of zzso types comprises 66 zzso zzso types including 21 putative novel zzso zzso We also detected 17 putative novel zzso zzso We demonstrated that the skin of nearly all zzso transplant recipients who developed various benign and zzso skin zzso was persistently infected with one or more zzso zzso types and/or zzso types belonging to groups zzso and zzso The frequency and distribution of zzso zzso and zzso types belonging to groups zzso and A4 were similar in biopsy specimens from zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but appeared to be lower in specimens of zzso cell zzso zzso benign zzso zzso and clinically normal skin zzso These findings suggest that zzso transplant recipients are prone to persistent zzso zzso zzso Our data do not support the existence of high-risk zzso zzso zzso
