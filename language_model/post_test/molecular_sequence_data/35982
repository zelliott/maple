The zzso region of the zzso E9 immunity protein zzso for its interaction with its zzso E zzso has been localized to zzso zzso of the zzso protein by the use of gene zzso A comparison of the alignment of zzso in this region of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins have identified nine candidate zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have changed each of these zzso in the zzso protein to the zzso found in the same position in the zzso zzso The immunity zzso zzso by the zzso immunity protein was then zzso Of the nine zzso only one zzso to zzso showed any evidence of zzso immunity to zzso zzso zzso other zzso in the zzso region to the equivalent zzso zzso did not affect the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso with the exception of the change of zzso to zzso which resulted in low-level zzso zzso While the zzso at positions 34 and 37 of the zzso protein introduced immunity towards zzso they did not diminish the immunity towards zzso suggesting that the two immunity proteins may have a common specificity framework which can be modified by single zzso In addition, we have used chemical modification of the unique zzso zzso of zzso zzso in order to probe further this zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso protein is accessible to modification with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso is close to zzso This zzso however, cannot be zzso by zzso zzso when the zzso protein is zzso to zzso zzso This result is consistent with the zzso zzso being buried in the zzso However, when the zzso zzso protein modified at zzso with a variety of zzso was used in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso the modified zzso proteins still possessed zzso activity but only up to a certain zzso molecular zzso These results are discussed in terms of the proximity of zzso to the zzso zzso
