Two zzso obtained by zzso chain reaction from zzso DNA of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated and zzso They zzso to fragments of two different putative zzso zzso zzso The existence of multiple zzso zzso genes was also suggested by Southern zzso zzso experiments employing one of the obtained clones as a zzso Two zzso zzso zzso protein fragments, which were directly zzso show differences in the zzso acid sequences zzso The comparison of the obtained zzso zzso zzso partial zzso acid sequences with each other, and with zzso from other zzso and from representative microbial and zzso organisms, highlights the larger zzso zzso of lower zzso compared to that observed in higher zzso
