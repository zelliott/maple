The crystal structure of the zzso zzso protein zzso was determined to a resolution of zzso and was the first structure to be determined from the extensive zzso family of zzso zzso zzso is an essential component of the zzso zzso that defines the paradigm for zzso zzso in dominant members of the human gut zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed an zzso region containing several zzso repeats zzso while the signature zzso region is less structured and contains extensive loop zzso zzso and structure analysis of zzso suggests the presence of binding zzso for other proteins from the zzso zzso
