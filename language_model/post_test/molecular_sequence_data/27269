In this study we analyzed the structure and function of a truncated form of zzso A zzso from zzso zzso using a series of functional and structural zzso zzso A belongs to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been identified as the most common protein zzso zzso among zzso zzso Currently, the mechanism of action for the zzso zzso members is not fully zzso In this study, zzso experiments revealed a zzso zzso zzso activity profile after zzso inactive zzso A was seeded with truncated zzso zzso We also solved the first zzso structure of a zzso zzso The truncated zzso A formed a right-handed parallel zzso with three adjoining segments of zzso zzso A zzso zzso bond, four buried zzso zzso and a zzso zzso were all located at the third complete zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso motif led to decreased activity and stability according to zzso and CD zzso Furthermore, the crystal structure revealed a zzso zzso dry zzso interface formed via zzso zzso interactions between neighboring zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso further supported the zzso zzso of full-length zzso zzso From these results, a model has been proposed, where zzso zzso interactions between zzso and neighboring full-length zzso A zzso facilitated in part by the highly zzso zzso pattern, account for the zzso zzso
