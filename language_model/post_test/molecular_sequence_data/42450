To differentiate 32 zzso zzso conventional techniques such as zzso and cellular typing are inadequate for high-resolution zzso zzso The most refined DNA typing until now is zzso typing and new selected zzso can be added to this system to distinguish new zzso zzso DNA sequencing, however, reveals directly the sequence information of all zzso zzso and has the advantage of being independent from zzso zzso We have developed a new zzso typing approach that is zzso fully zzso and therefore suitable for routine zzso The system is based upon direct sequencing of amplified DNA with zzso zzso The designation of zzso is obtained by a comparison of all zzso positions in the determined sequence with all known zzso sequences retained in a database along with their zzso zzso zzso data at both constant and zzso positions are used for quality zzso In this study, the typing results of a panel of 91 previous zzso DNA samples are zzso After comparison with the zzso results, we conclude that with this zzso system zzso assignment is zzso The method is easy to perform since both sequencing and assignment are zzso Furthermore, the system is easily zzso to other gene zzso
