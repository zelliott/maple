We have cloned and zzso a complementary DNA zzso the cellular zzso of the transforming zzso zzso of avian zzso virus zzso This complementary DNA contains an open reading frame of zzso base pairs that encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The first 205 zzso acids of this zzso protein were identical to those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the exception of 5 zzso zzso Like zzso this portion of zzso contained one each of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The 100 zzso zzso acids of zzso zzso which are not coded for in the zzso viral zzso contain another zzso zzso We found limited sequence zzso between zzso and the avian zzso zzso which explains zzso events in the zzso of this zzso Using a zzso zzso made against zzso expressed zzso we identified a zzso protein in normal chicken zzso zzso and in all embryonic chicken zzso zzso This zzso protein was indistinguishable from a zzso made by in zzso translation of zzso complementary zzso
