Signal regulatory protein zzso alpha is a membrane zzso that sends zzso signals to zzso cells by engagement of zzso The high resolution zzso structure of the zzso zzso binding domain shows it to have a distinctive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso is bound at a surface involving the zzso zzso and DE zzso which zzso it from other zzso zzso surface proteins that use the faces of the fold, but resembles zzso zzso The zzso interaction is confined to a single domain, and its use of an extended DE loop strengthens the similarity with T cell zzso binding and the suggestion that they are closely related in zzso The employment of zzso to form the zzso surface provides a mechanism for small sequence changes to zzso binding zzso explaining the different binding properties of zzso family zzso
