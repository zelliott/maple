Short basic peptides from the zzso zzso protein bind specifically to a zzso region in zzso zzso with a single zzso zzso providing the only zzso zzso The free zzso acid zzso also binds specifically to zzso Previous circular zzso zzso experiments suggested that zzso binding zzso a zzso change in zzso Here we confirm this observation using single zzso peptides and show that zzso or zzso binding also zzso a zzso change in zzso A zzso containing a single zzso within a stretch of zzso zzso shows zzso binding and a corresponding change in zzso zzso as detected by a decrease in the CD signal at 265 zzso zzso and zzso which bind to zzso with apparent zzso of approximately zzso zzso induce similar CD zzso In contrast, zzso which does not bind specifically to zzso has no zzso zzso of zzso that abolish specific binding (a zzso substitution in the zzso zzso a deletion of the zzso or an zzso to zzso base pair change above the zzso show no change in the CD signal upon binding of zzso zzso or zzso The results suggest that binding of a single zzso group to a specific site in zzso zzso a change in zzso zzso
