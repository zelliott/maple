A novel zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was isolated from a sample of zzso zzso collected from the northern South China Sea, at a depth of zzso zzso This isolate formed zzso zzso zzso and zzso aerial zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso zzso was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The novel strain could, however, be readily differentiated from zzso zzso zzso zzso on the basis of some zzso and cellular chemical zzso the level of zzso zzso between these two strains was only zzso Based on zzso and zzso evidence, strain zzso zzso represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso
