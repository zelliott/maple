We have devised a genetic screen to obtain zzso affecting cell division patterning in the developing central nervous system of zzso The division zzso delayed zzso locus was identified using a combination of zzso zzso and behavioral screening zzso The ordered cell cycle progression of zzso precursor cells, which generate synaptic target zzso for zzso is disrupted in zzso zzso The first of two zzso precursor cell divisions shows a delayed entry into zzso The second division, one that is triggered by an zzso signal from zzso zzso fails to take zzso Similar to zzso zzso cells that generate the zzso of the adult eye show two synchronized divisions found along the zzso zzso in the eye disc and the first division cycle in zzso zzso displays a delayed progression into M phase like that found in the first zzso precursor cell zzso zzso zzso also affect viability and produce zzso defects in several adult zzso including the eye, zzso wing and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso reveals a potential open reading frame of zzso zzso acids with zzso to a family of zzso integral membrane zzso These zzso zzso proteins are attached to the external leaflet of the plasma membrane via a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may serve as zzso for a variety of zzso proteins including zzso growth factor, vascular zzso growth factor, zzso growth factor and members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The cell division defects found in zzso zzso zzso the zzso group of integral membrane zzso in the control of cell division during zzso
