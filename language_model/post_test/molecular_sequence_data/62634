zzso hormones zzso are zzso factors important for many zzso and zzso functions in zzso and particularly in zzso zzso Their effects are zzso by two specific receptors zzso and zzso which are zzso zzso factors, members of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso Besides their pivotal role in zzso zzso zzso are also critical for fish zzso As this later role of zzso is less zzso we analyzed their action in the zzso zzso zzso a zzso flat zzso We describe the isolation of sequences for the zzso zzso of a number of zzso zzso which are induced during zzso zzso zzso expression of these genes during zzso metamorphosis was studied by several methods and the expression patterns of these genes compared with those in zzso and zzso We find that the period between the onset and the end of eye migration zzso 22 to day 30 zzso most likely zzso to the zzso climax with either high zzso or high zzso zzso Our results show that in contrast to zzso it is zzso and not zzso zzso that is zzso during zzso Our results highlight the notion that zzso zzso through a rise of zzso zzso a genetic cascade during zzso zzso The fact that zzso regulates metamorphosis in zzso and zzso zzso suggests that zzso metamorphosis is a zzso process zzso in most zzso
