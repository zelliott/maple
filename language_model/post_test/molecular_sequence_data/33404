zzso a transient zzso structure, is known as central for zzso and is indispensable for termination of zzso Here, we used the zzso zzso inventories to construct the potential zzso zzso interaction zzso zzso To delineate novel regulators participating in zzso the zzso a standard statistic score, rather than hub degree was implemented to prioritize the novel zzso Of these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were localized to the zzso whereas zzso and zzso were associated with the zzso zzso as examined by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in increasing numbers of zzso zzso cells, suggesting these newly identified hubs play critical roles in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso zzso in which zzso zzso sites have been replaced with Ala results in a zzso zzso This zzso network construction not only sheds light on the intimate interactions of the zzso zzso but also zzso novel hubs or protein complexes that may govern the process of zzso
