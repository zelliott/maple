The crystal structure of zzso zzso indicates that the alpha and beta zzso fold into a structure defined by three zzso the top zzso domain, the middle zzso domain, and the zzso zzso bundle domain zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the alpha and beta zzso form a crown structure at the top of zzso which was suggested to stabilize it zzso et zzso zzso In this study, the role of the zzso domain in the alpha and beta zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with regard to its folding and zzso was zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso and beta zzso were expressed individually and together in zzso zzso When expressed zzso the zzso domain of the beta zzso formed a large zzso structure, while the domain of the alpha zzso was predominately a zzso or zzso However, zzso of the zzso domain of alpha zzso with the zzso domain of beta zzso greatly reduced the zzso of the beta zzso zzso Furthermore, the two zzso zzso in complexes with the major portion of the complex found in a small molecular weight zzso These results indicate that the zzso domain of the alpha and beta zzso interact specifically with each other and that these interactions prevent the zzso of the zzso domain of the beta zzso These results mimic in zzso results and suggest that the interactions of the zzso zzso may be critical during the folding and assembly of zzso
