zzso of the zzso membrane attack complex of complement on host cells is inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso is species zzso and human zzso is not effective against rat zzso Previous functional analysis of zzso zzso zzso proteins indicated that the zzso responsible for the species selective function of human zzso map to a region contained between positions 40 and 66 in the primary zzso By comparative analysis of rat and human zzso models and by zzso analysis of candidate zzso we now identify the individual zzso within the zzso region that zzso species selective function on human zzso All zzso zzso within the zzso sequence were zzso from human to rat zzso in a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the individual human to rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso each produced a zzso human zzso protein with enhanced rat complement zzso activity with the single zzso substitution having the most significant zzso Interestingly, the side chains of the zzso at positions 47, 51, and 55 are all located on the short single zzso zzso zzso of zzso and form an exposed continuous strip parallel to the zzso zzso A single human zzso zzso protein containing rat zzso zzso at all three zzso zzso produced a protein with species selective activity comparable to that of rat zzso We further found that synthetic peptides spanning the human zzso zzso sequence were able to inhibit the binding of human zzso to human zzso but had little effect on the binding of rat zzso to rat zzso
