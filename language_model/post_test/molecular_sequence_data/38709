zzso is a zzso type zzso zzso isolated from Antarctic zzso The zzso belong to clan zzso of the zzso family of zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the precursor form of zzso zzso termed zzso can be successfully expressed in zzso zzso The presence of most of the zzso zzso zzso is essential during zzso under the growth conditions of zzso The zzso may be required either for correct folding or processing of the zzso Cod zzso generates a fully active zzso from its zzso which appears to be identical to the native zzso The mature zzso sequence contains 250 zzso zzso including a zzso zzso zzso which seems to be attached to the zzso by a zzso zzso zzso shares an average sequence identity of zzso with its type I zzso zzso crab zzso zzso However, the identity between these two sequences is much higher in the regions shown to be important for the broad zzso specificity and collagen binding of crab zzso zzso The type I zzso share only zzso identities with the type II zzso and zzso The low zzso point of zzso with a calculated zzso value of zzso is typical for the type I zzso
