There are four groups of zzso zzso with distinct zzso and zzso properties due to differences in surface zzso of the viral coat zzso zzso proteins also play a role as zzso zzso during the viral life cycle, binding an zzso hairpin within the zzso In this study, the first crystal structure of the coat protein from a Group II zzso zzso is reported and compared to the Group I zzso coat zzso The structure of the zzso zzso was determined at zzso A resolution zzso zzso zzso The overall folding pattern of the coat protein is similar to the Group I zzso coat protein in the intact virus zzso zzso zzso K, zzso K, zzso zzso 1993, J zzso zzso zzso or as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso J, zzso zzso zzso zzso 1995, zzso zzso The structures differ in the zzso zzso and in the first turn of the alpha A zzso zzso and zzso coat proteins differ in sequence at 49 of 129 zzso acid zzso zzso differences that contribute to distinct zzso and physical properties of the proteins are found at the surface of the intact virus in the AB and zzso zzso There are six differences in potential zzso contact zzso within the zzso site located in an zzso zzso across the zzso zzso Three differences involve zzso in the center of this zzso zzso zzso 83, zzso 87, and zzso zzso zzso 87 was shown by molecular zzso to define zzso specificity by zzso or zzso coat protein zzso zzso zzso M, zzso zzso 1994, J zzso zzso zzso This sequence difference reflects recognition of the zzso at position -5 in the zzso loop of the zzso operators bound by these coat zzso In zzso the zzso at this position is a zzso whereas in zzso it is a zzso
