A zzso human zzso clone designated zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated in a screen for zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso to a single major transcript of approximately zzso zzso in human cells which was increased about fivefold by zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared against zzso zzso products expressed in zzso coli as zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins recognized two proteins by Western zzso zzso An zzso zzso protein and a zzso expressed zzso protein whose level was not altered by zzso treatment were detected in human zzso U and zzso zzso cell zzso Only the zzso protein was detected in mouse zzso with zzso raised against the zzso human zzso the mouse zzso protein was zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso analyses showed that the zzso protein was exclusively zzso whereas the zzso protein was present in both the zzso and nucleus of human zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso zzso includes three copies of the highly zzso R motif commonly found in zzso zzso Both the zzso and the zzso proteins prepared from human nuclear extracts bound to zzso but not to zzso zzso affinity zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins that included the R motif possessed zzso zzso zzso prepared either from zzso zzso cells or from zzso cells contained increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results establish that zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso zzso and suggest that at least two forms of zzso zzso zzso occur in human zzso
