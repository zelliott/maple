zzso from the zzso zzso promoter zzso is normally totally dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso We describe experiments with a genetically engineered DNA zzso carrying zzso in which the wild type zzso binding site was replaced with synthetic zzso containing either zzso or zzso binding zzso When the synthetic zzso contains the 22 zzso consensus for zzso binding sites, expression from zzso is dependent on zzso but not zzso Single changes at either of two zzso positions create sites that are zzso by both zzso and zzso Changes at both positions result in a site that is not zzso by zzso but which binds zzso zzso
