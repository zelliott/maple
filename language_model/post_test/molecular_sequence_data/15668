zzso zzso have thus far been associated mainly with zzso processes participating in stress zzso However, zzso zzso a zzso has recently been shown to regulate zzso zzso initiation and further zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso belongs to a land zzso class of zzso that has a zzso active site zzso which deviates from zzso occurring zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies of yellow fluorescent zzso fusion genes driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso promoter reveal a zzso distribution of zzso We demonstrate that nuclear zzso of zzso is indispensable and thus crucial for its activity in flower zzso zzso zzso screens identified zzso zzso factors as interacting zzso which was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso experiments showing their nuclear interaction in zzso Overlapping expression patterns of zzso and zzso genes during flower development demonstrate that zzso protein interactions can occur in zzso and support their biological relevance in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso demonstrates the importance of the C zzso for its functionality and for zzso zzso protein zzso zzso analysis of the zzso pan double zzso and an engineered zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso a floral zzso zzso supports a dual role of zzso in zzso zzso Together, our results show that the zzso protein functions in the nucleus, likely by zzso zzso zzso and thereby regulating its activity in zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso affects later zzso zzso probably by modulating other zzso factors that might act zzso during differentiation of second zzso zzso
