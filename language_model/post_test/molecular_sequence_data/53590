We present a new method, secondary structure prediction by zzso zzso zzso for predicting the secondary structure of proteins from zzso acid zzso zzso parameters zzso for zzso acid zzso zzso and triplets were zzso with respect to secondary structural elements of proteins based on the dictionary of secondary structure prediction zzso secondary structure for zzso selected zzso zzso To the zzso acid triplets which are not found in the selected zzso a zzso value of zero is assigned with respect to the secondary structural elements of zzso The total number of parameters generated is zzso in the possible parameters of zzso zzso zzso is complete with respect to zzso acid zzso zzso and partially complete with respect to zzso acid zzso These generated parameters were used to predict secondary structural elements from zzso acid zzso The secondary structure predicted by our method zzso was compared with that of single sequence zzso and multiple sequence zzso zzso The average value of the percentage of prediction accuracy for a zzso by zzso zzso and zzso methods was found to be zzso zzso and zzso respectively for the proteins in the selected zzso For zzso the prediction accuracy is found to be zzso zzso and zzso respectively by zzso zzso and zzso zzso This clearly indicates that the secondary structure prediction by our method is as good as zzso method but much better than zzso zzso
