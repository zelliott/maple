The zzso zzso of zzso coli is an zzso zzso composed of 24 identical zzso chains forming an approximately zzso protein shell with a central zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso with a zzso zzso extension, have been amplified zzso and zzso respectively), zzso by a new procedure and zzso The zzso zzso exhibited properties similar to those of natural zzso but the iron content zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso Two major assembly states of zzso were zzso a zzso protein zzso and a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assembled into zzso having the same zzso properties as zzso presumably because their zzso extensions project into and occupy about zzso of the central zzso As a result, zzso failed zzso up iron under conditions that allowed incorporation into zzso in zzso The zzso content of zzso zzso zzso was lower than that of zzso zzso zzso and this, together with a difference in the visible zzso of the two zzso suggested that the zzso extensions in zzso zzso the zzso zzso A zzso zzso form of zzso was not zzso A combination of zzso zzso and electron zzso showed that the zzso loaded with iron in zzso has a zzso iron core, whereas the zzso loaded protein has an zzso zzso
