The tissue polarity zzso in zzso include a set of zzso gene products that appear to be involved in the control of zzso zzso Here we show that the tissue polarity gene prickle zzso encodes a protein with a triple zzso domain and a novel domain that is present in human, zzso and zzso zzso zzso which we designate zzso Three transcripts have been identified, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso conceptual zzso zzso The three transcripts span 70 zzso and share 6 zzso that contain the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso transcripts are expressed with similar zzso patterns but have zzso different zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and transgenic flies in which the different zzso are zzso show that the balance between zzso and zzso is critical for the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, these zzso suggest a zzso model in which the alignment of wing hairs is dependent on cell shape and need not reflect zzso zzso zzso Lack of both zzso and zzso transcripts gives a zzso affecting the whole body surface that is similar to those of zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a functional relationship between zzso and zzso zzso
