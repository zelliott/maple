Effect of zzso on structural properties and zzso stability of zzso was investigated by methods of circular zzso and zzso zzso The normal protein displayed an unusual secondary structural zzso extended left-handed zzso It is suggested that the structure of the normal zzso includes a zzso zzso part with rigid extended tail, zzso it is of a zzso zzso The normal protein structure is practically unaffected by changes in pH zzso zzso leads to some zzso within the extended part of the protein zzso zzso in pH zzso the zzso part of the zzso protein into the molten zzso zzso
