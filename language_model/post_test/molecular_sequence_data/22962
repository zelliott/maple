To clarify the structure of the zzso zzso region that contains quantitative trait zzso zzso related to fat, we constructed a bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso of the region from zzso to zzso on zzso zzso 7 and performed zzso zzso shotgun sequencing of the clones that composed a minimum zzso path of the zzso This analysis revealed that the gene order from zzso to zzso is zzso between human and zzso and that comparison with the human sequence identified a zzso in the zzso zzso at the zzso end of zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences of three zzso clones that included the zzso point demonstrated that zzso and zzso which were not present in the corresponding human region, were located adjacent to the zzso zzso These results provide useful information about the zzso region containing zzso for fat in pigs and help to clarify the structure of the so-called zzso zzso region zzso to the zzso major zzso complex class II zzso
