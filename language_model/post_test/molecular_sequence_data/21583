zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein modification that requires appropriate enrichment techniques to enable zzso zzso We report a simple yet highly specific method to enrich zzso by zzso involving only two straightforward chemical modifications of the zzso before capturing the obtained derivatives with a zzso designed zzso active zzso zzso Specifically, capping of the zzso zzso in the peptides is done first by reductive zzso to preserve the charge state of peptides for zzso zzso mass zzso analysis, followed by reduction of zzso to the corresponding zzso These peptides are then immobilized on the zzso active zzso zzso whereas other peptides carrying no free zzso groups are separated from the immobilized species by thoroughly washing the beads from which the zzso zzso derivatives can easily be released by zzso zzso at room zzso The benefits of selective enrichment from a zzso of unmodified peptides for liquid zzso mass zzso are demonstrated on three synthetic zzso that are zzso fragments of biologically relevant zzso Identification of several in zzso zzso human plasma zzso also implicated under various pathological zzso by database searches from the enriched and zzso zzso zzso is presented as a practical zzso We also show that converting the zzso to the small zzso tag does not significantly alter fragmentation properties upon zzso zzso compared with those of the native zzso and at the same time this zzso actually improves electron capture zzso due to conversion of the zzso zzso to this novel zzso
