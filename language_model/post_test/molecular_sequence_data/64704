The pattern of sensory zzso extensions and connections is established during embryonic development through complex and varied guidance cues that control zzso of growth cones and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are molecules that act as such zzso zzso response zzso proteins zzso are thought to be part of the zzso signal zzso zzso implicated in zzso growth cone zzso In this report, we present evidence that zzso are also involved in the zzso extension controlled by zzso We found that specific zzso and the zzso zzso protein for zzso both zzso the zzso extension induced by zzso while specific zzso and the corresponding zzso protein for zzso both abolished the zzso extension induced by zzso Our data suggest that zzso has a negative effect on zzso extension induced by zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso induced by zzso These results point to a function for zzso in the regulation of zzso outgrowth induced by zzso in sensory zzso
