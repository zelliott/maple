We report here the cloning of a gene zzso a novel Ral interacting protein zzso from a zzso expression library using zzso Ral as zzso zzso binds to Ral in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso transcript of the zzso gene is present in all zzso zzso and encodes for a protein product of zzso zzso zzso shares sequence similarity with GAP proteins that are capable of zzso the zzso activity of members of the zzso family of zzso When tested, zzso could activate the zzso activity of zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso Ral had no effect on the zzso ability of zzso in zzso
