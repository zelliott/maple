A zzso protein composed of 12 apparently identical zzso zzso zzso with the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso separates the two proteins in pure zzso On the basis of the highly zzso zzso and reaction of the zzso protein with zzso to pea zzso large zzso zzso the protein from zzso zzso is designated as a putative binding protein zzso for zzso Also the zzso sequence of zzso is quite similar to that of both alpha and beta zzso of the zzso zzso Our present research suggests that zzso may be a zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity and of species that zzso cross react with zzso or zzso (by zzso zzso zzso establish that levels of the two proteins vary together in zzso zzso grown on different carbon zzso
