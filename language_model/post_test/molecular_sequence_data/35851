zzso were analyzed by a combination of zzso liquid zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso First, zzso labeled with zzso were studied to see if they could be analyzed by zzso under the conditions used for separation by zzso zzso zzso could be analyzed under these conditions, although the mass zzso were zzso Then, liquid zzso zzso was used to analyze a zzso mixture derived from human zzso zzso The zzso were separated on a zzso column and zzso zzso The observed molecular weights were close to or identical to those expected from the structures, which were estimated from the zzso position on zzso This method is rapid and simple, as the mass zzso can give the accurate molecular weight of each zzso in one zzso run, even if the zzso separation is zzso This method can be used to extend the so-called two-dimensional mapping of zzso The structure can be studied in greater detail by tandem zzso
