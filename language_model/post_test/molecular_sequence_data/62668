The zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso exchange factors zzso for zzso zzso It is well established that zzso play an important role in zzso and zzso through the zzso of their zzso the zzso zzso Little is known about zzso zzso expression and cellular zzso Because of its zzso close to the common fragile site zzso which has been shown to be responsible for an zzso zzso of the zzso region in breast zzso cells, we examined the expression of the zzso zzso in normal and zzso breast zzso We report here the identification of five novel zzso alternative transcripts specifically expressed in breast zzso These zzso transcripts were characterized by the absence of one or several zzso all coding for the zzso zzso domain and generating modified or truncated predicted zzso zzso The zzso transcripts were predominantly expressed in breast zzso cell lines and in the most aggressive primary breast zzso suggesting they may play a role in breast tumor zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that the expression of zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso and zzso cells generated a loss of zzso stress fibers and the formation of membrane zzso and zzso This pattern suggests that zzso activates zzso zzso or zzso rather than zzso as previously demonstrated in in zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso We anticipate that the zzso of the zzso zzso possibly by the zzso zzso detected here, may play an important role in zzso breast zzso
