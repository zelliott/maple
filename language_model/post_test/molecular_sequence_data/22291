DNA zzso can stall or block zzso zzso thus zzso zzso To bypass such zzso zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso can be used to insert a zzso across from the zzso or extend from a zzso zzso When DNA repair is compromised in zzso zzso spontaneous DNA zzso can lead to a novel zzso event in which a zzso is accompanied by one or more base pair zzso These zzso zzso are dependent upon the zzso zzso Pol zzso and provide a zzso signature for zzso Pol zzso zzso In the current study, we have found that a specific subset of the Pol zzso zzso events requires zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso bypass of spontaneously oxidized DNA bases can be a significant source of zzso in repair compromised zzso
