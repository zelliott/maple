zzso zzso zzso recombine less efficiently than do identical zzso in zzso and much of this zzso can be attributed to action of the mismatch repair zzso zzso In this study an zzso zzso repeat zzso system has been used to directly compare the rates of zzso and zzso zzso between pairs of zzso zzso varying from zzso to zzso in sequence zzso The zzso rate data indicate that sequence divergence impacts zzso and zzso zzso similarly, although subtle differences are zzso In addition to assessing zzso rates as a function of sequence zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso events involving zzso zzso were determined by DNA zzso The zzso analysis indicates that the extent of zzso zzso DNA formed in a zzso strain is zzso longer than that formed in a zzso zzso These data are consistent with a model in which the zzso machinery interferes with the formation and/or extension of zzso zzso during zzso
