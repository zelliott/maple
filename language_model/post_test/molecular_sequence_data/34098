Numerous inherited diseases develop due to zzso zzso leading to an zzso zzso Whether an zzso change is zzso depends on the level of deleterious effects caused by the zzso zzso We show an example of different structural and zzso consequences caused by two individual zzso changes at the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso resulting from zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis of an zzso family revealed that affected individuals were zzso for zzso to our knowledge, previously zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Interestingly, 2 of 100 unrelated normal controls were zzso and 1 of the 100 was zzso for a different zzso in this position, zzso zzso In zzso modeling of the protein demonstrated deleterious structural effects from zzso substitution but not from zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies revealed a significantly larger number of zzso cells in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso complementary DNA zzso harboring zzso than those zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso These results show that changes in two distinct zzso acids at a locus are destined to elicit different zzso due to the degree of structural distortion resulting from the zzso zzso
