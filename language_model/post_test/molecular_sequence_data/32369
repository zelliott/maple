The zzso activity of a new series of zzso zzso was determined against zzso virus zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso virus, and zzso zzso Several compounds were identified that had good activity against each of the zzso including a set of novel zzso zzso zzso To investigate the possibility that these drugs might be zzso zzso by the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activities of these compounds were also assessed using zzso strains of some of these zzso Some of these compounds were shown to be much less effective in the absence of a functional zzso gene in zzso which was unexpected given the high degree of zzso acid identity between this zzso and its cellular zzso This unanticipated result suggested that the zzso zzso was important in the mechanism of action of these compounds and also that it might zzso a wider variety of zzso than other type II zzso To confirm these data, we expressed the zzso zzso and human zzso in bacteria and isolated the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the viral zzso could efficiently zzso many of these compounds, whereas most of the compounds were very poor zzso for the cellular zzso zzso Thus, the specific zzso of these compounds by the viral zzso may be sufficient to explain the zzso zzso This unexpected result suggests that selective zzso by the viral zzso may be a promising new approach in the discovery of highly selective zzso of zzso zzso
