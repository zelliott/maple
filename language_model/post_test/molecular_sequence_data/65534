zzso is a gene from zzso zzso strain zzso that hypothetically encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso As confirmation, this gene was zzso and the product was expressed in zzso coli strain zzso zzso cells and zzso The zzso obtained was zzso with a molecular mass of 45 zzso and exhibited zzso zzso A study of the zzso of the activity by some zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso for the zzso activity was zzso This zzso also presents broad zzso specificity and is active toward zzso acid, zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso from zzso zzso achieves a synergistic effect with zzso A toward zzso zzso As a member of the zzso family, it does not adopt the common zzso zzso zzso The zzso between the folds of zzso from zzso zzso and the hypothetical zzso precursor from zzso zzso which both belong to the zzso family, illustrates the divergence of such proteins from a common zzso Furthermore, the zzso possesses a putative zzso binding region at the N zzso of the protein which has never been described to date for any zzso
