The zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso in the zzso leading to formation of zzso zzso E1 was found to be zzso in cells of a mouse zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso mapping of zzso zzso of labeled E1 indicated that two zzso were mainly zzso in zzso The same zzso were also labeled in zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from the same cell zzso The zzso zzso is a key zzso playing a pivotal role in zzso transition in the cell zzso The zzso of one of the two zzso was prominent at the zzso phase of the cell cycle, and dependent upon the zzso zzso activity in zzso since it was significantly reduced in zzso a zzso cell line deficient in zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso at the fourth position of the E1 zzso was a zzso site of zzso zzso These findings suggest that E1 is a target of zzso zzso in the cell, zzso that the zzso system may be zzso involved in cell cycle control through zzso of this key zzso
