We investigated the occurrence of alternatively spliced forms zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso a large zzso zzso zzso in developing chicken zzso using the reverse zzso chain zzso We characterized the PLUS domain, which is apparently unique to the chicken zzso and is regulated by alternative zzso zzso in chicken zzso consisted of four forms with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two forms without zzso and zzso the PLUS domain zzso and zzso zzso The four forms of zzso were found in all samples zzso but the occurrence of the two zzso forms was regulated zzso zzso analysis has revealed that the PLUS and zzso zzso are zzso by a single zzso and this zzso has an internal alternative zzso donor site, allowing alternative spliced forms that do not include the zzso of the zzso zzso corresponding to the chicken PLUS domain zzso were not found in mouse and human and may have disappeared during zzso zzso similarity suggests that the PLUS domain zzso to the zzso zzso attachment domain of zzso and that it has a distinct function in the chicken zzso
