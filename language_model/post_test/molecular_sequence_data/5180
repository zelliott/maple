Genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso were isolated and zzso From zzso zzso a single zzso interrupting the fifth zzso in the zzso sequence could be zzso Two zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso contain a single zzso in a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso was found to lack an zzso while both zzso zzso zzso are interrupted by single zzso The deduced zzso and zzso proteins contained zzso and zzso identical zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso During zzso induction the zzso zzso and zzso transcript levels increased three- to zzso relative to zzso zzso while zzso and zzso control transcripts were not regulated zzso As suggested by zzso transcript zzso during zzso zzso this regulation occurs on the zzso zzso a zzso 18 zzso zzso sequence zzso which is present in the promoter regions of the zzso and zzso zzso may be involved in zzso
