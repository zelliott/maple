We found and characterized a type D zzso produced in a human zzso cell line of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso region of the zzso major structural protein zzso revealed no high zzso with any of the known zzso zzso acid zzso We have cloned zzso and the zzso zzso integrated in the zzso cells, and determined the complete zzso sequence and gene structures of the zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and has the structure of zzso The zzso sequences of the long terminal repeat zzso region and a part of the pol gene were closely related to the available sequences of zzso monkey zzso zzso and we designated this virus zzso zzso as zzso The primer zzso sequence of zzso zzso has a zzso zzso which is different from that of zzso The zzso protein of the 3' terminal region of zzso gene contains an zzso acid sequence of an zzso zzso zzso in which R is unique in zzso The core sequence of the zzso regulatory element is found upstream of the two zzso imperfect repeats in the zzso zzso partially zzso to those of the rat zzso protein gene are in gag and pol zzso
