The incorporation of reference DNA is crucial to the validation of any DNA typing zzso Currently, reference DNA standards are restricted to molecular size DNA ladders and/or tumor cell line zzso Either of these, however, presents some zzso We have rigorously characterized two zzso virus zzso human zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso determine their suitability as alternative zzso standards for three widely employed zzso profiling zzso zzso highly zzso zzso zzso systems (7 zzso 2 zzso and 12 zzso distributed over 12 zzso were scrutinized along with 3 zzso zzso zzso The genetic stability of each locus was confirmed over a period of 225 in zzso population zzso zzso size estimates and degree of zzso for each of the 21 zzso systems were zzso The zzso of zzso scoring by traditional zzso zzso using both cell lines as reference standards, was also verified by an zzso validation study involving 13 analysts from two geographically distinct forensic zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso and zzso zzso zzso could be adopted as reliable reference standards for DNA zzso
