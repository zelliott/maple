zzso zzso zzso is produced as a 136 zzso acid protein with zzso sequence zzso zzso STAR, zzso which may be converted to lower molecular weight forms zzso by removal of the first six zzso zzso zzso 6 with zzso zzso or the first ten zzso zzso zzso 10 with zzso zzso In the present study the occurrence and effects of these zzso during zzso zzso by zzso were studied in zzso systems and in human zzso In zzso zzso of zzso and native human zzso zzso rapid and quantitative conversion of zzso to zzso occurred, zzso with exposure of the active site in the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis revealed the sequence zzso in addition to the known sequences of the zzso zzso identifying zzso 10 as the zzso generated from zzso In zzso of zzso amount of zzso and human zzso zzso generation occurred zzso following an initial lag phase, during which zzso was converted to zzso zzso conversion of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The specific zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso 8,000 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 8,000 zzso were zzso In an in zzso system consisting of a 60 zzso plasma zzso submerged in 250 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within 1 h was obtained with 70 zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
