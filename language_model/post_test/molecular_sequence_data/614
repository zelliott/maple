zzso zzso zzso the specific zzso of the zzso zzso bond of various zzso producing fatty acids and zzso zzso zzso zzso constitute a large zzso of zzso whose products are important for a multitude of signal zzso zzso zzso zzso release, zzso zzso development, plant stress responses, and host zzso The crystal structure of rice zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso has been determined to zzso A resolution using sulfur zzso zzso and shows that the class zzso zzso have a unique structure compared with other zzso zzso The zzso half of the chain contains mainly loop structure, including the zzso zzso loop, but starts with a short zzso and also includes two short zzso zzso The zzso half is folded into three zzso zzso of which the two first are also present in other zzso zzso and contain the zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso zzso The structure is stabilized by six zzso zzso The water structure around the calcium zzso binding site suggests the involvement of a second water zzso in the mechanism for zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the complex structure is bound in a zzso pocket, which extends to the likely membrane interface and is proposed to model the binding of the product fatty zzso Due to the differences in structure, the suggested surface for binding to the membrane has a different zzso in the rice zzso compared with other zzso
