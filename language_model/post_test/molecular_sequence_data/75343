The zzso specificity of zzso raised against the bovine zzso zzso protein zzso and a series of zzso synthetic peptides was examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso isolated from zzso zzso and human zzso white matter, as well as with zzso incorporated into rat zzso zzso zzso analyses of 11 zzso zzso revealed a more restrictive zzso pattern with only five of the 11 zzso against peptides encompassing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with bovine zzso by zzso zzso analyses with the zzso zzso demonstrated a similar recognition with four of the 11 zzso against peptides zzso zzso zzso and zzso recognizing the zzso zzso These data suggest that, despite its strong zzso zzso multiple zzso sites exist within the zzso zzso and some of these zzso can be zzso by synthetic zzso However, the restrictive zzso of the zzso zzso suggest that zzso recognition of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso The availability of zzso zzso of predetermined zzso capable of recognizing the intact zzso should permit detailed examination of zzso topography in various experimental zzso
