zzso hormone zzso is a member of zzso zzso hormones that are composed of two dissimilar zzso alpha and zzso Very little information is available regarding the zzso and zzso acid sequence of zzso in avian zzso For better understanding of the zzso diversity and evolution of zzso zzso we have isolated and zzso the complete complementary DNA zzso zzso chicken zzso precursor zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso end zzso zzso The cloned chicken zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso including zzso zzso of the zzso region zzso zzso zzso of the open reading frame, and an extraordinarily long zzso of zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso It encodes a zzso precursor zzso of zzso with a signal zzso of 20 zzso acids followed by a mature protein of 111 zzso zzso Twelve zzso zzso forming six zzso bonds within zzso and two putative zzso zzso sites, are also zzso in the chicken zzso Four zzso zzso presumably responsible for changing the backbone direction of protein structure, are zzso in chicken zzso as zzso The zzso sequence of chicken zzso zzso shows high zzso with quail zzso zzso zzso zzso in the open reading frame, and zzso zzso in the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of chicken zzso shows a remarkable similarity to other avian zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso with ostrich, whereas a lower similarity zzso to zzso is noted when compared with zzso zzso By contrast, when comparing with the zzso of chicken zzso hormone and zzso hormone, the zzso are as low as 37 and zzso zzso zzso zzso was only expressed in zzso zzso out of various zzso examined and can be zzso by zzso hormone in zzso tissue culture as estimated by real-time quantitative zzso
