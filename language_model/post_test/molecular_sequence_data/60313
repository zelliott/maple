The B and T cell responses to zzso a repetitive part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined in zzso zzso zzso Most donors had high levels of zzso to zzso zzso and 17 overlapping peptides spanning zzso Taking proliferation and/or zzso zzso and zzso production as a measure of T cell zzso eight of the zzso peptides induced responses in zzso zzso of the donors zzso There was no general association between the different types of T cell responses measured, emphasizing the importance of including multiple parameters when analyzing T cell responses and suggesting that zzso zzso functionally distinct T cell zzso The most efficient zzso for induction of zzso responses was one previously shown to induce T cell responses in five different zzso zzso mouse strains primed with zzso suggesting that this is a universal T cell zzso The presence of multiple B and T cell zzso in zzso widely recognized by humans, is important since zzso has been shown to elicit protective zzso responses in monkeys and may be considered for inclusion in malaria zzso zzso
