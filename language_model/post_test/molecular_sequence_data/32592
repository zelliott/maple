zzso proteins have been classified as zzso zzso and target zzso and play a central role in the various membrane interactions in zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso project, we have identified a zzso family of at least 26 members zzso the zzso zzso zzso that can be grouped into 15 zzso zzso zzso match the classical zzso of zzso being zzso membrane proteins with an zzso zzso domain and a zzso single zzso zzso zzso The membrane anchor is preceded by a zzso zzso domain of approximately 60 zzso acids that is supposed to participate in zzso complex zzso In a zzso analysis, most of the zzso zzso genes were found to cluster in groups together with those from other organisms in a zzso manner, allowing an assignment to different compartments in a zzso zzso However, some of them seem to have no counterparts in zzso In another approach, we fused one representative member of each of the zzso zzso to green fluorescent protein and assessed the in zzso zzso which was further supported by zzso of some zzso This allowed us to assign zzso to all important trafficking pathways in zzso
