The zzso is an important tool for zzso the confidence zzso of zzso groups within zzso Although zzso analyses are used in most evolutionary studies, there is no clear consensus as how best to interpret zzso probability zzso To study further the zzso method, nine small zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso data sets were submitted to zzso maximum zzso zzso analyses using zzso and weighted sequence zzso zzso of the lengths zzso zzso zzso of the zzso trees show that the shape and mean of the zzso tree distribution may provide important insights into the evolutionary signal within the sequence zzso With complex zzso containing zzso defined by short internal branches zzso the mean of the zzso tree distribution may differ by 2 standard zzso from the length of the best tree found from the original data zzso zzso sequence positions significantly increases the zzso values at internal zzso There may, however, be strong zzso support for conflicting species groupings among different data zzso This phenomenon appears to result from a correlation between the zzso of the tree used to create the weights and the zzso of the zzso consensus tree zzso from the zzso analysis of these weighted zzso The analyses also show that characteristics of the zzso tree distribution zzso zzso may be used to choose between alternative weighting schemes for zzso zzso
