zzso reproduction in zzso depends upon the actions of zzso hormone zzso Despite the wide presence of zzso in zzso zzso zzso has not been isolated in zzso other than the common zzso To provide information on the evolution of this critical hormone, we isolated the full-length zzso of a zzso zzso from the central nervous system of a zzso zzso the sea zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame of this zzso encodes a protein of 147 zzso zzso The molecular architecture of the deduced protein is highly zzso to that reported for the zzso zzso zzso and consists of a putative signal zzso a zzso zzso a downstream processing site, and a zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso and differs from zzso by only two zzso zzso The transcript for zzso is widely expressed in the central nervous system zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso using an zzso against zzso detected zzso zzso in all zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was abolished by the zzso of the zzso with synthetic zzso In sum, zzso sequence is the first zzso zzso zzso to be zzso Further, it represents one of the only two zzso molecules found outside zzso zzso These data zzso the possibility that zzso arose zzso in zzso by zzso evolution and provide valuable support for an ancient origin of zzso during zzso zzso
