A zzso gene zzso with zzso zzso was cloned from the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It zzso a mature zzso zzso of zzso Da (920 zzso zzso Based on the zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso was assigned to the zzso zzso family zzso The zzso shared a gene sequence identity of zzso with the reported but much less characterized zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Its zzso zzso zzso was produced in zzso coli cells and zzso to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with degrees of zzso above four, to yield zzso as the dominant product, which was different from zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso pattern suggested that zzso was an zzso zzso zzso (90 zzso and zzso (9 zzso increased the zzso activity of zzso by zzso and zzso respectively, while zzso (9 zzso inhibited the activity zzso The zzso activity was independent of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso activity was observed at zzso and pH zzso The kinetic parameters K zzso V zzso K zzso and K zzso zzso values toward zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso 235 U zzso 401 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could have a potential application in the production of zzso zzso
