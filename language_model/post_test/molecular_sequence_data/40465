zzso spinal muscular zzso zzso is a neurodegenerative disease caused by low levels of the survival motor zzso zzso zzso In humans, zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso In zzso patients, the zzso gene is lost and the remaining zzso gene only partially zzso zzso by a zzso zzso transition in zzso the inefficient recognition of zzso 7 by the zzso machinery results in low levels of zzso Because the zzso gene is capable of expressing zzso zzso correction of zzso zzso is an attractive therapeutic zzso Although current mouse models of zzso characterized by zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso adequately model the disease zzso their complex zzso and short lifespan have hindered the development and testing of therapies aimed at zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the mouse and human zzso are regulated similarly by zzso elements within in zzso 7 and its downstream zzso zzso the zzso zzso is sufficient to induce zzso 7 skipping in the mouse zzso as in the human zzso When the mouse zzso gene was humanized to carry the zzso zzso keeping it under the control of the zzso promoter, and in the natural zzso context, the resulting mice exhibit zzso 7 skipping and mild adult onset zzso characterized by muscle zzso decreased activity and an zzso of the muscle fibers zzso This zzso zzso mouse represents a new model for an adult onset form of zzso zzso zzso also know as the zzso zzso
