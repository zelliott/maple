zzso zzso zzso is associated with the expansion and instability of a zzso zzso repeat at the zzso locus on zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis in the German population was carried out on 18 zzso families, six families with zzso diagnosis, 69 subjects with zzso clinical diagnosis, and 100 controls using the zzso chain reaction zzso and a refined Southern zzso In the majority of the cases molecular analysis confirmed the clinical zzso These included seven cases of zzso zzso zzso with widely differing gene expansions and zzso In most zzso families the expanded zzso became larger in successive generations, but we also identified four families with zzso and two families that showed stability of the enlarged zzso during zzso In four clinically defined zzso patients we were unable to detect enlarged zzso zzso zzso of each zzso of the zzso gene in two of these patients failed to show any zzso Our cases have important implications for genetic zzso of zzso families, highlighting both the diagnostic value of direct zzso analysis and its zzso
