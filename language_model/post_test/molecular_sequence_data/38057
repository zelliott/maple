We report a multifaceted study of the active site region of human pancreatic zzso Through a series of novel kinetic analyses using zzso and zzso zzso an overall zzso action pattern for this zzso has been zzso The preferred zzso mode occurs when a zzso zzso serves as the leaving group zzso sites zzso and zzso and there are three zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it appears that five binding zzso span the active site, although an additional zzso zzso appears to be a significant factor in the binding of longer zzso zzso parameters for the zzso of zzso modified at the 2 and zzso ' positions also highlight the importance of these zzso groups for zzso and identify the zzso zzso Further kinetic and structural studies pinpoint zzso as being the likely zzso in zzso with substitution of this zzso leading to an approximately zzso drop in zzso zzso zzso studies show that the original zzso structure of zzso is modified upon zzso presumably through a series of zzso and zzso zzso The end result is a zzso zzso that spans the active site region with its zzso zzso bond positioned at the normal site of zzso Interestingly, the side chains of zzso and zzso along with a water zzso are aligned about the inhibitor zzso zzso bond in a manner suggesting that these might act individually or collectively in the role of zzso catalyst in the reaction zzso Indeed, kinetic analyses show that substitution of the side chains of either zzso or zzso leads to as much as a approximately zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso of human pancreatic zzso and its complex with zzso clearly demonstrate the importance of zzso to the mode of inhibitor zzso
