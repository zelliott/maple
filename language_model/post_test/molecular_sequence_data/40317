We isolated three zzso zzso strains from zzso zzso zzso zzso that were capable of utilizing zzso as a sole carbon and energy zzso These strains are the first zzso zzso The strain designated zzso completely zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso medium within 12 zzso with zzso cell zzso We identified zzso and zzso as internal zzso by gas zzso zzso When zzso was used as an zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso could not degrade zzso and zzso was not zzso We concluded that metabolism of zzso by strain zzso is initiated by zzso to zzso followed by a zzso zzso Growth experiments with 20 other zzso showed that zzso zzso and zzso which have zzso side chains of three to five carbon atoms with zzso or zzso zzso supported cell growth but that zzso zzso technical zzso zzso and zzso did zzso The rate of growth on zzso was much higher than that of growth on the other zzso zzso experiments with various zzso showed that strain zzso cells grown on zzso could degrade zzso with variously sized and zzso side chains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso via a zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso Along with the degradation of these zzso we detected zzso zzso zzso that retained the structure of the original zzso side zzso zzso zzso may be useful in the zzso of environments zzso by zzso and various other zzso
