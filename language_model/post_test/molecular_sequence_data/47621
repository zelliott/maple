After amplification by zzso chain reaction zzso the zzso sequences of a zzso section of the zzso region of human zzso DNA zzso were determined in 40 teeth extracted from patients living in zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was extracted separately from the dental pulp and zzso zzso the attached pulp cells from the most superficial layer of the pulp cavity wall) of the same zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of the zzso region of the zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso events were identical in material from both zzso Thus, zzso produces equivalent results when the dental pulp of a tooth is zzso for zzso zzso To establish the reliability of the screening procedure for the sequence analysis, we identified restriction sites for the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso region of the zzso Thirteen of 14 patterns of four zzso analyzed using the zzso from the 40 tooth samples were identifiable by an initial screening procedure involving restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso Combined use of sequence analysis and zzso analysis proved extremely efficient in analyzing zzso zzso allowing identification of zzso
