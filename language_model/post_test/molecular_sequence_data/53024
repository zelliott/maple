Modern biomedical research greatly benefits from large-scale zzso projects ranging from studies of zzso bacteria, and zzso to zzso organisms, like zzso zzso Comparative zzso studies offer a vast array of prospects for identification and functional zzso of human zzso zzso We presented a novel comparative zzso approach for assembling human gene zzso and assisting gene zzso The zzso zzso zzso was used as an alignment template to assist in novel human gene identification from human zzso zzso zzso Among the available zzso zzso zzso protein zzso our results indicate that at least zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has human zzso zzso with zzso records of zzso zzso proteins matching known human gene zzso Only zzso or less of zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso We found that the remaining zzso sequences might lead to discoveries of novel human zzso and over 150 putative full-length human gene transcripts were assembled upon further database zzso [The sequence data described in this paper have been submitted to the
