The zzso sequence of the sheep zzso DNA zzso zzso region and its zzso zzso genes has been zzso Several zzso motifs among zzso have been identified along the zzso sequence of the sheep control zzso ten zzso sequences zzso and one zzso sequence block zzso zzso and zzso which are frequently found in most species, are not present in the sheep zzso which shows instead a short direct repeat at their usual zzso A long zzso tract between zzso and the zzso gene is also zzso Furthermore, the sheep zzso zzso region displays tandem repeats in the left domain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso three different zzso sequences zzso zzso and zzso
