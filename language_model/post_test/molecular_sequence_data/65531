zzso zzso is an opportunistic human pathogen which relies on several zzso signaling systems for optimum population zzso regulation of zzso zzso The zzso zzso signal zzso is a zzso with a zzso substitution which is zzso by the zzso of zzso acid with a zzso zzso The zzso zzso has been identified as being necessary for zzso production, and the zzso gene encodes a predicted protein with zzso to zzso zzso A zzso zzso In order to zzso the first step of the zzso synthesis zzso in zzso zzso we have characterized the function of the zzso gene zzso zzso prepared from zzso coli expressing zzso were shown to catalyze the formation of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso The zzso protein was zzso as a zzso zzso zzso and this protein was shown to have zzso zzso zzso The zzso was active on a variety of aromatic zzso including zzso and zzso and zzso derivatives of zzso zzso of zzso formation in zzso was observed for the zzso and zzso zzso as well as for several zzso which were not zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso protein is responsible for zzso zzso for entry into the zzso zzso zzso and that this zzso may serve as a useful in zzso indicator for potential agents to disrupt zzso signaling in zzso zzso
