The zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso share extensive structural and functional zzso both cleave natural zzso effectively only with a zzso at a zzso zzso However, the zzso activity of zzso is zzso lower than that of zzso To identify zzso of this poor zzso we expressed zzso of truncated zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The crystal structures of zzso and zzso revealed four characteristic active site components which were subsequently exchanged between zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso or exchanging the 148 loop did not increase activity of zzso whereas corresponding zzso abolished zzso of zzso zzso zzso by Val only moderately increased zzso of zzso zzso the 99 loop, however, dramatically increased zzso Furthermore, combining all four zzso essentially introduced zzso properties into zzso the zzso activity was increased zzso with zzso zzso zzso The results suggest a zzso origin of zzso poor zzso A narrowed zzso zzso zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso while a distorted zzso zzso zzso effective zzso of the zzso zzso Both defects could be repaired by introducing zzso zzso Such engineered zzso zzso will be useful in zzso and in the development of zzso
