zzso syndrome zzso is caused by the disturbed expression of genes from the imprinted region of zzso but the specific contributions of individual genes remain zzso Most paternal zzso deletions are bracketed by zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso deletions are very zzso In the present work, we describe the molecular analysis of two patients with zzso deletions using zzso analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso A deletion of about 2 zzso in Patient 1 started at zzso and ended in the middle of the typically deleted region within the zzso zzso The deletion in Patient 2 started zzso zzso zzso from zzso within the zzso zzso extended over zzso zzso and ended within the zzso gene in zzso zzso In Patient 1 both deletion zzso involved repetitive regions, which precluded cloning of the junction and pointed to zzso zzso zzso as a possible mechanism of this zzso The zzso in Patient 2 were zzso and their structure suggested zzso end joining as the most likely cause of this zzso The zzso of both patients did not depart significantly from the typical clinical picture of zzso although some symptoms in Patient 2 were also reminiscent of the zzso of individuals with the recently described zzso zzso zzso Our findings support previous observations of relatively mild zzso effects resulting from deletions that extend zzso from the zzso region and observations of the modest effects of different types of genetic defects on the spectrum and severity of symptoms in zzso
