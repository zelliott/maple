The zzso family comprises zzso and zzso proteins involved in zzso guidance and cell zzso We have isolated and characterized deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Both zzso exhibit defects in zzso zzso For example, the zzso ray precursor cells frequently fail to change zzso positions completely relative to their sister tail lateral zzso precursor cell zzso causing ray 1 to be formed anterior to its normal position next to ray zzso The ray cells, which normally separate from the lateral tail zzso cell zzso at the end of zzso stage, remains connected to the zzso cell even in adult zzso zzso The ray 1 defects are partially zzso in each single zzso zzso at 20 degrees C, but are greatly enhanced in zzso double zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso function in parallel to regulate ray 1 zzso Both zzso also have defects in other aspects of zzso functions, including head and tail zzso zzso and touch cell zzso migration, zzso zzso zzso alone have defects in zzso and zzso zzso A feature of zzso zzso that is shared with zzso of zzso (which encodes zzso is the abnormal zzso of contacts between zzso zzso
