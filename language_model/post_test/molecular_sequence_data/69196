The zzso zzso system consists of zzso 60 (also termed zzso which is zzso to zzso coli zzso and zzso 10, which is zzso to zzso coli zzso In zzso zzso 60 function has been shown to be essential for zzso We report here that the same is true for zzso zzso We have zzso zzso and disrupted the nuclear zzso 10 gene zzso from zzso zzso This gene encodes a protein of zzso Da that is imported into the zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso cells lacking a functional copy of zzso fail to grow at temperatures between 23 and 37 degrees zzso
