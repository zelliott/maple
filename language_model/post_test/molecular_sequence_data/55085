zzso zzso bacteria from a zzso microbial microcosm that exhibited apparent complete zzso of zzso zzso zzso were isolated through enrichment and zzso culture procedures with zzso as the model zzso By zzso zzso gene sequence zzso these zzso zzso were identified as being members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso among which those of the zzso zzso and zzso were most zzso All of the zzso zzso zzso as the sole carbon and energy source and zzso zzso metabolically or zzso however, they hardly attacked zzso zzso and zzso By zzso cloning and sequencing, genes predicted to zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in all test zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso with specific primer sets detected approximately zzso copies of the zzso large zzso genes zzso wet zzso in the microcosm from which the zzso were zzso This order of the copy number corresponded to approximately zzso of the zzso zzso gene copies from zzso and its relatives present as potent zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso bacteria co-exist and play a role in the zzso degradation of less zzso and completely zzso products in the zzso process, thereby achieving the apparent complete zzso of zzso
