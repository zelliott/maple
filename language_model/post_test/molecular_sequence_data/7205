zzso zzso is a recently isolated zzso antibiotic, consisting of an zzso zzso embedded in a highly zzso zzso This zzso damages duplex DNA in zzso producing a mixture of zzso and zzso breaks at selected zzso The zzso isolated as the methanol zzso from the zzso zzso exhibits the same selectivity and zzso chemistry as the zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that the primary DNA breaks involve zzso abstraction from the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Unlike most other zzso zzso zzso DNA strand zzso is not zzso induced by zzso or the methanol zzso of the zzso This was also observed for the zzso zzso DNA zzso is inhibited in the presence of certain zzso zzso zzso as was observed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies on the methanol zzso of the zzso zzso in the presence of calcium zzso provide clues regarding its zzso and give insight as to the regions of the zzso important for DNA zzso Our results suggest that the zzso artifact of the zzso may in essence be a zzso and it zzso the parent zzso as in the zzso prior to zzso zzso As with zzso and zzso zzso exhibits a high affinity for zzso in zzso zzso them to low molecular mass zzso zzso zzso the most opposite in net charge, is zzso most zzso This latter activity may serve to disrupt the zzso superstructure in zzso prior to exposing the DNA to the zzso
