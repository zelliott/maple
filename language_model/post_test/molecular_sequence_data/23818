zzso zzso zzso zzso expression library was zzso with zzso two clones were isolated and identified as zzso zzso Both clones were zzso zzso contained zzso translated bases zzso zzso zzso and designated as zzso while zzso contained 311 translated bases zzso protein of zzso zzso designated as zzso The DNA sequence zzso search of zzso revealed a relatively high degree of identity with zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso revealed the highest similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso search of zzso gave zzso identity with zzso protein zzso while zzso showed zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis of the deduced proteins was zzso in addition the predicted zzso & zzso zzso have been also zzso However, zzso zzso of identified zzso was achieved using the zzso in an indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso labeled the outer zzso in a zzso pattern, which proved that the identified zzso were zzso in origin and that infected zzso subjects induced zzso directed mainly against zzso zzso
