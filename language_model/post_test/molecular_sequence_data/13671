The primary theme emerging from molecular genetic work conducted with zzso tuberculosis and several other zzso species is that resistance is commonly associated with simple zzso zzso in target zzso genes rather than with acquisition of new genetic elements zzso zzso zzso zzso in an zzso region of the gene zzso zzso the beta zzso of zzso zzso account for zzso resistance in zzso of zzso tuberculosis and many zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance in about one-half of zzso tuberculosis zzso is associated with zzso zzso in the zzso gene coding for zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso in the zzso gene resulting in zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presumed regulatory region of the zzso locus are repeatedly associated with zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso A majority of zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso have zzso acid zzso in a region of the DNA zzso A zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis arise as a consequence of sequential zzso of zzso zzso resistance to single therapeutic zzso zzso strategies show considerable promise for rapid detection of zzso associated with zzso zzso These approaches are now amenable to zzso in an appropriately equipped clinical zzso zzso
