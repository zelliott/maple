zzso of most animals, plants, and zzso zzso are made up of tandem zzso of repeated DNA sequences produced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso has an unusual variation on this zzso zzso consist of tandem zzso of sequences produced by successive zzso of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso To explore the zzso distribution of these zzso zzso we have looked for zzso zzso in a zzso related zzso species, zzso We have found elements that, despite many differences in zzso zzso retain significant zzso acid similarity to zzso from zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso elements have features that characterize zzso elements in zzso zzso zzso they are found in tandem zzso on zzso ends, zzso they are not found in zzso and zzso they produce both sense and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso being in zzso The zzso zzso zzso elements have one surprising zzso both of the zzso contain long stretches of the zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso (with a few zzso zzso These long zzso stretches are zzso in the three zzso zzso elements zzso They do not interrupt any zzso of known function in the zzso proteins and are not seen in zzso proteins from other zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso mechanism of zzso maintenance may have arisen before the separation of the zzso zzso
