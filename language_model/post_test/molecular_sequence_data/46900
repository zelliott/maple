A zzso group III alcohol zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso which grows at an optimum temperature of 85 degrees C and an optimum pH of zzso The gene zzso this zzso was zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso characterized and compared with the native form of the zzso The zzso structure is zzso being a zzso zzso zzso of 45 zzso at pH zzso the pH optimum for alcohol zzso and a zzso zzso at pH zzso the pH optimum for zzso zzso The kinetic parameters of the zzso show that the affinity of the zzso is greater for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso form of the zzso is probably the active form in zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso a series of primary zzso and aromatic alcohols zzso from C2 to zzso but is also active towards methanol and zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso to be cloned and zzso in a zzso zzso expression system, and the zzso and the native forms have identical main zzso
