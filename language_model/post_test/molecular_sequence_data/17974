In this report, we examine two aspects in the development of a vaccine against zzso bacterial pathogens based on hybrid zzso that express zzso zzso First, we describe the construction of a zzso fusion zzso for zzso against zzso coli that produce zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso For that construction, the zzso zzso of the gene coding for ST was fused to the 3' zzso of the gene coding for the binding zzso of zzso The ST gene was constructed zzso with appropriate restriction sites to permit zzso downstream zzso zzso expression of ST zzso was obtained when a zzso zzso zzso was included between the zzso and ST zzso The zzso zzso fusion zzso consisted of a single zzso chain with an apparent molecular weight of zzso The zzso fusion zzso was zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso and ST were recognized by zzso directed against the native zzso Animals zzso with either crude or zzso preparations containing the hybrid zzso produced zzso that were able to recognize native toxin in zzso zzso these zzso were able to neutralize the biological activity of native zzso The second aspect reported here examines a mechanism for stabilizing expression of zzso zzso in attenuated zzso zzso by integration of the zzso gene zzso into the zzso of the zzso A comparative in zzso study of the levels of expression of zzso between the zzso strain and an zzso strain carrying the zzso gene on a zzso zzso demonstrated that the initial levels of expression of both strains is similar, that the zzso strain loses the ability to express the zzso zzso very quickly and that the zzso continues to maintain and express the zzso without the requirement for a stabilizing zzso
