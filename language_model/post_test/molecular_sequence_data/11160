The zzso zzso produced by zzso cells plays a critical role in zzso It was recently discovered that zzso zzso zzso is a component of that zzso and preliminary evidence suggested that it could contribute to the nurturing environment for zzso zzso A fusion protein prepared from the zzso terminal portion of zzso and the constant region of human zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso Furthermore, the cloning efficiency of zzso zzso precursors was increased in a zzso manner by addition of this fusion zzso We now report the complete zzso sequence for zzso zzso and its zzso to the central region of zzso zzso A fusion protein prepared from the full length of zzso and zzso was found to recognize zzso cells in a zzso zzso manner, and to augment zzso proliferation of mature B cells, as well as the cloning of zzso cells, but to have no influence on zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is normally a zzso zzso we show that it is also capable of zzso zzso when expressed as a zzso protein on zzso Although the zzso portion of zzso has sequence zzso to zzso the unique zzso one fifth of the protein was sufficient to augment zzso zzso
