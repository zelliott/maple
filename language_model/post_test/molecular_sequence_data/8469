zzso finger motif is a novel DNA binding motif characterized by the unique role of zzso the protein folding and the DNA binding ability are governed by the coordination of a zinc zzso In zzso zinc finger, two zzso and two zzso contribute to form a zzso domain through zinc zzso The zinc finger of zzso gives promise of recognition for any DNA sequences because of its recognition zzso A zzso zinc finger protein zzso has been converted into artificial zzso zzso with an attached zzso DNA zzso unit zzso This protein zzso DNA at a single site near the zzso recognition zzso The zinc zzso zzso is zzso to zzso mapping and zzso
