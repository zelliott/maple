The majority of the biological effects of zzso in the zzso tract are zzso by zzso zzso zzso which regulates zzso by several zzso Because the zzso effects of some zzso zzso may be caused by zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso we aimed to identify the contribution of DNA recognition to these mechanisms in two clinically important target zzso namely zzso and zzso We used a genetic mouse model that zzso DNA zzso zzso independent zzso regulation zzso by zzso The zzso zzso harbors zzso acid exchanges at four positions of the zzso domain zzso of zzso This construct was knocked in the zzso gene locus to produce zzso mice devoid of a functional zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso mice resembles the general zzso zzso of zzso knockout zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso and impaired zzso zzso zzso In agreement with this zzso the expression pattern of the zzso zzso mice in liver obtained by zzso gene expression profiling supports the observation of a near-complete loss of zzso gene regulation in comparison with the wild zzso Further gene expression analyses to validate the results of the zzso data were performed by quantitative zzso The analyses indicate that both gene zzso and repression by zzso zzso rely on an intact zzso in zzso
