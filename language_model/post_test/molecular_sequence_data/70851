On the basis of function and sequence similarities, the zzso zzso can be classified into three groups: zzso zzso and zzso Thirty new putative zzso genes from zzso and bacteria and six zzso zzso motifs have been identified in DNA and protein zzso Two of these motifs are specific of zzso one is specific of zzso another is specific of zzso and two are shared by both zzso and zzso Based on these data, literature data, and the zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso a model for the evolution zzso genes by successive zzso followed by divergent evolution is proposed, with either two different ancestors, one for the zzso and one for the zzso or a single common zzso for the two zzso The expected properties of such an hypothetical zzso suggest that the plant or insect zzso using zzso as zzso might be the present forms of this zzso since zzso using zzso as zzso are expected to be of earlier appearance in evolution than zzso using N zzso However, an example of zzso evolution of zzso genes is suggested for the appearance of the zzso found in plants and zzso
