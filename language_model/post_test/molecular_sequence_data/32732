The zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso beta zzso serves key roles in zzso regulation and the development of the senses of hearing and color zzso The versatile functions of this gene depend upon its expression of distinct zzso zzso by differential promoter zzso The zzso zzso has a particularly specialized distribution including in the anterior zzso and zzso zzso is also found in immature cone zzso where it has a unique role in programming the expression pattern of zzso zzso that mediate color zzso Given the importance of precise, zzso expression for the function of zzso we investigated the zzso control elements that direct this expression in zzso using zzso reporter zzso in zzso The zzso promoter region is sufficient for cochlear zzso whereas a complex zzso control region is necessary for zzso and retinal zzso In the zzso the zzso region directs peak expression in the zzso in zzso immature zzso The retinal control region is further subdivided into zzso that specify and amplify zzso respectively, indicating that zzso zzso expression reflects an integrated response to complex zzso The zzso zzso gene has therefore incorporated several mechanisms into a zzso zzso control region that regulates zzso induction of the distant zzso This specialized zzso organization zzso the unique expression pattern and functions of zzso
