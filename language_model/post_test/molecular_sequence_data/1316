zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso the transfer of zzso to zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso gene cause a type of zzso muscular zzso called zzso disease zzso We evaluated several truncated zzso of zzso to determine the minimal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids in the zzso and 9 zzso acids in the zzso did not affect zzso activity, while larger deletions on either end abolished zzso These data indicate that the minimal zzso domain is at least 353 zzso zzso Single zzso acid zzso in the stem domain of zzso from zzso patients abolished the activity of the zzso form but not the soluble zzso This suggests that the stem domain of the soluble form of zzso is unnecessary for activity, but that some zzso acids play a crucial role in the zzso zzso
