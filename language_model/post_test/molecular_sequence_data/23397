The zzso sequences of partial zzso zzso zzso to the zzso acid sequence of zzso in the total 97 zzso acids of zzso were determined for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and related zzso zzso zzso zzso were noted at 4 positions and a synonymous substitution was seen at position 82 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso sequence of zzso may provide more detailed information regarding the relative zzso positions of plants than the zzso acid zzso However, zzso plants in the same section zzso zzso and zzso and of different varieties zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed identical zzso zzso zzso This result suggests that there are very close relationships among the plants in each zzso
