Wheat zzso binding factor zzso was shown to be an zzso of zzso zzso zzso storage protein zzso Three zzso genes zzso this zzso factor were isolated from a bacterial artificial zzso zzso library and zzso The genes all have two zzso separated by an zzso of approximately 1,000 zzso where the second zzso contains the entire coding zzso Many differences were found between zzso zzso but none of them is predicted to significantly alter the sequence of the putative zzso zzso The three zzso genes are specifically expressed in grain from 3 to 39 days after zzso The zzso variation of a genetically diverse collection of 27 bread wheat lines was zzso One, five, and one zzso zzso zzso were detected in the zzso genes for the A, B, and D zzso zzso Physical and genetic mapping utilizing some of the zzso identified confirmed that zzso genes are located close to the zzso on the zzso group 5 zzso The low level of zzso diversity found in zzso genes may suggest that these genes play a key role and are thus constrained by zzso
