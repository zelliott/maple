zzso of either native zzso or soluble zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso was investigated by electron zzso of zzso zzso One of the soluble forms of zzso zzso formed zzso zzso inside the zzso zzso zzso perpendicular to their long axis showed a zzso crystal whereas cells cut parallel to their long axis contained a long, narrow zzso In both zzso directions an ordered zzso was visible as shown by optical zzso Computer processing was used to enhance the crystal zzso From this the unit cell parameters were calculated as a zzso zzso zzso b zzso 4 zzso c zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso 75 zzso The calculated zzso volume of 120 zzso is large enough to contain one protein zzso
