Williams syndrome zzso is caused by deletion of the zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed an zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso and the gene dosage of zzso using a new probe zzso in a series of 60 sporadic patients with a clinical diagnosis of zzso zzso of the zzso gene was shown in 54 cases, while clinical zzso of the 6 patients without the deletion did not confirm the diagnosis of zzso These results support the genetic zzso of zzso and the high accuracy of zzso molecular analysis, which can be zzso used for providing genetic zzso to zzso zzso
