We used the partial zzso nerve zzso zzso model of zzso to assess zzso zzso after administration of zzso zzso zzso At a dose of 200 zzso in zzso rats, subcutaneous delivery of zzso reversed zzso zzso at 3 and 24 zzso zzso declined at 48 h and returned to baseline at 72 zzso A dosing study of zzso gave a dependent response with 100 zzso having a similar potency to the 200 zzso study with 50 and 10 zzso responding somewhat zzso When zzso was administered every fourth day for 12 days at 100 zzso 24 h post injection values returned to baseline each zzso Our results suggest that zzso may have potential for therapeutic use in zzso pain syndromes in zzso
