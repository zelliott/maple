zzso cyanide zzso is a secondary zzso produced by many zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the gene cluster zzso zzso synthesis in a newly isolated zzso zzso strain, zzso from South Greenland was zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso gene cluster comprises a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso resulted in zzso zzso and zzso with no production of zzso and zzso zzso with reduced zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso was inserted into the zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso was found in a region upstream of a putative zzso zzso gene zzso and in zzso zzso the zzso disrupted a probable zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that in zzso zzso zzso strain zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso produced zzso and inhibited the growth of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, when zzso the strains in the zzso potato zzso zzso neither of the strains produced any zzso and thus, they were unable to inhibit zzso growth of zzso These experiments strongly indicate that the synthesis of zzso is highly dependent on the growth medium zzso
