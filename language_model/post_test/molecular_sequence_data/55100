zzso zzso asexual differentiation is induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso that include the zzso zzso Factor zzso zzso A zzso screen for proteins zzso expressed in the presence and absence of zzso identified 18 zzso Most candidates belong to GO term classes involved in zzso and/or zzso stress zzso Among these, we focused on zzso a putative zzso zzso which is zzso in a zzso zzso zzso is not required for growth since no differences were detected in the zzso extension upon deletion of zzso However, its activity is required to induce zzso under specific culture zzso A zzso strain zzso profusely under acid conditions but displays a characteristic fluffy zzso zzso in alkaline zzso The absence of asexual development in a zzso strain can be zzso on one hand, using high zzso of zzso carbon sources like zzso and on the other hand, when the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Overall, the results obtained in this work support a role for zzso at early stages of zzso zzso
