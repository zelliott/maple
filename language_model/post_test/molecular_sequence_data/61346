Analysis of the gene cluster from zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that it contains four large zzso zzso giant zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso 2, zzso 3, and zzso zzso These clustered zzso zzso genes responsible for zzso zzso together zzso 12 zzso sets of zzso activities zzso each catalyzing a specific round of zzso chain zzso The clustered genes zzso zzso zzso are organized as two sets of six modular repeats, zzso and zzso which are zzso zzso The total of 55 constituent active sites makes this the most complex zzso zzso system identified to zzso The zzso DNA region contains 14 additional zzso some of which zzso zzso governing other key steps in zzso zzso Between the two sets of zzso zzso genes lie two genes involved in zzso zzso one of which encodes zzso zzso zzso that probably zzso zzso ring formation at zzso to zzso Immediately right of the large zzso zzso genes is a set of genes involved in zzso zzso and its zzso to zzso zzso This cluster includes nine zzso but one is not functional in the zzso of zzso On the left side of zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso modification are located to the left of the zzso zzso zzso and an adjacent gene encodes a regulatory function that may be involved in zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
