zzso the evolutionary history of zzso requires zzso the zzso zzso amongst the constituent zzso Although the zzso and zzso among the three principal zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso well established, as are the internal relationships among the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso among the principal groups of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Depending on the study some find zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso more closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso than either are to the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas other studies support a zzso zzso To try and resolve between these two competing zzso we turned to zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso genes that have been shown to shed insight into particularly difficult zzso zzso Using deep sequencing we characterized the small zzso zzso of two zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and combined our results with the described zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the sea zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Our data zzso support the zzso of zzso as zzso zzso shares 12 zzso sequences with zzso zzso that are not present in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso libraries, and have never been reported from another zzso zzso Thus, these data resolve the zzso position of zzso ultimately allowing for a better understanding of body plan evolution throughout the zzso
