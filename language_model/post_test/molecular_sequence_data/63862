zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and relaxation during zzso zzso zzso differs from the skeletal zzso in that it has a cardiac specific N' extension of 32 zzso zzso zzso The role of the zzso N' region in modulating cardiac zzso has not been fully zzso To test the hypothesis that the zzso N' region of zzso helps regulate zzso function, we generated zzso transgenic mice in which zzso zzso zzso were zzso The hearts displayed significantly decreased contraction and relaxation under zzso and zzso stress compared to zzso hearts, with a reduction in zzso zzso force and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso sensitivity of force development and zzso zzso were not zzso Chemical shift mapping shows that both zzso and zzso interact with the N lobe of cardiac zzso C zzso and that zzso at zzso zzso these zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso N' region, do not play a direct role in the zzso transition in the cardiac regulatory or N lobe of zzso We hypothesized that zzso at zzso zzso a large zzso change positioning the zzso zzso N region to compete with zzso for the zzso region of zzso zzso with this hypothesis, deletion of the zzso zzso N' region results in a decrease in zzso zzso in the zzso mice demonstrating the importance of zzso N' region in regulating zzso zzso and zzso the response of the heart to zzso zzso
