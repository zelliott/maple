The use of human zzso zzso zzso zzso is increasing for the production of drug zzso used for drug safety testing and doping zzso Major challenges are high-priced zzso poor stability, and comparatively low zzso We have shown previously that production of specific zzso in milligrams to gram scale is feasible using human zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso In this study, we sought to improve the activities of human zzso zzso by genetic zzso Two side chains zzso and zzso of known zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso into the zzso forms of each of the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Different effects of the two zzso and their combination on zzso activity were monitored using both polar and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso double zzso displayed a strong increase in activity with respect to testosterone zzso zzso % of zzso zzso and zzso zzso turnover zzso % compared to wild zzso while the single zzso zzso showed 370 and 400 % of zzso activity towards zzso of testosterone and zzso of zzso zzso Overall, six out of seven newly created zzso displayed increased activity with at least one of the tested zzso These results support the notion that zzso knowledge can directly contribute to the improvement of zzso zzso
