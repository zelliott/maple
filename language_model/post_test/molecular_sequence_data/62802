More than blood zzso is a novel gene that is widely expressed in mouse zzso prior to zzso but is subsequently restricted to specific zzso including the developing central nervous system and zzso zzso Since zzso is highly expressed in the fetal liver and developing zzso we predicted that zzso would be required for zzso and that zzso deficient in zzso would die of zzso Surprisingly, zzso with a targeted disruption of zzso died prior to the initiation of blood cell development, immediately following zzso This zzso is due to a zzso in expansion of the inner cell mass zzso as zzso zzso failed to exhibit outgrowth of the ICM, both in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso exhibited a higher frequency of zzso cells than zzso or zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso is a novel gene that is essential for early embryonic zzso
