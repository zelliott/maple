The dogfish zzso zzso zzso I and a number of its zzso zzso in position 7 were tested in zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso I behaved as a full zzso at zzso zzso receptors of the guinea-pig zzso zzso muscle and at zzso receptors of the rabbit pulmonary artery and zzso zzso In these three preparations zzso I was as potent zzso as substance P zzso and zzso A, zzso Evidence for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso receptors by zzso I was obtained by using the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and L zzso zzso I was poorly active as an zzso at zzso receptors of the rat portal zzso Among zzso I zzso zzso I, zzso I and zzso I were zzso times weaker than zzso I itself at zzso and zzso zzso zzso I, zzso I and zzso I were as potent as zzso I at zzso receptors in the guinea-pig zzso while they showed zzso times lower affinity than zzso I for zzso zzso The present results are discussed in relation to the importance of position 7 in determining the potency and selectivity of zzso I zzso at zzso zzso
