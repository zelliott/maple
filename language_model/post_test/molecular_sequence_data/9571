A gene associated with zzso zzso transport was cloned from a local clinical zzso zzso zzso strain of the zzso zzso by using the zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso which codes for an integral membrane zzso zzso was expressed and targeted to the zzso zzso and was zzso isolated through simple zzso and zzso zzso To examine zzso of this zzso rabbits were orally fed with zzso zzso of live, zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso induced with zzso prior to zzso zzso plasmids were retrieved from zzso zzso cultured directly from stool samples of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso using the retrieved plasmids confirmed zzso of this zzso indicating viability and stability of the zzso in zzso The zzso zzso construct zzso substantial levels of zzso and zzso and challenge with virulent zzso zzso zzso evoked severe zzso in the zzso zzso control group, but not in those fed with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso administration with zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso gene increases both systemic and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso itself appears capable of protecting against the zzso symptoms caused by zzso zzso zzso is a zzso membrane protein associated with the zzso zzso and together with the zzso zzso zzso represent an attractive target for the development of a safer, live zzso therapy against zzso zzso
