zzso zzso is a zzso bacterial species which can be both zzso and zzso in humans and many zzso zzso typing of the zzso is often used for molecular zzso purposes, and can be useful for observing population structures as zzso Analysis of the variable number of tandem repeats zzso within the zzso called zzso zzso analysis zzso provides genetic information useful for molecular zzso A zzso typing method has been developed recently by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tandem repeat analysis for strain typing of zzso zzso zzso 11, zzso for zzso zzso A novel zzso protocol is described here, with the aim of investigating the zzso potential of the method, and to obtain preliminary data on the population structure of zzso zzso from a wide variety of zzso zzso zzso This protocol uses new zzso in zzso regions of the zzso and also makes use of zzso zzso for more precise results and for zzso zzso DNA sequencing of zzso was performed to ensure inclusion of zzso tandem repeats within each zzso zzso zzso unrelated zzso from a local collection obtained from 11 different animal species were typed at 6 zzso Thirty-five unique zzso types were zzso resulting in a zzso index of diversity of zzso zzso related zzso zzso previously typed by zzso gel zzso zzso were also examined with zzso and the zzso of the two methods was found to be very zzso All 81 zzso were successfully typed with zzso and zzso chain reactions zzso were automated using zzso and zzso plates, with zzso product sizes determined using zzso zzso zzso was also shown to be very zzso
