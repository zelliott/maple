The alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso binds zzso and functions as a zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is expressed in almost all zzso and cells, its zzso distribution is zzso Many studies have reported that zzso zzso from the zzso to the nucleus in a zzso manner whereas others have concluded that zzso is zzso located in the zzso These conflicting data may result from the use of zzso that do not discriminate zzso from a zzso zzso of the zzso gene termed zzso Using a zzso zzso we have recently demonstrated that zzso resides in the nucleus of cells independent of zzso zzso In the following study we have generated a novel zzso zzso zzso in order to zzso zzso the zzso distribution of zzso zzso recognizes zzso zzso on Western blots and in zzso experiments but does not zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso is detected by zzso in a variety of human cell lines including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and secondary lung zzso zzso In addition, zzso detects zzso rat and mouse zzso zzso was performed with zzso on zzso cells zzso with human zzso and on zzso rat zzso cells expressing zzso zzso In both systems, zzso was found in the zzso of cells in the absence of hormone and in the nucleus after hormone zzso These studies mark the first time a zzso zzso has been employed to examine the expression and zzso distribution of zzso zzso
