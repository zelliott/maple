zzso zzso are members of a family of structurally related zzso that promote zzso between DNA molecules that carry specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso closely related zzso that recognize different sets of sequences within the core regions of their respective attachment zzso To locate the zzso acid zzso that determine this difference in zzso we isolated zzso zzso that produce zzso zzso and measured the ability of these zzso to promote zzso of zzso and zzso sites in zzso A zzso that is of zzso origin except for one zzso zzso at position 99 and 12 zzso zzso located between positions 279 and zzso had zzso zzso specificity and activity for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing certain zzso of these 13 zzso had incomplete zzso The region around position 99 is not zzso in other members of the zzso family, but the zzso segment includes zzso that are highly zzso and believed to be directly involved in zzso Many zzso were inactive in zzso either zzso or zzso zzso zzso for zzso that restored activity to these zzso revealed sets of zzso that are likely to interact with each zzso
