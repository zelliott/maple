The human zzso zzso has previously been identified using zzso zzso to zzso an zzso tumor zzso used in monitoring zzso zzso The gene was mapped to the zzso region on zzso zzso and subsequently found to lie in close proximity to the recently identified zzso zzso The zzso protein has a zzso motif but the function of the protein is as yet zzso To investigate the function and importance of this zzso we have studied the conservation of this gene in other species and in particular in the zzso We have isolated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence indicates that the protein is highly zzso being zzso similar and zzso identical to the zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso clones indicates that it maps less than 1 zzso from the zzso gene and that, unlike that in human, this region is not zzso
