zzso zzso zzso in the tumor zzso gene zzso zzso individuals to early onset breast and zzso zzso zzso together with its structurally related partner zzso is required for zzso zzso and DNA zzso break repair, but how they perform these functions remains zzso As part of a comprehensive search for DNA repair genes in zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso In protein interaction screens, zzso was found to interact with components of the zzso pathway, the zzso domain protein zzso and most importantly, a zzso of zzso zzso We show that animals depleted for either zzso or zzso display similar zzso including a high zzso of zzso elevated levels of zzso germ cell death before and after zzso and impaired progeny survival and zzso fragmentation after zzso Furthermore, depletion of zzso and zzso leads to radiation sensitivity and a high zzso of zzso respectively, potentially linking these genes to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings support a shared role for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso DNA repair zzso and this role will permit studies of the zzso zzso in an zzso amenable to rapid genetic and zzso zzso
