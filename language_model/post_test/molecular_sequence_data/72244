zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso were characterized by molecular sequence analysis to determine their zzso and structural relationship with zzso of zzso zzso fragments from 19 plant zzso were identified in sequence databases and composite sequences were also assembled from expressed sequence tags for zzso zzso zzso differences in protein zzso and evidence for unique zzso zzso sites indicated that plant zzso were distinct from those of zzso A third zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso was identified as a distant relative to other zzso zzso and to those of higher zzso thus providing a suitable zzso for evolutionary reconstruction of the family zzso zzso evolutionary trees portrayed zzso plant, and zzso zzso as early, zzso ramifications prior to the appearance of closely related animal zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of DNA and protein sequence alignments revealed at least seven separate plant zzso represented by zzso zzso previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cotton, rape and zzso zzso zzso pepper and tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Other unique zzso may exist for rice, tomato zzso apple, and celery zzso Consensus sequences compiled for each zzso kingdom showed some breakdown of the zzso motif in repeats 2 and 3 of zzso and plant zzso and a zzso zzso deletion in repeat 3 of zzso The characterization of distinct zzso genes in plants and zzso reflects their comparable diversity among animal species and offers alternative models for the comparative study of zzso relationships within this important gene zzso
