This review summarizes our studies on the molecular biology of zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso Regarding PG zzso we have cloned five basic PG receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and four zzso zzso zzso The PG receptors are divided into three families related to signal zzso systems of the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso group zzso zzso and zzso and zzso group zzso and its zzso zzso zzso having different zzso peptides can couple to distinct G proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso specific expression of zzso zzso zzso was observed in various zzso The zzso changes of mice deficient in each zzso zzso the abnormal labor in zzso mice, the failure of zzso response in zzso mice, the abnormal closure of zzso zzso after birth in zzso mice, and the impaired inflammatory swelling and pain responses in zzso zzso Regarding zzso we have zzso mouse zzso from zzso cells, which is a zzso of 53 zzso zzso and then cloned its zzso The size of a zzso zzso is 74 zzso In the rat mast cell line, the zzso 74 zzso form of zzso was translated in the zzso and then zzso to the zzso where it was zzso processed to the 53 zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso 74 zzso form was rapidly zzso by an zzso zzso zzso The 74 zzso form without on zzso signal sequence is inserted into the zzso membrane with a zzso zzso
