The zzso zzso keeps precursor proteins in a zzso state and targets them to zzso at the zzso sites in the zzso membrane of zzso zzso zzso is thought to recognize zzso via its zzso To determine the minimal requirement for a zzso site, fusion proteins were created between zzso and different parts of the zzso of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso A zzso short zzso acid sequence corresponding to only the most zzso 22 zzso zzso of zzso zzso for the authentic binding of zzso or the zzso protein zzso zzso a deletion zzso that lacks this highly zzso domain, still supports precursor protein zzso but is unable to bind zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are defective in zzso zzso demonstrating that both zzso of the zzso zzso are needed to form a genuine zzso zzso zzso is released from the zzso at a very early stage in protein zzso when the zzso zzso binds zzso to initiate zzso It is concluded that the zzso site on zzso is confined to the extreme zzso of the zzso zzso and that zzso is released from this site at the onset of zzso
