zzso virus zzso is a recently identified zzso that is fatal in humans and could be used as an agent of zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso is required in order for the fusion protein zzso to mediate fusion, and analysis of the zzso of zzso F by G should lead to strategies for interfering with this key step in viral zzso zzso zzso once triggered by the zzso G, by zzso with other zzso F zzso zzso zzso zzso changes leading to a zzso bundle zzso structure that accomplishes fusion of the viral and cellular zzso The zzso of zzso F proteins contains two zzso zzso repeat regions zzso and zzso near the fusion zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso and zzso regions of F are proposed to inhibit fusion by preventing zzso after the initial triggering step, from forming the zzso structure that is required for zzso zzso peptides have previously been found to be effective at zzso zzso zzso However, we found that a human zzso virus 3 zzso is more effective at zzso zzso fusion than the comparable zzso zzso
