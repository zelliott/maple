zzso bind to receptors of the zzso type on target cells and also bind to zzso zzso including zzso In this study, we have sought to identify structural motifs zzso binding of the zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid sequences revealed the presence of several highly zzso basic zzso zzso and molecular modeling predicted that the side chains of three of the basic zzso acids fold closely together in zzso zzso zzso was used to change the zzso basic zzso in zzso to zzso and both zzso and zzso proteins were produced in a transient zzso cell expression zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso while three of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso at lower zzso zzso than wild type, while the binding of zzso with a zzso in the zzso zzso was indistinguishable from that of the zzso zzso To determine whether zzso capacity is required for zzso binding and cell zzso we performed competition zzso binding and calcium zzso experiments using one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso bound as efficiently as zzso zzso to zzso and was equally active in zzso increases in zzso free calcium zzso Our data define a zzso binding site in zzso consisting of three zzso basic zzso acids and show that the capacity to bind to zzso is not a prerequisite for zzso binding or signaling in zzso
