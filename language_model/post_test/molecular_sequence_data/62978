A total of 10 zzso genes are presently known to be expressed in human zzso We performed a comprehensive zzso search for novel zzso genes using two different but complementary approaches, and developed a novel zzso display to aid in the zzso of the zzso Seven novel human zzso genes were identified, five of which were predicted to be zzso including two processed zzso and three zzso that contained zzso Those five zzso represent the first zzso zzso zzso described in any zzso zzso studies were conducted for one novel zzso zzso and a series of alternatively spliced transcripts were identified in the human zzso zzso was also present in zzso and gorilla, differing at only seven zzso zzso zzso among the three zzso The results of these database mining studies will aid in studies of the regulation of these zzso zzso provide insights into the evolution of this gene family in humans, and serve as a starting point for comparative zzso studies of zzso zzso
