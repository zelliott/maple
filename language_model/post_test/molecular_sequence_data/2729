The zzso gene of zzso zzso a moderately zzso and absolutely zzso zzso was cloned by its ability to complement growth of an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso deficient in zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso and its zzso region was zzso The zzso gene overlapped at the termination zzso with a putative initiation zzso of zzso zzso as deduced from the zzso acid sequence zzso with zzso zzso II of zzso zzso zzso mapping of the zzso transcript produced in zzso coli cells suggested that the promoter of zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso I of zzso zzso predicted from the zzso sequence is more similar to that of an extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than that of zzso zzso
