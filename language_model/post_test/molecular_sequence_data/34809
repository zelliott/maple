Drug discovery and zzso drugs and zzso development is a continuous adaptation and maturation zzso The cycle of changes based on new findings is coupled with shifts in research priorities and make this part of pharmaceutical research a challenging zzso Over the last years, the emphasis on zzso has shifted to zzso the science of understanding how proteins translate gene information into function, and zzso the science of small zzso that are further apart from zzso zzso zzso describes the analysis of the protein complement of a biological sample with respect to zzso and spatial zzso This technology is based on separation of complex protein zzso by zzso zzso in gel digest and mass zzso analysis of the protein zzso zzso has been recently flanked by zzso a new research direction aimed at the comprehensive analysis of small zzso zzso zzso thus covering the gap between zzso and zzso The refinement of zzso is based on an essential paradigm related to zzso and zzso zzso are a paramount example of how one single gene can release multiple zzso We can expect fast progress in understanding protein and zzso networks from a systems biology approach ending in the discovery of new zzso zzso However, the way from a complex sample to potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets will depend on technological developments and from the ability to discriminate true zzso signals from false positive and negative signals, and the way from target discovery to target validation will not be zzso
