The zzso factor zzso binding protein zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in differentiated zzso and is able to induce growth arrest and differentiation in zzso zzso alpha expression is high in zzso zzso but decreases during liver zzso These observations suggest that zzso alpha is zzso related to cell zzso To investigate the mechanism of growth zzso by zzso zzso the response of zzso human cells to zzso of a zzso alpha expression zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso expression zzso was zzso zzso a zzso zzso an zzso deficient for zzso and zzso and zzso a zzso expressing zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso cells were stained for zzso activity to monitor their ability to undergo zzso The ability of stable zzso to form colonies was also assessed for each cell zzso zzso zzso with zzso alpha remained as zzso cells while control cells divided to form zzso zzso of the zzso alpha sequence demonstrated that only a small, previously zzso zzso domain was required for zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso alpha may play a role in maintaining the zzso state of zzso and other zzso Furthermore, it appears that the effects of zzso alpha are not zzso through zzso or zzso and are not altered by zzso
