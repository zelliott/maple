zzso zzso type C zzso zzso toxin contains a zzso zzso zzso designated zzso which appears to play an important role in the effective zzso of the toxin in gastrointestinal zzso cells and in creating a broad specificity for the zzso structure that zzso to various zzso In this study, using the zzso protein fused to zzso zzso we investigated the binding specificity of the zzso zzso to zzso and estimated the binding sites of zzso based on X-ray zzso and soaking experiments using various zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso effectively inhibited the binding that occurs between zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso and zzso did not inhibit zzso The crystal structures of zzso complex with zzso acid, zzso and zzso were also zzso There are two zzso sites, sites I and zzso Site I zzso to the electron zzso noted for all zzso and is located at the zzso zzso domain, while site II zzso to the electron zzso noted only for zzso An aromatic zzso acid zzso zzso at site I has a stacking interaction with the zzso ring of the zzso On the other hand, there is no aromatic zzso at site zzso thus, the interaction with zzso seems to be zzso The double zzso zzso at site I and zzso at site II has no zzso for zzso acid but has zzso for zzso In this report, the binding specificity of zzso zzso toxin zzso to various zzso is demonstrated based on its structural zzso
