In zzso zzso factors interact with promoters having complex zzso zzso The zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso efficiently activates a zzso mouse zzso tumor virus zzso promoter but is a poor zzso of the zzso promoter when it acquires an ordered zzso structure as an zzso replicating zzso We show that the zzso in zzso activity is not due to insufficient expression of either B or A zzso or competition between the two types of zzso zzso Rather, this zzso reflects an inability to induce the zzso zzso event that is required for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso To determine whether this characteristic is common to zzso expressed steroid receptors or specific to the zzso we examined the activity of zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso Unlike the zzso the zzso expressed zzso is an effective zzso of both zzso templates and efficiently zzso the necessary zzso zzso event at the zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso and zzso have unique requirements for zzso of promoters with ordered zzso zzso These differences may provide a mechanism for establishing target gene specificity in zzso for steroid receptors that recognize and bind to identical DNA zzso
