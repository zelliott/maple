We report the analysis of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso that contains a zzso at the zzso (for translation of zzso zzso nuclear zzso Pulse labeling of zzso proteins revealed that the synthesis of the two zzso I reaction center zzso zzso and zzso was zzso in this zzso The zzso levels of these proteins were only moderately reduced, suggesting that the primary zzso occurs at a step during or after zzso We constructed zzso genes consisting of the zzso and zzso zzso untranslated region zzso zzso fused to the zzso zzso zzso coding zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso of these genes into the zzso zzso through zzso transformation and analysis of their expression in the zzso zzso nuclear background revealed that the zzso (but not the zzso zzso zzso is the target of the zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso is required for the initiation of zzso zzso zzso The dependence of zzso synthesis or zzso on zzso synthesis is strongly suggested by the identification of a zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso The zzso specifically restores the synthesis of both proteins in the presence of the zzso zzso The location of the zzso zzso within a putative zzso region near the zzso initiation zzso suggests a role for zzso in the zzso of translation of the zzso zzso
