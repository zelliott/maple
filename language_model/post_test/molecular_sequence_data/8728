zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso zzso on the zzso precursor using zzso as the zzso We have zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso to apparent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now cloned and characterized the zzso zzso zzso using a reverse genetic zzso Conceptual translation of the zzso sequence of the cloned zzso pair zzso revealed an open reading frame containing 353 zzso acids with a predicted zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso into the expression zzso zzso to produce a zzso zzso protein on zzso which exhibited zzso zzso zzso A zzso search showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso possessed significant sequence zzso to a previously zzso zzso sequence zzso number zzso zzso The zzso sequence encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids that shows zzso of total zzso acid identity and zzso of total zzso acid similarity to the zzso zzso zzso alignment and zzso analysis suggest that the zzso sequence represents zzso zzso
