Human zzso is zzso to protect serum zzso from zzso zzso zzso serum activity of zzso in animal models is associated with an increased risk of vascular disease and has been linked to the zzso capacity of the zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso gene strongly influence serum zzso of the zzso The present study examined the hypothesis that promoter zzso may be genetic risk factors for vascular disease in zzso zzso arising from the promoter zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso The global odds ratio for zzso zzso comparing the high zzso zzso zzso to other zzso was zzso zzso zzso The association with the promoter zzso was more pronounced in the youngest age group zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso and was progressively lost with age zzso 50 years to zzso years, zzso zzso years, zzso There was no association between the promoter zzso and serum zzso The data are consistent with the high zzso promoter zzso being linked to reduced risk of zzso zzso The influence of the zzso may be compromised in older zzso
