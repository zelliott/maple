The effects of heat stress on organisms are zzso at the levels of organ function, zzso activity, protein stability and gene zzso Here, we examined effects of high temperature on the zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine how the temperatures at which zzso organ failure zzso zzso zzso irreversible protein damage zzso and zzso expression of genes zzso proteins involved in molecular zzso zzso and zzso and zzso regulation zzso and zzso occur compare with field temperatures, which commonly exceed zzso and can reach zzso Heart failure, zzso by the zzso break temperature, occurred at zzso zzso zzso rose significantly at zzso Genes for heat shock proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso for two zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso and for zzso zzso zzso zzso all showed increased expression at zzso Temperatures of zzso expression differed among zzso as did temperatures at which zzso zzso zzso patterns for zzso and zzso indicate that heat stress influenced cellular energy zzso above zzso zzso of zzso pathways is suggested by elevated expression of genes for zzso an altered balance between reliance on zzso and zzso fuels is indicated by changes in expression of zzso These results show that zzso zzso commonly experiences temperatures that induce expression of genes associated with the stress response zzso and zzso and regulation of energy metabolism zzso and zzso At high temperatures, there is likely to be a shift away from anabolic processes such as growth to zzso zzso to provide energy for coping with zzso damage, notably to zzso
