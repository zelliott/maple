Loss of zzso a zzso of human zzso results in zzso of zzso from the completion of DNA replication in zzso zzso An zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso zzso encodes a predicted product of zzso zzso acid zzso which shares zzso identity with budding zzso zzso a zzso related protein zzso zzso binds zzso a zzso zzso zzso previously isolated as a high dosage zzso of zzso The complex zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is defective in its ability to bind zzso suggesting that the physical interaction is essential for the maintenance of the zzso of cell cycle zzso In the zzso zzso double zzso the zzso zzso protein is still defective in its ability to bind to zzso However, zzso induced premature zzso is completely zzso suggesting that zzso may act downstream of the zzso physical interaction but upstream of the zzso of the zzso specific zzso zzso zzso
