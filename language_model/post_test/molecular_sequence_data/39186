Using a zzso library made from zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified a transcript with a zzso zzso open reading zzso The deduced protein zzso to zzso a zzso zzso previously isolated by our group from the zzso of this zzso The mature protein is composed by 185 zzso acids and shares similarity with members of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso the mature form was amplified by zzso zzso into zzso zzso and used to transform zzso coli zzso zzso As for the native zzso the zzso fusion protein shows zzso activity, promotes zzso zzso generates fragments similar to zzso and zzso zzso as zzso and generates zzso as the final zzso In addition, structural zzso studies indicated several interesting molecular features, including the zzso that could be responsible for zzso zzso zzso activity and the role of calcium binding in this zzso Such zzso activity has never been found in other members of the zzso zzso This is the first report describing the zzso production and zzso characterization of a zzso zzso zzso as well as the structural features that could be responsible for its zzso zzso zzso zzso
