zzso production by infected plants is an early resistance response leading to zzso of plant defense zzso However, plant pathogens also are capable of producing zzso and zzso might have an effect not only on the plant but on the pathogen as zzso zzso zzso may play a dual role in zzso interactions by affecting the plant as well as the zzso To address this question, we studied the effects of zzso on the gray mold fungus zzso zzso and the disease it causes on zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso zzso to zzso inhibited zzso growth in zzso and caused zzso changes in a large number of zzso zzso A screen of zzso signaling zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso which was zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and showed considerable zzso changes in response to zzso compared with the wild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants developed much larger zzso than zzso plants, whereas addition of zzso to zzso leaves restricted disease zzso zzso also affected zzso gene expression in zzso zzso of a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso was enhanced 24 h after zzso in zzso plants but only 48 h after zzso in zzso zzso Our results show that the responses of zzso zzso to zzso are partly zzso by a G protein signaling pathway, and that zzso plant resistance might involve effects of plant zzso on both the plant and the zzso
