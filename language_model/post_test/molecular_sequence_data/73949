zzso of zzso during zzso formation in zzso requires two protein factors, zzso factor I zzso I) and zzso factor zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso II indicates that four zzso of zzso 105, 100, and 90 zzso zzso with zzso II zzso The zzso protein is recognized by zzso against zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso specificity factor zzso The zzso zzso is identical to zzso a zzso protein with striking similarity to the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso designated zzso zzso factor zzso exhibits significant zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso zzso containing the zzso site and wild type upstream and downstream zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso lacking downstream sequences or to zzso in which the zzso processing signal has been zzso The specific binding of zzso to the zzso zzso is zzso in agreement with the requirement of zzso for zzso The zzso binding of zzso and the similarities of zzso II zzso to those of zzso supports the hypothesis that zzso II functions in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in a manner zzso to that of zzso in the zzso zzso These results provide additional evidence that certain features of the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso formation are zzso between zzso and zzso but also highlight unexpected zzso
