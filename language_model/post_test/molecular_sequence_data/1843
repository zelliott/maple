zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso expressed zzso protein complex required for the normal zzso of specialized zzso of the zzso system, such as zzso and zzso dense zzso The complex is known to contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The genes zzso these proteins are defective in zzso mouse strains that serve as models of zzso syndrome zzso a genetic disorder characterized by zzso and zzso storage pool zzso In addition, zzso of human zzso causes zzso type zzso Here, we report the identification of another four zzso of the zzso One is zzso a zzso protein previously characterized as a binding partner of zzso proteins 25 and 23 and implicated in the regulation of membrane fusion zzso The other three are previously zzso zzso which we named zzso zzso 1, 2, and 3 zzso zzso and zzso Using specific zzso to detect zzso proteins from human and mouse cells, we found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso upon size exclusion zzso with previously known zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso levels of the four proteins are significantly reduced in cells from pallid mice, which carry a zzso in zzso and display secondary loss of other zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses suggest a network of zzso interactions involving all of the previously known and newly identified zzso Interestingly, the zzso mouse model strain, reduced zzso carries a nonsense zzso in the gene zzso zzso As judged from size exclusion zzso zzso the reduced pigmentation zzso affects zzso assembly less severely than the pallid zzso zzso in the human genes zzso zzso and the zzso proteins could zzso novel forms of zzso
