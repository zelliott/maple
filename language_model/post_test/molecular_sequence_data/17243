zzso receptors zzso are the largest group of cell surface molecules involved in signal zzso and are receptors for a wide variety of stimuli ranging from light, calcium and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso It is assumed that systematic zzso zzso has identified the overwhelming majority of all remaining zzso in the zzso Here we report the cloning of a novel orphan zzso which was identified in a search for zzso genes in the brain as a strongly zzso zzso This unknown gene coded for a protein which had a zzso zzso and key features typical of zzso of the A family but a low overall identity to all known zzso The zzso coded zzso has an unusually high evolutionary conservation and is expressed in zzso in diverse areas of the zzso with relation to zzso functions or motor zzso A zzso zzso screen for interacting proteins revealed binding to the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso to zzso has been described for another zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, we found complete zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso The interaction with zzso proved to be critical for the stability or folding of zzso as in mice lacking zzso the zzso protein was zzso by zzso although zzso zzso levels remained zzso We propose that zzso is a highly interesting new orphan zzso with potential connections to zzso and zzso zzso zzso
