We have previously shown that the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso type 7 zzso promotes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso channels zzso seen upon zzso zzso Here, we performed a zzso zzso screen of a zzso rat brain zzso library using the zzso zzso tail of zzso as bait and identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a binding zzso The interaction was confirmed in zzso and in zzso by pull-down zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells and cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso was antagonized by zzso In zzso zzso of zzso with zzso but not zzso zzso unable to bind zzso reduced the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the absence of zzso zzso These results suggest that competitive interactions of zzso and zzso with zzso control the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso
