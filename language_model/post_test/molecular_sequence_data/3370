The zzso zzso zzso of zzso (called zzso zzso was isolated by screening of a zzso zzso library with mouse zzso zzso The isolated clone matched to zzso of zzso zzso Analysis with two of the zzso raised against zzso revealed that unlike zzso zzso it is heat zzso zzso induction of zzso by heat shock led to a slight zzso extension in the zzso zzso life zzso The transgenic worms that zzso zzso zzso predominantly in muscle showed life span extension zzso zzso for mean and approximately zzso for maximum life zzso as compared to the zzso and green fluorescent zzso zzso Life span extension of human cells was obtained by zzso of zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results show, for the first time, that this member of the zzso family zzso the longevity of worms and thus there are common pathways that determine zzso and zzso zzso
