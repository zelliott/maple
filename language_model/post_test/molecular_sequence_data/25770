The zzso acid sequence of the zzso carrier zzso a component of the inner zzso of zzso has been deduced from the sequences of overlapping zzso zzso These clones were generated in zzso chain reactions zzso in the first instance, complex zzso of zzso as zzso and zzso with sequences based upon partial protein sequences of zzso zzso fragments of the zzso zzso The protein sequence of the carrier, including the zzso zzso is 314 zzso acids zzso The mature protein has a modified zzso group, but the nature of this modification and the precise position of the mature zzso zzso acid have not been zzso although it must lie in zzso acids zzso of the deduced protein zzso zzso of the protein sequence with itself and with those of 3 other zzso carrier zzso zzso zzso the zzso carrier, and the zzso protein from brown fat, shows that all 4 proteins contain a zzso repeated sequence about 100 zzso acids in zzso and all the repeats are zzso This suggests that the members of this family of proteins have similar structures and mechanisms and that they have evolved from a common zzso The distribution of zzso zzso acids in the zzso carrier supports the view that the zzso are folded into similar structural zzso possibly consisting of two zzso zzso joined by an extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso arising from a longer related transcript of the zzso carrier gene have also been zzso They contain zzso additional zzso in the 3' zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
