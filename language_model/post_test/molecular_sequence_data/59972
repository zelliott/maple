zzso zzso is an important zzso pathogen that zzso zzso when grown in the presence of zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso to produce zzso is associated with zzso but the specific role of zzso in the zzso of infection is not zzso In this study the ability of zzso zzso zzso to bind proteins and protect against zzso peptides was zzso zzso was shown to bind a variety of proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso interactions were dependent on the pH of the solution and on the amount of protein and zzso zzso zzso cells were less susceptible to killing by three zzso zzso a zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso of the zzso peptides with zzso zzso followed by removal of the zzso reduced or abolished zzso activity, demonstrating interactions between peptides and zzso The ability of zzso to bind proteins and to protect against zzso peptides suggests a protective function for zzso zzso it sequesters zzso peptides and abrogates their zzso
