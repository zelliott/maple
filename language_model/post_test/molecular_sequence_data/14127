zzso of zzso to zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso the product of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression of zzso in humans is due, in part, to alternative zzso start sites that arise as a consequence of the use of zzso cells and zzso tissue from cows, horses, and pigs zzso in order to determine whether these species, like the human, zzso zzso promoters to drive zzso zzso The majority of transcripts in the zzso have zzso that differ from those in the zzso upstream of a common site of zzso indicative of a zzso zzso The use of zzso promoters by the bovine zzso gene would produce these results, as it does in the case of the human zzso zzso A bovine zzso library was then screened with zzso that zzso to zzso or zzso zzso Two clones of approximately 15 zzso each in length were zzso one zzso with the zzso sequence and the other zzso with the zzso zzso Whereas the former sequence was zzso with the downstream sequence containing the zzso start site, the latter was identical only with the sequence of the zzso transcripts upstream of the putative zzso zzso indicating that this was the zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso sequences share zzso zzso identity, while bovine and human zzso sequences demonstrated only zzso zzso zzso These results mirror those obtained in comparisons of human, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
