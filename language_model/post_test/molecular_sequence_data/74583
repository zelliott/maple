The human zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins have been reported to interact directly with zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso through the zzso motif in their zzso domain and function as zzso receptors for zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we identified and characterized a zzso of human zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the physical interaction between zzso and zzso from zzso which is likely zzso via the zzso domain of zzso that contains two zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso showed that zzso associates with zzso zzso TO zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso but not with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso complex, supporting the existence of a distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in onion zzso cells showed their zzso in the nucleus, consistent with the notion that the zzso complex functions as a nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of two zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed that embryonic development of the zzso zzso is arrested at the zzso stage, indicating that zzso is essential for plant zzso zzso the levels of zzso leads to diverse zzso zzso zzso that zzso might be involved in multiple zzso zzso
