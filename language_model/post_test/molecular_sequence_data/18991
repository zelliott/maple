zzso zzso zzso zzso the final step of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso in plants and zzso zzso analyses combined with activity zzso enabled us to zzso the two putative genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso which zzso the two zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we solved the crystal structures of zzso at zzso and zzso zzso at zzso revealing a quite similar overall structure that belongs to the family of zzso II zzso zzso zzso comparison indicated a significant induced fit upon binding to the zzso which occupies the binding site for the zzso zzso and blocks the product release zzso zzso zzso zzso further confirmed that zzso is a competitive inhibitor of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso alignment revealed that the zzso zzso are highly zzso in all zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso of zzso might be a universal mechanism of zzso zzso zzso
