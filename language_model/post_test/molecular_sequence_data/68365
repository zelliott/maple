The members of the zzso family of cloned zzso zzso channels are quite zzso in primary structure, but they are highly diverse in functional zzso zzso channels differ from zzso and zzso channels in zzso and zzso properties, the sensitivity to external zzso and to current zzso by external zzso zzso Here we show several other interesting zzso While zzso and zzso are blocked in a zzso and concentration dependent manner by internal zzso zzso zzso is only zzso blocked at very high zzso The single-channel zzso relations of zzso are rather linear while zzso exhibits an inwardly zzso single-channel current in symmetrical zzso zzso The zzso of the channels, measured by tail current zzso is faster in zzso by a factor of two compared with zzso In a search for the structural motif responsible for these differences, point zzso creating zzso between zzso and zzso in the pore region were zzso The zzso zzso zzso in the background of zzso zzso the properties of zzso block, tail current zzso and inward zzso zzso of zzso to zzso This zzso was previously shown to be responsible for the zzso in external zzso sensitivity and channel regulation by external zzso zzso Thus, this zzso is expected to be located at the external side of the pore zzso The data are consistent with the idea that the zzso alters the channel occupancy by zzso and thereby indirectly affects internal zzso block and channel zzso
