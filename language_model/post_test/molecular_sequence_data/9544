zzso to different ecological environments can promote zzso Although numerous examples of such zzso zzso now exist, the zzso basis of the process, and the role of gene flow in it, remains less zzso This is, at least in part, because systems that are well characterized in terms of their ecology often lack zzso zzso In this study, we characterize the zzso of zzso zzso stick insects, a system that has been researched zzso in terms of ecological zzso but for which zzso resources have not been previously zzso Specifically, we obtained zzso million zzso sequencing reads that assembled into zzso zzso representing approximately zzso unique genes and tens of thousands of potential molecular zzso Second, as an illustration of their utility, we used these zzso resources to assess zzso genetic divergence within both an zzso pair and a species pair of zzso stick zzso The results suggest variable levels of genetic divergence and gene flow among zzso pairs and genes and illustrate a first step towards future zzso work in zzso
