Little is known about the potential effect of climate warming on zzso zzso despite their important impact on the dynamics and diversity of plant zzso The structure of zzso zzso zzso along zzso zzso may provide information about this potential effect, because zzso zzso zzso to temperature zzso over short geographic zzso We thus investigated variations in the composition of zzso zzso inhabiting the zzso of European zzso zzso zzso at four sites over a zzso of zzso of zzso in the French zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso Our results show that the composition of zzso zzso varied significantly between zzso sites, in terms of both the relative abundance and the zzso of species, and that the variations in zzso composition were well correlated with variations in the average zzso Our results therefore suggest that climate warming might alter both the zzso and the abundance of zzso zzso species, including potential zzso For example, zzso zzso a zzso agent of leaf spots, showed decreasing abundance with zzso and might therefore shift to higher zzso in response to zzso
