Regional zzso zzso is associated with increased levels of zzso and zzso factors that may alter zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso We have used the zzso zzso model to determine whether zzso in zzso signal zzso through the beta zzso zzso zzso zzso occur in the setting of chronic episodes of zzso zzso Pigs were zzso with zzso zzso placed around the left zzso coronary zzso 5 zzso later, after zzso closure, flow and function were normal in the zzso bed, but flow zzso zzso zzso and function zzso zzso zzso were abnormal when zzso demands were zzso The zzso bed showed a reduction in zzso beta zzso number zzso zzso zzso Despite regional zzso of zzso beta zzso number, zzso zzso activity was similar in the zzso and control zzso zzso zzso showed that the cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha 2, was decreased in the zzso bed zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased in zzso sections from the zzso bed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha 2 content was associated with decreased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha 2 content, in conjunction with increased zzso alpha content in the zzso may provide a means by which zzso zzso is maintained in the setting of chronic episodic zzso zzso
