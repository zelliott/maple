We have cloned and completely zzso a gene zzso the heavy chain of zzso zzso zzso Like the zzso I molecules from zzso the zzso zzso I heavy chain is composed of a zzso head domain fused to a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain, rather than the zzso rod domain of conventional zzso Comparisons of the zzso zzso I zzso zzso acid sequence with those of the zzso zzso I reveal that they are highly similar zzso including the unconventional zzso zzso The zzso zzso I gene is expressed in growing cells as a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso level of this zzso at different times during zzso zzso and development are consistent with a role for zzso I in zzso and zzso Generation of zzso cells lacking zzso I by gene disruption and/or zzso zzso production should provide a way to test directly the role of this zzso zzso in cell zzso These experiments will be simplified by the fact that Southern zzso analyses of zzso zzso DNA are consistent with there being a single zzso I zzso zzso
