While studying the effect of steroids on the growth of the zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso was converted into the zzso zzso This reaction was identified as a transfer of the zzso group from zzso to the zzso group of zzso The corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso is specific for zzso or zzso and zzso zzso The apparent zzso for zzso is approximately zzso zzso The protein associated with zzso activity was partially zzso and finally isolated from an zzso zzso zzso peptides were generated and zzso zzso Two zzso sequences allowed the identification of an open reading frame zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso translating into a zzso protein of zzso unknown zzso This protein zzso by a gene known as zzso displays 37% identity with an alcohol zzso zzso by the zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso led to the complete elimination of zzso activity and consequently abolished the zzso of zzso In addition, a toxic effect of zzso linked to the disruption of zzso was zzso zzso toxicity is more pronounced when the zzso zzso is introduced in a zzso strain devoid of the zzso cassette zzso zzso and zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso plays an active role in the zzso of zzso in association with the zzso pumps zzso and zzso
