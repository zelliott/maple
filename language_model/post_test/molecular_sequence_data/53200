zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of growing in the zzso of infected host zzso zzso escape from the zzso zzso of infected cells is mainly zzso by the zzso zzso zzso O zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are zzso in the mouse zzso We have developed a genetic system with zzso as a reporter gene allowing the identification of both zzso and in zzso promoters of this zzso zzso libraries were created by randomly inserting zzso zzso zzso fragments upstream of the zzso zzso gene cloned into zzso and zzso shuttle zzso and expressed in an zzso zzso zzso With this zzso promoter trap system, combined with access to the zzso zzso zzso database, we identified 20 in zzso zzso including genes zzso zzso zzso a previously known zzso zzso zzso a putative new zzso and zzso two proteins of the general protein zzso zzso By using the zzso system as an in zzso expression technology zzso nine in zzso zzso of zzso zzso were identified, including genes zzso zzso the previously known in zzso zzso zzso C and zzso a putative zzso zzso possibly involved in zzso acid zzso The use of zzso as a reporter is a simple and powerful alternative to classical methods for zzso analysis to monitor promoter activity in zzso zzso
