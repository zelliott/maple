The active zzso zzso zzso zzso is crucial in the induction of zzso T cell zzso Here we show that zzso is associated with and regulated by two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In lethally zzso mice zzso with bone zzso cells from T cell zzso mice zzso zzso to express the genes zzso these zzso zzso zzso cells contained negligible amounts of zzso zzso proliferated well and produced large amounts of zzso 2 after zzso zzso In contrast, cells expressing the alternatively spliced zzso zzso 1 alternative reading frame 1, contained large amounts of zzso zzso and were functionally zzso and they proliferated poorly and produced zzso zzso 2 when zzso in a similar zzso Thus, these two proteins have opposing zzso functions in controlling the stability of zzso expression and the zzso zzso zzso in T zzso
