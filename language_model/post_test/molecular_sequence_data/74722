In order to analyze the genes related to the zzso production, a strain of zzso producing zzso bacteria, referred to as strain zzso was isolated using enrichment culture and zzso methods with zzso broth zzso from the fish sauce zzso The two Japanese fish sauce zzso used, accumulate over 1000 zzso of zzso zzso and 16 S zzso gene sequence analyses identified strain H as zzso zzso the zzso zzso producing bacteria present during fish sauce zzso zzso analyses zzso and Southern zzso of the zzso producing strain confirmed that the strain zzso a 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso a single copy of the zzso dependent zzso zzso gene zzso A comparison of zzso that is a structural gene of zzso zzso among strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated zzso sequence zzso The zzso gene cluster consisted of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and were almost identical to that of zzso zzso zzso with zzso sequence similarity including the structural zzso zzso zzso However, the approximately 500 zzso regions upstream and downstream of the zzso gene were different between that of strain H and zzso zzso zzso The complete sequence of zzso revealed zzso zzso including 28 zzso two pairs of zzso zzso zzso similar sequence of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso could be zzso on zzso elements among zzso acid zzso
