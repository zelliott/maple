A zzso approach based on zzso chain reaction zzso partial small zzso zzso genes and genetic profiling by zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to characterize the bacterial diversity inhabiting the zzso of zzso plants grown on an agricultural zzso The community structures of two zzso a genetically engineered and a zzso zzso different zzso regimes and soil zzso were compared with each other at two sampling zzso zzso were generated with DNA from bacterial cell zzso with zzso zzso to zzso highly zzso zzso gene zzso On zzso gels, each profile consisted of zzso 50 distinguishable zzso zzso analyses of patterns recorded by digital image analyses could not detect any difference between zzso or treatments that was greater than the zzso between zzso A total of 54 sequences recovered from different bands were identified and grouped into operational zzso units zzso Surprisingly, only five of 40 zzso contained sequences of both zzso Three different bands from a profile were selected to test whether this small overlap was due to an incomplete recovery of zzso From a faint band, two different zzso were found when 12 clones were zzso and from two strong bands 24 and 22 zzso were detected from a total of 26 and 36 zzso zzso The zzso belonged to zzso different groups of zzso Gene zzso that were developed to target different bands of the profiles, however, indicated in Southern zzso analyses that patterns between treatments, replicates and zzso and even from two different growing seasons were highly zzso Our study demonstrates that community profiles can consist of more sequences than zzso by zzso and that gene zzso in Southern zzso can be a useful control to investigate the composition of microbial communities by genetic zzso
