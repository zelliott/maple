zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso whose rapid zzso replication cycles define its zzso We identified a zzso growth zzso zzso which zzso arrests before the middle of the zzso stage of the zzso cell zzso This arrest is caused by a point zzso in a gene zzso across zzso zzso whose product zzso to the zzso To zzso the role of zzso we performed zzso expression zzso Besides the expected zzso expression profile, many genes associated with the zzso state as well as with the zzso zzso stage were zzso zzso with these profiles were the expression of zzso zzso factors typically associated with zzso and zzso stage zzso This suggests a role for zzso in control of gene zzso As zzso does not contain any functionally defined zzso we reasoned zzso exerts its function through interactions with other zzso In support of this model we demonstrated that zzso is present in a protein complex and can zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso acts as a pivotal protein potentially regulating gene expression at several transition points in zzso zzso
