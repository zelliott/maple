The human zzso gene expresses at least 2 type 1 membrane zzso zzso a zzso high zzso zzso zzso often highly expressed in breast cancer zzso and containing a variable number of tandem 20 zzso acid repeat units, and the zzso zzso which lacks this repeat array and, therefore, is not zzso Despite their documented importance in signal zzso zzso the relative expression of the 2 zzso in zzso tumors is zzso Using zzso zzso which recognize different zzso zzso the expression of these zzso in zzso zzso cells has been zzso A comparison of the amounts of the 2 zzso revealed preferential expression of the novel zzso protein in breast cancer tissue zzso Furthermore, although the zzso protein is almost zzso in zzso cervical zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso is extensively expressed in these zzso The presence of the zzso sequence as well as that of an additional zzso zzso designated zzso were demonstrated by reverse zzso zzso amplification of zzso extracted from zzso and zzso zzso zzso It has been shown previously that the zzso zzso domain interacts with the zzso domain containing zzso zzso which zzso signals to zzso a protein which in its activated form can lead to cell zzso We present here data demonstrating that zzso zzso expression increases the zzso potential of zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso in contrast, zzso of zzso is not observed with zzso zzso Our studies thus demonstrate that expression of the zzso gene in zzso tumors can give rise to substantial levels of zzso proteins devoid of the tandem repeat zzso which are generated by alternative zzso zzso
