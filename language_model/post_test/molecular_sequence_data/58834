zzso contain a molecular genetic system to express the 13 protein components of the electron transport system zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the function of this system result in some diseases, many of which are zzso disorders, prominently involving highly zzso zzso zzso These defects can be caused by large-scale zzso of zzso by point zzso or by nuclear gene zzso resulting in abnormalities in zzso Although any of these zzso would be expected to produce a similar clinical zzso by compromising zzso zzso the surprising and puzzling result is that different clinical zzso are generally associated with specific zzso zzso Moreover, the same zzso can produce a distinct clinical zzso in different individuals or zzso zzso zzso are also found in aged individuals, but at a zzso level, suggesting that normal and pathological processes can differ by the effect of genetic or environmental factors on the error rate of zzso zzso
