zzso zzso zzso is unique to the wood zzso zzso collectively referred to as white rot zzso zzso zzso simultaneously degrades zzso and zzso whereas the closely related species, zzso zzso also zzso zzso but may do so with relatively little cellulose zzso To investigate the basis for selective zzso we conducted comparative zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso numbered 13 and five in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso contains at least seven genes predicted to zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso contains zzso We also observed expansion of the number of zzso zzso zzso genes zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed substantial zzso of several zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso identified zzso proteins in zzso zzso culture zzso but none in zzso zzso zzso These results support the importance of zzso and a zzso degradation mechanism zzso zzso of the dominant zzso structures is zzso by zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso genes were predicted to zzso zzso structurally similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso and, following zzso expression in zzso coli, the zzso were shown to zzso high zzso potential zzso but not zzso Apart from zzso zzso degradation, we also examined zzso and zzso systems in both zzso In zzso the zzso zzso genetic inventory and expression patterns exhibit increased zzso potential and diminished zzso capability relative to zzso zzso
