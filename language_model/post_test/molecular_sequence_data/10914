Using zzso as a direct zzso label for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso we have identified a binding site for zzso in the zzso region of the zzso of the zzso zzso was completely inhibited in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso whereas neither the zzso zzso zzso zzso and caffeine nor the zzso zzso zzso and zzso affected the labeling zzso Competitive and zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased the yield of the zzso by up to zzso suggesting that the respective binding sites are zzso linked with the zzso zzso The zzso constant zzso of binding of zzso to the identified site on the zzso was of the order of zzso zzso Sites of labeling were found in the sequence regions zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso These regions may represent parts of a single binding site for zzso which is zzso distributed within the primary structure of the zzso zzso zzso The existence of an zzso binding site for zzso zzso on the molecular level, that this zzso can directly act on zzso zzso as has been suggested from previous zzso and zzso zzso
