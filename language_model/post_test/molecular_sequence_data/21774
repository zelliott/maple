The third zzso loop zzso of G zzso receptors zzso is an important contact domain between zzso and their G zzso Previously, the zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso was suggested to undergo a zzso change upon zzso as detected by differential zzso zzso in the presence and absence of zzso In this study using zzso zzso experiments we show that the zzso zzso ends of zzso 5 zzso and zzso 6 zzso that flank the zzso and zzso sides of zzso undergo zzso changes upon zzso zzso whereas the center of the zzso loop does zzso Single zzso substitution of zzso in the middle of zzso led to receptors that formed high levels of zzso zzso whereas zzso substitution at the interface of zzso and the zzso zzso ends of zzso and zzso resulted in minimal zzso zzso zzso The alternating pattern of zzso involved in zzso suggested the presence of a zzso zzso in the middle of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso by zzso zzso at the zzso ends of zzso and zzso but not by zzso in the middle of zzso Thus, the zzso ends of zzso and zzso undergo zzso change upon zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso did not influence zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the interaction of the zzso of zzso with zzso is critical for inducing zzso changes at zzso and zzso We propose that the changes in zzso revealed for zzso at the ends of zzso and zzso are affected by the presence of G protein but not G protein zzso This study provides new information about role of specific zzso of a zzso in signal zzso and how zzso zzso binding activates the zzso
