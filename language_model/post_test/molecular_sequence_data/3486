The zzso selectivity of human zzso and zzso zzso zzso forms of the zzso factor type 2 zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to identify zzso acids in these two zzso receptors zzso these zzso An zzso acid zzso in the third zzso domain zzso in zzso or zzso in zzso was found to diverge between both zzso When binding and signaling characteristics of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso the zzso acid motif replacement produced receptors with binding properties resembling the zzso zzso The converse zzso created a zzso zzso with a binding pharmacology identical to the profile of the zzso zzso This effect was most notable for zzso which possessed a binding affinity for zzso approximately zzso greater for zzso than zzso In contrast, the binding profiles of the zzso zzso and zzso did not zzso These data indicate that another domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso Two zzso acids in the first zzso domain differ in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso bound zzso with a low affinity indistinguishable from the zzso zzso zzso these data demonstrate that zzso selectivity differences between zzso and human forms of the zzso zzso are governed by these two motifs of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
