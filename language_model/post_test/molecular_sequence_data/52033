zzso from our analyses of variable region gene usage among spontaneous zzso zzso in zzso mice have indicated that both the early zzso and zzso zzso zzso to DNA are generated by zzso selected B zzso The zzso usage of particular variable region genes among all the zzso zzso analyzed and reported to date supports this zzso The preferential expression of particular light and heavy chain variable region genes among selected populations of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso likewise supports the zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso B cells are derived from the same zzso precursor population and may be derived from the same B cell zzso precursor within an individual zzso The selective and zzso expression of zzso and zzso structures that would be expected to promote protein binding to DNA within zzso zzso variable regions, particularly zzso in both light and heavy chain zzso regions, indicates that DNA or zzso complexes may be the zzso that stimulates zzso zzso in zzso zzso The progressive increase in the specificity of spontaneous zzso zzso for native DNA as the zzso response matures from zzso to zzso likewise suggests that DNA may be the zzso stimulus for spontaneous zzso in zzso zzso A hypothetical, computer-generated model of zzso zzso binding to DNA provides an interesting paradigm for the molecular basis of zzso specificity for zzso
