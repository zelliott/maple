The zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins belong to a highly zzso family of regulators of the type 2A zzso which participate in the zzso signaling pathway, connecting zzso availability to cell zzso The mechanism of regulation involves binding of zzso to zzso and zzso in zzso and binding of zzso to the zzso zzso of type zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Both zzso proteins undergo partial zzso generating stable zzso zzso The full-length proteins and zzso zzso deletion zzso at zzso acids 222 zzso 236 zzso and 254 zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso producing a zzso similar to the one generated by full-length zzso whereas zzso and zzso are highly stable zzso zzso and zzso show zzso circular zzso zzso as do their respective zzso zzso resistant zzso The cloned truncated proteins zzso and zzso however, possess a higher content of zzso indicating that the zzso region is less zzso which is consistent with its higher sensitivity to zzso In spite of their higher secondary structure content, zzso and zzso showed zzso unfolding zzso similar to the full-length zzso Based on small angle X-ray scattering zzso the calculated radius of zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso zzso A and their maximum dimension approximately 142 A and approximately 147 A, zzso The zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso plots show that all studied proteins show variable degree of zzso zzso of model structures based on zzso data showed that zzso and zzso proteins have zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso exhibit zzso zzso
