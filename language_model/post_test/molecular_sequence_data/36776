When basic proteins I and II from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are zzso zzso zzso with low activity, were injected zzso into mice, zzso was induced accompanied by a rapid increase of plasma zzso zzso zzso This increase was about 2 times greater than that raised by highly active zzso zzso zzso which has been regarded as a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso muscle fibers was observed with basic proteins I and II but not with zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso was induced by zzso but not by basic proteins I and zzso zzso and zzso effects appear to be not necessarily related to zzso activity of proteins although zzso effects is in parallel to zzso zzso Light microscopic observations of muscle preparations treated with three zzso showed similar zzso changes, zzso zzso necrosis without zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The structural and functional elements of zzso for zzso zzso are zzso
