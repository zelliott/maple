zzso a double stranded zzso binding zzso has been shown to be involved in creating and maintaining cellular asymmetry in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso binds to the 3' zzso of specific zzso and acts in their zzso and zzso to various zzso zzso zzso molecular interactions during development have been limited to investigations in zzso zzso Since a zzso zzso has not been studied in a zzso system, the aim of this study was to clone and characterize a zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso model, zzso The zzso zzso sequence shows a zzso zzso to the human zzso with a zzso zzso in the highly zzso double stranded zzso binding domain zzso zzso maps on the zzso radiation hybrid panel to linkage group 6, zzso zzso from zzso between zzso and zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso showed that zzso is expressed both zzso and zzso zzso expressed zzso is localized to the developing nervous system and at 24 h is highly concentrated in the zzso zone of the developing zzso zzso expressed zzso is dispersed in the mature zzso and early zzso In the adult, zzso is expressed in specific brain zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
