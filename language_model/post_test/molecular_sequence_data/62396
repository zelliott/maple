A full-length zzso clone zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated by screening a soybean zzso zzso library with a zzso expressed sequence zzso zzso sequence analysis of the isolated zzso revealed a single zzso frame of zzso base pairs zzso a zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of soybean zzso revealed significant zzso with other plant zzso Analysis of zzso DNA by Southern zzso indicated that zzso is zzso by a small gene zzso The authenticity of the isolated zzso zzso was confirmed by the expression of the zzso in an zzso coli zzso zzso resulting in the growth of the zzso in minimal medium without zzso zzso of soybean zzso in zzso coli resulted in the production of a zzso protein that was subsequently zzso by zzso column zzso The zzso protein exhibited zzso activity, indicating that the zzso zzso protein is a functionally active zzso The zzso soybean zzso was inhibited by zzso the end product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso soybean zzso zzso with a zzso protein from zzso leaves, but failed to detect any proteins from soybean leaves and zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis indicated that zzso zzso was expressed at low levels during soybean seed zzso In comparison to zzso leaves, the zzso activity was zzso lower in soybean leaves and seeds, suggesting that zzso is a zzso zzso
