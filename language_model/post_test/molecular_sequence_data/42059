We have performed analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the promoter region and the translated parts of the 18 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA from 20 unrelated familial zzso zzso patients was zzso Four different running conditions were used for the zzso gel zzso to systematically evaluate how differences in the running conditions affect the sensitivity of the zzso These conditions were 15 W, 40 W, and 50 W in the absence of zzso and 50 W in the presence of zzso zzso zzso analyses of the 18 zzso fragments for the 20 subjects revealed a total of 46 zzso at 15 W, 45 at 50 W, 42 at 40 W, and 41 at 50 W with zzso zzso A total of 53 different zzso were observed when the results of the four conditions were considered zzso Assuming that the four conditions together detected zzso of the different zzso the sensitivity of the four individual conditions ranged between zzso (15 zzso and zzso zzso W with zzso zzso There were marked differences among the different running conditions to detect abnormal zzso patterns of individual zzso zzso different conditions should be used for the different zzso of the zzso zzso
