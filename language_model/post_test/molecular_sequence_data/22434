zzso is a zzso zzso protein that controls the zzso translation of zzso and zzso B1 zzso in maturing zzso zzso zzso activity requires not only the zzso of zzso but also the synthesis of a zzso upstream zzso zzso We show that the synthesis of zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso reporter zzso show that a zzso element in the zzso zzso is necessary for zzso repression in immature zzso zzso The repression is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and by its binding protein zzso 2 zzso zzso also interacts with the zzso zzso of human zzso for zzso zzso and the embryonic zzso protein zzso Following the induction of zzso zzso zzso not only from zzso zzso but from zzso and zzso as well; as a consequence, zzso zzso is zzso These results demonstrate that a zzso zzso interaction controls zzso zzso translation and, as a result, zzso zzso zzso
