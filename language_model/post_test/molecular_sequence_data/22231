This study was designed to test the possibility that zzso peptides could be derived from the zzso sequences of zzso zzso Using two zzso zzso and zzso we selected and produced two putative peptides zzso and zzso zzso believed to possess zzso properties based on their zzso zzso The data presented support this hypothesis in that the peptides and various zzso displayed zzso activity, zzso or zzso either individually or upon zzso These putative peptides are believed to act by a mechanism of action resembling that of conventional zzso peptides when judged by both structural and functional zzso Thus, the peptides are shown to have the ability to form a zzso structure, to bind to model bacterial zzso and zzso model zzso They also display rapid zzso zzso and their zzso potency is increased upon zzso The possible relevance of these results in contributing to potency of zzso zzso is zzso Such peptides may be used to design new potent zzso compounds much needed in face of the ever threatening drug resistance zzso
