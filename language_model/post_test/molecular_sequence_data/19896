zzso zzso are a new class of potent zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso We have created a zzso model of a binding site for this class of compounds located on the contact area of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso The binding pocket that was identified from the analysis of the zzso model is formed by 4 zzso of three zzso and 2 zzso of the zzso The lead compound of the zzso series, zzso was zzso into the pocket using a simulated zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso Different zzso were treated zzso The best zzso pose for each zzso was zzso by molecular dynamics simulation on the zzso atoms of the binding region and zzso The interaction energies in the zzso complexes enable us to rank the different zzso in order of interaction strength with the zzso binding zzso We propose that the activity of zzso against zzso tuberculosis is based on interference of the compound with the zzso geometry of the zzso transfer zzso Upon binding the compound mimics the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and interacts in its place with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso This mode of action is zzso by the good agreement between the zzso interaction energies and the observed pattern of zzso in the model of the binding zzso
