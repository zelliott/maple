The zzso zzso zzso possesses two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso functional, zzso both zzso and zzso activities, while zzso is dysfunctional and not required for zzso The protein products of these two zzso zzso and zzso are much alike but are distinguished by an zzso zzso of zzso which is absent from zzso and other zzso zzso We show that deletion or zzso of the zzso zzso modestly impaired the zzso zzso efficiency in zzso (with a zzso to zzso increase in zzso and a zzso to zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso can be zzso converted to a functional gene via zzso zzso and the zzso zzso is zzso for protein stability and the rescue activity of zzso at zzso in zzso A zzso analysis further showed that zzso and zzso are zzso that arose from a gene zzso event relatively recently, with zzso being the zzso These results indicate that zzso is an active zzso essentially resembling the zzso zzso form of zzso Our study suggests that the zzso zzso represents a novel auxiliary domain, which zzso both productive zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
