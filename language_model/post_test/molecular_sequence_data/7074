zzso and zzso receptors exert their regulatory functions by acting as both zzso and zzso of gene zzso A nuclear zzso zzso zzso of relative molecular mass zzso has been identified which mediates zzso zzso of gene zzso by these zzso suggesting that the molecular mechanisms of repression by zzso and zzso receptors are analogous to the zzso zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso and zzso
