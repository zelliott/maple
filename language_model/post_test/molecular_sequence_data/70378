Thirty-nine human zzso zzso zzso were zzso separated from human zzso extracts using a mild zzso procedure which consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and immobilized zzso zzso Twenty of these zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid analysis, and 17 were shown to be highly zzso zzso zzso zzso The specific activities of these zzso zzso ranged from 1980 to zzso zzso protein in terms of the 2nd IS for human zzso zzso based on protein content as determined by zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso content were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The purity was assessed by silver zzso on zzso Under zzso conditions, a single band of apparent molecular mass zzso zzso was observed, whereas under reducing conditions the zzso migrated as two distinct bands, zzso zzso and zzso zzso probably corresponding to the alpha and beta zzso of zzso zzso The remaining three less pure zzso preparations zzso zzso contained additional bands of 16 zzso and zzso zzso under zzso zzso All zzso showed a low molecular mass zzso of zzso zzso which was zzso zzso of stained material as assessed by zzso zzso acid composition of the 17 zzso zzso was similar to the published zzso composition of zzso Further zzso of one zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso liquid zzso yielded four zzso identified by zzso sequencing as two alpha and two beta zzso zzso identical to their zzso zzso zzso No additional sequences indicative of internal clipping of zzso were zzso The two pairs of alpha and beta zzso probably represent two separate zzso zzso in this zzso It was concluded that a mild zzso procedure with high zzso for the isolation of intact zzso zzso has been developed, and 17 zzso of high purity suitable for further biological and zzso characterization have been zzso These zzso preparations are free of other zzso zzso but may still contain multiple zzso zzso
