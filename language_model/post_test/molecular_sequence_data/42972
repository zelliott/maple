The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoters of zzso salmon were cloned by zzso using zzso based on the DNA sequences of the rainbow trout zzso zzso of the DNA sequences of the zzso salmon and the rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoters revealed that their DNA sequences and putative zzso zzso are remarkably zzso zzso activity of the zzso salmon zzso zzso and zzso promoters were examined by zzso studies using cell lines from fish and zzso The zzso and zzso promoters were shown to be active in all fish cell lines but were only zzso active in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso promoter was also zzso by zinc and cadmium in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso promoter was inactive in all fish cell zzso zzso experiments also established that the zzso zzso promoter has very strong activity in the various fish cell zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso promoter and the zzso salmon zzso and zzso promoters are useful for the construction of expression zzso for transgenic and gene transfer studies in zzso
