zzso data supports the notion of a zzso protein family that is characterized by combination of two zzso zzso and a zzso zzso light zzso zzso Family members in zzso induce an zzso response that has been connected with resistance to zzso in zzso and is considered as a marker of zzso In the present study, we have compared three zzso of the liver fluke zzso zzso for their zzso properties in zzso zzso raised against the zzso proteins detected the native proteins in zzso type zzso and zzso linings of zzso system and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso induced strong zzso and zzso responses in zzso mice while only weak to moderate responses were observed against the complete zzso proteins and their zzso zzso zzso crude zzso and zzso extract zzso reacted predominantly with one zzso and its zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso infected mice did not react with the zzso zzso The zzso products of the three genes were detected from the zzso up to the adult zzso These observations indicate that the investigated zzso proteins are not at the frontier of zzso zzso interaction in acute zzso zzso in mouse but are acting as zzso proteins in zzso that interface with the zzso environment or zzso zzso
