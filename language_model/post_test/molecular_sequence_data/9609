The zzso of the zzso effect by zzso zzso against a synthetic zzso corresponding to the second zzso loop of the human zzso zzso receptors was studied in adult rat zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso shifted the zzso relationship of the zzso zzso zzso to higher zzso whereas zzso rabbit zzso G zzso or zzso against the zzso of the beta zzso had no zzso This effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso was fully blocked after zzso with the zzso zzso No significant change of zzso zzso response to zzso was observed in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso did apparently not hamper the access of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study demonstrates for the first time in intact adult zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso activity of zzso raised against a part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
