zzso defective interfering zzso zzso of the zzso zzso virus tomato bushy stunt virus contain four zzso segments zzso zzso derived from the viral zzso Region I zzso to zzso zzso regions II and III are derived from internal positions, and region IV represents a zzso zzso We analyzed the internally located region III in a zzso zzso zzso to understand better its role in zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso region III is not essential for zzso zzso zzso but molecules that lack it accumulate at significantly reduced levels ( approximately zzso zzso zzso region III is able to function at different positions and in opposite zzso zzso a single copy of region III is favored over multiple copies, zzso the zzso effect observed on zzso zzso zzso is not due to region zzso zzso stabilization, zzso zzso zzso lacking region III permit the efficient zzso of zzso zzso and are less effective at suppressing helper zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is also significantly depressed for zzso zzso lacking region zzso zzso these results support a role for region III as an zzso element that zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso strategy was used to define portions of region III important for its zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the results revealed several differences in the requirements for activity when region III was in the forward versus the reverse zzso In the context of the viral zzso region III was found to be essential for biological zzso This latter finding defines a critical role for this element in the zzso cycle of the zzso
