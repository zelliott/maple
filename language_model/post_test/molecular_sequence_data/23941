The zzso zzso sequence zzso base pairs, zzso of the mouse zzso zzso gene was determined and zzso The zzso start site was mapped to zzso zzso of two zzso motifs in tandem zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso upstream from the initiation zzso of the open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso One structural feature salient to the zzso regulatory region of zzso is present in the sequence 1 zzso immediately upstream from the zzso ORF, which is highly enriched in zzso content zzso and zzso island counts zzso zzso zzso and thus rich in zzso zzso At the 3' zzso region, the zzso signal was mapped to zzso zzso downstream from the termination zzso The transcript defined by sequence data thereby is consistent with a size of 3 zzso zzso zzso determined by Northern zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which links the promoter region of zzso to the zzso reporter zzso was constructed in order to evaluate the functional capacity of the promoter and the putative motifs residing within the defined regulatory region zzso zzso upstream from the zzso in directing the reporter gene expression in zzso in zzso zzso cells and in zzso in transgenic zzso zzso zzso cell types to zzso include those derived from neural and kidney zzso zzso zzso reporter expression in zzso mice established suggests that zzso zzso expression is zzso under zzso in central zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso superior zzso zzso and brain zzso and peripheral zzso zzso zzso
