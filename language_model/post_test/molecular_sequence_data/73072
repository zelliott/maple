zzso G zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso from zzso acid and its zzso such as zzso The zzso studied here, zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso strain zzso zzso has applications in cancer therapy: following its administration as an zzso in which zzso is linked to an zzso to a zzso zzso it can zzso convert subsequently administered inactive zzso to zzso drugs selectively at the zzso zzso zzso has no significant zzso acid sequence zzso with proteins of known zzso zzso structure determination of zzso was undertaken to identify zzso zzso which may in turn provide ideas for protein and/or zzso modification with a view to improving its therapeutic zzso 

We have determined the crystal structure of zzso at zzso A resolution using multiple zzso replacement methods and zzso symmetry zzso Each zzso of the molecular zzso consists of a larger zzso domain containing two zinc zzso at the active site, and a separate smaller domain that forms the zzso zzso The two active sites in the zzso are more than 60 A apart and are presumed to be zzso each contains a zzso distribution of zzso and zzso zzso around two zinc zzso which are zzso A zzso This distance is bridged by two shared zinc zzso an zzso acid zzso and a zzso zzso 

We find that the zzso zzso domain has structural zzso with other zzso zzso both those with a single zinc zzso and those with a pair of zinc zzso in the active zzso The closest structural zzso is with the zzso from zzso zzso where the similarity includes zzso zinc zzso but does not extend to the rest of the zzso zzso consistent with the different zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso is likely to be very similar in these two zzso and may involve the bridging zzso zzso zzso acting as a primary zzso
