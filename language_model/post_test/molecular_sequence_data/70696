The zzso syndrome zzso is a genetically zzso disease in which 4 genes zzso zzso zzso have been zzso Most of the zzso have been determined in the zzso zzso of the cardiac zzso channel genes zzso and zzso In this study, we investigated the 3' part of zzso for zzso 

New specific zzso allowed the amplification of the 3' part of zzso the identification of 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso M, in the putative zzso zzso binding domain, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso was a triggering factor for zzso de zzso in 2 of the zzso of these zzso Lastly, in a large family, a zzso inherited G to A transition was found in the zzso donor consensus site of zzso zzso and a zzso inherited zzso zzso was identified in zzso The 2 more severely affected sisters bore both zzso 

The discovery of zzso in the zzso part of zzso emphasizes that this region plays a significant role in cardiac zzso Clinical data suggests that these zzso may be less zzso than zzso occurring in the pore region, but they can become clinically significant in cases of zzso The first description of 2 patients with double zzso associated with a dramatic zzso zzso implies that genetic analysis of severely affected young patients should include an investigation for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
