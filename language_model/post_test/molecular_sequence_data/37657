The mechanism underlying the differential regulation of switching to human zzso zzso is still largely zzso We demonstrate that the region upstream of the initiation sites for zzso zzso zzso transcripts contains a functional promoter which is zzso induced by zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso in transient zzso zzso in the human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso identified multiple elements in the 3' half of the zzso zzso sequence that are required for zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are induced after zzso and bind to specific sequence motifs within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and C zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA segments from the human 3' zzso regions, which may function as a locus control region for switch zzso greatly activated the promoter in an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso fragments resulted in a further increase of promoter zzso The greater enhancement of the zzso zzso from the 3' zzso rather than the zzso locus may suggest a zzso explanation for the differential expression of various zzso
