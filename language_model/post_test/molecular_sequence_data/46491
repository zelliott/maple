zzso formation is a complex process that begins with the nucleation of a zzso structure zzso that expands into a zzso or isolation zzso the precursor of the zzso A key event in the formation of the zzso is the production of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso In zzso the two closely related zzso zzso and zzso are the only known zzso of zzso that act in the zzso zzso The recruitment of zzso or zzso to the zzso is an essential step in the formation of the zzso Our zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso in all zzso shows that zzso and zzso are both zzso zzso of zzso We show that zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso and is zzso expressed in a variety of cell zzso zzso is recruited to early zzso structures along with zzso and zzso and is required for the formation of zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso is zzso we observe a remarkable zzso of zzso zzso zzso structures labeled by zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1), which are thought to act as platforms for zzso zzso In view of our data we propose a role for zzso in the progression of zzso into zzso
