The paper zzso the point of view that the first step in the evolution of zzso in zzso involved development of zzso zzso which depended on specific distribution of zzso in plasma zzso zzso of zzso formation of zzso cell contacts with a high electrical zzso zzso of zzso to the land was associated with appearance of the ability to regulate zzso zzso of zzso in a number of zzso involving zzso and other zzso hormones, zzso of zzso into the zzso plasma zzso Enhancement of the zzso role in the zzso balance, zzso of the kidney function was due to a rise in zzso zzso zzso zzso rate, and zzso zzso which, despite the increase in the energy zzso provided for an obvious enhancement of the zzso work efficiency in maintaining the constancy of the internal zzso zzso of desert regions became possible in birds and zzso due to development of the system of urine zzso zzso Unlike the accepted point of view that this depended on the appearance of zzso zzso the statement is substantiated that the leading role in this process is played by differentiation of the kidney into the zzso and zzso as at our Laboratory zzso zzso similar to zzso loop have been revealed in the zzso In the zzso the evolution shifted from the zzso to zzso type of zzso zzso zzso with the leading role of the kidney in maintaining zzso zzso of the internal medium zzso
