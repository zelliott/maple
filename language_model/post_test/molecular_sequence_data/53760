The human zzso locus is responsible for the expression of the zzso blood group zzso It consists of two closely linked zzso zzso and zzso that exhibit zzso similarity between coding zzso These observations suggest that they are derived from a relatively recent zzso zzso Previously a study of nonhuman zzso zzso genes demonstrated that ancestral zzso gene zzso occurred in the common zzso of man, chimpanzees and zzso By amplification of zzso 3 and zzso 4 of gorilla zzso zzso we have now shown that, like man, gorillas possess two types of zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso 3 being zzso zzso longer than the zzso zzso 3) and two types of zzso 4 zzso zzso 4 being zzso zzso longer than the zzso zzso zzso Here we report the characterization of a zzso zzso by a gorilla zzso gene which possesses zzso 3 and 4 of the zzso zzso A comparison of this gorilla zzso coding sequence with previously characterized human and zzso zzso sequences suggests that zzso genes experienced complex zzso events after zzso in the common zzso of humans, chimpanzees and zzso
