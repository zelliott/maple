Fusion proteins containing the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso and zzso were produced in zzso zzso zzso I zzso was used to compare the interaction of these proteins with responsive elements zzso in a typically zzso gene zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and in an zzso gene (the zzso gene of rat zzso binding zzso It is demonstrated that response elements which most closely resemble the consensus sequence show identical zzso patterns for zzso and zzso The protected regions suggest that these sequences are occupied by two zzso zzso zzso forming a zzso zzso that constitute imperfect zzso zzso however, are apparently recognized by only one zzso which mainly protects the zzso zzso At these zzso the protection patterns produced by zzso and zzso are not zzso In the long terminal repeat zzso of zzso but not in zzso a mechanism other than classical zzso formation seems to increase the affinity of zzso and zzso for these imperfect zzso
