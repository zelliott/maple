We identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso that is expressed in cultivated tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso type VI zzso zzso and encodes an zzso that zzso the formation of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso was also identified in these zzso It encodes an zzso that uses zzso zzso to produce zzso as the major product as well as a variety of other zzso The profile of zzso produced by zzso is identical with the zzso found in type VI zzso zzso and zzso map to zzso 8, and the presence of a segment of zzso 8 derived from zzso zzso zzso causes conversion from the zzso zzso zzso pattern to that characteristic of zzso zzso The data indicate that, contrary to the textbook view of zzso zzso as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in tomato zzso zzso zzso serves as a precursor for the synthesis of zzso
