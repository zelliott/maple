Human zzso zzso is a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso with three zzso zzso zzso zzso It exhibits a broad zzso zzso This study describes the synthesis of zzso zzso the zzso fusion expression of the zzso in zzso coli, and the zzso zzso of released zzso A zzso gene zzso zzso by overlap zzso synthesis method was used in the synthesis of the zzso gene with zzso zzso By constructing the expression zzso zzso high concentration of soluble zzso fusion protein zzso zzso can be obtained in zzso zzso Further zzso studies showed that the expression system was very efficient to produce soluble target zzso and the zzso of the target protein could attain more than zzso even when the culture temperature was as high as 37 degrees zzso The highest productivity zzso zzso of the zzso fusion protein was achieved by zzso the zzso coli zzso in zzso medium at 34 degrees C, inducing the culture at the zzso phase with zzso zzso zzso zzso and collecting the broth after zzso zzso The soluble target protein accounted for zzso of the total soluble zzso and the mature zzso expression level was zzso estimated to be zzso zzso This fusion protein was then zzso and zzso to get the mature zzso zzso that showed zzso activity against zzso coli and zzso zzso
