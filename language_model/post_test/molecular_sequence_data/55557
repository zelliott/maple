zzso a recently identified T cell zzso has a critical function in the generation of mature zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and T zzso Although zzso has been shown to bind to the zzso proteins zzso and zzso previous studies have yielded conflicting results regarding whether zzso from zzso mice exhibit zzso signaling zzso In this study, we demonstrate that, in the absence of zzso zzso signaling is selectively impaired in zzso SP and zzso SP zzso but is not affected in zzso zzso zzso despite high expression of zzso in zzso zzso Like zzso zzso a related member of the zzso family, which is expressed in B cells and zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso a zzso region, and a nuclear zzso zzso To determine whether zzso and zzso can perform similar functions in zzso we analyzed T cell development and zzso signaling in zzso mice zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited the same potential to restore T cell development and zzso signaling in zzso zzso Both proteins were zzso zzso and were recruited within zzso signaling complexes to zzso following zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso molecular features of the zzso and zzso proteins are important for their biological activity and predict that zzso and zzso may perform similar functions in T and B cells, zzso
