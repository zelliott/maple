Based on our findings in zzso Japan, in 2008, we reported that human zzso type 3 zzso could be associated with epidemic zzso among adults, although zzso is generally associated with infectious diseases in zzso 

To clarify the relationship between community outbreaks among children and zzso through the continued surveillance of zzso zzso 

In the summer season zzso of 2011, we collected zzso specimens from children with infectious diseases, and throat zzso and stool and serum specimens from 5 patients with zzso We detected zzso using virus isolation and zzso zzso and carried out zzso zzso We also performed screening for zzso using 309 stocked frozen specimens collected in 2008 for a comparison between 2008 and 2011 zzso 

We detected zzso in 59 children and isolated zzso from all zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso strains circulating in 2008 and 2011 could be clearly zzso apart from two zzso Further, we detected zzso strains with identical zzso sequences from children and adults in 2008 and 2011, zzso Two children belonging to one zzso patient had upper respiratory infections prior to the onset of their father's illness, and the zzso zzso from these three patients had identical zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso circulating among children in the community, zzso their household, including parents, a portion of whom may subsequently show symptoms of zzso Our observations in 2008 and 2011 strongly suggest that clinical consideration should be given to zzso in children as well as in adults during summer seasons in which an zzso outbreak occurs among the children in the zzso
