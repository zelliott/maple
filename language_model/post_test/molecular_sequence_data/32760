To generate transgenic zzso which expresses human serum zzso zzso the zzso gene targeting zzso was constructed with zzso zzso as the gene of zzso partial zzso serum zzso zzso gene as zzso arms which respectively were zzso zzso zzso regulation sequence and zzso zzso zzso sequence from the first zzso to the fourth zzso The resistant gene zzso was inserted into zzso 1 and zzso was zzso to the 3' end of the zzso zzso targeting construct DNA was introduced into the zzso cells obtained from zzso fetus by zzso The zzso selection was performed and survival clones were screened by zzso and Southern zzso Three colonies with correct zzso zzso were zzso Our results set a good basis for the establishment of transgenic zzso by gene target and nuclear transfer zzso
