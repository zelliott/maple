The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that binds specifically to protein zzso C zzso thereby affecting cell growth and differentiation and zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso We used human peripheral blood zzso zzso and zzso cells in order to analyze the action mechanism of zzso and compare it with that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activated zzso or T zzso zzso in a similar zzso and induced a similar time kinetic of zzso zzso of zzso active and zzso zzso In addition, the 2 drugs induced similar patterns of protein zzso and activated the zzso and zzso genes that their protein products regulate zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, long-term (20 zzso treatment of cells with zzso resulted in a marked loss of both zzso and zzso zzso while zzso induced only a slight reduction in the amount of cellular zzso zzso of zzso human zzso proliferation by zzso correlated with a reduction in the amount of cellular zzso An opposite effect was observed in human zzso cells where zzso zzso growth and proliferation while zzso induced terminal differentiation and cell zzso We propose that at least some of the differences in the biological effects induced by zzso and zzso are due to distinct regulations of zzso Thus, although both agents can initially bind to and activate zzso at a later time zzso 16 zzso zzso but not zzso zzso rapid zzso degradation and zzso of zzso biological responses that are dependent on the continuous presence and/or zzso of the zzso
