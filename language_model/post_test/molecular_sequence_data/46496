In zzso zzso mice, a model for zzso Pick Disease Type zzso it has been reported that zzso insulin zzso function is significantly impaired, consistent with growing evidence that membrane fluidity and zzso structure have an important role in insulin signal zzso However, whether insulin zzso function is also compromised in human zzso Pick disease Type C1 is zzso We now report a girl who developed progressive zzso zzso and zzso from 9 years old, followed by severe zzso zzso zzso and acne at 11 years zzso She was diagnosed with zzso Pick Disease type C1 zzso based on positive zzso zzso and reduced zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso Further analysis revealed her also to be zzso for a novel zzso deletion zzso + zzso + zzso at the end of zzso 20 of zzso zzso the insulin zzso leading to deletion of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein levels were normal in zzso zzso consistent with a primary signal zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Although the zzso was significantly more insulin resistant than her father, who carried the zzso zzso but was only zzso for the zzso zzso their respective degrees of zzso were very similar to those previously reported in a zzso pair with the closely related zzso zzso zzso This suggests that loss of zzso function, with attendant changes in membrane cholesterol zzso does not significantly modify the zzso zzso even in the context of severely impaired zzso zzso
