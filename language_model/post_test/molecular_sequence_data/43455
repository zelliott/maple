The fusion domain of human zzso virus zzso envelope zzso zzso is a zzso zzso region located at the N zzso of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso has been shown to zzso interfere with zzso zzso zzso formation and virus zzso To understand this phenomenon, a zzso zzso zzso type, zzso identical to the zzso segment of zzso and its zzso zzso were zzso zzso labeled, and zzso Both peptides inhibited zzso zzso zzso fusion and had similar zzso content in membrane zzso zzso Studies with zzso labeled zzso zzso revealed that both peptides have high affinity for zzso zzso are susceptible to zzso by zzso in their zzso state, and tend to zzso and zzso in the zzso In zzso gel zzso the zzso zzso formed zzso as well as higher order zzso whereas the zzso zzso only formed zzso The zzso but not the zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso inhibited zzso fusion induced by the zzso zzso probably by forming inactive zzso These data form the basis for an explanation of the mechanism by which the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells when zzso with zzso zzso
