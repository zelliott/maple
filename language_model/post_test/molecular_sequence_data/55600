zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso into cells is believed to be zzso by specific binding of envelope proteins to a cellular zzso zzso specifically blocks this initial step in infection by zzso but not zzso Resistance of zzso to this compound maps to a region of the zzso zzso zzso C zzso We have studied the function of zzso in the initial interaction of the virus with the host cell, using zzso zzso deleted for zzso and zzso zzso Resistance to zzso was directly linked to the presence of zzso within the viral zzso In addition, deletion of the zzso gene caused a marked delay in zzso to cells relative to the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso genes composed of zzso and zzso sequences were used to zzso zzso resistance within the zzso 223 zzso acids of zzso This region of the zzso comprises an important domain responsible for binding of zzso to cell receptors in the presence of zzso A zzso zzso is still zzso indicating that zzso also has an alternative zzso of zzso
