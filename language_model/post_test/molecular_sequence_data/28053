The selectivity of zzso D, a zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in the degradation of zzso zzso was zzso For this purpose, several proteins of known primary structure were subjected to mild zzso by the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso bonds were zzso zzso of the primary structures around these sites indicates that zzso D shows a strong preference for zzso bonds within a distinct sequence pattern of zzso acids extending over 7 zzso In general, this pattern is most likely to occur within zzso zzso zzso These findings and their possible implications are discussed together with additional evidence suggesting an important role for zzso D in the processing of protein zzso an essential step for their recognition by zzso zzso it is proposed that the zzso activity of zzso D is crucial in selecting processing sites and hence the location and structural context of zzso zzso for the majority of protein zzso
