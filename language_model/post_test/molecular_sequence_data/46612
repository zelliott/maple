Three groups of zzso zzso zzso exchange factors including zzso zzso and zzso have been identified to zzso In the present study, we report a new zzso zzso zzso exchange factor which we have named zzso zzso zzso exchange factor for zzso zzso shows close sequence similarity to zzso although zzso lacks a zzso binding domain and contains a nuclear zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso can activate zzso but not zzso in zzso cells and that the zzso domain of zzso is required for the zzso of zzso Northern zzso analysis suggested that zzso zzso is strongly expressed in the zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso has been found to be localized in the zzso
