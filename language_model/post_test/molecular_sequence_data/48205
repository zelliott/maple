We have reported previously that zzso D1 zzso is labeled specifically with zzso following transient expression and zzso and that this modification appeared important both for membrane zzso and zzso zzso In this work we identify by zzso that the zzso sites on zzso are zzso zzso 240 and zzso with the zzso at position zzso accounting for most but not all of the zzso Replacement of both zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso resulted in a zzso protein that contained zzso zzso In comparison with the wild type zzso the double zzso showed reduced zzso activity in zzso whereas its activity in zzso was zzso In addition, the zzso of the double zzso was altered in comparison with the wild type zzso whereas wild type zzso is primarily on zzso zzso and on zzso structures, the double zzso was on plasma zzso Because zzso 240 and zzso lie within a putative zzso zzso domain of zzso it is likely that fatty zzso on these zzso zzso the function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
