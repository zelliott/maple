We carried out an analysis on the zzso zzso of the zzso family in zzso zzso eight clones were characterized by restriction zzso zzso and zzso These data taken together with our earlier findings show that the individual zzso copies are identical only in their structural part but embedded in entirely different zzso zzso All of the zzso genes identified here are flanked by elements such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso In some cases, sequences from different elements form complex patterns indicating a sophisticated history of these zzso zzso A novel observation is that Ty and delta in the regions analyzed are exclusively associated with the zzso zzso The observed patterns imply that the zzso genes mark regions of multiple zzso and subsequent zzso events, but that these have occurred after the individual zzso gene copies had been fixed in their present zzso zzso experiments by the use of zzso into zzso zzso suggest that the elements zzso the zzso genes exert a modulating effect on their zzso
