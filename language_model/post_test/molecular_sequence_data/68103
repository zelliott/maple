The zzso domain of the zzso 1 zzso of the mouse zzso zzso channel produced as a fusion protein with zzso was zzso in zzso by zzso A zzso of the zzso 1 zzso without zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso domain zzso zzso was constructed and was expressed alone or together with the zzso 2 zzso in zzso zzso Current responses of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels were enhanced by treatment with zzso a zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso were comparable with the corresponding zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of the zzso domain of the zzso 1 zzso is not responsible for zzso of zzso zzso channels by the zzso zzso
