The zzso C of the zzso zzso and the group B zzso zzso are structurally unrelated viruses that are known to compete for an unidentified cell surface zzso We now describe the isolation of zzso from human and mouse that zzso the human zzso and zzso and 5 zzso zzso and the mouse zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso Both are zzso zzso whose primary zzso acid sequences are highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to be zzso proteins that contain two zzso zzso zzso and therefore belong to this zzso zzso of either of these zzso molecules into zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso to zzso infection and permitted the expression of zzso from a zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso could be detected on Northern blots of zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells and zzso as well as several zzso of human and mouse origin that are known to be targets for Ad and zzso zzso Finally, Western blots using zzso that inhibit virus binding to either the human or mouse zzso receptors detected zzso proteins in zzso and zzso cells, zzso Taken together, these results confirm that the isolated zzso zzso the receptors for the zzso C Ad and zzso
