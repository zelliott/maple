We have isolated the virus from a zzso zzso in the colon of a zzso mouse with zzso zzso zzso housed in a room in which there has recently been an epidemic due to mouse zzso virus zzso and designated it as the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso strain was performed on major zzso spike zzso membrane zzso and zzso zzso proteins directly from zzso zzso The comparison of zzso sequences of zzso with other strains investigated so far revealed that all three structural proteins of the zzso strain had some unique zzso acid sequences among zzso strains which can be used as markers of this zzso
