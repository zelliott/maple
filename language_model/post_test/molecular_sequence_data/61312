zzso protein A zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso The largest zzso zzso which zzso the major zzso activity, has two zzso zzso that each adopt an zzso The complex of the two smaller zzso zzso and zzso has weak zzso activity but the mechanism of DNA binding is zzso We have determined the crystal structure of the zzso core of zzso and zzso which consists of the central two-thirds of zzso and the entire zzso zzso The structure revealed that zzso and the central part of zzso are structural zzso Each zzso contains a central zzso domain, which also resembles the zzso zzso in zzso an zzso extension that interacts with the central zzso zzso and a zzso zzso that mediate zzso via a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso but not zzso possesses additional similarity to the zzso zzso zzso supporting a zzso role for zzso The discovery of a third and fourth zzso in zzso suggests that the zzso structure of zzso which in zzso and zzso are also zzso of zzso is zzso in zzso The structure also suggests a mechanism for zzso zzso zzso
