zzso of G zzso receptors is frequently triggered by G zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, two zzso zzso zzso were cloned from the rat zzso One zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid protein that is virtually identical zzso zzso to human zzso The second zzso is similar except for a zzso pair insert that constitutes part of an zzso interrupting the zzso coding zzso This new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has therefore a specific zzso zzso A reverse zzso chain reaction zzso designed to discriminate zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso is widely distributed and expressed at much higher levels than zzso zzso in most peripheral zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in zzso zzso studies, performed with zzso extracts from zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells, indicated that zzso and zzso both zzso zzso zzso as well as a synthetic zzso The identification of zzso extends the family of zzso Further studies will be required to establish the tissue and zzso distribution of this protein and to delineate its zzso zzso
