The reduction of the zzso zzso in the culture medium results in an increase in zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso To study this regulation of zzso zzso in zzso cells, we have attempted to examine the involvement of zzso zzso The zzso with an zzso for the zzso of alpha zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso revealed no significant change in the level of zzso alpha in cells cultured with low (5 zzso or high zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the cultured with low zzso zzso induced the increases of both zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this increase in the transport activity was blocked by the presence of zzso in a dose dependent zzso These results suggest that there is a close relationship between the concentration of the zzso form of zzso protein zzso alpha beta zzso and the activity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
