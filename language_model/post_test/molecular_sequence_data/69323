zzso is a putative target zzso for zzso zzso zzso which is a member of a zzso zzso small zzso protein and implicated in neurotransmitter release from the zzso zzso has two copies of an internal repeat that are zzso to the C2 zzso of protein zzso C, zzso and zzso zzso which are known to bind to zzso in a zzso zzso In the current study, we have investigated the functional zzso or zzso by use of three zzso proteins as zzso full zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso containing the C2 zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and the zzso zzso bound to zzso in the presence of zzso but the zzso zzso did not bind to zzso zzso bound to zzso and the zzso zzso only in the presence of zzso but did not bind to the zzso zzso The zzso gamma zzso form of zzso zzso bound to both zzso and the zzso zzso but did not bind to the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso has at least two functionally different zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso
