Signal recognition particle zzso interacts with the signal sequence in nascent zzso and membrane proteins and directs them to the membrane of the zzso zzso zzso targeting is zzso by the 68 and the 72 zzso proteins of zzso We have cloned and zzso zzso zzso the 68 zzso protein of canine signal recognition particle zzso zzso is a basic protein comprised of zzso zzso acid zzso Close to the zzso zzso there is a zzso region which zzso has in common with some zzso zzso zzso shares no zzso similarity to any of the proteins in data zzso
