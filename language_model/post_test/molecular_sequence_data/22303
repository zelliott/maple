zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso form part of a defense mechanism that helps protect zzso and zzso zzso organisms from oxygen toxicity and zzso Here, we report the presence in the zzso zzso of four zzso zzso soda, zzso zzso and a newly identified zzso All four genes of zzso zzso have been cloned zzso zzso and zzso in zzso coli and shown to zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling of the structures of all four zzso using available X-ray crystal structures of zzso showed that the four zzso structures were nearly zzso zzso zzso using zzso proteins in zzso insect zzso shows that zzso is mainly zzso with a minor zzso zzso zzso is mainly zzso with some activity in the zzso and zzso and zzso are both zzso zzso zzso studies of all available zzso zzso and 106 zzso zzso and closely related zzso zzso zzso sequences suggest that the zzso zzso have all been acquired by more than one event of horizontal gene transfer, followed by events of gene zzso
