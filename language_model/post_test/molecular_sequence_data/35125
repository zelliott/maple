zzso oxide zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso oxide zzso from zzso and involved in multiple zzso zzso However, its zzso role in zzso was seldom zzso 

In the present study, an zzso zzso gene was identified from the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso Its zzso acid sequence shared zzso zzso and zzso similarities with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso which resembled those in zzso The zzso zzso transcripts expressed in all zzso and larvae after the zzso zzso stage, and were zzso in all tested zzso with the highest level in the zzso and with the immune zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso area of zzso distributed over the zzso zzso and cell zzso After zzso zzso and zzso zzso the expression level of zzso zzso in zzso increased significantly at 3 h zzso zzso and zzso respectively, P zzso zzso and reached the peak at 12 h zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso respectively, P zzso zzso and 24 h zzso for zzso P zzso zzso In addition, zzso also induced the expression of zzso which started to increase at 1 h zzso P zzso zzso and peaked at 6 h zzso P zzso zzso The zzso activity of the native zzso protein was zzso zzso zzso U zzso and it decreased significantly after the addition of the selective zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso U zzso respectively, P zzso zzso 

These results suggested that zzso with identical structure with zzso and similar zzso characteristics to zzso and zzso played the zzso role of zzso to be involved in the zzso immune defense against zzso and zzso
