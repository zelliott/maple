In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso floral volatile zzso zzso zzso is controlled zzso zzso and daily at zzso zzso and zzso zzso Multiple genes have been shown to zzso proteins that either directly zzso a zzso reaction yielding zzso compounds or are involved in zzso flux prior to the formation of zzso zzso It was hypothesized that multiple zzso factors are involved in the precise regulation of all necessary zzso resulting in the specific volatile signature of MD zzso After acquiring all available zzso transcript sequences with zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso (named for its close identity to zzso was identified, zzso and zzso zzso transcripts accumulate to relatively high levels in floral zzso at zzso and throughout open flower zzso which zzso with the spatial and zzso distribution of zzso production and zzso Upon zzso suppression of zzso zzso both zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene transcript levels were significantly zzso In addition, zzso plants emit higher levels of zzso compounds derived from zzso acid zzso and zzso compared with zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso functions in the repression of zzso transcription, indirectly controlling the balance of zzso production in zzso floral tissue zzso zzso
