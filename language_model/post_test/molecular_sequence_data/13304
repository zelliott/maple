We have identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene 1), required for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso for a disruption of zzso fail to zzso The gene has an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso with an expected size of 77 zzso zzso is expressed zzso in both a and alpha zzso and both zzso and zzso in zzso The message level of zzso increases approximately zzso after 4-6 h of zzso zzso zzso enter zzso DNA synthesis later than zzso zzso zzso zzso are not rescued by zzso These results suggest that zzso has a role late in zzso following DNA zzso
