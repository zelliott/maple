zzso grown in culture rapidly lose many of the zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso foreign zzso Among the proteins most readily lost are members of the zzso zzso We have investigated, by zzso protection zzso the ability of rat zzso cultured conventionally or zzso with rat liver zzso cells, to maintain the expression of genes zzso members of the zzso zzso and the zzso of this expression by zzso After 4 days of conventional zzso culture zzso zzso were zzso but remained zzso by zzso In zzso zzso the abundance of the zzso remained relatively constant from zzso zzso After 7 days of zzso the concentration of the zzso was increased zzso by zzso zzso protection zzso with zzso capable of distinguishing between zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that the ratios of the abundance and zzso of the two zzso were the same in zzso as in zzso zzso zzso also maintained the expression of genes coding for two other components of the zzso zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
