Lambda clones of mouse DNA from zzso and zzso each containing an array of zzso zzso were localized by FISH to a region close to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso DNA with zzso zzso zzso within the cloned DNA showed several zzso which were used to type eight sets of zzso zzso The two zzso clones contained zzso versions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso zzso in zzso and which includes a variety of sequence changes from the consensus zzso zzso zzso of the segregation of the amplification products of the zzso with the segregation of other zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F1 zzso zzso shows zzso suppression, possibly associated with zzso DNA sequences present on zzso zzso 13 in zzso zzso when compared with zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F1 zzso zzso and with the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso in females using a second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F1 zzso zzso also indicates zzso suppression when compared with zzso in males of the same zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, more than one cause may contribute to zzso suppression in this zzso The combined order of the zzso typed was zzso 2, 3, 4, zzso 8, zzso Data from crosses where apparently normal zzso of zzso occur suggest that the zzso array is about 6 map units zzso to the most zzso zzso on zzso zzso This distance is consistent with evidence from markers identified in two zzso clones obtained from the zzso
