Bloom syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe growth zzso and cancer zzso The disease is caused by a loss of function of the Bloom syndrome protein zzso a member of the zzso family of DNA zzso Here we report on the first zzso structure of a zzso fragment, a solution structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain from human zzso The structure reveals unique features of zzso zzso that are distinct from the zzso domain of zzso syndrome zzso In particular, zzso zzso retains many zzso zzso exposed to the zzso which makes the domain surface extensively zzso zzso with this, zzso polarization zzso showed an inability of isolated zzso zzso to interact with DNA zzso zzso employing zzso zzso CD zzso and dynamic light scattering showed that the zzso zzso domain exists as a stable zzso in zzso The results show that zzso zzso is a zzso robust and zzso motif which may play a distinct role apart from DNA zzso
