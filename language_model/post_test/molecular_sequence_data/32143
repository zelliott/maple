The complete sequences of 32 zzso zzso regions zzso from zzso zzso including 29 field strains isolated from zzso copper, zzso mine zzso or zzso of different zzso regions in China, reference strain zzso and the type strains of the two species were zzso These data, together with other sequences available in the zzso database, were used to carry out the first detailed assessment of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences and to zzso zzso relationships within the zzso The total length of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and from 434 to 456 zzso zzso The degree of zzso zzso sequence similarity was higher than the degree of zzso zzso and the overall similarity values of the zzso varied from zzso to zzso between representatives of different species of the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains ranged from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso All zzso strains were separated into three zzso major clusters and seven zzso zzso zzso may be a potential target for the development of in zzso zzso probe aimed at accurately detecting zzso in the various zzso zzso
