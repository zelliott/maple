A novel zzso clone zzso a putative G zzso zzso (named zzso was isolated from a mouse brain zzso library along with its zzso zzso (the mouse counterpart of previously reported rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction analyses showed zzso expression of these two receptors in the central nervous zzso In zzso zzso analysis revealed their prominent expression in the zzso system and further demonstrated the differential distribution of their zzso in mouse zzso Although the zzso for these receptors are yet to be identified, the significant sequence zzso between these receptors suggests that they constitute a new zzso zzso and they possibly represent different zzso zzso for an unknown zzso
