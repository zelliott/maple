The zzso protein is a zzso for zzso zzso factor zzso with intrinsic zzso zzso zzso We investigated the zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins expressed from a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso transformed by the expression of the zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso were able to grow and differentiate in response to zzso Their zzso proteins were normally zzso on zzso and became zzso on zzso zzso contained in five zzso peptides when the cells were exposed to zzso A subset of these peptides was zzso zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso consistent with the production of zzso by these zzso All the peptides detected in zzso were also zzso in zzso These peptides were analyzed by zzso to zzso comparison with synthetic zzso and zzso zzso The identities of four of the zzso peptides were zzso they arise from three unique zzso zzso zzso One major site of zzso zzso at zzso zzso accounted for two of the zzso zzso A second major site was identified at zzso zzso zzso These two zzso zzso sites are located within the zzso zzso insert zzso zzso zzso which has zzso to the major zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso is a minor zzso zzso zzso functional roles for these zzso of the zzso protein include interactions with zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso
