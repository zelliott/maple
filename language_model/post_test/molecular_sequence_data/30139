zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor with zzso promoting activity in mouse zzso cells zzso et zzso zzso In chick sympathetic zzso zzso but not zzso and synthetic zzso zzso promoted zzso outgrowth zzso et zzso zzso Thus, it was considered that the zzso zzso activity cannot account for the total biological activity of zzso We show here that synthetic zzso zzso with zzso specificity mimic zzso at similar zzso in zzso zzso Limited zzso of zzso with zzso causes a zzso between sites zzso and zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of the zzso The resulting fragments still zzso on zzso but the zzso inhibitor activity of zzso and the zzso zzso promoting activity are zzso The results confirm the necessity of an intact zzso site for the biological activity of zzso
