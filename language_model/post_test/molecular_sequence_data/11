zzso zzso are a class of zzso zzso that inhibit gene expression by binding to recognition zzso mainly in the 3' zzso zzso zzso of zzso A single zzso can target several hundred zzso leading to a complex zzso zzso zzso zzso located on zzso zzso is involved in cell proliferation and zzso zzso it may interfere with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso and is implicated in zzso These data prompted us to search for and validate novel targets of zzso 

In the present study, by using a combined zzso and molecular approach, we identified two novel putative targets of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso group zzso and we also studied zzso E which had been previously recognized as an zzso target by zzso zzso Using zzso activity zzso we demonstrated that zzso interacts with the 3' zzso of the three target zzso We showed that zzso in zzso and zzso cell lines, zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso E at the protein level, and of zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso 

Taken together, our data demonstrated that zzso can zzso regulate two new targets, zzso and zzso which are involved in cell zzso In addition, we also showed that the zzso of zzso E expression was due, at least in part, to a decrease in its zzso zzso
