Although zzso zzso are critical for zzso infection, the zzso catalyzing their synthesis have not been zzso Here, we report four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All are Type II membrane proteins which include a zzso tail, a zzso domain, a stem region, a zzso family 2 domain and a zzso zzso B zzso zzso All are expressed during zzso zzso infection in zzso with zzso and zzso expressed at 24 h and zzso and zzso at 48 and 72 h zzso suggesting that their expression may be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso display zzso zzso activity against zzso and zzso peptides suggesting that they contain zzso capable of zzso both types of zzso The importance of zzso zzso in zzso cell interactions raises the possibility that zzso may serve as targets for intervention in zzso
