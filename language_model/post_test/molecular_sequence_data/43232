We have used zzso corresponding to zzso regions of protein zzso regulators of zzso gene family as zzso to amplify these genes from zzso constructed from the human fetal inner zzso zzso characterization of clones revealed that the zzso zzso library from the fetal inner ear has high abundance of clones zzso a protein zzso regulator zzso zzso a member of zzso gene family, and relatively lower abundance of clones for two other members of the gene zzso One of these genes is identical to the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso there is no cloned gene for the other zzso in the human zzso gene family in the zzso acid data zzso A sequence zzso search revealed that the latter shared significant zzso with the gamma zzso of the rat zzso zzso On the basis of the sequence data, it appears that this clone represents a human zzso of the rat gamma zzso The results demonstrate the expression of zzso genes in the inner ear, characterize a human zzso of the rat gamma zzso of zzso zzso these proteins in ear development, and indicate the utility of gene family zzso chain reaction zzso for investigating gene expression in specific zzso
