In order to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying zzso perception in zzso we have performed experiments to identify and characterize the basic receptive elements of the zzso system, the zzso zzso We have identified a novel zzso family that encodes zzso receptors on zzso sensory zzso in the zzso zzso The tremendous size and diversity of this family indicate that zzso acuity in the zzso system relies heavily on the differential binding properties of hundreds of different zzso zzso In order to determine how the information supplied by such a large collection of diverse receptors might be zzso we have examined the patterns of expression of different zzso zzso genes in the zzso zzso We have observed distinct topographical patterns of zzso zzso zzso that indicate that the zzso zzso is divided into a series of expression zzso These zones are likely to provide for a broad organization of sensory information in the zzso cavity which is maintained in the zzso projection to the zzso zzso
