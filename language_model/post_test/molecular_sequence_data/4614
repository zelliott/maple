Under zzso conditions and at pH 7, zzso iron is zzso and complex formation of zzso with zzso is required to supply cells with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso compounds, termed zzso that bind zzso Certain human pathogens take up iron from human zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso are actively transported into bacterial cells by highly specific transport zzso In zzso bacteria, the zzso zzso and iron released from the host proteins are actively transported across the outer membrane zzso The zzso potential of the zzso membrane zzso zzso transport across the outer zzso which requires an zzso device, consisting of the proteins zzso zzso and zzso from the CM to the zzso Active transport across the CM is energized by zzso zzso Transport is regulated at the level of gene zzso In zzso bacteria, this is controlled by the zzso zzso in most zzso bacteria, by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso act as zzso when loaded with zzso In the zzso iron is released from the zzso by reduction to zzso and the zzso are either zzso or zzso The zzso iron is built into zzso and zzso iron zzso and a small proportion is incorporated into zzso but most of the iron is present in a poorly defined zzso Iron overload results in iron zzso mainly due to the formation of zzso zzso that strongly react with all kinds of zzso of which DNA damage has the most deleterious zzso
