The envelope protein zzso of zzso and human zzso viruses plays a critical role in viral entry into host zzso However, the extraordinarily high structural flexibility and heavy zzso of the protein have presented enormous difficulties in the pursuit of high-resolution structural investigation of some of its zzso zzso An zzso and fully zzso zzso core structure was recently determined to zzso A zzso The rather low zzso ratio limited refinement efforts in the original structure zzso In this work, refinement of this zzso core structure was carried out using a zzso refinement method that has been shown in previous studies to be effective in improving models of a zzso complex at zzso A resolution and of a membrane protein at zzso A zzso By using only the first four zzso zzso normal modes to construct the zzso zzso zzso combined with manual adjustments and standard zzso refinement using zzso the structural model of the zzso core was significantly improved in many aspects, including substantial decreases in R factors, better fitting of several flexible regions in zzso zzso the addition of five new sugar rings at four zzso chains and an excellent correlation of the zzso distribution with known structural zzso These results further underscore the effectiveness of this zzso method in improving models of protein and zzso components in zzso X-ray zzso
