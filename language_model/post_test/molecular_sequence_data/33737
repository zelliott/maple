To identify and characterize genes and proteins of the Atlantic zzso zzso zzso immune system, six zzso libraries were constructed from liver, zzso zzso peripheral blood, and zzso zzso were injected with zzso infectious pancreatic necrosis virus zzso or zzso vaccine and tissue samples were collected at various time zzso zzso from peripheral blood and zzso from zzso and zzso fish were isolated and further in zzso activated with the zzso zzso A zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to facilitate zzso and zzso A total of zzso high quality expressed sequence tags zzso were identified and assembled into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso these zzso 147 different putative immune related genes were zzso Several genes involved in innate and zzso immune responses such as complement zzso zzso cell surface zzso and zzso and zzso were zzso Of the immune related genes identified in this study, zzso had no match against any of the publicly available sequence data for zzso and thus can be considered as novel identification in zzso zzso The approach of combining in zzso zzso with in zzso zzso zzso in addition to preparation of zzso libraries from zzso enabled identification of many of the interesting genes including those involved in zzso zzso zzso
