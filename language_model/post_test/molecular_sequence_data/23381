zzso editing in higher plant zzso involves zzso conversion at specific sites in the zzso To examine whether pea shares editing sites with other zzso a systematic search for editing sites in pea zzso transcripts was zzso Based on zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso editing sites were predicted from 60 zzso zzso analysis of amplified zzso for these potential editing sites revealed 19 true editing sites from 13 zzso Together with those reported zzso the total number of editing sites is 27 from 16 transcripts in pea zzso Twenty-two sites are zzso among other plant species, whereas five sites are unique to zzso Among the 27 editing sites, seven are partially zzso The most interesting is the zzso site 1, which has led to the diversification of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso This observation suggests that some of the editing events cause the diversity of zzso acid zzso and zzso that prediction of editing sites based on zzso acid sequence alignment has its own zzso
