zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a variety of zzso Pigs express zzso as zzso zzso in zzso and thereafter in the zzso adrenal zzso and zzso Our studies also demonstrate the existence of zzso zzso of zzso which differ substantially in their zzso acid composition and zzso The zzso zzso most similar to zzso in other zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed in both zzso and zzso cells, is a zzso zzso acid protein exhibiting less than zzso of the activity of the zzso zzso Furthermore, it is inhibited not only by zzso but also by zzso which does not inhibit the zzso zzso zzso sequences generated by the rapid amplification of the zzso ends zzso procedure indicate that the expression of a third zzso in the zzso is switched to the zzso zzso during differentiation of the fetal zzso In addition, these zzso and others from the zzso zzso zzso adrenal zzso and zzso demonstrate differences in the zzso region zzso zzso I) suggestive of zzso alternative zzso An identical zzso sequence was obtained from transcripts expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso and adrenal transcripts also have identical zzso ends, which differ substantially from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences differ from each other and from those expressed in the zzso and zzso Several zzso transcripts thus zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, distinct zzso sequences exist for zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting different promoters and therefore regulation in the male and female zzso The molecular origins of the functional zzso and the zzso transcripts are uncertain, however partial zzso sequence and other genetic analyses suggest the existence of multiple zzso However, sequence alignment of the zzso and zzso zzso indicates complete conservation of putative zzso III, so that complex zzso remains a zzso Clearly, the regulation of zzso expression is more complex in the pig than in other zzso investigated to zzso
