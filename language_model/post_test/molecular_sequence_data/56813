We have isolated the zzso zzso zzso from a rat anterior zzso zzso library, determined its sequence and examined its functional zzso zzso studies were carried out in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of sense zzso transcripts into zzso zzso showed zzso responses of between 800 and 1000 zzso under zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with the zzso clone under the control of a zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso zzso carried zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso produced an approximately twofold increase in total zzso zzso zzso zzso in the rat anterior zzso revealed a zzso distribution of label, a characteristic pattern of zzso zzso The rat zzso zzso insert coded for a protein of 411 zzso acids compared with zzso for the mouse zzso Over its zzso the rat zzso protein showed considerable zzso with that of the zzso except for a deletion of 232 zzso in the zzso zzso This deletion did not appear to affect the functional characteristics of the zzso as shown by zzso studies with zzso zzso and by zzso of the zzso into zzso zzso The sequence given for the zzso region is zzso zzso longer than that reported for the mouse zzso and extends to the zzso zzso
