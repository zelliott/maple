We conducted a differential identification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso through the mapping of zzso zzso and the sequencing of the zzso and zzso zzso The entire zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were amplified by zzso zzso and zzso each was approximately 14 zzso in zzso zzso maps of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were then constructed using 13 restriction zzso The resulting restriction patterns enable us to estimate their genetic divergence at zzso The actual sequence divergence was zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso These results support the designation of zzso zzso as a separate species from zzso zzso
