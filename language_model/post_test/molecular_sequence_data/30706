The presence of zzso DNA was assessed in the serum samples from zzso zzso negative zzso blood zzso They were composed of zzso zzso donors selected because of abnormal serum zzso zzso zzso levels during routine testing of their blood donation, and of zzso donors zzso selected on the basis of normal serum zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences were detected in 37 zzso out of zzso subjects with abnormal zzso and in 2 zzso out of zzso subjects with normal zzso zzso was detected in 199 zzso of the zzso subjects with abnormal zzso and in 81 zzso out of zzso subjects with normal zzso Among the 39 subjects positive for serum zzso DNA, 12 zzso were positive for zzso while 27 zzso were negative for all zzso zzso zzso These data show in zzso where zzso infection is endemic, there is a high frequency of zzso negative zzso DNA positive individuals in whom zzso of zzso may occur without conventional zzso zzso zzso suggesting the possible existence of zzso viruses which may be responsible for some of the presumed zzso non-B zzso
