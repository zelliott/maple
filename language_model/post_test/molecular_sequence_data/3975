The surfaces of higher plants are characterized by zzso which usually consists of a single layer of zzso The zzso is derived from the outer cell layer of the zzso or zzso which arises as a result of zzso cell zzso After seed zzso most of the zzso cells of the aerial parts of plants are derived from the outer cell layer of the shoot zzso zzso (the zzso zzso Thus, knowledge of how the zzso and/or zzso layer is established is fundamental to understanding the zzso of higher zzso Here, we report the isolation of a gene zzso an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso putative zzso zzso zzso zzso which is involved in zzso zzso The domain organization of the predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso is essentially identical to that of zzso zzso fusion protein localized to the cell surface when expressed in tobacco cell zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected in all the zzso of the zzso zzso In developing zzso and shoot zzso zzso transcripts accumulated in zzso and zzso at relatively higher levels than in the inner zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso plants resulted in zzso of zzso to varying zzso These results suggest that zzso is, at a zzso involved in the normal zzso of zzso most likely through properly zzso zzso zzso
