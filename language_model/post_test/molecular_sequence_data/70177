Multiple transcripts coding for zzso light chain zzso are present in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso diversity arises through alternative zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso of the putative zzso zzso to rat and zzso proteins demonstrates a remarkable conservation of structural zzso and regulatory zzso We have identified a zzso domain that may be the site of zzso zzso of zzso zzso Selective transcript distribution occurs in disparate zzso suggesting an adaptation toward specialized zzso zzso is highest in the nervous system and some evidence for zzso transcripts is zzso In zzso this may relate to the differential targeting of specific zzso zzso such as synaptic zzso
