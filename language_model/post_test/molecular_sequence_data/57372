zzso with zzso or zzso is a favored technique for labeling biologically active peptides or proteins because of high specific zzso and convenience in counting zzso Previous studies used trace zzso in which fewer than zzso of the molecules are zzso We describe procedures for obtaining zzso zzso and therefore chemically homogeneous peptides with specific activities exceeding zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso By analyzing the pH dependence of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso we show that the method described can be applied to many short peptides and zzso for labeling on zzso and/or zzso The power of zzso zzso is exploited to resolve multiple products zzso with different zzso zzso of zzso from each other and from zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios can be used to identify the products, as confirmed by zzso sequence analysis under conditions that separate zzso zzso and zzso derivatives from all other zzso zzso We also show that the biological activities of zzso and zzso peptides can differ by several orders of magnitude in a T cell zzso and demonstrate the usefulness of zzso labeling to overcome ambiguities inherent in studying biological activities with zzso zzso
