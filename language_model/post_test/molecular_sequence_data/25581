A zzso binding zzso protein isolated from bovine zzso shares zzso zzso acid sequence with a protein isolated from newborn rat zzso The zzso of the zzso human, and rat genes have been isolated and zzso extraordinarily zzso proteins unrelated to known growth or zzso factors, although identity of nearly 50 percent has been found with the predicted sequence of a zzso acid induced transcript in zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso expressing this protein were zzso for zzso cells and initiated zzso outgrowth from mixed cultures of embryonic rat brain zzso zzso transcripts zzso this protein were widely distributed in zzso and were zzso zzso This zzso previously designated as zzso binding growth factor zzso is now renamed zzso zzso to reflect its diverse zzso zzso may be the first member of a family of zzso regulated zzso
