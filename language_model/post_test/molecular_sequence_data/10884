G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diverse mechanisms to associate with the plasma membrane and mediate zzso of zzso zzso For example, two members of this family, zzso and zzso contain zzso zzso zzso that are zzso To address whether the activity and membrane association of zzso is regulated by zzso we zzso and characterized zzso zzso and two zzso zzso one with the zzso sites zzso to zzso zzso and one containing a zzso zzso motif to promote zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso had a approximately zzso higher zzso and approximately zzso lower zzso for zzso zzso whereas zzso exhibited a approximately zzso lower zzso and approximately zzso higher zzso for zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso displayed similar activity toward the zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso also bound significantly to zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, 79 zzso 4, and 4 zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso activity is dependent upon its ability to interact with the plasma zzso When zzso in zzso cells zzso promoted minimal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso while zzso was significantly increased in cells expressing either zzso zzso or zzso These data demonstrate an important functional link between the ability of zzso to bind to the plasma zzso a process that appears to be regulated by zzso and its activity toward zzso zzso
