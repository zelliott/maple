zzso display has been used to select zzso zzso zzso against zzso a surface zzso present on zzso cells as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso Several attempts to produce zzso zzso from zzso cells of mice zzso with zzso zzso were zzso This report describes the isolation of zzso zzso from a zzso display library made from the zzso of the same zzso zzso on zzso zzso produced in zzso coli or on zzso positive cells was zzso Several zzso which bind specifically to zzso were zzso zzso on zzso zzso yielded five different zzso zzso on cells selected two different zzso which also differ from the zzso selected by zzso zzso The heavy chains of the zzso selected on zzso zzso are derived from four different heavy chain gene families and the zzso selected on cells are derived from two of these zzso In contrast, the light chains of all of these zzso are derived from family zzso Moreover, the light chains of the two zzso selected on cells are very similar to the light chains of two of the zzso selected by panning on zzso zzso except for a few point zzso One of these zzso which have been studied in detail has been shown to bind specifically to zzso positive zzso zzso
