We have compared a new commercially available zzso protein zzso C zzso activity zzso based on the fluorescent zzso zzso analogue zzso with a classical radioactive zzso based on zzso basic zzso zzso and other zzso The zzso had lower affinity for zzso from rat brain than zzso such as zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso zzso was considerably lower than that of the zzso zzso The zzso was readily zzso in an zzso manner by crude and zzso zzso zzso extracts from rat brain, rat zzso zzso and zzso zzso In rat kidney this degradation was not prevented by many common zzso zzso zzso column zzso separated the zzso degrading activity from zzso We conclude that the zzso fluorescent zzso zzso is zzso to highly zzso zzso preparations but has low sensitivity and is not zzso to crude extracts due to zzso zzso
