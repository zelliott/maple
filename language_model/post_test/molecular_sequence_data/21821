zzso and zzso regions zzso are important regulators of gene expression and play key roles in disease progression and zzso The zzso of the fragile X mental zzso 1 zzso gene contains a zzso repeat element that is expanded zzso zzso zzso full zzso and zzso in fragile X syndrome zzso the most common form of inherited intellectual disability zzso and known cause of zzso zzso zzso involvement has also emerged in some individuals with the zzso zzso zzso zzso including fragile zzso premature zzso zzso zzso in zzso and the neurodegenerative disorder, fragile zzso zzso syndrome zzso in older adult zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso in human and mouse brain is expressed as a combination of multiple zzso that use alternative zzso start sites and different zzso zzso Furthermore, we have identified a novel human zzso start site used in brain but not in zzso cells, and have detected zzso zzso generated through the use of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in both human and zzso a specific regulation of the zzso is observed in brain of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the transcript zzso may play a role in zzso zzso
