In this paper we describe the zzso organization of the mouse zzso DNA zzso zzso gene and zzso three putative regulatory elements around this zzso The zzso gene plays a key role in the zzso repair of zzso zzso zzso and has been localized upstream of the zzso gene cluster in human and zzso The human zzso gene has been fully zzso whereas up to now only the zzso sequence of the mouse zzso gene had been zzso Here, we describe a detailed restriction map, the zzso structure, the zzso putative promoter zzso and the exact zzso of the mouse zzso gene with respect to the zzso zzso gene zzso Our analysis reveals a remarkable different zzso structure of the mouse zzso gene compared with its human zzso Two prominent zzso hypersensitive sites zzso were found zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the coding zzso In addition to these zzso an zzso prominent zzso was mapped at the zzso boundary of the last zzso The characterization and zzso of the zzso gene in mouse makes it now possible to carry out transgenic and gene targeting experiments and are essential to understand the control of gene expression of the zzso gene in particular and of the whole region in zzso
