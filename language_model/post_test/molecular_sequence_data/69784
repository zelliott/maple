zzso labeling of the two zzso components of the respiratory burst zzso system, zzso and zzso from resting zzso zzso was carried out with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso higher affinities for both zzso and zzso than for zzso suggesting that they are zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than the zzso site of the zzso In addition, zzso markedly inhibited the affinity labeling of zzso with zzso and zzso well reflecting its zzso effect on the zzso activity in the zzso system, which was previously reported to propose the zzso site in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with either zzso acid or zzso zzso zzso resulted in great enhancement of the zzso activity, and in considerable zzso of zzso and zzso Nevertheless, the affinity labeling of the zzso cell zzso in both cases revealed no labeled bands corresponding to molecular masses of 49 zzso and 63 zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso had lost its zzso binding ability in contrast with that from resting zzso suggesting that the zzso sites of the two zzso components may be zzso on zzso binding in their zzso zzso
