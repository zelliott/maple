zzso acid zzso zzso expression is suppressed in oral zzso zzso and head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso This study was conducted to determine whether zzso gene expression in such zzso can be silenced by promoter zzso 

zzso zzso was analyzed in DNA samples from 22 pairs of primary zzso and adjacent normal zzso 124 samples of oral zzso and 18 zzso cell lines using zzso zzso zzso promoter was zzso in 67, 56, and zzso of zzso tumors, zzso cell lines, and zzso oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by sodium zzso combined with restriction zzso zzso analysis and by random cloning and sequencing of zzso DNA zzso 

zzso higher zzso zzso levels were found in tumor tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the cell lines was correlated with loss of zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso related to the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso agent zzso zzso restored zzso zzso by zzso acid zzso in some of the cell lines, which posses a zzso zzso zzso In some cell lines, this effect was associated with increased growth zzso after combined treatment with zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso by zzso is an early event in head and neck zzso zzso can restore zzso zzso by zzso in most cell lines, and the combination of zzso and zzso is more effective in growth zzso than single zzso
