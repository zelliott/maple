A detailed mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso is proposed on the basis of a model constructed from the known structure of the zzso zzso The model zzso is bound as a type zzso zzso turn with the ends exposed to permit longer zzso chains zzso protein zzso to act as zzso An zzso zzso potential for the zzso zzso bond is combined with a molecular mechanics representation of the rest of the system to calculate the reaction zzso The resulting zzso energy for the zzso zzso zzso is equal to about 6 zzso in good agreement with zzso The lowering of the barrier relative to the solution value of 19 zzso is found to arise from a combination of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and preferential zzso zzso zzso zzso are required in the zzso and the zzso along the reaction zzso The zzso zzso that participate in zzso agree with the available zzso zzso The type zzso turn model zzso to a zzso structural motif commonly found on the surface of zzso It is likely to have a role in the formation of protein complexes with zzso zzso that function as zzso or zzso
