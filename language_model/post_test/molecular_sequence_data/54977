zzso are infected by 2 genetic zzso (A and zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso that causes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are commonly identified in human zzso zzso requires amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing or restriction zzso length zzso zzso identifies zzso but is expensive zzso zzso or insensitive zzso This study investigated a zzso detection method, using zzso zzso length zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene to characterize human zzso Clinical samples zzso positive for zzso were collected in New South Wales, Australia, and were used to evaluate zzso zzso The accuracy and sensitivity of zzso detection was established by comparison to DNA sequencing and zzso zzso assignment by zzso identified zzso as the common zzso in zzso cases, whilst zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso When compared to DNA sequencing and zzso analysis by zzso was a reliable and zzso zzso zzso fluorescent detection enabled accurate zzso of restriction fragments and provided a sensitive alternative to zzso Discrimination of zzso by zzso was comparable to DNA sequencing, but was efficient and zzso The protocol described here provides a rapid and sensitive diagnostic tool for routine sample screenings in zzso zzso
