zzso zzso zzso was used to examine the genetic basis of zzso and resistance of the Atlantic salmon zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso immune relevant genes are listed and two zzso for zzso leukemia differentiation protein zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso obtained from the susceptible salmon library were zzso Both sequences showed high zzso acid identity and similarity with human and mouse zzso and their possible involvement in the response of salmon to zzso zzso is zzso zzso reverse zzso was performed for both zzso zzso of zzso in B1 zzso salmon of the susceptible zzso category compared with resistant salmon was zzso The possible relationship of the salmon zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso host response is zzso Potential involvement of zzso in the depletion of zzso cells during prolonged and heavy zzso zzso infection, via suppression of DNA synthesis and profound decrease in zzso cell zzso is zzso However, only two of six susceptible fish showed high zzso of zzso which might indicate that its expression is zzso to sites of wounds resulting from a heavy burden of zzso zzso
