The zzso class II zzso is a zzso zzso consisting of one alpha and one beta zzso chain of almost identical molecular zzso Recently it has been shown by others, and confirmed in our laboratory, that isolated zzso of zzso zzso II molecules are capable of binding zzso peptides like the zzso intact zzso In addition, preliminary results from our laboratory indicate that isolated single zzso complexes of zzso zzso class II molecules are capable of stimulating cloned T cells in an zzso specific zzso These results prompted us to isolate relatively large quantities of individual alpha and beta zzso of zzso II molecules for further in zzso and in zzso zzso Isolation of alpha and beta zzso proved to be difficult using conventional zzso zzso In this report we describe zzso and zzso continuous flow zzso methods by which zzso quantities of zzso II zzso can be zzso An optimal condition for the zzso of zzso zzso II into alpha and beta zzso was identified, and separation of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso Both methods offer the resolving power of gel zzso with the convenience of continuous sample zzso zzso zzso II zzso obtained by these methods were tested for their ability to bind zzso zzso zzso presented in this study indicate that zzso zzso of both human zzso and zzso zzso are equally active in specific binding of zzso peptides like the native zzso
