We have previously shown that the cell line zzso chronically infected with the zzso isolate zzso zzso the zzso envelope zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by sequential affinity zzso steps using a zzso zzso to zzso zzso and an zzso human zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of zzso and zzso showed the loss of the signal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso with zzso revealed that both proteins are heavily zzso and contain complex zzso in contrast to the zzso form of zzso which has been shown to contain zzso immature zzso Competitive binding analysis showed that while both zzso and zzso bind zzso the affinity of zzso was five times lower than that of zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited zzso formation by zzso cells when mixed with zzso zzso Furthermore, both zzso and zzso had strong zzso effects on the T cells from zzso zzso but not on cells from zzso zzso
