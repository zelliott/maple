Attempts by zzso to understand zzso diversification in the Amazon have often employed contemporary species distribution patterns to support particular theories, such as zzso rainforest zzso rather than to test among alternative zzso zzso zones, narrow regions where multiple contact zones and hybrid zones between zzso zzso have been seen as evidence for past expansion of whole zzso that have undergone zzso divergence in zzso zzso We used zzso analysis of zzso sequence data to examine population split times in 22 pairs of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso We test a hypothesis of simultaneous divergence across a zzso zone in zzso zzso Our results reveal a scattered time course of diversification in this zzso zone, rather than a tight cluster of split zzso Additionally, we find rapid diversification within some lineages such as zzso contrasting with older divergence within lineages such as the zzso zzso and zzso These results strongly reject simple zzso as a cause of the zzso zzso At the same time, observed lineage effects are incompatible with a series of geographically zzso zzso events which should affect all lineages zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso forcing cannot readily explain this Peruvian zzso zzso zzso biological traits, such as characteristic distances of gene flow or varying rates of zzso zzso may be of greater zzso
