zzso is a potent zzso of zzso and zzso zzso It is zzso from zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso a member of Family 8 in the zzso zzso zzso Unlike most zzso which require zzso reducing zzso and an oxygen zzso for zzso zzso zzso an zzso with an initial step of zzso bond zzso of zzso zzso zzso The low abundance of zzso in natural zzso zzso zzso expression for studies of zzso relationships and reaction zzso We report here a high-yield zzso system for expression of zzso active human zzso The zzso zzso is modified by replacing the zzso zzso sequence with the more zzso zzso sequence from zzso zzso and by adding a zzso tag at the zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso associates with host cell zzso and was zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and CM zzso column zzso The zzso zzso with a zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso formation at a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso per zzso The zzso zzso binds CO with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso of 15 zzso The zzso complex of zzso is very short-lived and zzso at a rate of zzso zzso zzso binding zzso showed that zzso binds zzso to zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso but zzso a bulky and rigid zzso zzso binds strongly zzso approximately 1 zzso The transient nature of the CO complex and the weak zzso binding seem to support an earlier proposal that zzso active site has a limited space, but the tight binding of zzso argues against this zzso It appears that the zzso zzso pocket of zzso is fairly adaptable to zzso of various zzso zzso zzso magnetic circular zzso and electron zzso resonance zzso indicate that zzso has a typical zzso zzso with a zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso bond of a test zzso zzso acid, accompanied by formation of a zzso intermediate with a zzso zzso optical zzso
