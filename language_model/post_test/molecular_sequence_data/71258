The zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso zzso protein has been implicated in the inherent resistance of zzso to zzso zzso zzso therapy in clinical zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that zzso interacts in zzso with and zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and that zzso interacts with at least one other cellular zzso The present study describes the establishment and characterization of various stable zzso human cell lines, and the development of a cell zzso zzso for determining the inherent zzso resistance of clinical zzso zzso Human zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines were generated that express zzso under tight regulation by the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso occurred at 48 hours following the removal of zzso from the culture zzso The zzso of zzso in these cell lines was between 4 to 6 zzso zzso protein expression was localized zzso with a zzso pattern consistent with the location of the zzso apparatus and zzso zzso In the majority of cell lines, no obvious zzso changes were zzso However, three zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines exhibited zzso effect and severely reduced proliferation as a result of high-level zzso zzso zzso zzso protein isolated from a zzso zzso zzso patient zzso was capable of rescuing zzso virus replication during zzso challenge up to zzso whereas a full-length zzso and an zzso sensitivity determining region zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso isolated from a zzso zzso zzso patient showed no rescue zzso The zzso and zzso proteins also rescued zzso zzso virus replication during zzso treatment by two- to zzso These data zzso suggest that zzso expression alone can render cells partially resistant to the effects of zzso against zzso zzso and that in some systems, these effects may be independent of the putative zzso A scenario is discussed in which the zzso protein may employ multiple strategies contributing to zzso resistance during zzso zzso
