Active targeting of a drug carrier to a specific target site is crucial to provide a safe and efficient delivery of zzso and imaging contrast zzso zzso expression is induced on the zzso cell surface of vessels in response to inflammatory stimuli but is absent in the normal zzso Thus, zzso is an attractive molecular target, and high affinity zzso for zzso could be powerful tools for the delivery of zzso and/or imaging agents to inflamed zzso In this study, we identified a zzso modified zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso by employing a zzso selection zzso a zzso zzso zzso binding selection from a zzso library followed by a zzso zzso binding selection using zzso expressing human zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively bound to zzso with zzso binding affinity zzso 47 zzso while exhibiting minimal cross zzso to zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso binding to zzso on the zzso cells markedly antagonized the zzso (over zzso zzso of zzso positive zzso cells at zzso zzso zzso also bound specifically to the inflamed zzso zzso of human zzso derived from breast, zzso and skin but not to normal zzso and this binding was highly associated with the zzso expression zzso Similarly, zzso injected zzso demonstrated distinct binding to the tumor zzso in a breast cancer zzso zzso Together, our data zzso the discovery of a zzso zzso that binds to zzso with high affinity and zzso thereby highlighting the potential application of zzso for zzso targeted zzso
