The recent discovery of zzso zzso in zzso zzso including zzso known previously only from animals or plants, implies that zzso have a deep evolutionary history among zzso This contrasts with the prevailing view that zzso evolved zzso in animals and zzso We re-evaluate the evidence and find that none of the 73 plant and animal zzso described from zzso meet the required criteria for zzso zzso and, by zzso animals and plants did not acquire any of their respective zzso genes from the crown zzso of zzso Furthermore, of the 159 novel zzso previously identified among the seven species of zzso zzso zzso only 28 from the algae zzso and zzso meet the criteria for zzso zzso zzso at present only five groups of zzso are known to possess zzso indicating that zzso have evolved independently within zzso through zzso of their shared inherited zzso zzso
