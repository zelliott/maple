The identification of proteins involved in the early zzso of cell death has relied primarily on the modular organization of shared sequences and structural motifs of previously identified proteins in the zzso zzso This property has facilitated the isolation of proteins that interact with each other through structural zzso using zzso zzso zzso Likewise, the conservation in primary sequence of the various shared zzso has promoted the use of zzso chain reaction and database search strategies to isolate additional family zzso Here, we discuss the use of database search strategies in the isolation of novel death zzso as well as how similar strategies may be extended to discover zzso novel cell death zzso
