Three zzso zzso bacterial zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso soil of rice and zzso The strains produced zzso acid and zzso had zzso zzso activity and sulfur zzso property and also methanol zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso and methanol zzso zzso gene sequences showed that zzso zzso was their close zzso The results of the zzso zzso and zzso analyses showed that strains zzso and zzso with zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity and 99 % zzso zzso could be distinguished from recognized species of zzso Therefore strain zzso and zzso are considered to represent a novel species of zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso zzso zzso represents a novel strain of the species zzso zzso
