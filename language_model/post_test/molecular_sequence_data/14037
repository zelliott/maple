Using the zzso gene fusion methodology adapted to zzso several zzso tuberculosis DNA fragments zzso exported proteins were recently zzso In this paper, the molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence determination and zzso start site mapping of a new zzso tuberculosis zzso identified by this methodology, are zzso This gene was called zzso (for exported repetitive zzso and has a sequence similar to that of the zzso zzso 28 zzso zzso zzso gene zzso tuberculosis zzso gene contains a putative iron box close to the mapped zzso start zzso The predicted zzso protein displays a typical zzso signal zzso a zzso domain at the zzso and zzso repeated zzso acid zzso These structural features are reminiscent of zzso surface proteins from zzso zzso We found that these repeats are zzso among zzso tuberculosis zzso and are absent from the published zzso zzso zzso gene zzso In addition to being present in zzso zzso zzso sequences were found in other members of the zzso tuberculosis complex, but not in other zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso might zzso a cell surface component shared by major zzso zzso
