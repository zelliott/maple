The most recently discovered zzso zzso zzso is expressed in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We previously cloned the zzso partial sequence zzso and here report the complete sequencing of the entire zzso zzso One highly variable region zzso was discovered in the zzso end of zzso A total of 20 different zzso zzso were detected in zzso and 18 zzso are able to translate into proteins along with the rest of the zzso zzso The longest zzso of zzso consists of 182 zzso with a transcript of approximately 25 zzso A central zzso of approximately 12 zzso contains highly repetitive sequences and has no zzso zzso The deduced zzso protein has the bona fide zzso zzso structure, zzso zzso An unusual structural feature of zzso which is lacking in other zzso zzso is its long zzso zzso upstream of the first zzso zzso The long zzso zzso is mostly translated from the sequences in zzso and contains zzso repetitive zzso To validate the integrity of the zzso zzso zzso from both the 3' and zzso end were used to demonstrate a similar tissue expression pattern of zzso in trachea and zzso zzso In addition, zzso were developed against either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso and similar zzso zzso patterns were observed in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we have cloned and zzso the entire zzso zzso which will facilitate understanding of the function and regulation of this important, yet zzso zzso gene in airway zzso
