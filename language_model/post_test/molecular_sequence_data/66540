We previously described isolation of a potentially new zzso strain from the central nervous system of an zzso female infant with a history of active zzso oral zzso zzso intermittent zzso zzso and feeding intolerance zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 23, zzso zzso This zzso strain was tentatively identified as a member of the zzso 2 group by virus zzso and zzso zzso studies and has been named type 2 Winnipeg zzso For this study we determined the zzso sequences of the zzso S1, zzso zzso and zzso zzso segments to allow molecular comparison with other zzso Comparative segment alignments of zzso zzso gene sequence with other zzso zzso sequences showed zzso belongs to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is most similar to the zzso genes of zzso strains zzso and zzso with zzso identity zzso The zzso zzso gene showed highest identity to zzso zzso Lang zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene showed highest identity to the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene showed highest identity to the zzso Jones zzso gene zzso zzso zzso protein comparisons between zzso zzso proteins and all available zzso zzso proteins ranged from zzso identity for the zzso comparisons to more than zzso identity for zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein sequences were confirmed by mass zzso
