The zzso zzso zzso system plays an important role in the defense against microbial invasion in zzso In the present study, we report a second zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of the black tiger shrimp, zzso zzso zzso contained the structural features of the clip domain zzso zzso family and exhibited 51% zzso acid sequence similarity to the insect zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence alignment with the available zzso zzso sequences demonstrated that zzso is a new class of zzso zzso zzso expression analysis revealed that zzso transcripts were mainly expressed in zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso transcript levels resulted in a significant decrease in the total zzso PO activity zzso and also increased the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso organization analysis revealed that zzso and zzso are zzso by different zzso zzso The zzso gene consists of ten zzso and nine zzso whilst zzso comprises of eight zzso interrupted by seven zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso stage expression of the four key genes in the shrimp zzso system zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso and zzso transcripts were expressed in all zzso stages zzso zzso zzso and zzso whilst zzso and zzso transcripts were mainly presented in the late zzso zzso stages zzso and zzso These results suggest that the zzso functions as a shrimp zzso and possibly mediates the zzso of zzso
