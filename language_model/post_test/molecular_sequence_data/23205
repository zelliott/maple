zzso component zzso is a part of the zzso membrane attack complex formed during complement zzso Animal modeling to define the role of zzso zzso zzso in human disease has used zzso deficient in zzso yet the molecular basis for the deficiencies has not been zzso zzso derived from a 493 zzso zzso sequence of the rat zzso gene were used to isolate full-length transcripts of rat zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the derived zzso acid sequence for rat zzso is highly zzso to human and zzso We identified a 31 zzso deletion in zzso 10 of the zzso gene that leads to zzso zzso in a strain of zzso rats zzso and developed a zzso zzso zzso In addition, we identified four point zzso in the mouse zzso gene that may result in zzso zzso observed in the zzso mouse zzso A serendipitous finding from this study was a zzso zzso in the zzso deficient mice and zzso zzso deficient mice or rats demonstrated prolonged tail bleeding times that was reversed by treatment with zzso rat zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso induced zzso zzso were markedly reduced in zzso deficient zzso The molecular basis for these zzso defects is unknown at zzso
