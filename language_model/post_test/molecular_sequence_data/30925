A zzso library was constructed in zzso zzso using zzso zzso from cells infected with zzso virus type 2 zzso zzso clones were identified by screening the library with zzso zzso zzso made from randomly primed zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso gene were identified by sequence comparisons with known zzso virus zzso gene zzso The largest zzso clone isolated had a zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso with a single long open reading frame zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein has nine predicted zzso sites and an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein shares zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso protein of zzso virus 5 and zzso with zzso virus, zzso of the zzso acids being common to all three zzso
