Dolphin zzso G Heavy zzso zzso sequences were obtained by zzso amplification of zzso from peripheral blood zzso using zzso zzso Analysis of full-length sequences indicated the presence of two expressed zzso zzso and zzso that differ mainly in the hinge region of the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso and zzso genes are most likely present in single zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences show greatest similarity between the zzso and other closely related zzso zzso The genetic structure of the zzso genes were deduced through zzso zzso and revealed that the hinge regions of both zzso and zzso are zzso by a single zzso The zzso region of the zzso zzso chain shows similarity to the zzso region of other zzso zzso chains with a zzso zzso zzso This is in contrast to the unusual zzso to zzso substitution previously found in the zzso zzso zzso region, and the functional significance of this variation for B cell zzso zzso zzso remains zzso
