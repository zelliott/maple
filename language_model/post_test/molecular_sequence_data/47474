zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso have a major effect on slowing development and increasing life zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein involved in zzso zzso and, zzso is required for zzso and zzso In this study, zzso and zzso zzso were used to isolate both human and mouse zzso zzso Human zzso was mapped to zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The number and location of human zzso zzso were determined, and the location of zzso II and IV are the same as in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that three different zzso of zzso zzso are present in several zzso and that the zzso differ in the amount of zzso The functional zzso of human zzso to the zzso zzso zzso was tested by introducing either a single or zzso zzso containing human zzso zzso into zzso zzso deletion strains and zzso for growth on a zzso carbon zzso The human zzso gene was able to functionally complement zzso zzso deletion zzso The protein similarities and the conservation of function of the zzso gene products suggest a potential link between the production of zzso and zzso
