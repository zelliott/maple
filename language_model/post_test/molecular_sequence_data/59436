In the current model of zzso zzso the given hormone is not involved in the conversion of the inactive zzso zzso to the fully active state zzso Rather, it zzso selects the activated zzso zzso thereby shifting the equilibrium toward zzso The hormone zzso II zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso and zzso that are essential for zzso We show that the zzso zzso in zzso zzso III of the zzso zzso zzso directly interacts with the zzso side zzso A decrease in the size of the zzso side chain zzso an intermediate activated zzso zzso zzso The zzso II analogue zzso II fully activates the zzso zzso indicating that either the transition from zzso to zzso or the stabilization of the zzso state requires binding by zzso II but not its zzso and zzso side zzso In contrast, zzso II binds to but does not activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that in the zzso zzso spontaneous occurrence of zzso and zzso states is zzso Thus, zzso II through interactions involving zzso and zzso zzso a transition from R to zzso and through unspecified interactions zzso transition from zzso to zzso states rather than stabilizing the spontaneously generated zzso state by zzso zzso
