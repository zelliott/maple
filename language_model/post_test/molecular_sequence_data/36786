zzso migration and the formation of muscle attachments are crucial events for the proper development of muscle patterning in the zzso zzso This paper describes the identification of a new embryonic zzso zzso zzso in zzso This protein is initially expressed by muscle precursors at zzso and zzso attachment zzso As development continues, zzso becomes associated with muscle zzso zzso Studies of the zzso zzso of this zzso protein in primary embryonic cultured zzso show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and that it is specifically enriched in sites where zzso zzso are linked to the plasma zzso zzso zzso exhibit high levels of this protein at their leading edge while, in zzso that have already developed zzso architecture, the protein is localized mainly at the zzso zzso of a partial zzso zzso zzso clone and molecular analysis of the predicted protein sequence of this protein indicates that it encodes a high relative molecular mass protein zzso 300 zzso zzso which exhibits at least five zzso zzso Several properties are shared by zzso and members of the zzso zzso it is associated with zzso zzso its sequence exhibits zzso repeats and it is localized at sites where zzso is linked to the plasma zzso This protein could have a zzso role in the formation of zzso attachments and may be involved in zzso migration on the zzso
