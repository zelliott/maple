We have identified a novel zzso zzso designated zzso using a reverse zzso zzso cloning zzso zzso analysis reveals that the zzso of zzso is zzso zzso at the zzso level and zzso identical at the zzso acid sequence level to another zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence comparisons indicate that zzso and zzso represent a distinct zzso of paired type zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso from zzso zzso and adult zzso identified multiple transcripts that are expressed in a zzso specific and tissue restricted zzso zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso region leads to the inclusion of a chain terminating zzso In addition, the zzso expression pattern of this gene at day 12 of gestation was determined by in zzso zzso zzso was observed in diverse zzso cells in zzso zzso primitive zzso zzso and zzso zzso
