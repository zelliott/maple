We have isolated and characterized zzso clones zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso this zzso is zzso and contains the activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The deduced sequence of the zzso acid open reading frame contained exact matches to zzso (15 zzso and internal zzso zzso zzso sequences obtained from the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence derived from the rat zzso shows extensive zzso to analogous proteins from zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have used the zzso to determine the zzso levels of the zzso in various rat zzso and have found that gene expression is regulated in a zzso zzso zzso levels are highest in kidney and liver with liver transcripts reduced about zzso relative to those found in zzso zzso heart, zzso lung and skeletal muscle display even lower transcript zzso reductions range from 70 to zzso of transcript levels found in zzso zzso to the levels of zzso in these zzso allows us to conclude that zzso events predominate in the zzso zzso The rat zzso has been functionally expressed in zzso zzso as evidenced by its capacity to complement a zzso deletion of zzso the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso
