In an attempt to establish a model for zzso C virus zzso infection, we produced mice transgenic for the zzso envelope zzso E1 and zzso under the control of a regulatory element from zzso B zzso zzso mice from the established founders demonstrated expression of both E1 and zzso proteins as zzso forms in their zzso including the zzso zzso revealed the zzso of envelope proteins principally in the zzso of zzso around the zzso central zzso Furthermore, E1 and zzso proteins were shown by zzso to be associated with each other in the mouse zzso There was no evidence of tissue pathology in the mouse liver up to 16 months of age, suggesting that E1 and zzso proteins per zzso may not have direct zzso zzso Our results demonstrate the first successful expression of zzso gene products in the mouse liver and the association of in zzso expressed zzso envelope zzso This transgenic mouse would be a good model to study the zzso interactions of zzso such as zzso transport and assembly of envelope zzso Also it may be a good model system to determine the role of these proteins in the zzso of zzso or zzso manifestations in zzso infection by the introduction of zzso T zzso specific for the envelope zzso
