zzso zzso zzso occur in the zzso zzso of many zzso These zzso are surrounded by zzso zzso cells and increase dramatically in number and size with zzso The characterization of these zzso substances is necessary for the establishment of zzso cell zzso In a previous study we showed that these zzso in the zzso zzso contain a number of zzso however, the characterization of these zzso has not yet been carried zzso To characterize the zzso zzso we zzso the zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The isolated zzso were unable to be zzso in a regular buffer since they were very zzso However, zzso was accomplished in sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso buffer following treatment with zzso Analysis using zzso gel zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso contain four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose estimated molecular weights were 26 zzso zzso zzso 48 zzso and 60 zzso zzso zzso with zzso A zzso showed that both zzso and zzso were zzso Moreover, zzso zzso acid sequencing and Western zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso and zzso to be zzso zzso while zzso the major protein in the zzso proved to be zzso Therefore we report here that the zzso that occur in zzso zzso zzso zzso are of two types, zzso zzso fragments and zzso
