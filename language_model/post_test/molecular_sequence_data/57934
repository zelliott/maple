zzso of the rat growth hormone gene zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site were cloned upstream of the zzso zzso reporter gene to study promoter activity in zzso rat zzso cells during lag, zzso and plateau phase cell zzso The region zzso to zzso activated gene expression in lag phase cells, but was neutral during zzso and plateau phase cell zzso zzso between zzso and zzso were zzso during lag and plateau phase growth, but activated promoter activity when introduced into cells during zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso DNA provides an interesting model to study DNA sequences involved in zzso changes in promoter zzso
