zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso channel that releases zzso into the zzso and its zzso distribution is believed to have significant effects on zzso zzso We constructed a zzso zzso containing full-length rat type 3 zzso linked to zzso zzso for expression in zzso zzso Western zzso analyses revealed that the expressed fusion protein contained both zzso and full-length type 3 zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso showed that the zzso of zzso was distributed to zzso network structures, even after cell zzso with zzso We further zzso zzso zzso with zzso a vital fluorescent marker for zzso zzso and provide evidence that the distribution of zzso zzso with the distribution of the zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso can be used to zzso zzso in living cells, and pave the way for subsequent zzso and functional zzso
