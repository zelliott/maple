We describe how to build protein models from structural zzso zzso to identify structural similarities between proteins in cases of zzso moderate to low, or virtually absent sequence similarity are zzso The detection and evaluation of structural relationships is emphasized as a central aspect of protein zzso distinct from the more technical aspects of model zzso zzso techniques to generate and complement comparative protein models are also zzso Two examples, zzso and zzso are presented to illustrate the derivation of protein model structures and their use in experimental zzso
