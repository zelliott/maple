zzso serum contains a large fraction of functional zzso zzso - zzso of heavy chains without light zzso The variable zzso of these zzso zzso zzso have a long zzso determining region 3 zzso loop that compensates for the absence of the zzso zzso of the variable light chains zzso In the case of the zzso zzso zzso part of the 24 zzso acid long zzso loop zzso from the zzso surface and zzso into the zzso zzso of its zzso rendering zzso a competitive zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso with specificity for bovine zzso A, zzso has a short zzso loop of 12 zzso acids and is not a competitive zzso zzso The structure of the zzso A complex has been solved at zzso zzso The zzso scaffold architecture is close to that of a human zzso zzso heavy zzso The structure of the zzso zzso 1 loop zzso of both zzso and zzso differ from the known zzso zzso in addition these zzso zzso resemble each zzso The zzso provides an zzso surface and shields the face of the domain that interacts with zzso in conventional zzso 

zzso adopt the common zzso fold of variable zzso but the zzso zzso zzso from the predicted zzso zzso We define a new zzso structure for the zzso loop of zzso with zzso and zzso as reference zzso This new loop structure might also occur in human or mouse zzso zzso Surprisingly, only two zzso are involved in zzso zzso the zzso does not zzso Nevertheless, the zzso binding occurs with zzso affinities because of a preferential usage of zzso atoms for zzso zzso
