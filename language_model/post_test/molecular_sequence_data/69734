Human zzso is a zzso protein that plays a major role in the signaling zzso leading to zzso zzso Essentially complete assignment of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of human zzso have been made by analysis of zzso double- and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso alpha and zzso beta chemical shifts from their respective random zzso values were analyzed and correlate well with the secondary structure determined from the zzso zzso Twenty structures of human zzso were refined in the program zzso using a total of zzso zzso derived zzso zzso The structures zzso to a root mean squared distance zzso of zzso A for the backbone zzso The zzso zzso ensemble indicates that human zzso is an zzso protein comprised of a zzso zzso zzso and three zzso The secondary structure elements for human zzso are quite similar to those found in zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1993), zzso 32, zzso suggesting that the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso I should be analogous to that determined here for human zzso The structure determination of human zzso has facilitated the sequence alignment of lower zzso and human zzso and provides a framework upon which the various zzso of zzso can be zzso At least one element of the zzso region of human zzso is an zzso Two mechanisms by which zzso zzso can interfere with zzso by human zzso are zzso
