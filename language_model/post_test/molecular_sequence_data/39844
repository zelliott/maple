The zzso zzso zzso I) from zzso coli is composed of 13 zzso called zzso through zzso and contains one zzso and 9 zzso clusters as zzso zzso zzso transfer from zzso to zzso is coupled with the zzso of zzso across the membrane by a yet unknown zzso zzso zzso transform infrared difference zzso showed that the zzso of zzso cluster zzso located on zzso is accompanied by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the effect of mutating the zzso zzso zzso acids on zzso The complex was assembled in all zzso but the electron transfer activity was completely abolished in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The complex isolated from these zzso contained zzso although in diminished zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso coupled with the zzso of zzso was not zzso in the complex from the zzso zzso However, the conservative zzso zzso and zzso did not disturb the zzso activity, and the signals because of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso We discuss the possible participation of zzso in a zzso zzso coupled with the zzso reaction of zzso
