zzso zzso anemia zzso is caused by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso resulting in deficient zzso zzso The characteristic zzso zzso anemia typically becomes manifest in the first three decades of zzso Hematologic response to zzso is variable and rarely zzso We report two unrelated cases of highly zzso zzso in geriatric patients previously diagnosed with zzso anemia and ringed zzso A previously unaffected zzso male and an zzso female were each found to have developed severe zzso zzso anemia with ringed zzso in the bone zzso which responded dramatically to zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis identified an A to C zzso in zzso 7 zzso of the zzso gene in the male zzso and his zzso In the female zzso a G to A transition was identified in zzso 5 zzso This zzso resulted in decreased in zzso stability of bone zzso zzso zzso zzso Each patient's zzso zzso zzso zzso had marked zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso stabilized the zzso zzso consistent with the observed dramatic response to zzso in zzso This zzso form of zzso can be distinguished from zzso anemia and ringed zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings emphasize the need to consider all elderly patients with zzso zzso anemia as candidates for zzso especially if zzso responsiveness is zzso
