The characterization of zzso zzso complexes of the zzso peptides and zzso using mass zzso is zzso The zzso peptides belong to a class of proteins which bind to zzso zzso and are important in the regulation of gene zzso in zzso These proteins contain a zzso structural motif which consists of a basic zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso specifically bind zzso DNA containing the binding element zzso to form a zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we report the detection of such a specific zzso complex using mass zzso Under conditions necessary for observation of the zzso complex, no zzso were detected for the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso with zzso These observations indicate that the specific interaction of the zzso with the protein zzso zzso the biologically significant zzso complex in the gas zzso zzso were observed for various lengths of both zzso and zzso zzso DNA containing the specific recognition zzso The binding specificity of the complex was verified with the use of control DNA not containing the recognition sequence and control peptides not known to bind DNA zzso Additionally, combining limited zzso of zzso zzso complexes with mass zzso determination of the products compared to identical experiments with zzso peptides was used to probe interactions of specific zzso acids with the zzso The ability to observe these complexes by mass zzso and to probe the specific interactions involved opens the door for utilizing this zzso technique to other structural biological problems including the study of zzso processes and determining the specific binding regions between zzso and zzso
