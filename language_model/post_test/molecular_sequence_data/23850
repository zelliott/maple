zzso is a zzso application, including an editor, of multiple sequence alignment and a three-dimensional zzso structure zzso It is possible to manipulate alignments containing hundreds of sequences and to display a dozen zzso zzso can handle so-called zzso alignments to allow the zzso of complex structures zzso proteins and/or small molecules and zzso and the editing of the corresponding zzso The zzso viewer and the alignment editor are connected together allowing rapid refinement of zzso alignment by taking advantage of the immediate zzso of resulting zzso and strict zzso in their structural zzso More generally, it allows the mapping of zzso about the sequence conservation extracted from the alignment onto the zzso structures in a dynamic zzso zzso is also connected to two comparative zzso programs, zzso and zzso These features make zzso a powerful tool to characterize protein families and to zzso the alignments for comparative zzso
