The zzso zzso zzso the sixth zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso appears to be the first gene of an zzso The second zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso of unknown zzso To study the regulation of zzso expression directly, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso respectively, were constructed and the level of expression of the reporter genes was determined under different growth zzso The results obtained show that the synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso controlled by zzso and that this control occurs at the level of zzso The zzso zzso start zzso zzso the zzso zzso stop zzso suggesting that the two genes are zzso zzso This was investigated by studying how zzso zzso which cause premature termination of zzso translation at different points, affect zzso zzso All zzso reduced zzso expression markedly without interfering with zzso of the zzso Thus, expression of zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the zzso junction region suggests that formation of secondary structures on the naked zzso may explain the low level of zzso expression in the absence of translation of the zzso terminal zzso
