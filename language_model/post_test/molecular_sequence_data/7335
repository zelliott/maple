We examined in zzso collagen zzso by organ cultures from human fetal zzso growth plate zzso The zzso products were characterized by zzso fractional zzso limited zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso slab gel zzso zzso cultures of human fetal zzso growth plate cartilage zzso large amounts of type X collagen in addition to type II, type IX, and type zzso zzso The individual zzso chains of human type X collagen migrated with an apparent zzso of 45 zzso after zzso zzso with zzso The migration pattern of these molecules did not change when examined under reducing and zzso conditions, indicating that they did not contain zzso zzso zzso zzso of the rates at type X collagen zzso at weeks 20 and 24 of human fetal development showed a marked increase of 24 zzso Northern zzso analysis of total zzso from freshly isolated zzso growth plate zzso with a zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso of human type X collagen indicated that the zzso increase of type X collagen production is determined by zzso zzso
