The CA zzso zzso is currently the best individual marker for the detection of pancreatic zzso In order to zzso the CA zzso zzso and to develop approaches to further improve cancer zzso it is important to understand the specificity differences between CA zzso zzso and the consequential affect on zzso zzso zzso zzso enabled zzso comparisons between five different CA zzso zzso used in the analysis of plasma samples from pancreatic cancer patients and zzso Major differences were observed between zzso in their detection of particular patient zzso zzso array analysis revealed that certain zzso were highly specific for the zzso CA zzso zzso zzso A, while others bound zzso A in addition to a related structure called zzso C and modification with zzso In a much larger patient zzso we confirmed the binding of zzso C zzso by one of the zzso and showed that the broader specificity led to the detection of an increased number of cancer patients without increasing detection of zzso patient zzso This work demonstrates that variation between zzso specificity for zzso zzso can have significant implications for zzso performance and highlights the value of characterizing and detecting the range of zzso structures that are elevated in zzso
