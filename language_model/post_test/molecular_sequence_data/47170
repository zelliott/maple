zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso When folded into a beta structure, the protein is predicted to have two clusters of three zzso zzso each cluster able to bind a zzso metal zzso When the protein was incubated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso metal complexes of zzso zzso were observed by zzso mass zzso The relative zzso of the zzso complexes suggested an order of affinities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with zzso affinities for zzso or zzso zzso Limited zzso of zzso zzso by immobilized zzso as measured by zzso mass zzso showed that the zzso zzso bond of zzso zzso was zzso more slowly in the presence of zzso than in its zzso Because zzso has little or no effect on the zzso rate of zzso the slower zzso of the zzso zzso bond may be due to its decreased accessibility caused by zzso folding of zzso zzso
