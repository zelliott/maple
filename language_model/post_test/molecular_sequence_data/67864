zzso receptors zzso mediate immune responses via the recognition of zzso molecular patterns, thus playing important roles in host zzso Among the chicken zzso zzso family, zzso 2, 4, 15, and 21 were shown to recognize bacterial zzso In our earlier study, we reported zzso of zzso 2, and zzso In the present study, we cloned zzso 15, and 21 genes from different chicken breeds and analyzed their zzso We identified 9 zzso acid zzso sites in zzso with 8 zzso domain sites and 1 site in the zzso domain, 15 zzso acid zzso sites in zzso with 14 zzso domain sites and 1 site in the zzso domain, and 7 zzso acid zzso sites in zzso with 5 zzso domain sites and 2 sites in the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso genes are zzso among different avian breeds, suggesting a varied resistance across numerous chicken zzso This information might help improve chicken health by breeding and zzso
