The zzso zzso zzso is a key component for the energy supply of higher plants and green zzso An zzso of identical protein zzso III is responsible for the conversion of an zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso It is highly controversial if the zzso III zzso is affected by the zzso state of any zzso Here, the intact zzso III of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been isolated for the first zzso Due to the importance of the zzso III zzso for energy conversion, a zzso gel system was established to distinguish zzso with different zzso With this methodology, a possible zzso of the zzso in respect to the zzso state of the cells was zzso Several growth zzso zzso light intensity, pH value, carbon source, and zzso zzso were varied to determine their effects on the zzso zzso to previous suggestions for zzso coli, the zzso III of the zzso zzso zzso always consists of a constant number of zzso over a wide range of zzso zzso Furthermore, mass zzso indicates that zzso III from zzso zzso is not modified zzso Data suggest a zzso III zzso of the algae zzso zzso divergent from higher zzso
