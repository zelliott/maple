Studies of the interactions between zzso zzso and their hosts are severely hampered by the absence of methods that allow the zzso identification of individual zzso in complex environments that contain mixed populations of zzso such as soil or zzso This study details the development of a zzso zzso zzso that allows the detection and recovery of zzso zzso in naturally infested zzso and the zzso of zzso strains of zzso during zzso interactions with their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso class M zzso was raised against a protein zzso of a zzso zzso specific for species of the zzso zzso and for the closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not react with zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso nor with a range of unrelated zzso and zzso zzso zzso production of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso bound to a zzso of proteins with apparent molecular masses in the range zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso bound strongly to the cell walls of zzso and zzso and the zzso and terminal zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso electron zzso revealed strong binding of zzso to the cell walls and zzso of zzso and to the cell walls of zzso In zzso studies of dual cultures of zzso and zzso zzso only the cell walls of the zzso which coiled around the host, were stained by zzso The specificity of zzso enabled the development of a combined zzso technique for the detection of zzso zzso in naturally infested zzso The specificity of this technique was confirmed by zzso analysis based on sequences of the zzso zzso regions of the zzso
