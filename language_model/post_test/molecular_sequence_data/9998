In previous studies we have identified zzso zzso and zzso as target sites in chicken zzso middle molecular mass protein zzso for zzso zzso I zzso in zzso and have shown that these sites are also zzso in zzso We now make use of a combination of molecular biological and protein chemical techniques to show that two additional in zzso zzso sites in chicken zzso zzso and zzso can also be zzso by zzso in zzso These two sites are zzso in higher zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso containing the zzso rat zzso peptides can be zzso by zzso in zzso suggesting that zzso of these sites is zzso at least in higher zzso The two new sites are adjacent to a zzso zzso sequence zzso found once in higher zzso zzso molecules and twice in zzso zzso zzso of this sequence are also found in zzso low and high molecular mass proteins zzso and zzso and zzso and in zzso zzso are known to be associated with in zzso zzso zzso We speculate that zzso zzso in general, and these sites in particular, may be important in zzso zzso
