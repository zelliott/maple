We recently identified zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso whose zzso zzso functions as a zzso determination factor and upstream zzso of zzso zzso et zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso Here we identify two additional zzso zzso and zzso which together define a novel zzso of zzso mouse zzso Comparative analysis of zzso expression indicates that these three genes define distinct zzso populations in the developing zzso and zzso exhibiting zzso expression in some areas and partial overlap in zzso The expression of the zzso zzso zzso and often temporally precedes that of zzso suggesting that (as in zzso the zzso and zzso function in a zzso Thus, as in zzso different zzso determination factors may activate a common zzso differentiation factor in different zzso The zzso therefore represent both a family of putative zzso zzso determination genes and useful markers of the origins of zzso zzso
