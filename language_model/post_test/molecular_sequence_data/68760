A zzso zzso of zzso zzso is deficient in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and hence cannot zzso zzso Upon transformation of a zzso zzso strain with a zzso zzso zzso library, hybrid plasmids were isolated which zzso the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso strain is zzso The zzso reveals an open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso leads to a zzso zzso zzso A putative zzso domain, located at the zzso zzso was identified by comparison with the zzso acid sequences of other zzso The cloned gene has been mapped both physically and genetically to the left arm of zzso IX, where the original zzso zzso also zzso We conclude that the presented zzso is the zzso gene and propose that it is the structural gene for the zzso zzso zzso zzso
