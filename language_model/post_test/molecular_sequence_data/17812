A number of zzso zzso were constructed for high-level gene expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso incorporate the zzso and translation initiation regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which codes for the abundantly zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso surface zzso The expression zzso are based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and incorporate the zzso promoter and zzso start zzso Some zzso also contain translation initiation zzso these can result in the addition of as little as a single zzso zzso to the protein zzso by the cloned zzso The zzso can be introduced into zzso zzso by zzso at high frequency zzso up to zzso zzso DNA with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso They range in size from 10 to 12 zzso specify either zzso or zzso resistance, and possess the restriction sites zzso zzso zzso and zzso for cloning genes downstream of the zzso gene zzso For a number of the zzso the complete zzso sequence is zzso A comparison was made between the expression of an zzso gene from these plasmids in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and similar constructions under the control of zzso alpha zzso and translation initiation signals carried on a zzso zzso in an zzso coli zzso The two expression systems compared zzso cell zzso prepared from zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso of the zzso activity of similarly prepared zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso prepared from zzso zzso zzso exhibited only zzso of the zzso activity of zzso coli zzso
