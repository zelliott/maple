Two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso soil of a zzso plant zzso zzso zzso which was collected from Mara Island, Republic of zzso The colonies of the zzso were zzso smooth, convex and moderately zzso in zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that the zzso belonged to the family zzso and formed two distinct zzso within the radiation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between the zzso was zzso zzso The closest zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso respectively, whereas zzso zzso gene sequence similarities between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both of the zzso contained zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso acid in the cell zzso The zzso zzso was zzso The polar lipids were zzso and zzso The fatty acid profiles of the zzso were characterized by the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso fatty zzso with small amounts of zzso fatty zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso between the zzso were zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso zzso and zzso % zzso zzso the zzso showed low zzso zzso values zzso zzso to the most closely related strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso data presented here, the zzso are considered to represent two novel species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso
