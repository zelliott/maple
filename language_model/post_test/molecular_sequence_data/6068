The protein zzso acts as an interface between zzso proteins with zzso zzso zzso zzso and the receptors for insulin, IGF-1, growth hormone, several zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso It regulates gene expression and stimulates zzso and appears to mediate zzso zzso zzso Thus, survival of the zzso mouse with only mild resistance to insulin was zzso This dilemma is zzso resolved with our discovery of a second zzso zzso We zzso and cloned a likely candidate called zzso from zzso zzso cells and, because of its resemblance to zzso we designate it zzso zzso of the sequences of zzso and zzso revealed a highly zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso domain and a zzso domain, and a poorly zzso zzso zzso containing several zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in many cells, including zzso from zzso mice, and may be essential for zzso by several zzso zzso
