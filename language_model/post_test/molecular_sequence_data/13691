DNA from zzso zzso zzso with the restriction zzso was zzso with zzso zzso probe zzso zzso and adult showed same clear zzso patterns, which were characteristic of zzso DNA zzso The zzso patterns were quite different from those of the zzso zzso zzso variations in 4 zzso zzso of zzso zzso including 3 zzso which have been reported to be indistinguishable by zzso zzso and protein composition of zzso were investigated using this zzso Each of the 4 zzso exhibited zzso zzso patterns and were easily distinguished from one another, thus it was considered that zzso was a highly resolvable and zzso probe for zzso However, it was also indicated that zzso was so sensitive that applying zzso with zzso to zzso or zzso analysis was limited where habitat of the host was restricted to the small zzso In comparison to zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso represented more and sharper zzso It was considered that a zzso probe was more useful for genetic analysis of zzso
