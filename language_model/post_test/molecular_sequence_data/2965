It has been found that zzso zzso and a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the sequence zzso of human zzso heavy chain stimulate Con zzso proliferation of T zzso from the blood of healthy zzso zzso zzso and an zzso of zzso receptors zzso zzso tested in parallel were not zzso The stimulating effect of zzso and zzso on T zzso proliferation was not inhibited by zzso Studies on zzso binding of zzso zzso to T zzso revealed that it binds with high affinity to zzso binding sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely inhibited the specific binding of zzso zzso to zzso binding sites on T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso bind to common zzso binding sites on T zzso and enhance Con zzso proliferation of these zzso
