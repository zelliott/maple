zzso channeling has been proposed to occur at the entry point into plant zzso zzso To determine whether zzso of zzso zzso zzso the first zzso in the pathway, can associate with the next zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso to facilitate zzso we generated transgenic tobacco zzso zzso plants independently expressing zzso versions of two PAL zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and protein gel zzso analysis using zzso and PAL zzso zzso indicated both zzso and zzso locations of zzso but only zzso zzso of zzso However, both PAL zzso were zzso localized in plants zzso zzso These results, which suggest that zzso itself may organize the complex for membrane association of zzso were confirmed using zzso fluorescent protein zzso zzso with zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso resulted in a shift of zzso zzso from zzso to zzso in zzso zzso plants, whereas zzso of zzso zzso with zzso did not affect zzso zzso indicating that zzso has a higher affinity for its membrane zzso site than does zzso zzso zzso and zzso energy resonance transfer zzso studies confirmed zzso of PAL and zzso However, zzso analysis with zzso zzso suggested that the zzso was not zzso
