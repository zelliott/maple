zzso live oral vaccines expressing zzso zzso offer a unique set of attractive zzso Among these are the simplicity of administration, the capacity to induce zzso and systemic zzso and the advantage of permitting genetic manipulation for optimal zzso zzso In this study, the benefit of having a zzso zzso expressed on the surface of a live zzso rather than zzso was zzso zzso the immune response of mice zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso vaccine strain expressing the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso on its surface zzso was compared with the expression in the zzso compartment zzso zzso zzso zzso mice showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso a significantly higher level of zzso systemic zzso G zzso and zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso Further studies were aimed at determining whether the zzso zzso expressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be used as carriers of foreign zzso For this, the vaccine strain was genetically engineered to express zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso virus zzso C zzso and A zzso zzso of the spike protein inserted into the zzso major zzso zzso zzso zzso mice administered orally zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso from the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso produced systemic zzso against both zzso and the zzso C zzso but not against the zzso A zzso To improve the zzso of the zzso zzso the in zzso zzso zzso promoter was inserted into zzso upstream of the zzso zzso to create zzso In comparison with the previously used zzso zzso mice zzso orally with zzso zzso zzso demonstrated significantly higher levels of serum zzso and zzso zzso against zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso against the zzso C zzso was only detected with zzso zzso zzso The induced zzso also recognized the zzso in the context of the full-length zzso spike zzso zzso immune responses to zzso zzso zzso on zzso vaccine zzso can be zzso by using promoters known to be activated in zzso
