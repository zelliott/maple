After decades of research, protein structure prediction remains a very challenging zzso In order to address the different levels of complexity of structural zzso two types of modeling zzso modeling and zzso zzso been zzso zzso modeling can often generate a zzso to high-resolution model when a similar, zzso template structure is found for a query protein but fails if no template or only incorrect templates are zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso may generate models of moderate resolution for small proteins of low zzso zzso zzso have the two techniques been integrated together to improve protein zzso Here we develop a zzso protein modeling approach to selectively and zzso apply zzso and zzso modeling methods to model zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regions of a zzso A preliminary zzso of the approach was tested on a number of hard modeling cases during the 9th Critical Assessment of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and successfully improved the quality of modeling in most of these zzso zzso modeling can significantly reduce the complexity of protein structure modeling and integrate zzso and zzso modeling to improve the quality and efficiency of protein structure zzso
