Powerful zzso muscles are found in most zzso including chimpanzees and zzso and were part of a prominent adaptation of zzso and zzso extinct zzso of the family zzso In contrast, zzso muscles are considerably smaller in both modern and fossil members of zzso The evolving zzso zzso zzso to a Late zzso zzso zzso towards a pattern of zzso nearly simultaneously with accelerated zzso in early zzso Here, we show that the gene zzso the zzso zzso heavy chain zzso expressed in these muscles was zzso by a zzso zzso after the lineages leading to humans and chimpanzees zzso Loss of this protein zzso is associated with marked size reductions in individual muscle zzso and entire zzso zzso Using the coding sequence for the zzso rod zzso as a molecular clock, we estimate that this zzso appeared approximately zzso million years ago, predating the appearance of modern human body size and zzso of Homo from zzso This represents the first zzso distinction between humans and chimpanzees that can be correlated with a traceable zzso imprint in the fossil zzso
