In zzso and zzso increases in zzso zzso can activate zzso zzso and other protective functions of gastric zzso We hypothesized that the recently cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso is functioning in the gastric zzso In zzso zzso gastric zzso reverse zzso chain reaction using zzso based on previously cloned zzso sequences amplified a zzso DNA zzso that had zzso zzso sequence identity with the rat kidney zzso zzso zzso of the zzso using specific zzso zzso revealed its presence on the zzso aspect of gastric zzso zzso In zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso exposure to elevated zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in significant zzso of zzso membrane electrical zzso and increases in zzso membrane resistance zzso Circuit analysis revealed that these changes reflected specific decreases in zzso membrane zzso zzso of zzso synthesis using zzso significantly attenuated these zzso We conclude that the zzso is present and functioning in zzso gastric zzso
