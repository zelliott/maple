We have zzso a zzso clone and a nuclear gene zzso the zzso 30 s zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso The identification is based on the high similarity of the predicted zzso sequence with zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso raised against the zzso produced from part of the zzso expressed in zzso The predicted zzso sequence contains an zzso extension which has several features characteristic of zzso transit zzso zzso suggest there is a single copy of this gene in zzso zzso and multiple copies in zzso zzso The origin of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso is also zzso
