The method of thin film preparation known as zzso assembly is of growing interest for current and envisioned developments in zzso Here, zzso zzso peptides have been zzso zzso zzso and used to prepare zzso zzso A range of zzso crystal zzso zzso transform infrared zzso circular zzso zzso and zzso liquid zzso been used to probe the effect of zzso strength and zzso secondary structure in solution on zzso zzso and on secondary structure formation and zzso bond zzso in the zzso zzso The amount of designed zzso deposited per zzso step of film fabrication increased with increasing zzso strength, as with conventional zzso Secondary structure content changed from random zzso to beta sheet on incorporation of peptides into a zzso zzso zzso by zzso bond formation increased film stability at zzso zzso zzso for zzso stabilization have been zzso The results contribute to exploration of the physical basis of zzso zzso broaden the scope of applications of zzso zzso particularly where zzso and stability are key design concerns, and provide a basis for mass production of custom zzso thin films of high stability, even in harsh zzso
