Using very high stringency zzso conditions for the Southern zzso zzso analysis of zzso cell hybrid DNA, we were able to map the human zzso zzso gene and two of its zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso 18, 14, and zzso These zzso were confirmed and extended to zzso zzso and zzso by using a combination of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso spreads and the zzso chain reaction analysis of DNA samples isolated from zzso cell hybrids retaining deletions or zzso of zzso zzso
