zzso zzso has been isolated from zzso of human chronic zzso specimens but the characteristics of zzso zzso positive zzso remains zzso This study aims to compare the zzso features between chronic zzso patients with and without zzso zzso infection in gallbladder zzso 

Three hundred and zzso chronic zzso patients were divided into two groups according to whether zzso zzso could be detected by culture, zzso or zzso for zzso zzso zzso gene in gallbladder zzso Positive samples were zzso for zzso zzso zzso Clinical parameters as well as pathological characteristics including some zzso zzso and the expression levels of zzso and zzso in gallbladder were compared between the two zzso 

zzso zzso infection in gallbladder zzso was detected in zzso of zzso zzso These patients had a higher prevalence of acid zzso symptoms zzso more histories of chronic zzso zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher presence of zzso zzso in the stomach as compared to patients without zzso zzso infection in the gallbladder zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in gallbladder and zzso zzso from the same individual patient had identical zzso Also, higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher enhanced expressions of zzso and zzso were detected in zzso zzso infected gallbladder zzso zzso 

zzso zzso infection in gallbladder zzso is strongly associated with zzso zzso existed in zzso zzso zzso is also correlated with gallbladder zzso zzso including zzso and zzso The potential mechanism might be related with higher zzso production but needs further zzso
