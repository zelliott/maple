We developed a simple and accurate method to define the sequence recognition properties of zzso zzso The method employs zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of sequences selected from a mixture of random zzso by the gel zzso zzso We used this method to define the sequence requirement of the binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a total of 200 zzso of zzso protein and four cycles of binding and subsequent amplification, we identified the zzso sequence as the binding consensus of zzso which is consistent with the previously reported recognition zzso In addition, our data indicate that zzso can bind with lower affinity to sequences that differ from the optimal sequence in one or even two zzso The most common variation was the C to A at position zzso The majority of the zzso that still allowed binding were 3' to the central C zzso indicating that the two sides of the zzso recognition sequence are not zzso
