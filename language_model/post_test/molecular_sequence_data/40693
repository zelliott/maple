The aim of this work was to clarify zzso and examine evolutionary relationships within European zzso species using a combined analysis of the large zzso zzso nuclear zzso and small zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Data from the ITS region were applied to enhance the view of the zzso relationships among different zzso The studied samples grouped into four complex zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is zzso The generic type zzso zzso formed a separate group together with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In this zzso the closely related species zzso zzso and zzso zzso grouped together with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have identical zzso and zzso sequences but differ in zzso zzso zzso also fell in the zzso zzso but showed closer proximity to zzso zzso than to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Another zzso was composed of a zzso zzso zzso group and was found to be closely related to zzso and zzso with the overall zzso highly reminiscent of the residual zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso erected in the past for zzso zzso due to its remarkable zzso differences, also fell within the residual zzso zzso zzso zzso held an isolated position from the other species of the zzso zzso the previously proposed name zzso zzso has been adopted for this zzso zzso zzso appeared unrelated to two other European zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso grouped in a separate zzso distinct from zzso zzso Finally, the ITS data demonstrated zzso of some zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso
