A promising new approach in cancer therapy is the use of tumor specific zzso coupled to zzso zzso Currently these zzso are prepared by rather unspecific zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso As the drug load is a key zzso for the zzso activity, zzso strategies are zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso are methods for the specific zzso modification of a target zzso Both include the expression as an zzso fusion zzso followed by the exchange of the zzso for a zzso zzso 

A full-length zzso specific for zzso zzso was expressed as fusion protein with an zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso attached to each heavy zzso In zzso protocols were established to zzso modify the zzso in high yields by zzso or zzso zzso Although reducing conditions had to be employed during the process, the integrity or affinity of the zzso was not zzso The protocols were used to prepare zzso containing two zzso molecules per zzso attached to the zzso of the heavy zzso 

zzso zzso can be efficiently and zzso modified at the zzso of their heavy chains by zzso zzso The described protocols can be used to prepare zzso of high zzso and with a defined drug load of zzso The attachment to the zzso is expected to retain the affinity and zzso functions of the zzso
