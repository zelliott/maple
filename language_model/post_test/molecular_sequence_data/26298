zzso zzso virus zzso is the zzso agent in zzso bovine zzso a disease occurring zzso This virus is normally detected by the zzso gel zzso or zzso zzso which rely on the appearance of zzso to a major surface protein of the virus, zzso present in the serum of infected zzso We have used the zzso chain reaction, which depends on the amplification of specific DNA sequences as a sensitive zzso for the detection of zzso It was possible to detect zzso DNA in 100 zzso of zzso DNA from an infected host using zzso gel zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso was increased by two log orders when zzso analysis, using a zzso zzso DNA probe, was used in combination with amplification of the zzso zzso DNA was detected in both zzso and zzso DNA and at all stages of infection in zzso
