zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso motif are widely distributed in three zzso zzso However, recent work suggests that bacteria could possess zzso peptides zzso Here, we report zzso zzso in zzso zzso structural and functional characterization of a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso adopts a typical structural feature of zzso zzso which is also consistent with an zzso zzso structure model predicted using zzso zzso We found that zzso is an zzso zzso that led to more than 50% growth zzso on sexual stages of zzso zzso at zzso zzso and killed zzso zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso in a zzso zzso These results provide functional evidence for zzso origin of zzso zzso zzso production of the pure zzso zzso without harming zzso red blood cells in zzso coli makes zzso an interesting candidate for zzso drug zzso
