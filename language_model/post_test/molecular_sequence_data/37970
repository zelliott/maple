zzso for zzso zzso will need to contain both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are the most desirable, but they are often poorly zzso The major zzso surface protein 1 zzso is currently a leading vaccine candidate zzso In this study, six peptides from zzso or partly zzso regions of zzso were evaluated for zzso in B10 zzso zzso Following zzso with the zzso zzso T cells were tested for the ability to zzso in zzso and zzso responses to zzso were evaluated in zzso The results showed that one highly zzso sequence zzso zzso located at zzso acid positions 20 to zzso and one partly zzso sequence zzso zzso located at positions 44 to zzso contained both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of mice with these peptides resulted in zzso proliferation and enhanced production of zzso to zzso upon exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso responses in three of the six strains of mice zzso whereas zzso was zzso in only one zzso zzso with the other four peptides resulted in zzso responses to the zzso but none of the resulting zzso T cells recognized native zzso These results demonstrate that two sequences located in the N zzso of zzso can induce zzso and zzso responses following zzso in a zzso zzso Clearly, these sequences merit further consideration for inclusion in a vaccine for zzso
