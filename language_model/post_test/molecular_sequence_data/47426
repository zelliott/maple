zzso restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in the fungus zzso zzso using a zzso containing a strong zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were analyzed in zzso A zzso zzso was shown to contain a zzso zzso that disrupted a gene that shows a high degree of zzso to the zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso was shown to contain a zzso zzso in the zzso upstream region of a gene that strongly resembles zzso which encodes the zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso resulted in enhanced expression of the zzso zzso demonstrating that the combination of zzso with a zzso insert can be used to activate gene zzso
