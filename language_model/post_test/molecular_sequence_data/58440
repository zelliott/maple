Previous work has shown that the zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso also known as zzso is involved in the control of viral gene zzso although the precise mechanism remains to be zzso In order to study the zzso of this zzso we constructed expression zzso containing the coding sequence of the zzso gene placed under the control of the zzso or zzso zzso After cell zzso zzso synthesis was studied by zzso using a specific zzso In transient expression experiments in zzso cells in which the zzso zzso was under the control of the zzso promoter, we found that zzso was able to inhibit zzso zzso zzso expression under the control of either the alpha 22 zzso promoter or other zzso zzso such as alpha 4 zzso alpha 0 zzso and alpha 27 zzso zzso expression under the control of the alpha 4 zzso promoter was inhibited in these cells by expression of zzso under the control of the zzso zzso it was also inhibited in zzso cells by zzso expressed under the control of the zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expression directed by the zzso or zzso promoters was only zzso or not inhibited by the zzso zzso We also constructed an expression zzso for zzso a gene whose product is implicated in the zzso of zzso Although zzso expression under the control of the alpha 4 zzso promoter was also zzso regulated by the zzso gene product, the effects of the zzso zzso by the zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso zzso at a particular zzso ratio of the two zzso zzso of zzso activity was partially zzso The results in the present work suggest that zzso can zzso regulate the expression of zzso viral genes and that its zzso by zzso protein zzso might be involved in the zzso of its zzso
