zzso zzso are important targets of the immune system in clearing bacterial zzso Although the immune system almost exclusively uses zzso in response to foreign zzso there is still much to learn about the role of different zzso on the zzso as targets of protective zzso We examined the role of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso by use of human zzso zzso zzso specific for such zzso We zzso zzso technology to produce fully human zzso zzso zzso zzso from B cells of an individual zzso zzso infection and cloned the zzso variable regions to produce an zzso form of each original zzso zzso and functionality of the zzso zzso were tested in zzso using zzso zzso zzso complement deposition, and zzso zzso We found that a zzso zzso zzso that bound the best to zzso or backbone zzso on zzso had superior complement deposition and zzso activity compared to two zzso that bound zzso to zzso that was expressed with a native level zzso of zzso groups zzso zzso and zzso Protection of mice against zzso due to zzso zzso strains zzso and Reynolds further showed that the zzso zzso had optimal protective efficacy compared with the zzso zzso These results provide evidence for the importance of zzso specificity in inducing the optimal protective zzso response to zzso and indicate that zzso to the zzso form of zzso could be zzso agents for preventing or treating zzso zzso
