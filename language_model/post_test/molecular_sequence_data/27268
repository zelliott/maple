zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that plays a recognized prominent role as a tumor zzso However, the zzso details underlying its function are poorly understood because its primary zzso zzso have not been firmly zzso To shed light on the mechanisms underlying the zzso role of this zzso we set out to identify new zzso zzso by a novel approach based on screening of high density zzso zzso The results of the array experiment were combined with a zzso filter to identify eight potential zzso targets among the proteins zzso in the zzso zzso In this study we show that one of these potential targets, the zzso is indeed a direct zzso zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso confirmed our prediction and demonstrated an overall specificity of zzso in targeting the zzso zzso 204 of zzso After zzso growth factor zzso the zzso of the zzso loop of zzso can be modulated by changing the concentration of zzso without affecting the activity of the upstream zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso contains a zzso motif to recruit zzso proteins by a zzso mechanism zzso by the common zzso domain in zzso zzso proteins that are zzso in the zzso zzso domain become insensitive to zzso zzso zzso this study provides novel insights into the zzso role of this zzso and proposes a new mechanism that may also be relevant for the regulation of zzso growth zzso
