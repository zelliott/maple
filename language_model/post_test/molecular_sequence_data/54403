A high zzso zzso strain was isolated and identified as zzso zzso zzso according to the zzso and comparison of internal transcribed zzso zzso gene zzso When rice straw and corn steep powder were used as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, a maximum zzso activity of zzso zzso one of the highest among zzso zzso was zzso The optimum temperature and pH for zzso production were zzso and zzso zzso The increased production of zzso in zzso zzso culture at zzso was confirmed by two-dimensional zzso followed by zzso sequencing of the partial zzso The internal zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso showed a significant zzso with zzso from zzso zzso family zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by sequential zzso of zzso zzso culture zzso on a zzso column, a gel zzso column, and then on a zzso Q column with zzso liquid zzso The zzso zzso was a zzso protein with a molecular weight of zzso and showed broad zzso specificity with maximum activity towards zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso value of zzso at zzso and V zzso value of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso Although zzso have been reported, the high specific activity zzso zzso zzso zzso
