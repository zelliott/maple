zzso zzso is a zzso adhesive zzso with a zzso zzso cell binding zzso Several independent studies have suggested that zzso functions in tumor growth and zzso and one likely possibility is that zzso zzso tumor invasion by promoting tumor cell zzso zzso with this hypothesis, immobilized zzso promoted zzso tumor cell migration zzso zzso in modified zzso zzso In particular, zzso of zzso by zzso which likely occurs in the tumor zzso resulted in enhancement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso performed with zzso preparations of the two individual zzso zzso fragments demonstrated that all zzso activity was associated with the zzso zzso In contrast to the activity of both zzso and its zzso zzso in promoting zzso neither of these proteins in solution promoted zzso indicating that each must be immobilized to promote cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso alpha v beta 3 blocked zzso zzso cell migration towards the zzso zzso fragment, implicating alpha v beta 3 as its principal functional zzso In comparison with zzso quantities of other adhesive zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was not only zzso zzso more effective than intact zzso at promoting zzso but also zzso zzso and zzso zzso more effective than zzso and zzso respectively, indicating that this zzso zzso is highly active relative to other alpha v beta 3 zzso
