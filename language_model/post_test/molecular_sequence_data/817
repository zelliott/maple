zzso zzso syndrome zzso is associated with zzso throughout the zzso zzso zzso zzso Different zzso at the same zzso have been identified in individuals with various zzso suggesting the nature of the zzso zzso may influence the degree of zzso We investigated if zzso could be predicted by comparing the functionality of zzso zzso with those at the same zzso of known zzso 

We identified patients from the Cambridge Disorders of Sex Development Database with the zzso zzso zzso with zzso without zzso and zzso with complete zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have previously been reported to be associated with different degrees of zzso 

We characterized the functional properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and used the crystal structure of the zzso zzso binding domain to model the zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound zzso with decreasing zzso while zzso showed reduced affinity compared to zzso A similar pattern of reduced zzso was seen on zzso responsive zzso We suggest how the zzso could affect zzso structure, resulting in the observed zzso 

The relative functional properties of zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors correlate broadly with their specific zzso zzso comparing the molecular consequences of novel zzso with others at the same zzso may be a useful aid to zzso patient management, particularly for sex of rearing decisions when prediction of functionality is zzso
