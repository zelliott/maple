zzso proteins 5 zzso of zzso are structurally and zzso related proteins that are characterized by their low affinity for zzso For this reason, they are mainly involved in zzso resistance, due essentially to their ability to take over the function of all other zzso already bound and inhibited by the zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso resistance in zzso is acquired either by overproduction of zzso or by the presence of specific zzso acid sequences in the protein that further decrease the affinity for zzso In particular, a specific zzso acid box zzso previously identified in zzso zzso is responsible for the high zzso resistance displayed by this zzso Here, we describe the zzso of the zzso zzso acid box zzso in zzso zzso an zzso species usually more sensitive to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into a zzso zzso of zzso zzso obtained by zzso of zzso zzso Data indicate that this zzso acid box brings about no reduction in zzso sensitivity in the recipient zzso zzso strain, but, zzso dramatically lowers the zzso minimal zzso concentration caused by the native zzso We deduce that, although zzso zzso are a family of closely related proteins as far as biological function is concerned, differences exist in their three-dimensional structure that affect zzso zzso
