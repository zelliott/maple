We have examined the rate of evolution of Ross River virus, a zzso zzso virus, during epidemic spread through tens of thousands of zzso humans over a period of 10 zzso Two regions of the Ross River virus zzso were zzso the zzso gene zzso zzso in zzso which encodes the major zzso zzso of the virus, and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso a single zzso change was selected which led to a predicted zzso acid change at zzso zzso No changes were selected in the zzso zzso By comparison with rates of evolution reported for zzso zzso zzso the rate for Ross River virus is surprisingly zzso We identify three features of the Ross River virus replication and transmission cycle which may limit the rate of evolution of zzso viruses in the zzso
