The first cells generated during development of the zzso zzso are the zzso cells, the projection zzso of the zzso Although they are one of the most zzso studied cell types within the central nervous system, little is known of the mechanisms that determine zzso cell zzso We demonstrate that zzso cells are selected from a large group of competent zzso that comprise the majority of the early embryonic zzso and that differentiation within this group is regulated by zzso zzso activity in zzso was diminished using zzso zzso or zzso using a zzso zzso zzso active zzso of zzso The number of zzso cells produced was zzso related to the level of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso Delta inhibited retinal zzso from zzso as zzso cells to the same degree as did activated zzso in an in zzso zzso These results suggest a zzso strategy for zzso in the zzso and describe a versatile in zzso and in zzso system with which to examine the action of the zzso zzso in a specific cell fate decision in a zzso
