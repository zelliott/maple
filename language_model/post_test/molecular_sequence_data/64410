Identification of proteins in complex zzso by mass zzso is most useful when quantitative data is also zzso We recently introduced zzso affinity tags zzso zzso for the relative zzso of proteins present in two or more biological zzso In this report, we describe a new generation of zzso zzso that contain the following additional features: zzso a visible tag that allows the zzso position of zzso peptides during separation to be easily zzso zzso a zzso zzso that allows most of the tag to be removed prior to mass zzso zzso zzso an isotope tag that contains zzso and zzso atoms instead of zzso to ensure precise zzso of light and heavy zzso peptides by zzso zzso These zzso contain an zzso group that selectively zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso modification chemistry is also reported that allows tagging of peptides that are devoid of zzso The synthesis of these visible zzso affinity tags zzso zzso and their reaction with peptides are described in this zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso visible probe or an zzso zzso are zzso These zzso are most useful for the determination of the absolute quantity of specific target proteins in complex protein zzso such as serum or cell zzso
