Human zzso zzso is a recently identified member of the zzso zzso zzso family that is expressed in breast zzso and in zzso cartilage from zzso zzso In this work we have isolated and characterized zzso clones coding for human zzso This gene is composed of 10 zzso and 9 zzso and spans over zzso zzso The overall organization of the zzso gene is similar to that of other zzso genes clustered at zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but is more zzso related to genes coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which map outside of this gene zzso zzso sequence analysis of about 1 zzso of the zzso region of the zzso gene revealed the presence of a zzso box, an zzso zzso a zzso consensus zzso an zzso specific element zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso and zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso site is functional and responsible for the observed zzso of the reporter gene by the tumor promoter zzso zzso However, and in contrast to other zzso zzso no zzso synergistic effect on zzso activity between the zzso and zzso elements found in the zzso gene promoter was zzso DNA binding analysis with nuclear extracts from zzso cells revealed the formation of specific complexes between zzso promoter sequences containing the zzso site and nuclear zzso The presence of this zzso functional site, which is able to zzso responsiveness to a variety of tumor promoters and zzso products, zzso contribute to explaining the high-level expression of zzso in breast zzso and degenerative joint zzso
