A novel zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from muddy soil collected from a stream of zzso Mountain in zzso north zzso The zzso was found to have zzso and zzso characteristics typical of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso showed highest similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene and zzso gene demonstrated that strain zzso was a member of the zzso zzso and supported the closest zzso relationship to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A combination of zzso zzso and some zzso characteristics indicated that the novel strain could be readily distinguished from these closest zzso zzso zzso it is proposed that zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
