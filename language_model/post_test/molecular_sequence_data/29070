zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso was characterized in zzso coronary zzso zzso In intact zzso 100 zzso substance P and 600 zzso zzso zzso produced zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished the zzso response but substance P continued to induce a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso patch recordings revealed a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was increased by zzso and reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso P activated an outward current under zzso zzso conditions and a component of this current zzso was inhibited by zzso A second zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited by zzso was observed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso but not the zzso zzso of zzso was detected by zzso - zzso in samples of zzso Western zzso indicated that zzso protein was abundant in samples of zzso compared to whole zzso zzso protein was present in whole artery nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso was highly expressed at the zzso of zzso cells and was not expressed in smooth zzso zzso was restricted to the zzso regions of both zzso and smooth muscle zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso coronary artery zzso expresses an zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso These channels are likely to zzso all or part of the zzso component of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso
