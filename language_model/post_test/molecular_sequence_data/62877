zzso employ different zzso zzso systems to adapt to certain environmental conditions and to different carbon source zzso The zzso of zzso carbohydrates and the subsequent zzso of zzso forms may also play a role in zzso zzso zzso accumulates cell wall components during zzso growth and degrades them during sexual zzso We have identified the zzso zzso affinity zzso zzso gene in a differential library, which was enriched for zzso zzso The zzso gene is disrupted by 6 zzso and predicted to zzso a 531 zzso acid protein with high similarity to major zzso zzso members including the high affinity zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains the 12 predicted zzso zzso characteristic for this zzso zzso of zzso did not impair growth of zzso zzso on a variety of carbon sources nor did it inhibit sexual development suggesting redundant sugar zzso zzso We found at least 17 putative zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso Despite the high similarity of zzso to zzso high affinity zzso zzso the zzso gene did not restore growth on zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in which all zzso zzso were zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso under high zzso conditions and expressed in zzso zzso upon carbon zzso and during sexual zzso We found zzso expression in developing zzso specifically in zzso zzso and propose that zzso is a high affinity zzso zzso involved in sugar metabolism during sexual zzso
