Six field zzso disease viruses zzso including four zzso O and two zzso Asia 1 zzso were collected from endemic outbreaks in 2005, 2006, and 2007 from four different provinces in zzso The viruses were isolated and genetically characterized for their complete zzso zzso The genetic analysis based on the complete zzso coding sequences revealed that the four zzso O zzso were related to each other, sharing zzso zzso zzso identity and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso analysis and a zzso tree, based on the zzso gene of zzso showed that the four present Vietnamese zzso O strains have a high level of identity with other zzso O representatives of the zzso lineage of the Southeast Asian zzso zzso The four viruses were all clustered into the zzso lineage of the SEA zzso sharing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This finding of the zzso lineage was different from previous reports that the Vietnamese zzso O strains belonged to the zzso lineage of the SEA zzso and two other zzso Middle zzso Asia zzso and zzso For the two zzso Asia 1 zzso the genetic analysis based on the complete zzso coding sequences as well as on the zzso gene revealed that they belonged to two zzso IV and zzso Of note, the zzso strain of zzso zzso isolated in 2007, was very closely related to the pandemic Asia 1 strain which caused zzso outbreaks in China zzso zzso and Mongolia zzso zzso in 2005, sharing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the second strain zzso of zzso IV, isolated in 2005, was closely related to all referenced Vietnamese zzso Asia 1 strains found in the zzso databases, sharing zzso zzso and zzso zzso identity with zzso This study is the first description of the full-length zzso sequence of Vietnamese zzso zzso O and Asia 1 and may provide the evidence of the concurrent circulation of different zzso and zzso of zzso in recent years in zzso
