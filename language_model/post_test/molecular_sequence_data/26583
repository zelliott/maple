A microcosm zzso method was set up to investigate the growth of zzso zzso zzso isolated from a water sample acquired at a depth of 50 m from the northern basin of Lake zzso For this purpose, both zzso and zzso targeting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso zzso cell growth at the end of the zzso microcosm experiment accounted for zzso of the zzso cells, which corresponded to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso libraries and zzso zzso confirmed the dominance of zzso zzso in the zzso community zzso The majority of the identified zzso zzso zzso gene sequences in the clone libraries were affiliated with zzso Marine Group 1 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso community on zzso zzso plates in medium containing different carbon sources to stimulate zzso growth failed to show significant differences in zzso abundance zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for zzso extract and simple organic zzso zzso The lack of growth stimulation by organic compounds is in zzso with the zzso status of Lake zzso Finally, the addition of antibiotics to the growth medium resulted in zzso cell counts that were significantly lower than those obtained from cultures in zzso medium zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso
