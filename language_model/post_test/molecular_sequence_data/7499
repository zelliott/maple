Based on the zzso of the zzso zzso complex, an 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from zzso zzso zzso chemical analysis and studies involving zzso zzso and zzso establish that the zzso is a unique zzso that cannot be classified so far in one of the conventional zzso zzso The zzso zzso behaves as an zzso zzso since its activity towards the zzso complex is apparently not regulated by the binding of a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso screening of the zzso specificity suggests that the zzso complex represents the only zzso for this zzso This zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso complex at two consecutive zzso zzso which constitute one of the contact sites for zzso I zzso and which are also located at one of the proposed zzso contact sites along the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso importance of this zzso was demonstrated by studying the effect of zzso on the nucleation and the capping activity of the zzso complex using zzso enhancement zzso As could be demonstrated, the nucleation of zzso filaments by the zzso complex is completely abolished upon zzso by the zzso zzso of the complex also interferes with its capping activity, which becomes zzso In addition, capping and zzso activity is regulated in zzso by zzso of which zzso displays the highest activity and zzso zzso partially zzso the nucleation and capping activity of the zzso zzso The capping activity of the zzso zzso complex was inhibited by zzso to a much greater extent as compared to the zzso zzso zzso Among all zzso tested, zzso displayed the highest zzso zzso experiments with zzso preparations of the zzso zzso zzso alkaline zzso and acid zzso showed that zzso and zzso zzso were capable of zzso the zzso zzso zzso These findings raised the question of whether these or other protein zzso were involved in the zzso of this zzso in zzso To address this question, zzso extracts were subjected to zzso by zzso exchange zzso and the column zzso were zzso in a variety of conditions, to identify the protein zzso involved in the zzso of this zzso and to identify the zzso position of the major zzso protein zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
