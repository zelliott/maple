zzso axis formation requires both the correct zzso of cell fates and the coordination of zzso zzso We report that the zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso is activated on the zzso side by the maternal zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso activity display abnormal cell movements during zzso resulting in a zzso head and a shortened zzso zzso but show no defects in early cell fate zzso Time course analysis, cell zzso and transplantation experiments revealed that zzso activity is required cell autonomously for the anterior migration of zzso zzso cells and zzso autonomously for the convergence of neighboring zzso zzso These results reveal a role for zzso in controlling cell movements during zzso
