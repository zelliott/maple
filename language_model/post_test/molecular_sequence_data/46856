The moderate zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso expresses a zzso zzso zzso 2) belonging to the zzso zzso zzso group of the zzso zzso Based on secondary structures predictions and a secondary zzso multiple sequence alignment with remote zzso protein of known three-dimensional zzso structure, we previously hypothesized for this zzso the zzso fold typical of several zzso and zzso and identified zzso zzso and zzso as the putative members of the zzso zzso In this paper we report the construction of a zzso model for this zzso based on the structure of mouse zzso zzso with zzso The model reveals the zzso organization of the fold corroborating our zzso As regarding the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located close to each other at hydrogen bond zzso Their zzso role was here zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, on the basis of the secondary zzso multiple sequence alignment and the zzso structural model, a zzso supposed important for zzso zzso was zzso to zzso The activity of the zzso zzso was drastically zzso We propose that zzso is part of a putative zzso zzso involved in the stabilization of the transition state similar to the C group of the zzso zzso
