zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso in response to stimulation with zzso zzso zzso production by zzso was inhibited by zzso However, reversal of the effect of this inhibitor on protein synthesis results in zzso being zzso in amounts equivalent to those produced by zzso zzso not treated with zzso zzso D treatment of zzso blocked the production of zzso zzso zzso production of zzso required zzso gene zzso during the first 6 h of incubation with zzso To determine whether zzso zzso alpha zzso and/or zzso beta were produced by zzso zzso was zzso from the total zzso isolated from zzso zzso and amplified by the zzso chain reaction in the presence of zzso zzso specific for each zzso On the basis of the zzso chain reaction analysis, it was determined that zzso zzso levels were increased in zzso zzso Thus, production of zzso by zzso in response to the zzso component of bacterial cell walls is likely to contribute to the expression of zzso effects occurring in zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso
