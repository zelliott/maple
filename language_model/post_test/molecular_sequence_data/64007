zzso of the zzso factor zzso to its DNA binding motif regulates the expression of a number of zzso and zzso zzso The long terminal repeat zzso of zzso strains of zzso infectious anemia virus zzso contains three zzso binding sites, namely an zzso zzso site as well as two upstream zzso We have previously shown that these sites are important for zzso zzso activity in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since the sequences present in these three binding motifs are not zzso we sought to determine the role of these three sites in zzso zzso zzso While zzso I zzso studies indicated that all three sites within the zzso were bound by zzso zzso reporter gene zzso demonstrated that the middle motif was most important for zzso levels of zzso activity in zzso and that the zzso motif had little zzso The impact of the 3' site became evident in zzso zzso studies, in which the loss of the site reduced zzso expression zzso In contrast, elimination of the zzso site had no effect on zzso zzso zzso studies were performed to determine whether differences in zzso binding affinity for the three sites correlated with the relative impact of each site on zzso zzso While small differences were observed in the binding affinities of the three sites, with the zzso site having the strongest binding zzso these differences could not account for the dramatic differences observed in the zzso zzso Instead, the zzso position of the 3' motif appeared to be critical for its zzso impact and suggested that the zzso sites may serve different roles depending upon the location of the sites within the zzso zzso studies demonstrated that an zzso containing an zzso composed of the three zzso sites was not sufficient to drive viral replication in zzso These findings indicate that while the zzso zzso site is the most critical site for zzso zzso activity in the presence of zzso other elements within the zzso are needed for zzso replication in zzso
