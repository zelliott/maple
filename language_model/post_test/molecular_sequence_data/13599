zzso are a class of compounds with potential as zzso for a variety of clinical zzso Local delivery of zzso to the zzso wall is a challenging aspect of the development of these zzso for zzso and zzso we report experiments characterizing the zzso and distribution of zzso zzso into vascular smooth muscle cells in primary cultures and in rabbit zzso zzso cultures of smooth muscle cells incubated with zzso showed zzso only into zzso zzso No nuclear or zzso zzso was zzso In normal arteries there was no visible tissue or cellular zzso of zzso after zzso zzso However, in zzso arteries there was significant zzso zzso into the tissue with apparent zzso delivery to the zzso smooth muscle cells, as zzso by intense zzso of their zzso with labeled zzso zzso of zzso in artery extracts showed significantly greater zzso in injured, compared with normal zzso Light and electron microscopic studies demonstrated a correlation between the degree of damage and the amount of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso penetrate easily into the zzso wall of zzso arteries and accumulate in the zzso smooth muscle zzso target cells for zzso zzso following balloon zzso
