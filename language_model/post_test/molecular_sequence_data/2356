A zzso clone for human pro alpha zzso collagen zzso was isolated from a zzso library constructed for human fetal skin zzso The zzso zzso was identified by restriction mapping and zzso zzso with previously published human type III collagen sequences revealed some differences which may reflect individual zzso The clone was used to study the expression of type III collagen zzso in various fetal zzso in comparison to the expression of type I collagen zzso In zzso fetal skin the ratio of alpha zzso to alpha zzso collagen zzso was zzso zzso and zzso bone contained high amounts of type I collagen zzso and low levels of type III collagen zzso resulting in high type zzso III zzso In zzso zzso of sections of skeletal zzso was employed to identify the cells containing the zzso for types I, II and III zzso The results revealed differential expression patterns for these three collagen types in various human fetal zzso Lack of coordinate expression suggests that production of type I and type III zzso is under different regulatory mechanisms in developing skeletal zzso
