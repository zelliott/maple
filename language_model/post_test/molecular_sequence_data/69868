The zzso inversion of zzso 16 and the zzso are two zzso aberrations in bone zzso of patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso characterized by abnormal zzso zzso We describe here the precise zzso of the zzso using zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso spread over the short arm of zzso 16 and the zzso isolation and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso containing a cluster of zzso First, zzso were mapped to intervals defined by constitutional zzso zzso second, the zzso and zzso zzso were mapped to one of the intervals using FISH with the mapped zzso and third, zzso within this zzso were ordered using two color zzso zzso An zzso of the zzso closest to the zzso was then used to isolate five zzso which did span all of the 16 zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso In the DNA of one zzso patient we detected an additional zzso deletion immediately zzso to the zzso zzso Since this patient has the same zzso the zzso sequences zzso to the zzso seem zzso to zzso zzso This implies that the zzso event is the juxtaposition of sequences zzso to the zzso zzso with sequences zzso to the zzso zzso While four of the five zzso showed instability of the region around the zzso zzso DNA halo analysis allowed us to identify one zzso which was zzso with normal zzso DNA and has yielded the actual zzso sequences which could be zzso into zzso and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
