A novel fish muscle zzso zzso named muscle soluble zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the soluble fraction of zzso fish zzso zzso zzso muscle by ammonium zzso zzso followed by four steps of column zzso In zzso the zzso zzso appeared as a single band with an estimated zzso mass of approximately 380 zzso by gel zzso In zzso under reducing conditions, the zzso zzso migrated as two protein bands at 110 and 100 zzso named zzso A and B, zzso The 20 zzso of zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso B showed zzso of zzso to zzso of carp zzso Moreover, both zzso A and B showed zzso with anti carp zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso After acid treatment zzso 2, 24 zzso however, the zzso activity zzso at 14 zzso from zzso zzso carried out under zzso conditions was inhibited by zzso zzso fish zzso most rapidly zzso zzso and zzso but did not zzso zzso and zzso and was not suppressed either by zzso zzso A and zzso acid zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso with zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso by the acid zzso zzso and free zzso were most active at pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso but time courses of degradation of these zzso by the zzso zzso
