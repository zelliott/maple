At a time of the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial zzso the development of zzso compounds with novel mechanisms of action is of considerable zzso Perhaps the most promising among these is a family of zzso peptides originally isolated from zzso These were shown to act in a zzso manner on an zzso unidentified target bacterial zzso One of these zzso zzso is inactive in zzso due to the rapid decomposition in zzso zzso However, another family member, zzso is significantly more stable, has increased in zzso efficacy against zzso bacterial zzso and if administered alone, as we show here, is devoid of in zzso or in zzso zzso At low doses, zzso protected mice against zzso coli infection, but at a higher dose zzso the infection of compromised zzso zzso of zzso were, therefore, zzso to further improve zzso resistance and reduce zzso A linear zzso containing zzso zzso acids at both zzso showed high potency and lack of toxicity in zzso and an expanded zzso analog displayed broad activity spectrum in zzso The zzso zzso of native zzso was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and similar to zzso reverse turns were identified as zzso important elements at the zzso bridged by an extended zzso zzso zzso of the primary and secondary structural requirements for in zzso activity of these peptides allows the design of novel zzso drug zzso
