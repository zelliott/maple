zzso play a significant role in the zzso and mobility of zzso in the zzso In this study, the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso linked to zzso zzso reduction was shown to be zzso by sludge samples, enrichment cultures zzso and pure cultures incubated under zzso zzso No activity was observed in treatments lacking zzso or with zzso zzso or in controls lacking zzso The zzso zzso was linked to the complete reduction of zzso to zzso and the zzso ratio of zzso formed to zzso consumed approached the theoretical value of zzso assuming the zzso zzso from zzso were used to completely reduce zzso In keeping with zzso as a putative intermediate of zzso reduction, the zzso could also zzso zzso to zzso with zzso at low zzso Low levels of organic carbon were essential in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso gene clone libraries indicated that the zzso were dominated by clones of zzso (including zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso under zzso zzso Additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified in zzso zzso Two isolated zzso pure cultures, zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso were able to grow by linking the zzso of zzso to zzso with the reduction of zzso The presence of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso gene was demonstrated with zzso in the zzso and pure zzso This study demonstrates that zzso is an alternative electron zzso to support the microbial zzso of zzso
