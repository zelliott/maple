The distinction and zzso property of the zzso zzso species in the zzso zzso of the order zzso was resolved by molecular zzso analysis based on the combined sequences of the zzso zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso region including zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso gene zzso zzso The addition to the zzso of new zzso species identified among zzso zzso isolated from China confirmed and strengthened the separation of this zzso from other zzso or lineages in the order zzso A new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso is therefore proposed to accommodate the zzso species in the zzso zzso Six new combinations are proposed for the described species of this zzso which were formerly assigned to the zzso zzso Four novel species in the new zzso were identified among 16 zzso zzso strains isolated from plant leaves collected in zzso province, southern China, by zzso and ITS sequence zzso The novel species are described as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
