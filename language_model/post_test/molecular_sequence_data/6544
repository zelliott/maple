In the budding zzso zzso zzso the zzso pole body zzso serves as the zzso center and is the functional analog of the zzso of higher zzso By expressing a fusion of a zzso zzso protein to the zzso zzso green fluorescent zzso the movement of the zzso in living zzso cells undergoing zzso was observed by zzso zzso The ability to zzso zzso in zzso has revealed previously unidentified zzso zzso During zzso the zzso zzso has four sequential activities: alignment at the zzso zzso fast zzso zzso into the zzso and slow zzso These results indicate that distinct forces act upon the zzso at different times during zzso
