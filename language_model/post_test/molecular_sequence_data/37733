zzso zzso receptors zzso are known to mediate zzso zzso in spinal cord, brain stem and some higher brain zzso Several zzso and regionally regulated zzso zzso exist, which result from a differential expression of the zzso alpha zzso and beta zzso zzso Currently, very little is known about zzso containing the zzso zzso whose existence was predicted from a partial zzso zzso Here, we describe the isolation of complementary DNA zzso sequences for the mouse and chick zzso zzso zzso We show that a mouse zzso zzso zzso full-length zzso directs the formation of functional zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, and that these resemble zzso composed of the zzso zzso in pharmacological profile and single-channel zzso In zzso zzso reveals high levels of zzso zzso zzso transcripts in the embryonic zzso chick spinal cord, zzso sympathetic zzso and zzso root zzso The avian zzso zzso zzso gene also shows zzso expression in the developing zzso zzso The pharmacological profile of zzso zzso receptors and deduced location of the avian zzso zzso zzso are consistent with it being a component of the embryonic zzso zzso previously identified in sympathetic zzso Our data also suggest a novel role for zzso in the maturation of zzso zzso
