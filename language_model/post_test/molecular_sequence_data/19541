zzso acid zzso from zzso zzso zzso is a zzso with high zzso and industrial zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso form of a zzso zzso zzso allowed us to go deep into the structural differences between zzso and zzso and on the zzso binding and its contribution to zzso zzso A significant decrease in intrinsic zzso zzso took place upon zzso zzso associated to zzso induced zzso transitions or zzso zzso that could affect the local environment of protein zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso experiments indicated that one of the five zzso zzso of zzso became less accessible upon zzso zzso A zzso M for the zzso of zzso from zzso was calculated from binding experiments based on both zzso of zzso zzso and activity zzso zzso Secondary structure prediction indicated that zzso is a mixed zzso protein with 8 zzso and 14 zzso connected by zzso zzso results were in good agreement with the estimates obtained by circular zzso which indicated that both the zzso and the zzso had the same structural component zzso zzso zzso content, zzso zzso content zzso zzso and zzso parallel zzso zzso zzso and zzso of random zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested zzso zzso processes with apparent zzso transition temperatures zzso of zzso degrees C and zzso degrees C for the zzso and the zzso zzso A three-dimensional model of zzso built by zzso zzso and consistent with the zzso studies is zzso Comparing our results with those reported for pig kidney zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso a zzso interaction between zzso in the zzso zzso might be zzso
