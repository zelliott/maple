The zzso marine zzso zzso zzso produces zzso zzso zzso that is important in zzso formation by this zzso zzso and precise zzso of zzso at a locus essential for zzso zzso production zzso controls phase variation of zzso production in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso by using a zzso zzso revealed a circular form of zzso that may be an intermediate in zzso or a terminal product of zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso circle junction indicates that the ends of the element are juxtaposed with a zzso zzso zzso This zzso sequence zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso target sequence found at all zzso zzso sites on the zzso zzso zzso that we identified by using inverse zzso zzso circle formation correlated with precise zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso target sequence when introduced into zzso coli on a zzso zzso analyses of the zzso host sequences at the zzso zzso site for zzso demonstrated that the zzso duplicated target sequence is essential for precise zzso of zzso and circle formation in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli also depends on the level of expression of the putative zzso zzso A regulatory role for the circular form of zzso is suggested by the creation of a new strong promoter for expression of zzso by the joining of the ends of the zzso sequence element at the circle zzso
