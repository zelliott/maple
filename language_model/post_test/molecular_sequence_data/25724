zzso is a synthetic analogue of zzso which is a naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso complex has been made by two-dimensional zzso zzso The solution structure of the complex was calculated by an zzso hybrid relaxation zzso method combined with zzso distance restrained molecular zzso zzso proceeded in two steps in which the zzso was initially refined alone and then zzso was added to the structure to allow initial estimates of zzso zzso A hybrid zzso refinement was used to better take into account problems associated with spin zzso Thus the distances from the zzso zzso zzso were calculated from the relaxation rate zzso which were evaluated from a hybrid zzso volume zzso zzso elements from the experimental spectrum and those calculated from an initial zzso The hybrid zzso derived distances were then used in a restrained molecular dynamics procedure to obtain a new structure that better zzso the zzso zzso The resulting partially refined structure was then used to calculate an improved theoretical zzso volume zzso which is once again merged with the experimental zzso until refinement is zzso The efficacy of zzso has been attributed to its minor groove binding and zzso to the zzso position of zzso zzso appears to bind to the zzso in a similar zzso The effect of zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso spectrum was consistent with a minor groove binding motif with the drug zzso at A17 with the zzso rings oriented toward the zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso data support one major zzso but also indicate the presence of a minor zzso The latter could represent a drug zzso of the DNA at a secondary site (or alternative orientation of the zzso
