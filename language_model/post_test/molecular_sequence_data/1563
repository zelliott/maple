The spotted zzso zzso minor is a promising new species for zzso zzso The broad zzso of zzso zzso zzso and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus zzso makes them potentially zzso to new fish species in zzso zzso and zzso strains highly zzso in farmed Atlantic salmon zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, in Norway were used for the challenge of spotted zzso In general, zzso infection with zzso and zzso resulted in significant mortality among juveniles zzso zzso zzso mortality after zzso and zzso was 60 to zzso in the smallest juveniles zzso zzso zzso and zzso injection of zzso was zzso lethal to zzso of 10 zzso and the groups at 12 degrees C died before those at 7 degrees zzso No zzso of this size died, but zzso was still zzso in these individuals after 10 zzso A persistent zzso infection with low mortality developed in zzso juveniles of zzso zzso in which zzso was still zzso 4 zzso zzso This study comprises a demonstration of experimental viral infections in cultured spotted zzso although to date no natural outbreaks of viral diseases have been reported in this zzso
