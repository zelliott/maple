zzso is a 115 zzso protein which was identified by its ability to enhance zzso zzso exchange for the zzso family member zzso It also binds to activated zzso and zzso and appears to function as part of a zzso complex in downstream events following zzso zzso Here we report the identification of full-length zzso clones for human zzso isolated from a brain zzso zzso The predicted protein has strong sequence zzso to rat and zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso and zzso regions, but an internal region zzso zzso shows relatively high divergence with only zzso identical zzso acid zzso The human zzso gene is contained within a 30 zzso region of zzso approximately 200 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso within the current critical region for the zzso sclerosis gene zzso zzso zzso structure was zzso it consists of at least 11 zzso Based upon analysis of Southern blots from 110 zzso patients, zzso DNA zzso analysis, and zzso analysis which demonstrated zzso expression of both zzso in patients from zzso zzso families using zzso zzso we conclude that zzso is not likely to be zzso
