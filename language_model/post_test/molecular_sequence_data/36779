zzso screening at temperatures between zzso degrees C far exceeds the range of growth of most bacteria, and is not zzso to isolate easily zzso protein zzso We describe a temperature shift protocol and an in zzso screening method which allowed us to identify a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso Our strategy was to zzso after zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso which overcomes a zzso leading to a zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene revealed only one change in the zzso acid zzso substituting a zzso for zzso at position zzso This single zzso acid replacement increased the zzso of the protein at 90 degrees C by a factor of two to three relative to the zzso zzso When this substitution was combined with another stabilizing substitution zzso we described zzso the stabilizing effects were zzso The zzso of the new protein was about 12 hours at 90 degrees C, corresponding to a nine to zzso increase over the zzso zzso and the industrial zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are located in a predicted folding domain of the protein which appears crucial in determining zzso zzso
