Recently, we have shown differential zzso of an zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso this zzso lies within the region of the gene zzso the cellulose binding domain zzso Sims, zzso zzso zzso zzso Wang, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that such differential zzso occurs in the zzso gene of this fungus as well as in the zzso gene and that this phenomenon is zzso zzso zzso elicits the synthesis of both classes of zzso transcripts from both of these zzso In contrast, zzso cellulose predominantly elicits the synthesis of fully spliced transcripts from both zzso Such differential zzso might allow this fungus to regulate the zzso of zzso binding for these zzso
