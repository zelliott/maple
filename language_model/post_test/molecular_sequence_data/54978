zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso play a diverse range of roles in a number of zzso zzso In humans zzso function in regulating the inflammatory and immune responses, control of vascular zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso are thought to function primarily in the zzso zzso involved in zzso sugar transport into the zzso apparatus and subsequent protein zzso Although rare in bacteria, in zzso zzso zzso zzso function as zzso zzso In the last 2 decades it has become clear that a large number of zzso zzso putative zzso and the functions of a number of these have been zzso In this review, the available evidence for zzso in zzso and the role of these zzso is summarized and zzso Furthermore, the processes by which zzso could function in zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammation and zzso formation are considered, and the data supporting such putative roles zzso Potential future research directions to further clarify the role and importance of zzso in zzso are zzso An attempt is also made to clarify the nomenclature used in the zzso field for the zzso protein zzso and a uniform system zzso
