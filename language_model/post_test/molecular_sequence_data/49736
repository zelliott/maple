zzso and human zzso zzso prevent zzso C virus zzso infection in cultured human zzso the preventive mechanism is thought to be the direct interaction between zzso and zzso To clarify this hypothesis, we have characterized the binding activity of zzso to zzso zzso envelope protein and have zzso to determine which zzso of zzso are important for this binding zzso Several regions of human zzso have been expressed and zzso as zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using these zzso fragments and the zzso zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells, revealed that the 93 zzso zzso acids of zzso specifically bound to the zzso zzso The 93 zzso zzso acids of zzso derived from bovine and horse cells also possessed similar binding activity to the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso acid sequences of these zzso regions appeared to show partial zzso to zzso a candidate zzso for zzso and the binding activity of these zzso regions was also comparable with that of zzso Further deletion analysis identified 33 zzso acid zzso as the minimum binding site in the zzso region of zzso and the binding specificity of these 33 zzso acids was also confirmed by using 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that the 33 zzso zzso zzso acids prevented zzso infection in cultured human zzso In addition, the zzso zzso to an Ala zzso in both terminal zzso of the 33 zzso acids revealed that zzso at zzso acid 628 was determined to be critical for binding to the zzso zzso These results led us to consider the development of an effective zzso zzso This is the first identification of a natural zzso zzso that specifically binds to zzso zzso protein and prevents zzso zzso
