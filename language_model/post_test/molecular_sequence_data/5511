zzso is an integral membrane protein of zzso zzso and is essential for neurotransmitter zzso Previously, a zzso zzso structure has been proposed by zzso experiments performed on brain zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso expressed and zzso zzso II forms a zzso The zzso were detected upon zzso with a zzso zzso zzso or by zzso of the single zzso zzso located within the zzso zzso zzso was also observed without prior zzso upon zzso under mild zzso Interestingly, zzso required the presence of the zzso segment which therefore is zzso to be the principal site of zzso zzso The zzso zzso this segment were individually zzso zzso of some point zzso was significantly impaired, which proved the sequence specificity of interaction and identified zzso contributing to the zzso zzso The distribution of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggests that the zzso segment has an zzso structure and that the zzso pair in a right-handed zzso The importance of the zzso segment for zzso interaction relates zzso to zzso membrane proteins of enveloped viruses where zzso segments have been implicated in both zzso and membrane zzso
