zzso are zzso of proteins and zzso zzso formed in the peripheral portion of the zzso system of zzso They add mass to the zzso zzso zzso thereby increasing its zzso during linear zzso This added mass increases the sensitivity of the underlying sensory zzso zzso provide a promising system to decipher the interaction of protein and mineral during the growth and maintenance of zzso We have zzso the major protein of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which we call zzso and determined its zzso acid sequence and zzso zzso The zzso zzso are 37% identical to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso We propose that zzso from zzso zzso is zzso to zzso zzso and has a similar zzso zzso
