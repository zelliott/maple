The zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso is expressed virtually on normal zzso in zzso Among different species, the zzso acid sequence of zzso is highly zzso indicating that zzso is an evolutionary zzso zzso However, differences in the expression pattern of zzso zzso have been zzso We hypothesized that differences in expression pattern might be related to the promoter organization of the respective zzso zzso zzso we here compared the promoter region of the mouse and human zzso zzso In addition, we compared the expression pattern of the human and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso transgenic zzso In zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed that the zzso acid sequence as well as the domain structure is highly zzso throughout different zzso In zzso analysis of the promoter region identified that the human and mouse zzso promoters share a low zzso In agreement with this low zzso the zzso and human zzso promoter contains only a few common zzso factor binding zzso Nevertheless, zzso analysis of the expression of human and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and kidney of the zzso transgenic mouse identified that expression of both zzso is restricted to zzso cells in these zzso Moreover, in lung and colon the human and zzso zzso of zzso were zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso were only sporadically zzso in zzso zzso although they were distributed similarly along the zzso zzso Together, these findings indicate an overall zzso regulatory mechanism that ensures zzso expression of zzso zzso despite the low promoter zzso Furthermore, the fact that zzso zzso express the human zzso of zzso indicates that the mouse has zzso factors required for human zzso zzso
