The expression of zzso zzso the zzso that zzso zzso from zzso is regulated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the exact mechanism of zzso regulation is zzso In this study, the role of a zzso regulatory system zzso in zzso expression was zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was constructed by zzso zzso By use of zzso the zzso was shown to zzso zzso in the absence of zzso while the wild type and a zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso transcript levels were increased in the zzso zzso suggesting regulation at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also found to zzso zzso zzso and this zzso was reversed by zzso zzso Paper zzso studies and chemical tests showed that the zzso zzso contained zzso and zzso acid but not zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso was not zzso The production of a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has not been reported for zzso zzso and may be considered zzso In conclusion, the results indicate that the expression of zzso and a zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso regulated by the zzso zzso regulatory system in zzso zzso
