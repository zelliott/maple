zzso zzso proteins are basic proteins that zzso viral zzso zzso to form part of the virus zzso The zzso protein of zzso is highly zzso and associated with several zzso zzso Our previous studies using nuclear magnetic resonance revealed the domain organization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to bind to the zzso domain zzso although recently the zzso half of the protein has also been implicated in zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso domain zzso spanning zzso zzso zzso had stronger zzso zzso activity than the zzso To determine the molecular basis of this activity, we have also solved the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso form a positively charged groove similar to that found in the infectious zzso virus zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the positively charged surface area is larger in the zzso construct than in the zzso zzso between zzso zzso and the rest of the zzso also stabilize the formation of an zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in the crystal forms two zzso basic zzso zzso which may be zzso attachment sites, and suggests a mechanism for zzso zzso packaging in the zzso
