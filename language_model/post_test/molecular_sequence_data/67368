zzso are zzso viruses with a zzso zzso zzso A genetically unique zzso zzso virus, was recently discovered as the zzso agent of a zzso outbreak of acute zzso illness with zzso manifestations in zzso and South zzso The outbreak had a case fatality rate of zzso A reverse zzso system to rescue infectious zzso virus from zzso was established to investigate the biological properties of this zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed unique zzso at the 3' zzso of the S segment promoter zzso While developing this system, we discovered that reconstructing infectious zzso virus using the previously reported L segment zzso region zzso zzso the zzso zzso termination zzso yielded an attenuated zzso zzso zzso revealed that the correct L segment zzso was 36 zzso longer, and incorporating it into the reconstructed zzso virus restored the growth rate to that of the authentic clinical virus zzso These additional zzso were predicted to more than double the free energy of the zzso main zzso zzso In addition, incorporating the newly determined zzso into a zzso reporter system enhanced the expression of a zzso reporter L zzso Overall, these results imply that an extremely stable secondary structure within the zzso is critical for zzso virus propagation and viral protein zzso The technology for producing zzso zzso virus now provides a method to precisely investigate the molecular zzso of zzso of this newly identified zzso
