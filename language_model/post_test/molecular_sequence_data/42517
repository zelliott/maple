To address the relationship between primary sequence variation in zzso zzso and its zzso structure in a simple system, we have measured the binding of human and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso from four molecular clones of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite the close relationship between these zzso and their relatively zzso zzso zzso there is considerable variation in their zzso structure, judged by zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and C4 zzso and to zzso zzso Because of our prior studies of the zzso of zzso binding to zzso zzso we can make reasonable estimates of how sequence variation among the zzso clone zzso affects their binding of some zzso for other zzso our current knowledge of zzso structure is too limited to allow such zzso These results indicate that small variations in primary zzso zzso acid sequence can profoundly affect recognition of this zzso by all five groups of defined zzso zzso zzso
