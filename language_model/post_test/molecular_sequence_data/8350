We previously reported that the expression of the rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso gene is markedly increased by zzso zzso In this paper, we have used transient zzso zzso with reporter plasmids expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso linked to zzso zzso regions of the zzso gene promoter, to identify zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso analysis localized an zzso element zzso at position zzso with one zzso on the first base compared with the consensus zzso This element zzso zzso responsiveness to zzso reporter linked to both the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso promoter and the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, using a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter encompassing the zzso and the zzso DNA binding domain obtained from a bacterial expression system, zzso I zzso experiments demonstrated a specific protection covering 20 zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso Based on these studies, we believe that this zzso zzso identified in the zzso gene promoter, may be a major zzso element involved in the regulation of the gene by zzso
