Recently the zzso cycle, involving the zzso of membrane zzso by an activated zzso to generate zzso has emerged as a key zzso in cell differentiation and zzso in zzso and other cell zzso Here we investigate a role for this zzso in the zzso of zzso human zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso levels of zzso increased considerably zzso and specifically zzso with other zzso as cells entered the zzso zzso Investigation of the mechanism of increased zzso led to the discovery that neutral zzso activity is elevated 8-10 fold in zzso zzso There were no changes in zzso activity or zzso levels as zzso entered zzso following serum withdrawal or contact zzso Thus, the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso is due to zzso and supports the hypotheses that zzso represents a distinct program of cell development that can be differentiated from zzso Additional studies disclosed the ability of zzso to induce a zzso zzso Thus, when zzso zzso (15 zzso was administered to young zzso zzso it produced zzso levels comparable to those observed in zzso cells (as determined by zzso labeling zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited the growth of young zzso and induced a zzso zzso by its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis and zzso These zzso of zzso also induced zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso in young zzso thus zzso basic zzso and molecular changes of zzso zzso and zzso may thus be implicated as zzso of cellular zzso
