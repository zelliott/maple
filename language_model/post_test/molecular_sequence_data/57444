The solution structure of zzso I, which was isolated from membrane acid extracts of the zzso from the Japanese zzso crab zzso zzso was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and distance geometry zzso zzso I takes an zzso zzso structure with a zzso zzso Recently, among more than 20 synthetic peptides associated with zzso and its zzso zzso we found that a novel compound, which we designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited the human zzso virus zzso zzso effect and viral zzso zzso The solution structure of zzso was investigated using zzso and its secondary structure was confirmed to be similar to that of zzso zzso The zzso zzso structure and the several zzso side chains on the plane of the zzso of zzso are thought to be associated with the expression of zzso zzso
