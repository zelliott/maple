A novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso was isolated from a sea zzso zzso zzso collected from the South China zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to grow in the presence of zzso % zzso total zzso and at pH zzso and zzso degrees zzso optimum growth was observed with zzso % zzso total zzso and at pH zzso and zzso degrees zzso The major zzso acid constituents of the cell wall were zzso zzso and zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The respiratory zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the polar lipids were zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso A zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain zzso zzso should be assigned to the zzso zzso The sequence similarities between the novel isolate and the type strains of recognized zzso species were in the range zzso zzso The results of the zzso analysis, combined with zzso zzso data, zzso characteristics and zzso information, support the view that strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso AA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
