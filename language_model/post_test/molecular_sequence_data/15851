We constructed a synthetic zzso coli expression system in which various promoter elements can be changed zzso In this study we investigated the effect of a number of portable zzso regions zzso zzso on the synthesis of two modified zzso human growth hormones zzso The production of these modified zzso was measured during exponential growth and after the bacteria had reached stationary zzso The results show that the optimal distance between the zzso region zzso and the zzso start zzso is approximately 11 zzso However, the zzso sequence in this region also influences expression: 6-10 zzso result in comparable expression levels despite the varying zzso Two overlapping zzso regions reduce expression of the growth hormones zzso whereas two potential zzso start zzso do not affect zzso Having a zzso region partly or totally complementary to the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso does not alter translation zzso zzso of the delta G values for the association between the zzso zzso and the zzso region suggests that these are not indicators of expression zzso
