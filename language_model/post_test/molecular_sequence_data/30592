The factor zzso zzso of zzso using factor H as a zzso was completely inhibited by zzso zzso when factor I and zzso were incubated with zzso before the addition of factor zzso zzso although to a lesser degree, was observed when factor H was present during zzso No zzso in factor I activity was seen when factor I and H were incubated with zzso either alone or zzso It was also demonstrated that the zzso zzso of factor I bound zzso zzso when factor I and zzso together were exposed to zzso These observations suggest that factor I interacts with zzso in a manner that exposes its zzso site to zzso an interaction that is independent of factor zzso The zzso effect by zzso on factor I led us to further investigate the factor I zzso products of zzso zzso as previous reports were ambiguous as to whether zzso occurs in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso bound to activated zzso zzso zzso in the presence of factor H at low pH and zzso strength and in serum by complement zzso produced zzso fragments with apparent molecular mass of 41 and 43 zzso These fragments were shown to have three different zzso and two different zzso zzso The major fragments had zzso sequences starting with zzso as shown by sequence zzso zzso of fragments extending beyond this point were also found, shown by Western zzso analysis using a panel of zzso previously shown to bind to zzso exposed within a region of zzso spanning zzso zzso to zzso as well as a shorter zzso starting with zzso When zzso of zzso is carried out in the presence of zzso the factor I level necessary for zzso is elevated and may explain how the first two zzso producing zzso but not the following giving zzso can zzso The finding of several factor I zzso sites in the zzso region of zzso demonstrates that factor I has a broad zzso mainly for zzso zzso It has also been shown to digest a zzso bond exposed in zzso zzso
