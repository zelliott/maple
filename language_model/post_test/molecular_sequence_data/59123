zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso reaction converting zzso I or III to zzso I or zzso The zzso protein has been zzso from several sources and its gene has been cloned from many zzso In spite of this, little is known about the active zzso of the zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso and zzso zzso are important for zzso zzso We employed the zzso method of zzso zzso to convert each of the six zzso in human zzso to zzso and each of the three zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli, partially zzso and their kinetic properties compared to zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso retained zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, indicating that no single zzso is absolutely critical for the integrity of the zzso zzso The three zzso zzso also retained significant zzso activity and one, zzso displayed unique zzso The zzso zzso resulted in an zzso with high residual activity but zzso of intermediate reaction products of the I zzso series was markedly zzso The zzso at zzso 339 is likely important in zzso zzso zzso
