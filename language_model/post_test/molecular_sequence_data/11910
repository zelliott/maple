Eastern zzso encephalitis zzso virus is a zzso zzso that can produce a severe and often fatal acute encephalitis in humans, with significant zzso zzso in zzso Due to the serious nature of the disease, an zzso zzso zzso vaccine zzso is available to individuals at risk for zzso Both zzso and recent molecular analyses of zzso viruses have demonstrated marked differences between the two zzso varieties of zzso virus, designated North American zzso and South American zzso In view of these findings, we have examined the zzso of zzso from three individuals zzso with the zzso zzso derived from an zzso zzso with field strains of zzso zzso zzso serum zzso from zzso reacted strongly in Western zzso zzso with both of the envelope zzso and zzso zzso of each zzso strain zzso while zzso with the zzso of zzso strains were substantially weaker and variable and dependent upon both the immune response of the zzso and the virus isolate zzso Most striking was the modest to virtual lack of zzso with the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso differences among the zzso of zzso viruses were not as pronounced in zzso zzso Most significantly, although human immune zzso displayed high zzso zzso against each of the zzso zzso zzso only negligible zzso zzso were obtained against zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso individuals would mount an effective zzso response against infection with zzso strains of zzso virus, but that further investigation is clearly warranted to fully assess the protective capability of the vaccine against infection with zzso zzso
