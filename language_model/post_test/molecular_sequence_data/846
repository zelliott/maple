zzso compensation in zzso zzso occurs by zzso of one X zzso in zzso zzso of that X zzso is initiated by zzso a large zzso zzso whose coating of the zzso extends in zzso from the X zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implicated as possible players for propagation of the zzso zzso but it has remained unclear whether they are essential zzso We previously identified a group of South American zzso in which zzso zzso ceased over 8 million years ago and have now determined that at least one species of these zzso zzso zzso still retains X zzso We have also isolated and analyzed the majority of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and a sister species retaining zzso activity, zzso zzso to determine if evolution in these sequences has left signatures that might suggest a critical role for zzso elements in zzso zzso zzso of rates of zzso evolution in the two species fails to support zzso involvement, although other explanations are zzso Similarly, comparison of known repeats and potential zzso secondary structures reveals no major differences with the exception of a new repeat in zzso zzso that has potential to form new secondary zzso
