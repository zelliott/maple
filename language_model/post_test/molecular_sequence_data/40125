The expression of zzso genes in zzso and other cells has become a powerful means for studying the function of zzso zzso We report here on the isolation and functional analysis of three zzso zzso zzso gene promoters and the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso labeling revealed that the zzso gene and one of the zzso had zzso zzso zzso the other two zzso genes were expressed by the zzso body wall zzso Comparative analysis shows that they all display many features typical of zzso and zzso promoters from other species, including zzso zzso box sequences and predicted general zzso factor binding sites (such as zzso zzso boxes and zzso zzso The ability of these zzso zzso sequences to drive expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso of each of the promoter sequences was found to produce reliably cellular expression of the reporter construct in both zzso and muscle zzso These results introduce reliable and effective methods to selectively express genes in individual cells of the zzso in zzso during embryonic zzso
