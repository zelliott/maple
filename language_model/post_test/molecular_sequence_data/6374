A stable, zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso totally defective in zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso 3 and screened for zzso colonies following incubation with zzso In contrast to the parental strain which became serum resistant on incubation with zzso or blood cell zzso the zzso zzso remained serum zzso French press extracts of strain zzso zzso zzso zzso but corresponding extracts of the zzso were zzso Five zzso components were detected by zzso in the parental zzso Five components of the same Mr were also found in the zzso Three identical components were detected by Western zzso using zzso zzso which recognizes the Gal beta zzso groups in the zzso zzso components of zzso which can be zzso The zzso zzso is therefore deficient in the zzso that is essential for both zzso zzso and conversion of zzso zzso to serum resistance by either zzso or blood cell zzso No evidence was obtained for an zzso zzso zzso by blood cell extracts that is independent of zzso
