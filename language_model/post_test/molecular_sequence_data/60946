The zzso clone zzso a novel zzso of protein zzso zzso termed zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso had high sequence zzso with zzso originally isolated zzso especially in the repeats of charged zzso zzso region with zzso like sequences zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain, and in approximately 130 zzso acid stretch zzso zzso located between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso However, the zzso acid sequence of zzso differed from that of zzso in the region immediately zzso to the zzso domain, which contained two distinct zzso sequences consistent with the class II consensus zzso zzso for binding to zzso zzso Distribution of zzso differed from that of zzso in the following two zzso zzso Northern zzso indicated that zzso zzso could not be detected in human adult zzso but was expressed abundantly in human cancer cell zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso localized in nucleus and zzso zzso apparatus, and was almost absent in zzso region in zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells displayed zzso and zzso zzso activity, but was found to be significantly less responsive to zzso acid than zzso The identification of this novel zzso underscores the diversity of zzso signaling zzso
