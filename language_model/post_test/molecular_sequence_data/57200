The mechanisms involved in regulating the selective expression of protein zzso C zzso zzso are poorly zzso Two human B zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso exhibited differential expression of the two alternatively spliced products of the zzso beta zzso zzso beta I and beta zzso The zzso cell line expressed zzso more zzso beta II protein than the zzso cell line, whereas the zzso cell line expressed zzso more zzso beta I zzso This differential expression was found to be regulated at the zzso zzso zzso of zzso beta I and beta II messages in zzso zzso and total cellular zzso revealed that selective zzso was not zzso The messages for zzso beta I and beta II had comparable zzso in both cell lines, ruling out differential message zzso In addition, similar ratios of zzso beta I and beta II messages in zzso and nuclear zzso suggested that differential zzso transport was not zzso In the zzso cell line, the predominance of mature zzso beta II message as well as that of a larger message spliced to zzso beta II provided evidence that the differential expression of zzso beta II was regulated at the level of zzso zzso In the zzso cell line, equal amounts of mature zzso beta I and beta II message and the absence of the larger message suggested that the zzso of the zzso beta gene product can be regulated to produce altered ratios of zzso beta I and beta zzso zzso of these studies on the differential expression of zzso zzso and their roles in biology are zzso
