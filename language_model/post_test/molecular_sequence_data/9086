It has been well known that the bacteria of the zzso zzso in addition to the beneficial zzso activity, are able to improve plant growth by a number of direct and indirect zzso To identify this potential in indigenous zzso the efficiency of 17 zzso of zzso from the zzso of wheat and barley plants cultivated in zzso and/or zzso zzso in Iran were evaluated for their ability to zzso zzso and organic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso First, they were zzso characterized and one isolate zzso was identified by zzso zzso zzso Eight zzso were designated as zzso zzso and the remaining zzso were identified as zzso zzso All zzso zzso the organic and zzso zzso compounds and effectively produced zzso Fifteen zzso produced zzso but only one isolate showed zzso activity which is being reported for the first time in relation to zzso None of the 17 zzso was capable of producing zzso or zzso However, zzso chain reaction amplification of the zzso coding zzso by the use of the zzso zzso indicated that not all contain the zzso zzso The standard screening methods with slight zzso especially in the case of zzso zzso were zzso The results showed that the use of specific screening methods, modified according to bacterial nutritional requirements, are the efficient methods for precise evaluation of the plant growth promoting zzso zzso
