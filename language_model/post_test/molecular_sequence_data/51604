The zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso arises through an zzso interaction in which cells of the vegetal zzso of the zzso act on zzso equatorial and animal pole zzso Three classes of zzso zzso zzso that might be responsible for this interaction in zzso have been zzso These are members of the transforming growth factor type beta zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso Among the most potent zzso are the zzso members of the zzso family, but zzso for zzso A and B is not zzso in the zzso zzso until zzso and late zzso zzso respectively, and this is probably too late for the molecules to act as natural zzso In this paper, we use the zzso chain reaction to clone additional members of the zzso family that might possess zzso zzso We show that transcripts zzso zzso bone zzso protein 4 zzso are zzso in the zzso egg, and that injection of zzso zzso into the animal zzso of zzso eggs causes animal caps isolated from the resulting zzso to express zzso zzso Surprisingly, however, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the action of zzso is zzso over that of zzso In this respect, zzso differs from basic zzso another zzso zzso where simultaneous treatment with zzso and zzso results in zzso zzso The dominance of zzso over zzso may account for the ability of injected zzso zzso to zzso whole zzso zzso It is interesting, however, that zzso formation in such zzso can occur perfectly zzso This contrasts with zzso zzso by zzso and suggests that zzso zzso occurs after the onset of zzso
