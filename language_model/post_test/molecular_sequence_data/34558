Rapid blight is a newly described disease on turf zzso primarily found on golf courses using zzso water for irrigation zzso On the basis of shared zzso zzso it has been proposed that the rapid blight pathogen belongs to a zzso of zzso zzso which had been known to cause disease of marine plants zzso We have collected 10 zzso from four species of turf grass in five states and zzso portions of the zzso zzso zzso gene from each to provide a definitive zzso placement for rapid blight zzso We also included sequences from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several zzso zzso of zzso We found that rapid blight zzso indeed are placed firmly within the zzso zzso and that they lack zzso genetic diversity in the zzso zzso zzso We propose that the rapid blight pathogens share a recent common zzso and might have originated from a single, infected zzso
