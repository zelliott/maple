The accurate placement of side chains in zzso protein modeling and design involves the searching of vast numbers of zzso zzso 

We have applied the information contained within structurally aligned zzso families, in the form of zzso zzso angle conservation rules, to the problem of the comparative zzso This allows the accurate borrowing of entire zzso zzso and/or the restriction to high probability zzso zzso The application of these rules consistently reduces the number of zzso combinations that need to be searched to trivial values and also reduces the overall zzso root mean square zzso zzso of the final zzso The approach is complementary to current zzso placement zzso that use the decomposition of interacting clusters to increase the speed of the placement zzso
