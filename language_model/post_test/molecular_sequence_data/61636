The zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso regulate responses to zzso zzso Previous studies identified a zzso domain in the zzso zzso zzso and the sequence is zzso in the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso and zzso Here we use genetic analysis to assess the role of this domain in zzso zzso of zzso at zzso that are important for zzso binding of zzso zzso abolished zzso binding in zzso and caused diverse zzso in zzso Various zzso processes were zzso including zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso invasive growth, the zzso zzso function of zzso and zzso of the carbon zzso promoter zzso Moreover, the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso even in the absence of zzso as determined by analysis of a zzso strain lacking zzso zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso domain of zzso positively affects zzso zzso function by a mechanism that is independent of zzso zzso
