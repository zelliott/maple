Central nervous system zzso zzso cells zzso zzso in the embryonic neural tube and give rise to zzso and zzso zzso A characteristic feature of the zzso zzso cells is expression of the intermediate filament zzso and it was previously shown that the rat zzso second zzso functions as an zzso directing gene expression to zzso zzso zzso In this report we characterize the zzso zzso in further zzso Cloning and sequence analysis of the rat and human zzso second zzso revealed local zzso of high sequence similarity in the 3' portion of the zzso zzso mice were generated with the most zzso zzso zzso in the 3' portion of the zzso or with the complete, zzso zzso human second zzso coupled to the reporter gene zzso The two zzso gave a very similar zzso expression pattern, indicating that the important control elements reside in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed starting in embryonic day zzso neural plate, and at zzso zzso zzso cells throughout the neural tube expressed zzso At zzso zzso expression was more restricted and confined to zzso regions in the neural zzso An interesting difference, compared to the rat zzso second zzso was that the human zzso at zzso zzso zzso expression also in early zzso neural crest cells, which is a site of zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, these data show that a relatively short, zzso zzso region is sufficient to control gene expression in zzso zzso cells, but that the same region differs between zzso and primates in its capacity to control expression in neural crest zzso
