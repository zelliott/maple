The effect of a zzso transition zzso at the translation initiation zzso of the human vitamin D zzso zzso gene on the biological function of the zzso protein was zzso Of 239 Japanese women volunteers subjected to zzso analysis for this zzso 32 zzso were zzso zzso (the M zzso is zzso at the putative translation start zzso 75 zzso were zzso zzso (the m zzso is zzso at the putative translation start zzso and 132 zzso were zzso zzso The bone mineral density zzso in the zzso spine zzso was determined for 110 healthy zzso women from the volunteers and was shown to be zzso greater zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso than for zzso zzso zzso of the proteins by the M and m zzso from the cloned zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso cells revealed them to have a size of 50 and zzso zzso respectively, as determined by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso This size difference is consistent with initiation of translation of the M zzso protein from an zzso zzso located at zzso zzso to zzso in the conventional open reading zzso The extent of vitamin zzso zzso zzso of a reporter construct under the control of a vitamin D response element in zzso zzso cells was approximately zzso greater for the m type zzso than for the M type zzso These results suggest that the zzso at the translation start site of the zzso gene may zzso zzso in zzso Japanese zzso
