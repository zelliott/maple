An zzso role has been proposed for human zzso zzso in skin zzso within the zzso patient zzso To examine this possibility, we have focused on an zzso type that, to date, has been identified only in the zzso zzso of zzso transplant recipients despite a high degree of sequence zzso with other zzso commonly found in warts in the general zzso We report that the zzso region of this virus, zzso type 77, contains a consensus binding site for the zzso zzso protein zzso and we show by zzso analysis that this sequence does indeed bind zzso Furthermore, using reporter gene zzso we demonstrate that zzso promoter activity is zzso by zzso radiation and that this response is zzso through the zzso binding zzso This is the first report of a zzso positive response element within a viral zzso Our results suggest a possible novel mechanism by which specific types of zzso might act as zzso with zzso radiation in zzso zzso
