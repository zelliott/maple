zzso growth factor 1 zzso or zzso is the zzso member of the zzso growth factors which are capable of zzso in zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso cancer, wound repair and inflammatory zzso zzso As part of an effort to understand the role of zzso in the zzso of inflammation and cancer, we have undertaken steps to isolate and characterize the mouse zzso zzso Southern zzso and sequence analysis displayed considerable conservation within the coding and upstream untranslated regions of zzso in human, zzso zzso rat and zzso By using zzso derived from the zzso zzso of a rat zzso zzso zzso a zzso product was amplified from mouse zzso DNA via zzso zzso analysis of this zzso showed that there was zzso similarity with the corresponding region of the rat zzso zzso zzso designed from this zzso and the zzso coding region were used to isolate multiple overlapping zzso clones spanning the entire mouse zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sequence upstream from this novel zzso zzso did not reveal typical zzso zzso zzso It appears that the occurrence of multiple untranslated zzso for zzso is a highly zzso theme for this gene across zzso
