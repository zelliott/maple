zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the first peptides with delta zzso zzso activity lacking zzso considered essential for zzso activity based on the zzso zzso sequence zzso of zzso skin zzso zzso were then designed to restrain the zzso flexibility of zzso by the substitution of zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso peptides were zzso by solid phase and solution methods using zzso technology or condensing zzso or zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso by zzso and characteristics determined by zzso zzso melting point, zzso and zzso acid zzso 

zzso had high affinity zzso delta zzso zzso zzso and extraordinary selectivity zzso zzso delta zzso zzso zzso had a Ki delta zzso zzso zzso and delta selectivity zzso zzso zzso and selectivity increased zzso and zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso and zzso fitted zzso zzso binding models zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso and zzso best fitted zzso models zzso zzso zzso F zzso p zzso zzso zzso increased zzso affinity by zzso to zzso and acted zzso with zzso to reverse selectivity zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with mouse zzso zzso and lacked zzso zzso activity zzso 10 zzso in guinea-pig zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso receptors in the 1 to zzso 20 zzso zzso 

zzso zzso peptides represent a highly potent class of zzso zzso zzso with greater potency than the zzso delta zzso zzso and have potential application as clinical and therapeutic zzso
