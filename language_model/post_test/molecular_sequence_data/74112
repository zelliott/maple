zzso zzso 2 zzso is the major zzso protein that recruits zzso to sites of inflammation and increased expression of zzso is associated with numerous inflammatory diseases including human zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in the zzso promoter has been associated with increased expression of zzso as well as zzso of zzso however, the molecular mechanism of regulation is zzso We propose a molecular model for zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso which are major producers of zzso in the zzso The zzso G zzso creates a zzso site for the zzso regulator zzso which along with binding partner zzso zzso binds the zzso G zzso zzso promoters harboring the G zzso under zzso conditions exhibit a lower zzso activity compared to the ancestral A zzso Upon zzso beta zzso zzso complexes maintain the ability to bind zzso G zzso yet zzso levels from promoters that harbor the A or G zzso are equally zzso suggesting that the zzso region does not influence zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso promoters that harbor the zzso G zzso undergo a higher fold induction and by extension, individuals zzso for zzso G would be expected to exhibit zzso zzso zzso during periods of zzso
