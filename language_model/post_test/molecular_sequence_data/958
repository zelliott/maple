To identify novel regulators of zzso the most abundant zzso in brain, we used zzso zzso screening with zzso active zzso as bait and identified a new regulator of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso as a novel human member of the zzso (or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso motif and a zzso zzso domain with highest zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was strongly expressed as multiple species in zzso and other brain zzso The interactions between zzso and active forms of zzso zzso zzso or zzso but not zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso in zzso pull-down zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acted as a zzso protein zzso on free zzso and zzso under zzso conditions, and on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso Unlike zzso which is highly selective for zzso zzso exhibited limited selectivity for zzso among zzso zzso All zzso family members reduced zzso zzso of zzso formation and abolished zzso hormone zzso calcium zzso zzso is a new zzso member that zzso zzso zzso signaling via zzso zzso and zzso over zzso to enhance zzso signaling and inhibit calcium zzso zzso observed between in zzso GAP zzso and zzso signaling suggest additional zzso of the zzso specificity of zzso GAP effects that could include receptors and zzso
