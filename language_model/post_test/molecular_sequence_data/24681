Once thought to be zzso zzso it is now known that natural killer zzso cells possess an elaborate array of receptors that regulate zzso zzso and zzso functions upon interaction with target cell zzso class I zzso These zzso known as killer cell zzso receptors zzso in humans, and zzso receptors in the zzso have become the focus of intense study in an effort to discern the underlying biology of these large zzso zzso These zzso families include both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a target expressing zzso zzso leads to zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso poorly defined zzso zzso zzso activated during engagement mediate the zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso The zzso zzso serve as efficient recruitment points for the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso critical for cellular zzso In contrast, some zzso and zzso lack the zzso and possess a charged zzso in their zzso zzso that mediates interaction with the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso uses its zzso zzso zzso zzso motif zzso to mediate cellular zzso zzso of a zzso coupled zzso or zzso results in zzso of zzso and other key zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso C, and zzso zzso zzso then leads to the zzso cascade and ultimately to enhanced zzso and production of zzso and zzso Although the context in which zzso and zzso zzso and zzso function is not yet known, the dissection of the zzso and zzso signal zzso pathways should shed light on their method of integration into the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Ultimately, this work will lead to concrete understanding of the zzso of these seemingly zzso zzso zzso
