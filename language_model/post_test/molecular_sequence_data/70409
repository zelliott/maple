The sequence of the zzso zzso zzso excluding the zzso tail, of the citrus zzso leaf virus zzso zzso was determined and compared with that of the apple stem zzso virus zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso region of zzso contains two overlapping open reading frames zzso and a zzso zzso region of 142 zzso The long, incomplete zzso ends at zzso zzso zzso and encodes a protein with at least zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso This protein contains the zzso motif associated with the zzso zzso zzso in a different frame within zzso starts at zzso zzso zzso and stops at zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were found among the zzso protein of zzso the zzso protein of apple zzso leaf spot zzso the zzso protein of potato virus T and the gene 1 products of zzso The arrangement of zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso is in perfect agreement with that of the zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso zzso excluding the zzso tail, of the zzso zzso shows zzso identity to that of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid sequences zzso by zzso and zzso of zzso with the corresponding regions of zzso are zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a zzso closely related to zzso
