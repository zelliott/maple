A family of four satellite zzso has been characterized in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso All share zzso sites, a similar zzso length of about 160 base pairs zzso and the related zzso motifs zzso and zzso repeated six to 15 times within the repetitive zzso The motif zzso is common to all members of the satellite zzso It is present in three of them in both zzso zzso within zzso DNA zzso The zzso zzso appears to be the main building element of one of the satellites forming a prominent zzso structure in conjunction with the zzso zzso The former has been also found in perfect tandem repeats in a junction region adjacent to the proper satellite zzso Southern analysis has revealed that zzso and/or related sequences are abundant and widely distributed in the zzso zzso zzso The distribution observed is consistent with the zzso of the scattering of short sequence motifs throughout the zzso and the spread of longer DNA zzso with zzso formation of satellite zzso zzso Both kinds of zzso may have contributed to the observed complex arrangement of the zzso satellite DNA family in zzso
