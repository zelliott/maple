Three wastewater treatment plants in South Africa were investigated to understand the zzso and distribution of zzso zzso using real-time zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed zzso to zzso zzso of South African clones to zzso zzso reported in zzso The standard zzso for zzso showed zzso values greater than zzso accurate for zzso The relative occurrence of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene copies in the three wastewater treatment plants was in the range zzso to zzso zzso zzso copies increased when the environmental temperature zzso or zzso degrees zzso and zzso zzso ratio was zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso copies could be positively correlated to the sludge volume index at low zzso At higher temperature, there was a rapid reduction in zzso zzso population irrespective of other favorable factors, indicating the strong influence of temperature on zzso zzso zzso has potential applications in wastewater treatment plants to monitor sudden shift in the microbial population and assessing the plants zzso
