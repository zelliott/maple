zzso zzso an zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso in zzso coli, zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso zzso This zzso has been found to have broad zzso zzso including the zzso of zzso zzso where the zzso functional group at the zzso has been replaced by an zzso or by a zzso zzso Previous pH profile studies zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and chemical modification studies have suggested the involvement of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso activity of the zzso With the assistance of sequence zzso several potential zzso acids have been targeted for zzso zzso zzso studies have confirmed a role for zzso in the binding of the zzso group of zzso and the involvement of two zzso at the zzso binding zzso zzso at these sites have led to the decoupling of the zzso activity from an inherent zzso activity in the zzso and suggest the presence of independent zzso for the binding of each zzso in zzso zzso
