We characterized the zzso zzso I zzso gene in a patient with zzso progressive zzso with marked zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence analysis revealed a C to A zzso which predicts a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso this base change, occurring in the middle of zzso 5, resulted in a production of the novel transcript lacking zzso 5 and a part of zzso zzso Three different transcripts of the zzso zzso previously reported in the human liver, were also present in the peripheral zzso from the patient and zzso zzso comparison of the zzso zzso and the zzso one implied that differential zzso regulates the zzso zzso activity, leading to the clinical variations in zzso The patient showed a unique clinical zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso system is more affected than previously thought in zzso
