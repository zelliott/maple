A second distinct family of zzso zzso zzso in addition to the classical zzso (or zzso zzso family, has recently been zzso zzso interest in this gene family is zzso by the fact that the zzso zzso and zzso genes have been recognized as the disease genes zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso syndrome, zzso We report the expansion of the zzso gene family by characterizing three novel zzso members, named zzso zzso and zzso on zzso 8, 6, and 1, zzso The zzso proteins are structurally very similar at the zzso acid level to the previous family members and show zzso expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso More detailed characterization by zzso and/or in zzso zzso localized zzso to zzso segments of zzso zzso to developing zzso and zzso to the zzso side of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso proteins in zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso and zzso transport activity, suggesting that they zzso functional zzso zzso The functional characterization of the novel zzso members may provide new insights to zzso transport physiology in different parts of zzso
