We analyzed the third zzso region zzso of the zzso heavy chain zzso gene in five patients with zzso zzso pneumonia zzso through a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and sequencing zzso By sequencing analysis of the zzso products, zzso zzso could be divided into two groups: a zzso type and a minor zzso zzso Because of their high zzso minor zzso clones seemed to be zzso clones hidden in normally zzso zzso zzso zzso only the zzso type might have represented true zzso zzso of the zzso products from zzso biopsy and zzso lung biopsy zzso specimens obtained 8 zzso later in one patient with minor zzso type zzso confirmed this zzso In true zzso six of 20 zzso clones showed 67 to zzso zzso with zzso clones derived from fetal zzso In three of these six zzso the zzso zzso lengths were very short, whereas four clones showed a high zzso with zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso immature B cells zzso by zzso might play some role in the zzso of true zzso
