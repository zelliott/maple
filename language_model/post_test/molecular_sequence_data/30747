A chemically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the consensus sequence at the branch point in zzso undergoing zzso zzso was used as a zzso to elicit zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso structurally related zzso indicated that the zzso are highly specific for the branch structure and have some specificity for the zzso sequence at the branch point, but have essentially none for a variety of other zzso or zzso zzso or for the linear zzso zzso zzso of these zzso by binding to zzso zzso linked to zzso followed by zzso attachment of the zzso zzso to protein zzso has provided an zzso that zzso retains zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso released from zzso during in zzso zzso
