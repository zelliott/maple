Here, we report the identification of a novel zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with two zzso zzso zzso present in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso domain has been revealed to be implicated in zzso disease and zzso hearing zzso The presence of zzso domain in zzso zzso hinge zzso of long tail fiber might reflect the horizontal gene transfer from zzso And we proposed that zzso domain might function as important structural element in zzso zzso
