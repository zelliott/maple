The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso binding protein which zzso in zzso and zzso gene induction in response to zzso which occur in the plant wound zzso The region downstream of the zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned and zzso for zzso and expression zzso Three open reading frames transcribed in the same direction as zzso were zzso The first two, together with zzso zzso putative proteins of a zzso binding zzso sugar zzso system, or zzso zzso binding zzso zzso The third open reading frame encodes a protein of unknown zzso The deduced zzso gene products are related on the zzso acid level to bacterial sugar zzso and probably function in zzso and zzso zzso We have named these genes zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso or zzso do not affect zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso growth on 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso toward zzso zzso zzso or zzso
