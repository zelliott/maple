The identification of a gene zzso zzso a nuclear protein and an intrinsic zzso protein further emphasizes the close and presumably zzso relationship between the cell nucleus and the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso library with an zzso to a zzso protein and zzso with the insert of an initial clone released two complete zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso coding for proteins with notable zzso The zzso sections of zzso A zzso zzso acid zzso molecular mass zzso zzso and of zzso B zzso zzso acid zzso molecular mass zzso zzso are identical over 272 zzso acid zzso The zzso section of the larger protein comprises additional 175 zzso acid zzso including nuclear location zzso The zzso zzso zzso A and B derive from a single zzso zzso DNA as template and primer pairs complementary to the sequence which is identical in zzso A and B zzso results in amplification of only one DNA zzso Moreover, one zzso of the zzso sequence and the zzso zzso zzso sequence include a G which is deleted in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the two zzso are the products of either alternative zzso or alternative zzso in combination with zzso zzso The zzso expressed zzso protein consisting of zzso A and the green fluorescent protein from zzso zzso accumulates in zzso while the corresponding fusion protein with the zzso B sequence is transported into zzso
