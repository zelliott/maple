The diversity and abundance of the zzso zzso a newly described zzso zzso class which is a sister group to the zzso was assessed in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea by culture isolation, molecular biology techniques, and zzso zzso Eight strains of zzso were isolated in culture from different zzso and zzso zzso The corresponding small zzso zzso zzso gene sequences allowed us to design two zzso specific for the zzso These zzso have been used in natural samples zzso to selectively amplify and detect zzso sequences and zzso to zzso the relative abundance of zzso within the zzso zzso zzso available to date indicate that the class zzso comprises at least three different zzso two corresponding to the previously described species zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the third one corresponding to a subspecies of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene from natural samples with universal zzso and zzso using a zzso probe followed by a zzso probe allowed us to estimate the contribution of the zzso to the zzso DNA in both Pacific and Mediterranean waters to be lower than zzso Similarly, zzso liquid zzso analyses of zzso the major zzso present in zzso indicated that less than zzso of the total zzso a in the zzso fraction in the equatorial Pacific was due to zzso zzso although strains of zzso have been isolated from samples collected at several stations, this new class seems to have been a minor component of the natural zzso populations in the zzso investigated, at least during the periods zzso
