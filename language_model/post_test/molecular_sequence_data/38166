A novel zzso zzso termed zzso was identified by screening both human and mouse zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso There are several zzso regions rich in zzso acid in the zzso The zzso by zzso search, shows similarities to zzso and zzso zzso repeat proteins localized to the nucleus and involved in the regulation of protein zzso In zzso the zzso is first detected at about Day 14 zzso presumably when zzso zzso are first zzso In zzso zzso confirmed the expression of the zzso zzso at this stage of zzso zzso analysis revealed that the protein is most abundant in the zzso of zzso and zzso cells, corresponding to late zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is markedly reduced in secondary zzso suggesting a functional association of zzso with zzso An zzso zzso probe did not bind to mouse zzso zzso in a dot zzso zzso
