We identified five different putative zzso gene cluster types, which are responsible for the synthesis of the core zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence that the genes zzso by this cluster are involved in core zzso zzso came from analysis of the recently released zzso El zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence and sodium zzso zzso gel zzso analysis of zzso El zzso zzso strains defective in three genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso of 38 different zzso zzso strains by Southern zzso zzso and sequencing analyses showed that the zzso El zzso zzso gene cluster type is prevalent among clinical zzso of different zzso associated with zzso and environmental zzso zzso In contrast, we found differences in the zzso gene contents of 19 unrelated zzso zzso environmental and human zzso not associated with zzso These strains contained four new zzso gene cluster types that differ from each other in distinct gene zzso providing evidence for horizontal transfer of zzso genes and for limited structural diversity of the core zzso among zzso zzso zzso Our results show genetic diversity in the core zzso zzso gene cluster and predominance of the type 1 zzso gene locus in strains associated with clinical zzso suggesting that a specific core zzso structure could contribute to zzso zzso zzso
