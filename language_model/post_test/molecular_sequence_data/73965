In a previous publication describing the geographic distribution of zzso associated with cactus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified as strains of zzso zzso van der Walt et van zzso on the basis of zzso and certain zzso zzso Here we show by using DNA zzso and additional zzso properties that these strains were misidentified and that they represent a minimum of three separate species that can be differentiated from zzso zzso and from each other by zzso of zzso or zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso of zzso as a sole nitrogen source, vitamin zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso One of the new species is zzso and zzso and its zzso represents the zzso zzso We describe zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso relationship of zzso zzso with other members of the zzso zzso and its zzso the zzso zzso was estimated from zzso DNA zzso sequence zzso The type strain, a zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso CBS zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The complementary mating type is zzso zzso zzso CBS zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
