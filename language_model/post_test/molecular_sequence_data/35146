In the zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso sensor domain zzso are zzso to the zzso zzso domain zzso leading to its zzso activity against zzso zzso The zzso between both zzso is proposed to be crucial for the zzso zzso With a combined approach of zzso zzso on zzso zzso and molecular dynamics simulations of a zzso model embedded in a zzso zzso we analyzed how zzso changes in the zzso mediate the interaction between the CD and the activated zzso In this way, we identified specific zzso in the zzso that interact with zzso zzso acids in one of the three zzso forming the active site of the zzso named zzso zzso With our results, we shed light into the early steps of the zzso process between the zzso and the CD, which are based on fine-tuned zzso and zzso interactions between the zzso the membrane and the zzso
