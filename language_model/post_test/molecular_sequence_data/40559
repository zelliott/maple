The complement system of fish is generally as complex as in zzso and in addition zzso fish often possess several genes zzso different zzso of a given complement zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso of both the classical zzso and alternative zzso zzso zzso have been characterized in the rainbow trout but so far no molecules of the zzso zzso have been zzso Based on the generally accepted idea of complement evolution, which predicts that the alternative zzso predates the two other zzso and that the zzso zzso developed before the classical, we set out to characterize members of the zzso zzso in zzso We identified and characterized three zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a bona fide zzso zzso By means of zzso and zzso using zzso zzso we found that they were zzso in the zzso the anterior zzso and the zzso In the liver, we saw zzso with zzso zzso associated zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso 2 and 3 zzso were also found in the vascular system of the rainbow zzso By means of gel size exclusion zzso of serum we found that zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison and zzso studies showed that the zzso were more related with zzso than any other zzso and that two previously characterized trout zzso designated zzso and zzso should be reconsidered as zzso zzso
