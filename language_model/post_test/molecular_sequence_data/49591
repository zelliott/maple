Among the various zzso procedures that have been studied as alternatives to traditional fresh nerve zzso for the repair of severed peripheral nerves, zzso graft zzso have recently been devised and successfully zzso In the present study, the early presence, origin, and proliferation activity of zzso cells zzso along this particular type of biological graft zzso have been investigated, using zzso directed against zzso zzso acid protein zzso a protein that is specifically expressed in zzso cells, and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso a protein that is expressed by cells during DNA zzso zzso showed that the zzso graft was progressively invaded by a number of zzso zzso many of which were also found to be zzso for zzso thus demonstrating that their proliferation continues to occur inside the zzso Among the molecules that could be involved in the stimulation of zzso proliferation is zzso zzso that mediates its effects by binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the authors report on the zzso analysis for zzso and zzso zzso showing an overall increase in the content of these transcripts inside the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso graft zzso constitutes an environment favorable to zzso zzso proliferation during the early zzso zzso
