zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso bind to distinct but zzso coupled zzso sites on zzso sodium channels and cause persistent channel zzso zzso presumably binds in the inner zzso whereas zzso are predicted to bind at the zzso cavity formed by the short zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduces sodium currents and zzso the action of zzso on zzso sodium channels, suggesting that it also binds inside the zzso However, a zzso zzso zzso in zzso which does not face the zzso is essential for the activity of zzso 502 but not for zzso In this study, we found that three additional zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso (the latter two are also zzso and three zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso are all critical for zzso 502 action on zzso sodium zzso Using these data as constraints, we constructed a zzso 502 binding model in which zzso 502 wraps around zzso probably making direct contacts with all of the above zzso on the opposite faces of the zzso zzso except for the putative gating hinge zzso zzso 502 and its inactive analog zzso 1855 antagonize the action of zzso The antagonism was eliminated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Our analysis revealed a unique mode of action of zzso zzso its zzso site overlapping with those of both zzso and zzso
