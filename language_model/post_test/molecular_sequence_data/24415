A zzso inhibitor that is highly zzso with bovine pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso was zzso along with zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of this inhibitor zzso and the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso this protein were determined by protein chemistry and gene zzso zzso contains 68 zzso acid zzso and has a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso has 31 zzso acid zzso that are identical with zzso zzso including 6 zzso and 5 aromatic zzso acid zzso The active site zzso zzso in zzso is replaced by an zzso zzso in zzso zzso is an effective inhibitor of zzso and moderately zzso zzso but less zzso zzso or zzso zzso was expressed by zzso coli containing a zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso an expression yield of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso relationship of zzso and the other zzso zzso zzso was analyzed using most likelihood zzso zzso
