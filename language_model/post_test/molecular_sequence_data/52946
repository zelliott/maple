zzso is a zzso process that occurs in several zzso and is regulated by a large number of gene zzso An zzso transgenic mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated that results in abnormal zzso development, showing abnormal zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso We cloned the disrupted locus of zzso and identified a novel zzso zzso zzso which is specifically expressed in zzso and was disrupted in the transgenic zzso The zzso zzso screening method revealed that zzso protein strongly interacts with zzso containing zzso zzso suggesting that zzso protein functions as a regulatory factor in protein zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso locus is essential for the maintenance of zzso and that a gene expression disorder may be involved in male zzso
