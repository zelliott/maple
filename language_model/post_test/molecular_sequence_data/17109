A zzso protein zzso that comprises the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the naturally occurring inhibitor of bacterial zzso zzso has been constructed for study of zzso characteristics of zzso zzso fused zzso Such zzso zzso may be potentially employed for development of zzso zzso on the basis of the high affinity interaction between zzso and zzso (the association constant is about zzso zzso We have developed a protocol for zzso expression in zzso coli and zzso and zzso from inclusion bodies that yields a homogeneous and soluble form of this zzso zzso scanning zzso in combination with zzso and CD zzso revealed that the zzso formed zzso ordered secondary and compact zzso zzso However, partial loss of zzso interactions resulted in low stability of the zzso protein and the lack of functional activity of the two constituent zzso These zzso features suggest that the protein might be referred to the class of native molten zzso which comprises partially unfolded zzso stabilized under zzso zzso Since individually expressed zzso domain and zzso retain completely folded zzso and stable spatial structure, the incomplete folding of the zzso protein may be attributed to interaction between zzso zzso which appears at the folding stage preceding formation of a system of zzso interactions in both structural zzso The results provide evidence for non-native interactions between zzso zzso that may occur in zzso proteins composed of zzso distinct fusion zzso
