The zzso regulation of the chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso Two different types of zzso regions were zzso one was a zzso region located between zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site, and the other was essential for the expression of zzso in skeletal muscle cells and was located between 106 and 91 base pairs upstream of the cap zzso This zzso zzso element was designated as the zzso box since it is well zzso in various zzso zzso promoter zzso The activity of the zzso box showed tissue zzso To analyze the relationship between the zzso sequence and the activity of the zzso box precisely, zzso analysis was zzso The zzso sequence was indispensable for the active zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso box could function in either zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso box was similar to the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso By using a gel mobility zzso zzso the nuclear zzso that binds to both zzso box and zzso box was detected with nuclear extract prepared from chicken embryonic breast zzso These observations imply that a common factor regulates the coordinate expression of these zzso proteins in muscle zzso
