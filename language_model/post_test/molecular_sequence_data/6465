To investigate the underlying mechanisms of zzso we have developed a technique to determine the frequency of genetic changes in zzso zzso zzso We have demonstrated that at a ratio of between zzso and zzso zzso zzso the signal from a zzso zzso zzso is not apparent after zzso chain reaction zzso amplification and further direct sequencing or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To bypass this problem, which is inherent in the zzso of the prostate tissue and of the zzso we selected areas of graded prostate zzso zzso zzso from zzso preparations and zzso these cells zzso zzso After zzso zzso removal of zzso zzso amplification of zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso analysis, an abnormal zzso band shift was observed in suspected zzso cells, compared with zzso zzso cells used as an internal control, while zzso a crude preparation of tissue DNA carrying the zzso did not show any zzso and zzso zzso by a set of zzso zzso against zzso protein remained zzso zzso sequence analysis of the different bands confirmed the presence of a zzso in the zzso gene zzso 6 position zzso in an abnormal band for one zzso while no zzso was detected in the normal zzso zzso By targeting zzso zzso cells we can find DNA zzso which are zzso using the standard technique of zzso DNA zzso particularly in a zzso zzso such as zzso of the zzso
