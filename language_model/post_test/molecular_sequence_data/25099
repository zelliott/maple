zzso models for both fresh and seawater salmon were established using a Scottish isolate of infectious salmon zzso virus zzso zzso of infection were zzso injection, zzso and immersion exposure, and a range of doses was zzso Development of these models using a Scottish isolate of zzso provided an approximation of the minimum zzso dose leading to mortality under different infection zzso The models also allow prediction of the time to first mortality and an zzso of expected total mortality following the various routes of zzso Such knowledge is important to the development of zzso vaccines and to future studies aimed at understanding the biology of zzso in zzso
