zzso of isolated mast cells with zzso of zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso acids zzso or zzso are replaced with an zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in response to zzso A 10 zzso zzso with either analog (10 zzso inhibited zzso zzso release by zzso zzso or by zzso zzso At zzso that are zzso zzso and zzso alone elicit very little release zzso zzso at 10 zzso In the continued presence of the zzso the zzso effect lasts for more than 45 zzso removal of the zzso resulted in restoration of sensitivity to zzso within 10 zzso zzso with analog zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of stimulation by substance P and a zzso zzso of stimulation by zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso with analog zzso gave no zzso of release by SP or zzso Neither analog inhibited zzso release in response to zzso zzso zzso compound zzso zzso the calcium zzso zzso or zzso stimulation of passively zzso mast zzso Although zzso and zzso differ slightly in regard to the peptides they zzso both probably act at a step early in the zzso zzso zzso most likely before the rise in the level of free zzso calcium that has been shown to accompany zzso in mast zzso It is suggested that these zzso exert their zzso effect on zzso by competing with zzso for a binding site on the mast cell zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
