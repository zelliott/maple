The genes coding for two different human zzso zzso were isolated, and the primary structures were deduced from the zzso zzso The genes differ from each other and from any other zzso zzso structure described until zzso The differences occur mainly within the zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas the central part of the protein is highly zzso Within the zzso zzso however, some sequence elements are shared by different zzso zzso zzso An zzso which has been described in zzso zzso of most zzso zzso is found in both zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso portions of both zzso genes show zzso motifs at established regulatory sites, but otherwise these 3' and zzso zzso sequences of both genes differ zzso
