Previously, we identified zzso as a candidate gene for zzso zzso zzso hearing loss locus 17 zzso This gene has since been found to be a member of a zzso gene family, but its function has not been zzso The purpose of this study was thus to zzso the gene structure and pattern of zzso providing information that might allow a hypothesis to be developed about zzso function of in the inner zzso To do this we analyzed its mouse zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso expressed in all analyzed zzso and had two major transcript zzso presumed to result from an alternative use of two distinct zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments revealed a zzso zzso pattern of expression in the zzso zzso of the growing semicircular canals at embryonic day zzso zzso This expression pattern resembles the known pattern of the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter region demonstrated a putative zzso binding zzso Based on our findings, we zzso that zzso may be a downstream target gene for the zzso zzso factor, and may thus be involved in cell differentiation and proliferation during inner ear zzso Additionally, analyses of putative zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso proteins showed that their primary and secondary structures and overall zzso were highly zzso Further study is zzso to determine the role of zzso in inner ear zzso
