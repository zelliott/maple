Previous work has shown that zzso assembly of gold zzso can be zzso to make effective zzso zzso However, the method is restricted to zzso that are directly involved in zzso zzso To expand the methodology to a broader range of zzso a zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso assembly of gold zzso is reported zzso The zzso is based on the zzso zzso with an zzso zzso motif that can zzso the zzso activity through zzso interactions depending on the presence of zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso is inactive and the zzso strands can serve as zzso to assemble zzso zzso gold zzso resulting in a blue zzso However, the presence of zzso activates the zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso zzso A red color of separated gold zzso is zzso zzso of zzso of up to 1 zzso can be measured zzso by the degree of blue to red color changes or zzso by the extinction ratio at 520 and 700 zzso Under the same conditions, 5 zzso zzso zzso or zzso resulted in a blue color only, indicating good selectivity of the zzso The color difference can be clearly observed by the naked eye by spotting the resulting sensor solution onto an zzso TLC zzso Since zzso that can target many classes of important zzso have already been selected, they can be adapted into zzso systems through rational design or further zzso Thus, zzso zzso for many zzso of interest can be designed using the method presented here, regardless of whether the zzso are directly involved in the zzso reaction or zzso
