zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso consisting of a family 9 zzso domain zzso a family zzso cellulose binding module zzso a zzso zzso domain, and a family 2 zzso This zzso has the highest activity of any individual zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso particularly bacterial cellulose zzso zzso were introduced into the CD or the zzso of zzso using zzso zzso The zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso and tested for activity on four zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results show that zzso and zzso play an important role in activity by forming a hydrogen bonding network with the zzso base, zzso another important supporting zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso interacting with zzso plays an important role in zzso Several zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso to zzso had less than zzso activity on BC and markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso with zzso activity on zzso cellulose zzso were found in the zzso from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had decreased activity on BC but had zzso or improved zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso at the end of the zzso increased activity on zzso zzso Previous work showed that deletion of the zzso abolished zzso activity and zzso This study shows that it is zzso in the zzso zzso that control zzso while the zzso is important for loose binding of the zzso to the zzso cellulose zzso
