Many insects contain diverse gut microbial zzso While several studies have focused on a single or small group of species, comparative studies of zzso diverse hosts can illuminate general patterns of zzso zzso In this study, we tested the hypotheses that zzso host diet and zzso host zzso structure zzso bacterial community composition among zzso We used published zzso zzso gene sequence data for 58 insect species in addition to four zzso species sampled from the zzso National Wildlife zzso to test these zzso Overall, gut bacterial species richness in these insects was zzso zzso wood zzso insects zzso the richest bacterial gut zzso zzso species level operational zzso units zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso diversity zzso while bees and zzso zzso the least rich bacterial communities zzso species level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found evidence to support our hypotheses that host diet and zzso structure insect gut bacterial communities zzso zzso zzso for zzso However, while host zzso was important in zzso and zzso gut community structure, diet was an important community structuring factor particularly for insect hosts that zzso zzso zzso Our analysis provides a baseline comparison of insect gut bacterial communities from which to test further hypotheses concerning zzso and ultimate causes of these zzso
