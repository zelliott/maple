In this study, a new zzso typing strategy for the zzso locus is presented which involves zzso separate amplification of zzso 2 and 3 of zzso zzso in a first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 or 3 were combined in 10 zzso with zzso zzso zzso to the zzso or zzso of zzso 3 or 2 for zzso of the zzso zzso in 14 zzso zzso zzso four overlapping short zzso are produced under identical zzso chain reaction zzso conditions with individual separate amplification of zzso 2 and zzso 3 of the zzso zzso in most zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Big zzso zzso cycle sequencing is shown to provide reliable high resolution typing of the zzso zzso even in a few cases of two zzso in one primer reaction zzso In comparison, to other zzso typing zzso techniques the applied typing strategy zzso the risk of unequal amplification or of zzso of one of the zzso zzso and allows unequivocal definition of the zzso trans linkage of zzso positions of the complete zzso 2 and zzso 3 in most zzso zzso This also includes detection of new zzso differing in the zzso template generating primer zzso sites as well as in unusual combinations of known zzso 2 and 3 zzso With 10 primer sets working under identical conditions for zzso and separate amplification of the zzso zzso our zzso procedure also could be implemented in clinical settings of large-scale stem cell donor zzso testing for fast molecular zzso zzso
