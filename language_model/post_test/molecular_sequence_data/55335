The red swamp zzso zzso zzso was introduced to China in the early zzso zzso It has been spread to almost all forms of fresh water bodies including lakes, rivers and even zzso in most provinces of zzso To clarify issues such as the initial entry zzso zzso pattern, genetic diversity and genetic structure of zzso zzso in China, the genetic structure and diversity of zzso zzso populations at 37 sampling sites (35 from China, one from the USA and one from Japan) were analyzed using both zzso gene sequences zzso and zzso zzso and 12 nuclear zzso Multiple tests including zzso zzso zzso assignment and analysis of isolation by distance showed that zzso the population from Japan and those collected from China, particularly from zzso zzso and zzso and its some neighboring sites zzso zzso and zzso have similar genetic zzso zzso relatively high genetic diversity was detected in Chinese zzso zzso the zzso zzso populations in China did not experience significant population zzso Taken together, zzso zzso province is the presumed initial entry point, and zzso zzso and zzso variation are likely responsible for the observed genetic pattern of zzso zzso in zzso
