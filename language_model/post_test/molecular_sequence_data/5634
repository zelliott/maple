We have previously shown that zzso expression of the rat smooth muscle zzso heavy chain zzso gene in cultured rat zzso smooth muscle cells zzso required the presence of a highly zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso that contained two zzso serum response factor zzso binding elements zzso boxes 1 and 2) and a zzso zzso element that was recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso Hershey, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso White, zzso zzso and Owens, zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, to better understand the functional role of these three zzso zzso we created a series of zzso zzso zzso in which each element was zzso either alone or in combination with each other and tested them for activity in transient zzso zzso using primary cultured rat zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the most zzso zzso binding element zzso was active in the absence of zzso but only upon removal of the zzso zzso In contrast, regardless of sequence context, zzso was active only when zzso was zzso We further demonstrated using zzso mobility shift zzso that zzso binding to the zzso zzso element did not prevent zzso binding to the adjacent zzso Thus, unlike other proteins reported to inhibit zzso activity, the zzso activity associated with the zzso element does not appear to function through direct zzso of zzso zzso As a first step toward understanding the importance of these elements in zzso we performed in zzso zzso on the intact rat zzso We demonstrated that both zzso boxes and the zzso element were bound by protein within the zzso Additionally, using the rat carotid injury model we showed that zzso protein was significantly increased in zzso located within the zzso zzso suggesting that increased expression of this putative zzso factor may contribute to the decreased zzso zzso expression within zzso found in zzso zzso
