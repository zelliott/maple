The crystal structure of the zzso copper protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso has been solved and refined using zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in space group zzso with zzso dimensions a zzso zzso c zzso zzso A and with three protein molecules per zzso zzso The final residual R is zzso The structure was solved using molecular replacement with a search model based on the crystal structure of a close zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso has 105 zzso zzso The single zzso atom is coordinated by the same zzso - two zzso a zzso and a zzso - as in other zzso In the crystal structure, the three molecules of the zzso unit are related by a zzso zzso zzso A zzso atom lies between each pair of zzso molecules in this ensemble, being coordinated by a surface zzso zzso of one zzso and by two zzso of the zzso
