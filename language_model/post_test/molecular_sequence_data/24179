Members of the zzso zzso family of putative zzso factors are involved in various aspects of plant zzso zzso zzso is a member of this protein family and plays a significant role in the zzso patterning of both roots and zzso However, little is known about the regulation of zzso expression and its mode of action in zzso Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated by selecting for proteins that interact with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso in the zzso family of zzso interacts with zzso through a zzso domain, and exerts zzso zzso of reporter genes zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in the roots, where its expression is regulated by zzso as it also is in shoots and mature zzso These results indicate that zzso is a member of the zzso family, and suggest that its mode of action in plant zzso response may involve interaction with zzso
