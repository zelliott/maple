A zzso library was constructed from white spot syndrome virus zzso zzso shrimp zzso zzso clones with zzso zzso were isolated and zzso By comparison with DNA sequences in zzso zzso clones containing sequence identical to those of the zzso envelope protein zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso sites in the zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso Genes zzso the major viral structural proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of 5 zzso zzso collected from different shrimp species and/or geographical areas were zzso and compared with those of 4 other zzso isolate sequences in zzso For each of the viral structural protein genes zzso the zzso sequences were 100 to zzso identical among the 9 zzso Gene zzso or zzso zzso based on the gene sequences of the zzso structural proteins can be used for diagnoses and/or detection of zzso zzso
