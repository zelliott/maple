zzso zzso transport and deposition was zzso by zzso in developing zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso and zzso varieties deficient in B zzso zzso gamma 1 zzso zzso gamma 2 zzso and minor B zzso zzso zzso or gamma 3 zzso zzso In all zzso zzso zzso were detected both in the zzso as zzso ranging in diameter from 50 zzso to zzso zzso and in the zzso as protein zzso In the zzso zzso B and C zzso zzso are assembled as a core and are surrounded by an outer layer of gamma 1 and gamma 2 zzso The zzso apparently fuse several times in the zzso before entering the zzso zzso of gamma 3 zzso in the zzso zzso leads to a dramatic change in zzso zzso zzso the zzso storage proteins being largely deposited in the zzso of the rough zzso zzso gamma 3 zzso is unique among the zzso zzso zzso being zzso and forming only zzso zzso bridges, while the other B and gamma zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the rough zzso zzso in the absence of gamma 3 zzso suggests that gamma 3 zzso may maintain the zzso storage zzso in a transport competent zzso The sequence of the mature gamma 3 zzso zzso was deduced from a zzso zzso and compared with gamma 2 zzso The zzso recognized by the gamma 1 + gamma 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso used for zzso was mapped to include zzso and zzso by zzso overlapping zzso
