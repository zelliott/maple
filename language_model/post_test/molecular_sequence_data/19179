The family of zzso complexes mediates protein sorting in the late zzso zzso and it is essential for the development of zzso The zzso expressed zzso complex consists of four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mediates protein transport between the zzso network and early zzso The polarized zzso zzso complex contains the zzso zzso mediates specific transport of proteins from zzso recycling zzso to the zzso plasma membrane of polarized zzso zzso 

Analysis of the zzso zzso revealed the existence of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the novel zzso zzso which is not found in zzso zzso shows zzso sequence identity with zzso and zzso The zzso expression pattern largely zzso with that of zzso while zzso is expressed in zzso zzso By zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso techniques we demonstrate that each of these zzso zzso is essential for zzso development, with zzso and zzso being involved in central nervous system development and zzso in zzso gut and liver zzso 

zzso is unique in expressing three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results demonstrate that they are not redundant and that each of them has specific functions, which cannot be fulfilled by one of the other zzso Each of the zzso zzso appears to mediate specific molecular mechanisms essential for early zzso zzso which depends on specific zzso zzso protein sorting zzso
