The zzso zzso factor and zzso are among the most abundant zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso Both molecules are zzso and have extended zzso zzso that are respectively approximately 35 and 40 zzso zzso Here we report the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso factor which codes for a protein of zzso zzso zzso Its calculated molecular mass is zzso zzso which is considerably smaller than suggested by its mobility in zzso Analysis of the sequence shows a region that is highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso chicken zzso zzso and human zzso This zzso domain probably represents an zzso binding site that is connected to the zzso part of the zzso via a highly charged stretch of zzso zzso Whereas the sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that the extended rod domain of the zzso is based on four zzso repeats with high zzso potential, the rod domain of the zzso zzso factor is constructed from six zzso repeats that have a high content of zzso and zzso zzso and which, in contrast to zzso do not appear to have a high zzso zzso These repeats show a distinctive pattern of regions that have high zzso potential alternating with short zones rich in zzso with a high potential for zzso This observation suggests that each zzso motif has a zzso zzso with approximately nine sheets arranged perpendicular to the long axis of the zzso In the high zzso zones every second zzso is often zzso In a zzso structure, this pattern would result in one side of the domain having a surface rich in zzso side chains which could account for the zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso
