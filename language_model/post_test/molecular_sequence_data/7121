The zzso zzso of 2 zzso zzso clinical zzso was increased zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso through gradual exposure of the bacteria to increasing zzso of zzso in the zzso In both zzso the affinity of all four high molecular mass zzso binding proteins zzso for zzso was drastically reduced accompanied by major changes in the composition of zzso as resolved by zzso The ratio of zzso to zzso peptides became virtually zzso in the resistant cell walls with zzso representing two-thirds of the zzso zzso The proportion of the zzso zzso zzso a major component of the cell wall of the original zzso decreased to one-third or zzso of its normal zzso while the amounts of zzso zzso with an zzso substitution on the zzso zzso zzso group increased by close to a factor of zzso The growth rates of both zzso decreased by a factor of approximately two, as compared to the original zzso
