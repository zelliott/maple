zzso of the sulfur zzso zzso in zzso zzso is under control of sulfur zzso repression, which is composed of zzso genes zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso gene coding for a zzso zzso In this paper we report three dominant zzso of zzso requirement isolated from a zzso zzso zzso All three zzso lead to the substitution of zzso 48 by zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso carrying the dominant zzso zzso exhibit increased activities of homocysteine zzso and sulfur zzso zzso as well as elevated levels of the corresponding zzso These changes are observed even under conditions of zzso repression, which suggests that the zzso zzso protein may be resistant to zzso or degradation zzso by sulfur zzso zzso We also found that a zzso impaired in zzso zzso activity, known until now as zzso has a zzso which changes 41 zzso zzso zzso zzso it is now designated zzso This zzso has elevated levels of zzso transcripts and of activities of sulfur zzso zzso (except zzso zzso which can be zzso to the wild type level by zzso zzso Thus, zzso and the three dominant zzso represent new types of zzso affecting different parts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
