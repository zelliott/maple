To detect and zzso the effects of genes influencing variation in zzso zzso and protein levels, we conducted statistical genetic analyses of circulating zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso tissue in adult, pedigreed zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso tissue biopsy and blood sample were collected from zzso zzso from the colony at the Southwest Foundation for zzso Research, San Antonio, zzso Total zzso was isolated from zzso tissue and zzso zzso levels were zzso by zzso quantitative reverse zzso zzso insulin, zzso cholesterol, zzso zzso and zzso were measured in zzso zzso zzso genetic analyses were conducted for zzso zzso and serum protein using a maximum zzso zzso decomposition zzso A zzso linkage analysis was conducted using zzso zzso and protein levels as zzso zzso zzso was estimated for zzso zzso levels zzso zzso and protein levels zzso zzso zzso correlations were found between zzso protein and body weight zzso zzso cell volume zzso zzso serum zzso zzso zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso of odds score of zzso was found for zzso zzso levels on zzso zzso zzso which is zzso to human zzso There is a significant genetic component affecting variation in the analyzed traits, and common genes may be influencing zzso zzso zzso volume, body weight and circulating zzso The region on zzso has been linked to zzso zzso in human zzso
