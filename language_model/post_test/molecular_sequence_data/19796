Despite ongoing developments of treatment protocols head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso show only marginal improvement in outcome, which has been attributed to a lack of therapy individualized to tumor biological zzso We compared zzso expression profiles of zzso and normal zzso cells using differential display to identify gene fragments showing differential expression in zzso zzso We identified a zzso long zzso to be zzso in zzso cells that revealed a zzso zzso with the zzso zzso The differential expression was confirmed by Northern zzso zzso showed zzso of the zzso protein in zzso zzso of invasive zzso Analysis of zzso protein expression in relation to zzso stage and zzso grade of the tumors exhibited no significant zzso However, when samples of primary tumor and zzso retrieved from the same patients zzso were zzso nearly significant correlation of zzso expression with zzso grade was found zzso The high frequency of the zzso expression of zzso of different grades and stages in conjunction with its absence in zzso head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso the functional role of zzso in molecular processes of zzso
