zzso protein zzso and zzso contain modular zzso that mediate zzso interactions with a wide variety of nuclear zzso A zzso domain of zzso zzso to as the zzso is responsible for interaction with the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso such as the steroid zzso zzso zzso and also other zzso regulators such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we show that the pointed zzso domain of zzso mediates its interaction with the zzso zzso and describe the effects of zzso in the SID on binding of zzso zzso and zzso In zzso binding studies indicate that zzso zzso and zzso display mutually exclusive binding to the zzso zzso zzso with this, we observed negative zzso between zzso zzso and zzso proteins in reporter zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso activity by zzso was rescued by zzso with a zzso expression zzso consistent with the hypothesis that the observed zzso was due to competition for zzso in zzso zzso comparisons revealed that zzso proteins contain a zzso motif similar to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso lacking the zzso motif were unable to bind the zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso corresponding to this sequence zzso the binding of full-length zzso zzso and zzso proteins to the zzso zzso Thus, a zzso zzso zzso mediates mutually exclusive interactions of functionally diverse nuclear proteins with zzso
