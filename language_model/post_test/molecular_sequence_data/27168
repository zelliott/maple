We propose an order index, zzso which gives a quantitative measure of randomness and order of complete zzso zzso It maps zzso to a number from 0 zzso and of infinite zzso to 1 zzso zzso and applies regardless of sequence zzso The zzso complete zzso sequences in zzso were found to have zzso values in a very narrow range, zzso We show this implies that zzso are halfway toward being completely random, or, at the zzso of zzso We further show that artificial zzso converted from literary classics have zzso 's that almost exactly coincide with zzso but sequences of low information content do zzso We zzso that zzso represents a high zzso zzso zzso in sequence space, and that zzso are driven to it by the dynamics of a robust growth and evolution zzso We show that a growth process characterized by random zzso zzso can robustly drive zzso to the fixed zzso
