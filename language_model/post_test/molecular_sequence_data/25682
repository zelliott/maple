zzso zzso energy transfer zzso is thought to be a highly sensitive measure of distance, occurring through a zzso zzso zzso mechanism in which the efficiency of zzso depends on the inverse sixth power of the distance between zzso The current work zzso the utility of zzso for measuring distances in duplex and zzso DNA zzso The apparent efficiencies of zzso between donor zzso and zzso zzso zzso attached to opposite ends of zzso duplexes of varying length were zzso the results suggest that zzso is a useful qualitative indicator of distance in DNA zzso However, the apparent zzso efficiency values cannot be fit to the zzso equation without the zzso of highly extended zzso zzso and zzso restricted zzso conditions that are unlikely to zzso Three other lines of evidence further suggest that factors in addition to zzso transfer contribute to apparent zzso in zzso zzso The efficiency of zzso appears to depend on the base sequence in some zzso zzso zzso zzso changes with the extent of zzso induced DNA melting in a zzso fashion, indicating zzso zzso zzso The distances between the ends of various zzso combinations of arms of a DNA zzso junction do not vary as much as expected from previous zzso Thus, the occurrence of any zzso effects on energy transfer in zzso systems must be defined before distances in DNA molecules can be zzso by using zzso
