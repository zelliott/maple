zzso characterization of the zzso envelope protein zzso is very important for providing an understanding of the zzso zzso and its binding to cell zzso So far, the zzso structure of zzso with an intact zzso loop (in the absence of a zzso zzso or zzso has not been zzso The third variable region zzso of the zzso is zzso and contains zzso signatures that are essential for zzso binding and entry of the virus into zzso In this study, we characterized the structure of the outer domain of zzso with an intact zzso loop zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells utilizing mass zzso zzso We mapped the zzso sites and calculated the zzso occupancy of zzso 11 sites from 15 zzso motifs were determined as having zzso or hybrid zzso zzso The specific zzso zzso of nine zzso sites from eight unique zzso were determined by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso coupled with mass zzso analysis was employed to provide detailed information about protein structure of zzso by directly identifying accessible and zzso zzso side chain zzso zzso of zzso experimental zzso data with a zzso model derived from the zzso zzso crystal structure revealed a flexible zzso loop structure in which the zzso tip may provide contacts with the rest of the protein while zzso in the zzso base remain zzso zzso In addition, the data illustrate interactions between specific sugar zzso and zzso acid side chains potentially important to the zzso zzso
