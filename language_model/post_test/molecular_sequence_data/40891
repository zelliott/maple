zzso zzso form zzso terminal complexes in the plasma zzso of zzso and various linear terminal complexes in other zzso The sequence of a putative zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was deduced using a cloning strategy involving zzso zzso a zzso library screen, and zzso and 3' rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso identified two alternative zzso starts and four alternative zzso zzso The first translation start zzso provided an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids and was zzso amplified without zzso from zzso zzso Southern zzso indicated one strongly zzso gene with possible zzso related genes or zzso zzso acid sequence analysis identified a family 48 zzso module zzso upstream of the zzso first predicted zzso zzso There are broad similarities in predicted zzso structures of the family 48 zzso from zzso from several zzso and zzso zzso and from protein zzso but there are zzso at some zzso thought to be involved in zzso zzso The module in zzso zzso zzso will be on the zzso face of the plasma membrane so that it could potentially bind either low molecular weight zzso or starch which is zzso rather than inside zzso zzso in red zzso zzso reasons why red zzso zzso have evolved family 48 zzso perhaps as part of a system to regulate cellulose zzso activity in relation to cellular zzso status are briefly zzso
