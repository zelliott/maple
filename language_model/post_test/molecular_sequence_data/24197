Respiratory zzso zzso represents a central functionality in plant zzso but the zzso composition of the respiratory complexes in plants is still being zzso Most notably, complex II zzso zzso and complex IV zzso c zzso are the least defined in plant zzso Using zzso zzso samples and zzso zzso we have separated complex II and IV from each other and displayed their individual zzso for analysis by tandem mass zzso and zzso zzso Complex II can be zzso separated from other complexes on zzso gels and consists of eight protein zzso It contains the four classical zzso zzso as well as four zzso unknown in zzso from other zzso Five of these proteins have previously been identified, while three are newly identified in this zzso Complex IV consists of zzso protein bands, however, it is more diffuse in zzso gels and zzso in part with the zzso of the outer membrane zzso zzso zzso analysis of TOM and complex IV reveals that complex IV probably contains eight zzso with similarity to known complex IV zzso from other zzso and a further six putative zzso which all represent proteins of unknown function in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso data with zzso separation of potato and bean zzso confirmed the protein band complexity of these two respiratory complexes in zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso followed by zzso in successive dimensions, separated a zzso zzso complex containing both TOM and complex zzso This suggests that the very similar mass of these complexes will likely prevent high purity zzso based on zzso The documented roles of several of the putative complex IV zzso in zzso response and ozone stress, and similarity between new complex II zzso and recently identified plant specific zzso of complex I, suggest novel biological insights can be gained from respiratory complex composition zzso
