In this paper we report the first case of zzso A resistance in a zzso zzso that is attributable to a zzso in the zzso zzso b zzso zzso We selected for, and isolated, a zzso zzso zzso strain that is resistant to zzso zzso This resistance was evident at the levels of the in zzso growth and zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso revealed a zzso zzso in the expected region of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso and other structural genes of the zzso zzso are located on the zzso component of the zzso DNA, which is present in zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed the presence of the zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso manifestation of the zzso implies that the zzso zzso is edited and translated within the zzso Thus, this finding provides direct evidence that edited zzso are translated in zzso zzso Furthermore, a defined zzso zzso drug resistance to a zzso gene product can be exploited for the development of zzso zzso systems for zzso
