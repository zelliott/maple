A zzso zzso zzso consisting of 18 zzso acid zzso including 6 zzso zzso is produced by a zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with replacements of single zzso at each from positions 5 to 17 by the corresponding zzso acid zzso were zzso by a zzso zzso Of these zzso zzso showed the same biological properties as zzso Moreover, its activity to cause fluid zzso in zzso mouse lasts more than 24 hours, whereas the activity of zzso decreases after 6-10 zzso These results indicate that the action of the analog zzso is strongly zzso to that of the native zzso
