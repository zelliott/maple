zzso pig zzso zzso zzso zzso complex was transformed in zzso to its zzso form by incubation with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso by zzso to a zzso zzso containing its specific DNA recognition site, the zzso responsive element zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso identified four zzso zzso complexes, with molecular masses of approximately 97, 105, and 115 zzso and a somewhat broader complex at 247 zzso The zzso complex appears to contain two distinct zzso complexes of approximately 232 and 256 zzso and represents two proteins zzso zzso to a single zzso zzso while the 97, 105, and zzso complexes represent single zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso containing variable numbers of zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso identified as the zzso zzso zzso by zzso labeling with a zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso core consensus zzso the zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso immediately zzso of the zzso Overall, our results not only demonstrate that the critical zzso contacts which occur between the zzso complex and the zzso are made primarily by the zzso zzso but also indicate that the zzso complex exists as two distinct zzso zzso forms, containing one zzso zzso zzso and either one zzso or one zzso zzso zzso
