In multiple sclerosis zzso patients who carry the Class II major zzso zzso type zzso T cells specific for zzso acids zzso in the zzso protein zzso are activated and zzso zzso However, it remains unclear whether these zzso T cells play a zzso role or, rather, protect against the central nervous system zzso zzso We have addressed this issue, using mice transgenic for the human zzso class II region carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso After stimulating cultured zzso zzso cells repeatedly with zzso we generated 2 zzso zzso zzso lines zzso from the transgenic mice zzso with this portion of zzso The zzso were zzso and produced zzso 1 zzso zzso in response to the zzso These zzso were zzso transferred into zzso mice expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso Mice receiving 1 of the zzso developed a neurological disorder zzso zzso movement without apparent zzso on day 3, 4, or 5 after cell zzso zzso examination revealed inflammatory zzso primarily restricted to the zzso and zzso in association with scattered zzso zzso in the deep cerebral zzso These results support a zzso role for zzso T cells in zzso zzso patients, and shed light on the possible correlation between zzso target zzso and disease zzso in human zzso zzso zzso
