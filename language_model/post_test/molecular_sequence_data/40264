zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the second reaction of the zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the present study, crystal structures of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined in zzso zzso Crystal structures in zzso forms were also determined for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In general, overall structures of zzso are similar to each zzso However, the zzso of the B zzso are varied among zzso and the MD simulation suggested the mobility of the B zzso Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the B loop in the B domain fixes the position of the zzso and zzso zzso groups of the bound zzso The structures of zzso and the bound zzso were compared with each other in detail, and structures of zzso with full zzso as well as the possible reaction zzso were zzso
