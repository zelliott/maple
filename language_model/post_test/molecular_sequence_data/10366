Native American populations have a limited zzso zzso compared with other ethnic zzso In spite of this, many novel zzso locus zzso not observed in other zzso have been identified in South American tribes, and rapid evolution of this locus has been zzso We have studied unrelated subjects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tribes from northeastern Argentina to investigate the extent of the zzso zzso and obtain clues of selective forces that may have acted in these zzso In these tribes the number of zzso zzso is small at all zzso except zzso which presents 22 zzso Seven novel zzso were characterized including 5 of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 at zzso zzso and 1 at zzso zzso All these zzso may have arisen by gene conversion zzso Some of the novel zzso represent the most frequent zzso of these populations zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso or are the most frequent zzso in their zzso zzso B, zzso and zzso but not zzso display relatively similar gene zzso This results in high zzso in all the tribes for all the zzso studied except zzso The larger zzso and the generation and maintenance of novel zzso at the zzso locus suggests a more specialized response of this locus to evolutionary zzso These effects may be related to the nature of the zzso to the number of founder zzso and to the functional characteristics of the individual zzso
