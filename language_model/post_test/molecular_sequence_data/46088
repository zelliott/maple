The material properties of heart valves depend on the zzso age, the state of the disease and the complex zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cells zzso are zzso and their synthesis of zzso zzso not only determines the zzso material properties but also provides an adhesive zzso for zzso However, the zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and synthetic properties is poorly zzso Given that the local mechanical environment zzso zzso surrounding zzso differs among different age groups and different zzso regions of the zzso it was hypothesized that there may be an zzso and zzso response of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 6-year-old zzso zzso from the center of the zzso valve anterior leaflet zzso and zzso leaflet zzso were seeded onto zzso zzso zzso of different zzso and stained for markers of zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso and collagen synthesis zzso shock zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated decreased zzso zzso and zzso on stiffer gels, while 6-week-old zzso only demonstrated decreased zzso zzso zzso demonstrated no difference between zzso while zzso zzso demonstrated decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated decreased zzso and zzso while 6-year-old zzso demonstrated decreased zzso and increased zzso In conclusion, the zzso and zzso responses of zzso to zzso zzso link zzso zzso to the leaflet regional zzso in which the zzso zzso These data provide further rationale for investigating the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso within diseased and tissue engineered zzso
