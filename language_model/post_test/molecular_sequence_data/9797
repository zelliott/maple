zzso zzso has been implicated as one of the zzso agents in zzso infection and causes a zzso thought to be initiated via the gastrointestinal zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso cells was concentration and temperature dependent and was effectively blocked by zzso bacteria or by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso A variety of zzso zzso zzso were tested as zzso of zzso The best inhibitor was the zzso which was considerably better than other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso Further evidence that the bacteria preferred zzso structures was obtained by growing zzso cells in the presence of zzso processing zzso that block zzso I and increase the amount of zzso zzso at the cell zzso Such cells bound zzso to zzso more bacteria than did control zzso The zzso involved in binding to zzso structures was zzso from isolated zzso On sodium zzso zzso a zzso protein was identified by its specific binding to a zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of several peptides from the zzso zzso showed over zzso identity to zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were labeled with zzso and examined for the ability to bind to zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso and was inhibited by the addition of zzso but not by zzso with fewer zzso zzso zzso zzso against this zzso protein also effectively blocked zzso of zzso or zzso zzso but no effect was observed with zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso whose specificity is directed toward Man, zzso zzso
