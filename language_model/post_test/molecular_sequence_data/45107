The presence of chicken anemia virus zzso in Slovenia was confirmed by zzso of zzso chickens without zzso against zzso and isolation of the virus on the zzso disease chicken zzso line and by zzso chain reaction zzso Experimental zzso of zzso chickens resulted in lower zzso values, zzso of the zzso and zzso of bone zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso in the zzso bone zzso zzso of zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso sequence of the whole viral protein zzso gene was determined by direct zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence alignment of zzso zzso with 19 other zzso strains demonstrated zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso shared highest zzso with the zzso isolate from zzso zzso of the deduced zzso zzso acids showed that the zzso zzso shared zzso zzso and had an zzso acid sequence most similar to the zzso strain from Bangladesh zzso and were zzso similar to the zzso strain from Japan and the zzso strain from the United zzso The zzso zzso were least similar zzso to the zzso strain from zzso A zzso analysis on the basis of the alignment of the zzso zzso acids showed that zzso zzso used in the study formed three groups that indicated the possible existence of genetic groups among zzso zzso The zzso zzso were grouped together independent of their geographic origin and zzso
