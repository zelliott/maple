Mice zzso with zzso DNA zzso zzso regulatory protein of human zzso virus type 1 developed high levels of zzso zzso After 4 intramuscular injections of 100 zzso zzso DNA, zzso zzso reached zzso up to 2 zzso zzso A significant specific zzso response was maintained for at least 16 zzso Using a set of seven zzso zzso synthetic peptides covering the entire sequence of zzso we zzso the specificity of zzso zzso Interestingly, specific zzso produced in response to zzso expressing zzso DNA did not recognize the linear peptides except the long zzso zzso zzso zzso for 3 of the 10 zzso With zzso zzso produced in mice zzso with the protein zzso without any zzso the same restraint zzso binding was zzso Only 3 of the 5 zzso positive zzso reacted with the zzso zzso This suggests that specific zzso induced by zzso DNA as well as by the zzso protein recognize zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso from mice zzso with the protein in zzso zzso showed a broader zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the analysis of zzso zzso profiles of zzso generated by the different protocols of zzso showed that zzso DNA zzso induced predominantly zzso whereas zzso with zzso zzso with or without zzso yielded a preponderance of zzso zzso
