In bacteria many zzso proteins are exported via the zzso zzso A zzso apparatus was found to be involved in the transport of proteins across the zzso membrane in zzso In the present study additional data on the zzso and expression of one of the genes essential in this process, zzso is zzso For the first time, zzso activity of zzso in the zzso was zzso When zzso is used as a zzso marker for zzso evolution it demonstrates a large zzso distance between zzso and zzso zzso zzso primary zzso This distance could be explained by assuming zzso for major zzso zzso Moreover, it was found that two types of zzso genes may exist in zzso Whether or not these are involved in different protein zzso processes is presently zzso In an attempt to identify further candidates, zzso zzso zzso for zzso protein zzso an zzso protein was detected in zzso zzso by the use of a zzso zzso
