A zzso clone coding for general zzso zzso was isolated from the antenna of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of sequencing and structural analyses showed that the full-length of zzso was 636 zzso possessing 162 zzso acid zzso and a signal zzso of 21 zzso zzso Its predicted molecular weight and zzso point were zzso zzso and zzso zzso This deduced zzso acid sequence shared some common structural features with zzso proteins from several zzso species, including the six zzso zzso zzso typical of zzso zzso Northern zzso showed that zzso is specifically expressed in the antenna of zzso zzso at similar levels in both zzso In order to obtain sufficient zzso for further determining its zzso and zzso properties, a zzso expression zzso of zzso was constructed and successfully zzso The protein was obtained mainly as zzso inclusion bodies, that, however, could be zzso and zzso The zzso was zzso by affinity zzso and gel zzso The zzso was shown to zzso with an zzso zzso from zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso against zzso were used to mark the distribution of the protein in zzso zzso and were tested by zzso zzso In the male, zzso is mainly expressed in zzso zzso while in the female, it is equally expressed in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso
