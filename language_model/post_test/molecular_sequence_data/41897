zzso and zzso zzso have been implicated in the development of zzso and zzso zzso Evidence for such a role has been derived from in zzso zzso studies showing zzso and zzso expression in developing zzso and spinal zzso regions and from studies of zzso mice whose zzso genes have undergone targeted disruption by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit zzso defects but no spinal zzso zzso despite expression of the gene in these zzso The absence of spinal zzso abnormalities is thought to be due to a functional compensation of the zzso zzso by related zzso a problem that has complicated the analysis of zzso zzso of other zzso genes as zzso zzso we describe the zzso of zzso expression using zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso grown in zzso We induce similar zzso and zzso abnormalities as those seen in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression was also associated with zzso resulting in zzso These findings are consistent with the possibility that a subset of zzso expressing cells include neural crest cells known to contribute to zzso of the zzso zzso and to formation of the visceral zzso zzso knockout of zzso a gene structurally related to zzso targeted the zzso and zzso region, which were zzso and failed to expand, and the spinal cord, which exhibited lateral zzso at the level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso targeted all brain regions leading to incomplete closure of the zzso neural zzso and an increase in the number and severity of zzso along the spinal cord, suggesting that these genes complement one another to produce normal patterning of the spinal zzso The short time required to assess the zzso zzso (2 zzso and the need for limited sequence information of the target gene zzso zzso make this zzso zzso zzso culture system ideal for testing the importance of specific genes and their interactions in zzso embryonic zzso
