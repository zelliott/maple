Mechanical stresses were applied directly to cell surface receptors with a magnetic twisting zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso beta 1, induced focal zzso formation and supported a zzso stiffening response, whereas zzso receptors did zzso The zzso zzso zzso of stress to zzso increased in direct proportion to the applied stress and required intact zzso and intermediate filaments as well as zzso zzso models that incorporate mechanically zzso zzso and strings that zzso globally in response to a localized stress zzso this zzso These results suggest that zzso act as zzso and transmit mechanical signals to the zzso zzso in turn, may be zzso simultaneously at multiple locations inside the cell through zzso zzso within a zzso integrated zzso
