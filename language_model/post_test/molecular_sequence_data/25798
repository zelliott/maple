zzso growth zzso zzso has been zzso from chicken serum and zzso The zzso has eight zzso acid zzso when compared with human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Chicken zzso zzso has been measured using a zzso with a human zzso zzso standard and an zzso raised against zzso In this zzso the zzso of zzso was approximately 50% with respect to zzso and the zzso of chicken zzso was zzso with respect to chicken zzso To determine whether binding proteins in chicken plasma can zzso interfere with zzso zzso as they do in zzso chicken plasma was zzso by molecular sieve zzso at acid zzso When the zzso corresponding to the binding protein region were included in the zzso zzso essentially no apparent zzso was zzso indicating that the binding proteins did not zzso This result, together with the finding that zzso in zzso extracts of chicken plasma produced parallel zzso zzso to pure zzso and zzso allows the reliable measurement of zzso in such zzso The zzso of zzso in plasma from male birds increased two- to zzso between 1 and 7 weeks after zzso to achieve zzso zzso Smaller increases were found in female chickens from a higher value at 1 zzso No zzso pattern of zzso levels could be zzso In zzso birds, the plasma concentration of the zzso fell from nearly 40 to 15 zzso after 24 zzso of zzso and to 9 zzso 20 zzso zzso These effects are very similar to those described for zzso and strongly suggest that the regulation of zzso is zzso during evolution, notwithstanding the lower plasma zzso of the growth factor in zzso
