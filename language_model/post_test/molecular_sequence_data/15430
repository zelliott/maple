The human zzso gene and its zzso zzso zzso zzso essential proteins that are involved in zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in recycling of the zzso zzso factor zzso from zzso particles as well as in translation zzso of zzso zzso The zzso protein is highly zzso containing approximately 250 zzso acid zzso in animals, zzso and zzso while zzso zzso of plants and a group of zzso contain an extended zzso zzso In this work, we describe the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso density zzso which is consistent with a role in zzso zzso We show that zzso contains a zzso extension of 200 zzso acids that displays the features of zzso zzso proteins as determined by zzso circular zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso extension is responsible for zzso interaction activity in zzso mobility shift zzso This finding suggests that zzso and possibly also other organisms containing zzso with extended zzso regions have evolved an additional function for zzso in zzso zzso
