In order to better understand basic mechanisms of tumor development and identify potential new zzso we have performed difference gel zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso on pooled protein extracts from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with matched normal zzso zzso Image analysis of zzso gels comparing zzso and matched normal zzso tissue protein indicated that zzso of the protein spots were zzso expressed at a zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso between two different pools of protein from normal zzso zzso revealed differential protein expression of only zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso zzso One hundred zzso protein spots were identified by zzso representing 90 distinct zzso Excluding zzso zzso and zzso imaging software determined 31 proteins to be zzso expressed at the zzso (or zzso zzso Individual gel comparisons zzso zzso matched zzso from five patients established that zzso zzso of these proteins exhibited statistically significant differential zzso Previously identified molecular markers in this group of proteins include zzso B, zzso 19, and zzso Novel zzso expressed proteins include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, protein zzso 2, zzso binding protein 1, vitamin D binding zzso and proteins involved in zzso zzso The use of two-dimensional gel zzso zzso revealed a significantly altered protein mass and/or zzso in zzso of zzso suggesting alternatively spliced forms and other zzso modification of proteins revealed by this zzso We confirmed zzso as a potentially useful zzso using zzso analysis zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for distinguishing benign from zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis of zzso using zzso and mass zzso has confirmed several known zzso uncovered novel potential zzso and provided insights into global zzso changes in zzso Many of the differences observed would not have been detected by zzso or other zzso zzso
