zzso encodes an abundant zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso turnover in zzso A screen for bypass zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso double zzso identified dominant zzso of zzso zzso an zzso zzso with zzso These zzso zzso restored zzso functions, including zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity to the zzso drug zzso and zzso The zzso were localized to a region of the zzso gene zzso a putative zzso nuclear zzso sequence zzso zzso to green fluorescent protein were used to demonstrate that zzso zzso is localized to the nucleus and that the zzso zzso result in zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso targeting zzso to the nucleus by the addition of the zzso virus 40 zzso zzso resulted in zzso of the temperature sensitivity of a zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso are functionally interchangeable zzso that function in and are restricted to the zzso and nucleus, zzso It is likely that the higher zzso zzso of these proteins will function similarly in the zzso and zzso
