zzso diversity was assessed of the complete zzso gene directly amplified from 49 clinical specimens during an explosive zzso disease zzso outbreak in zzso Type O Taiwan zzso viruses are genetically highly zzso as seen by the minute divergence of zzso revealed in 20 zzso The zzso and zzso viral zzso dominated zzso outbreaks and were prevalent in most affected zzso zzso zzso of deduced zzso acid sequences around the main zzso zzso sites on the zzso zzso showed no significant zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso had an alternative critical zzso at position 43 in zzso site 3, which may be due to selective pressure in the zzso Two vaccine production strains zzso and zzso probably provide partial zzso protection of zzso against O Taiwan zzso The type O Taiwan zzso clustered in zzso A1 of four main lineages in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso viruses in zzso zzso are closely related to the O Taiwan zzso The zzso agent for the 1997 epidemic presumably originated from a single common source of type O zzso viruses prevalent in neighboring zzso
