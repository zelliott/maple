zzso stem zzso caused by the zzso zzso pathogen zzso zzso is a serious disease of canola zzso zzso zzso To increase the understanding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction, proteins potentially involved in zzso this interaction were identified and zzso Upon infection of canola leaves by zzso zzso necrosis of host leaves was observed by 12 h and rapidly progressed during the later time zzso These zzso observations were supported by microscopic study performed at different time points after pathogen zzso Leaf proteins were extracted and analyzed by zzso which revealed the zzso of 32 proteins (12 zzso and 20 zzso The identities of these proteins were established by zzso zzso and included proteins involved in photosynthesis and zzso zzso protein folding and zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso Gene expression analysis of selected genes was performed by zzso whereas the elevated levels of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were validated by zzso zzso To the zzso best knowledge, this is the first zzso investigation of zzso zzso zzso interaction, and the roles of many of the proteins identified are discussed within the context of this zzso
