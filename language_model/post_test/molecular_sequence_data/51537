zzso zzso zzso is a protein which removes the zzso zzso zzso induced in DNA by zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that freshly isolated zzso from reduction zzso specimens contain significant levels of zzso zzso zzso activity in breast zzso cells shows zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso activity remain unchanged during short-term zzso culture of breast zzso cells inside three-dimensional zzso collagen gel zzso In the present study, we zzso conditions for depleting zzso activity in human breast zzso cells cultured in three-dimensional collagen gel zzso using zzso and zzso which are zzso for zzso zzso activity was efficiently zzso by exposure of cells to zzso or zzso zzso with zzso was more zzso of greater magnitude and consistency and occurred at lower zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity was zzso achieved with 50 zzso zzso In contrast, 500 zzso zzso was needed to obtain a zzso effect and this reduced zzso activity by only zzso of zzso Within 30 zzso of adding the free base, 50 zzso zzso depleted zzso of the levels of zzso compared to zzso zzso with 500 zzso zzso The profile for restoration of zzso activity was different following a 24 h incubation and subsequent removal of each of the zzso zzso zzso activity levels remained zzso for at least 2 days after removal of 50 zzso zzso from the medium and recovered to only zzso of control values after an additional 3 zzso zzso activity levels remained zzso for at least 2 days after removal of 50 zzso zzso from the medium and recovered to only zzso of control values after an additional 3 zzso In contrast, following removal of 500 zzso zzso the activity was restored from its zzso of zzso of control values reaching zzso levels after 5 zzso These results suggest that treatment with zzso may be used to zzso the zzso of transforming zzso in cultured human breast zzso cells treated with chemical zzso which give rise to zzso zzso
