A zzso synthetic zzso encompassing the zzso zzso domain of skeletal muscle zzso light chain zzso was studied by two-dimensional zzso and CD zzso In water the zzso does not form any regular zzso however, addition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso causes it to form an zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of this zzso in zzso and zzso zzso were assigned by double zzso zzso zzso total correlation zzso and nuclear zzso effect correlated zzso zzso In addition, the zzso chemical shifts were obtained from zzso multiple quantum zzso zzso The presence of numerous zzso i + 1), d alpha zzso i + zzso and d alpha zzso i + 3) zzso zzso indicates that an zzso can be formed from zzso 3 to 20; this is further supported by the CD zzso zzso zzso and downfield zzso shifts in this region of the zzso provide further support for the formation of an zzso The zzso induced by zzso appears to be similar to that formed upon binding of the zzso to zzso
