We have created J chain knockout mice to define the zzso role of the J chain in zzso synthesis and zzso The J chain is zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso M and zzso zzso and is also expressed in most zzso zzso J zzso mice have normal serum zzso and zzso levels but markedly elevated serum zzso Although zzso zzso was present in the zzso mice, a larger proportion of their serum zzso was zzso than was found in zzso mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were decreased in J zzso mice compared with zzso mice, suggesting inefficient transport of J zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso The zzso transport of zzso zzso from zzso and zzso mice was assessed in zzso canine kidney zzso cells zzso with the zzso These studies revealed selective transport by zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso but not J zzso zzso We conclude that although the J chain is not required for zzso zzso it does affect the efficiency of zzso or have a role in maintaining zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the J chain is essential for efficient zzso zzso transport of zzso
