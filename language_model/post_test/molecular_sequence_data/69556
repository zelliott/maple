A clone zzso the guinea pig zzso zzso K zzso channel was isolated and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibit many of the zzso and pharmacological properties characteristic of zzso the slow component of the delayed zzso zzso zzso in guinea pig cardiac zzso zzso commands evoke outward zzso currents that activate slowly, with time zzso on the order of zzso The currents are blocked by the class III zzso compound zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso or low zzso of zzso Like zzso in guinea pig zzso zzso is modulated by stimulation of protein zzso A and protein zzso C zzso In contrast to rat and mouse zzso which are decreased upon stimulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso are increased after zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso at position 102 by zzso zzso the zzso found in the analogous position of the mouse and rat zzso K zzso results in decreased zzso in response to zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that the zzso K protein zzso the slow component of the delayed zzso zzso current in zzso zzso and account for the zzso responses to stimulation of zzso
