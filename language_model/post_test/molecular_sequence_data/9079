zzso are zzso in response to DNA zzso breaks zzso promoting recruitment of repair proteins to zzso zzso (also known as zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso with zzso (also known as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso chains at zzso sites in concert with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis is regulated in a zzso manner by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1), which binds zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso domain, which had been implicated in zzso zzso are required for binding to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Here we describe structural and zzso studies zzso how zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso We unexpectedly find that zzso binding to zzso is zzso regulated by free zzso which binds to a second site in zzso and increases its affinity for zzso while at the same time zzso interactions with zzso in a manner that depends on the zzso N zzso Crystal structures of an zzso complex and of zzso bound to zzso zzso and a chemical zzso zzso show that binding of free zzso to zzso triggers zzso changes in the zzso domain and formation of a zzso zzso in the N zzso thus promoting binding of the zzso donor zzso in zzso to zzso The donor zzso thus cannot interact with the zzso zzso which has been shown to be important for zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is positioned to interfere with zzso binding to zzso as well as with attack on the zzso by an zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso zzso binding also zzso the zzso zzso binding site on zzso thus providing a further component of zzso The general features of the zzso mechanism explain how zzso zzso other zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
