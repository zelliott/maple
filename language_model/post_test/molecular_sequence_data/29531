The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bind to zzso growth factor zzso and promote its zzso a proposed prerequisite for binding to a cellular zzso and triggering zzso zzso The problem of minimal structural requirements for zzso sequences to bind zzso was approached by surface zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso studies using the three synthetic zzso zzso zzso R zzso zzso zzso zzso BA, R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AA and BA significantly interact with the zzso whereas zzso is practically zzso The zzso zzso show that, whereas the interaction of AA primarily involves the zzso zzso zzso at its zzso end, zzso at both the zzso zzso and reducing side zzso appear to be involved in the weaker complex of zzso Furthermore, zzso experiments show that, in addition to zzso zzso complexes, AA and BA are able to form zzso complexes, indicating that zzso zzso of zzso requires only one zzso group per zzso
