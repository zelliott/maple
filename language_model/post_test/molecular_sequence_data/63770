zzso a 42 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that controls cell migration and invasion, is mainly expressed by zzso cells but is also expressed in zzso zzso zzso Upon culture of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso is zzso to nearly zzso levels by passage zzso DNA zzso is one of several processes that controls gene expression during cell zzso development, genetic zzso and zzso but has not been studied in zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether DNA zzso of the zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso is involved in the mechanism of zzso of zzso synthesis in human zzso zzso zzso and zzso Human donor zzso zzso cells were immediately placed into zzso defined medium or cultured in the presence of zzso and passed into zzso medium or medium containing zzso or zzso to induce the zzso zzso or zzso for the zzso zzso These cell types are found in wounded zzso The cells were used to prepare zzso for zzso or quantitative zzso or to extract protein for Western zzso In addition, zzso zzso cultured zzso were treated with the DNA zzso agent, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso with and without treatment were harvested and zzso for DNA zzso using sodium zzso zzso The zzso state of zzso zzso associated with the zzso gene in the zzso zzso cells was determined using a zzso zzso Freshly harvested zzso zzso cells expressed zzso but upon zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein were dramatically zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed that the zzso promoter in the freshly isolated zzso zzso was zzso while both the zzso zzso cells and the zzso cells cultured in the presence of zzso defined zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso synthesis was also associated with zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and protein were zzso at low levels with zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso treated cells did not increase zzso zzso Treatment with zzso did not significantly alter zzso of the zzso promoter but did zzso zzso zzso These results show zzso promoter zzso and zzso zzso occur with zzso of zzso synthesis in zzso zzso cells and suggest regulation of genes upon conversion of zzso to wound healing zzso can involve promoter and zzso zzso
