Here, we report a novel, zzso molecular zzso system to zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso Three types of simple zzso peptides consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were prepared as building blocks for zzso A detailed analysis of the zzso and zzso mechanism was performed by using circular zzso zzso zzso zzso and atomic force zzso zzso A wide variety of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be zzso by tuning the zzso zzso reaction time, and solution zzso The ability to control the zzso zzso should provide a simple and/or essential insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso including zzso formation, and it should be useful for the design of novel zzso zzso
