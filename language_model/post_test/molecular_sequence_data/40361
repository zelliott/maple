A zzso zzso zzso strain, designated zzso was isolated from the abdominal zzso of a sea cucumber, zzso zzso collected in seawater off the coast of zzso A zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that strain zzso was a member of the class zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso analyses showed that strain zzso represented a novel, zzso and distinct zzso lineage within the class zzso and clustered with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso had zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso acid in the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso as the diagnostic zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso and zzso as the major cellular fatty zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso Based on data from the current zzso study, it is proposed that the new marine isolate be placed in a novel zzso and be considered a novel species designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the new family, order and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the class zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
