We present a new zzso method for the prediction of zzso gene groups for microbial zzso based on the prediction of zzso of zzso zzso The method is inspired by the observation that zzso genes are highly likely to be zzso if their neighboring genes are also zzso Based on zzso of zzso zzso we have grouped the zzso zzso of 77 selected zzso microbial zzso so that zzso of the same group are highly likely to be functionally similar or zzso We then cluster the zzso genes in the same zzso group so that genes of the same cluster are highly likely to be similar in terms of their sequences and functions, zzso they are predicted to be zzso zzso By comparing our predicted zzso gene groups with the zzso assignments and zzso zzso we conclude that our method is promising to provide more accurate and specific predictions than the existing zzso
