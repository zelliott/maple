zzso associations of a zzso zzso of the zzso promoter region were analyzed in a random North Italian population, in 69 zzso zzso cell lines and in 29 families in Boston, all typed for zzso class I, class II and complement zzso zzso zzso associations were detected in the random population between zzso zzso and several zzso markers carried by extended zzso The inclusion of zzso zzso in extended zzso suggested by population analysis, was confirmed in zzso cells, including zzso zzso zzso cell lines and families, selected for the presence of the whole set of zzso reported for zzso extended zzso Every tested extended zzso was exclusively associated with a given zzso zzso except those carrying zzso zzso C was included in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso extended zzso accounting for the previously observed strong association with zzso In addition the same zzso was found on the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and on the zzso zzso zzso extended zzso The zzso A zzso was carried by all zzso extended zzso except the one above zzso zzso B correlated with zzso zzso and zzso Thus the zzso promoter zzso provide new precisely located markers of extended zzso
