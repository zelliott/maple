We have cloned human zzso zzso a novel protein of zzso zzso acids that contains the zzso consensus sequence zzso and several stretches surrounding the zzso which are zzso to those of the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When expressed in zzso cells, the protein predominantly exists in the membrane fraction and exhibits a zzso zzso activity in a zzso zzso The transcript of the zzso zzso gene is zzso observed as a single band of approximately zzso zzso on Northern zzso with the most abundant expression in the skeletal muscle and zzso By a search of the database, we have also identified its putative zzso zzso zzso which shows zzso identity with that of human in the zzso zzso zzso Thus the novel type of zzso is zzso well zzso suggestive of its biological zzso
