The zzso protein 11 zzso can act as a tumor marker because of its specific association with various forms of zzso A zzso zzso zzso library prepared from human zzso was screened with a zzso zzso zzso Out of zzso independent zzso only one clone reacted with the zzso zzso The isolated zzso coded only for the zzso part of zzso and was subsequently used to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso clones out of zzso screened were identified zzso the entire protein of zzso zzso zzso including a typical zzso signal sequence of 18 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso coding sequence in zzso coli resulted in the synthesis of a protein with the expected size which can be specifically zzso with zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that two forms of the protein are present in the bacterial zzso a zzso form of approximately 42 zzso in the zzso and a zzso form of approximately 42 zzso in the zzso This result indicates that zzso can be zzso in zzso coli and is process by removal of the zzso signal zzso Both the zzso and the processed zzso zzso protein exhibit a zzso zzso
