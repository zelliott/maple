The zzso locus of zzso zzso is one of several zzso zzso with genes zzso zzso of the major cell surface protein known as the zzso zzso zzso The locus is highly zzso raising questions concerning functional zzso and selective forces acting on its multiple zzso Here, we compare the sequences and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The precursor zzso are highly zzso They are rich in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and they share nearly identical zzso zzso and zzso addition zzso The locations of the 39 zzso are highly zzso particularly in the zzso central, imperfect tandem repeats in which 8 periodic zzso punctuate alternating short and long stretches of zzso zzso zzso patterns are also zzso Nevertheless, zzso acid sequence identity is low, ranging from zzso to zzso At the zzso level, from zzso to zzso of zzso sites are zzso in zzso zzso zzso of each zzso is regulated by zzso zzso zzso H zzso are stable at zzso degrees but are unstable at zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is less affected by temperature, has a different arrangement of the putative zzso zzso motif zzso zzso analysis of zzso genes indicates that the multiple zzso are zzso zzso low ratios of the rates of zzso to synonymous zzso acid zzso suggest that the multiple zzso are subject to zzso zzso selection enforcing constraints on zzso
