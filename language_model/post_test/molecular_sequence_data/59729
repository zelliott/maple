zzso of zzso C virus zzso have been classified by zzso sequence comparisons in different regions of the zzso Many investigators have defined the ranges of sequence similarity values or evolutionary distances corresponding to divisions of zzso into types, zzso and zzso Using these criteria, novel zzso of zzso from Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia have been classified as types 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, many of which can be further subdivided into between two to four zzso In this study, this zzso method of virus zzso was compared with zzso analysis and statistical measures to establish the confidence of the zzso Using zzso zzso of zzso trees in several zzso regions zzso zzso zzso and with complete zzso zzso we found that one set of novel zzso zzso zzso 7, 8, 9 and zzso consistently grouped together into a single zzso that also contained type zzso while zzso zzso grouped with type zzso In contrast, no robust zzso groupings were observed between any of the other five previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso In each zzso region, the distribution of zzso distances between members of the type 6 zzso were consistently zzso and therefore provided no justification for zzso of these zzso into the three proposed categories zzso zzso zzso Based on these results, we propose that a more useful zzso would regard all these zzso as zzso of type 6 or type 3, even though the level of sequence diversity within the zzso was greater than observed for other zzso zzso by zzso zzso rules out simple sequence similarity zzso as a method for assigning zzso zzso but provides a more appropriate description of the evolutionary and zzso history of a zzso
