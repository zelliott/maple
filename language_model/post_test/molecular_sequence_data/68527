We have isolated complementary DNA clones coding for a novel member of the zzso hormone zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and in zzso zzso revealed that the gene is expressed exclusively in prenatal and zzso zzso zzso We have tentatively proposed the name zzso zzso zzso zzso for the gene and its zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein is zzso as a zzso acid zzso which contains a zzso acid signal zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso protein with members of the zzso hormone zzso predicts that the biologically active zzso after zzso processing of the zzso consists of a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso and has a molecular size of zzso zzso
