zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso sensor zzso that help a wide variety of bacteria respond to their light zzso In zzso zzso a unique pair of zzso with potentially opposing roles in light sensing are zzso Both zzso contain an zzso zzso domain that zzso zzso a zzso zzso Whereas zzso assumes a zzso ground state, zzso is unusual in that it assumes a zzso ground state that is produced zzso after zzso binding through a transient zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso light then generates zzso but this zzso is also unstable and rapidly reverts zzso to zzso zzso contains a typical zzso zzso zzso domain at its C zzso whose activity is zzso after zzso to zzso zzso also functions as a zzso zzso but instead uses a distinct zzso zzso motif that is zzso after zzso to zzso We identified sequences related to this domain in numerous predicted sensing proteins in zzso zzso and other bacteria, indicating that zzso might represent the founding member of a family of zzso zzso proteins that is widely used in environmental zzso By using these mutually opposing zzso zzso zzso presumably has the capacity to simultaneously sense red zzso and zzso zzso environments through zzso of their associated zzso zzso
