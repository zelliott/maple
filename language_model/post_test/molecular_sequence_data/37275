zzso in the activity of zzso c zzso zzso the terminal zzso in the respiratory chain, are a frequent cause of zzso zzso zzso disease in zzso These patients are clinically and genetically heterogeneous, and all defects so far identified in this group have been found in genes coding for accessory proteins that play important roles in the assembly of the zzso zzso zzso Many patients, however, remain without a molecular zzso We have used a panel of zzso zzso expressing human zzso assembly factors in these patients to identify the molecular basis for the zzso zzso by functional zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso a protein involved in the synthesis of zzso A, the zzso prosthetic group for zzso can functionally complement the isolated zzso zzso in zzso from a patient with zzso infantile zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso in the patient identified a zzso zzso zzso on one zzso changing a zzso zzso to zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso 3 on the other zzso zzso resulting in a deletion of zzso zzso This zzso error introduces a zzso and a premature stop zzso resulting in an unstable zzso and, zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso A content was reduced in the patient's heart and zzso zzso and levels of zzso O were increased in the patient's zzso zzso activity and the total amount of fully assembled zzso were reduced by zzso in patient zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso A content and rescued zzso zzso These results suggest that reduced availability of zzso A zzso the assembly of zzso This study establishes zzso as an additional cause, along with zzso of fatal zzso zzso zzso associated with isolated zzso zzso
