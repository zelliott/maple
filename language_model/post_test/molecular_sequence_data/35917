We zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the entire zzso gene zzso and its zzso and 3' zzso zzso The zzso coding sequence spanned zzso zzso and as in other species, comprised 10 zzso separated by the corresponding zzso The deduced protein corresponded to zzso zzso acid zzso 8 of which differed from a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso region displayed several putative zzso elements which may be involved in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso dependent zzso zzso We also characterized within the zzso region a 139 zzso repetitive element of the short zzso zzso element zzso family located on the opposite zzso In addition, we characterized the last five zzso of a zzso opposite strand gene zzso located in the zzso at the 3' end of zzso The zzso part of this zzso displayed a very strong zzso with its human zzso
