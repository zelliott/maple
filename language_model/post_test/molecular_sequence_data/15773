The spike zzso zzso gene of zzso codes for a precursor protein which is zzso into the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso comprises approximately 520 zzso acid zzso We have determined the zzso sequence of zzso of seven strains of the Massachusetts zzso zzso and the first 337 bases of two additional Mass zzso Despite the fact that the strains had been isolated over three decades in Europe and the zzso there was only zzso base and zzso zzso acid variation within the zzso Nearly one third of the 32 zzso acid differences in zzso were in two zzso regions zzso 1 and 2) zzso zzso zzso and zzso identified by zzso et zzso zzso showing that zzso 1 and 2 are a feature of the Mass zzso zzso acid variation within zzso 1 and 2 was zzso and zzso zzso Five vaccine strains could be distinguished from each other by sequencing of the first 337 zzso zzso of zzso which resisted zzso by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso had the same, single base change at position 134, resulting in substitution of zzso zzso 45 by zzso This indicates that zzso within zzso 1 are associated with zzso which induce zzso zzso
