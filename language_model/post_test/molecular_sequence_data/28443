The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be selectively incorporated into the most zzso zzso zzso of zzso S1, and upon zzso an zzso zzso is formed between zzso and the zzso zzso region of zzso If a zzso is present during zzso zzso can be formed either with the zzso region or with the central zzso region zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 83, zzso zzso of the zzso maps of zzso and zzso zzso heavy chains indicates that the segment located about zzso zzso from the zzso of the heavy chain can be zzso to zzso via zzso independently of the presence of a zzso whereas the segment located zzso zzso from the zzso can be zzso to zzso only in the presence of a zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso 26, zzso In this report, zzso was labeled with radioactive zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and then zzso with zzso zzso zzso containing zzso were isolated by liquid zzso and subjected to zzso acid sequence zzso The results show that zzso is the major site and zzso and zzso are the minor sites involved in zzso with zzso zzso via zzso These zzso are very near the zzso zzso zzso zzso but relatively remote in the primary structure from the putative zzso binding zzso
