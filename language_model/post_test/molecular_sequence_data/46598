The zzso coli proteins zzso is recognized as an important component among the major zzso zzso In studies of zzso coli strains with defects in zzso we discovered a zzso that zzso restored zzso viability zzso of such zzso The zzso zzso was the result of a zzso that led to zzso higher levels of the functionally and structurally related zzso zzso This zzso was a base pair change in the zzso structural zzso and the zzso acid substitution in the zzso protein altered its turnover properties, suggesting a role for this zzso in a zzso site for zzso We determined the stability of the zzso and the zzso proteins and found that the zzso protein was zzso relatively rapidly in strains lacking functional zzso whereas zzso remained stable irrespective of the zzso of zzso Using zzso zzso we obtained evidence that the Lon zzso was responsible for the degradation of zzso The differential turnover of the zzso proteins is suggested to contribute to the regulation of their zzso and ratio in terms of zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso in contrast to zzso is present mainly in zzso form in zzso zzso
