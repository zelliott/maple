zzso synthesis and zzso of zzso and its zzso mark the onset of renewed growth when wheat zzso are zzso in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that is not found in immature zzso or in mature zzso before their zzso An zzso was raised by injecting rabbits with zzso that was freed of other proteins by zzso and gel zzso The zzso has been used to zzso in extracts of mature zzso from dry, zzso wheat zzso a protein that is zzso related to zzso The zzso related protein has been named zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso then declines appreciably in amount by zzso zzso in soluble extracts of immature zzso from several wheat zzso The zzso was also used to identify zzso and zzso among the proteins extracted from cell walls and to bind zzso to cell walls zzso to visualizing zzso zzso by scanning electron zzso zzso zzso accounts for about zzso of the total zzso in zzso wheat zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso is the most conspicuous zzso change in the distribution of zzso zzso It seems that zzso may act at the level of the zzso and that zzso may zzso the role of zzso at low water zzso during zzso The zzso zzso sequences in zzso and zzso are very similar but zzso analysis detects discrete differences between the zzso of their constituent zzso as well as gross differences between the zzso of the parent zzso Like zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso but zzso has unprecedented zzso zzso properties that have never been previously reported for a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso with otherwise pure specimens of zzso (and zzso have been isolated for analysis and shown to be highly zzso zzso The possible biological significance of selective and tenacious association between zzso and zzso is discussed in relation to cell expansion during zzso and zzso development of zzso as are some peculiarities of zzso sequence that suggest a possible relation between zzso and a zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso
