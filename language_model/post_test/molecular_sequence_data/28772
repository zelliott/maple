The high zzso zzso protein complex zzso composed of zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso sequences were used to design zzso zzso zzso which were then used as a first step in amplification, identification and sequencing of the zzso gene zzso zzso Number zzso zzso analysis revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence (which contained the zzso determined zzso zzso has zzso or zzso zzso acids zzso on which start zzso is zzso the mature protein consists of zzso zzso zzso has a predicted zzso of zzso and a theoretical zzso of zzso It is preceded by a 29 or 18 zzso acid signal zzso which includes a typical zzso region near the zzso zzso zzso plots of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso display striking similarity with those of zzso coli zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso transport zzso zzso modeling of zzso zzso zzso (based on zzso and zzso sequence profiles, coupled with secondary structure and zzso potential zzso indicated that the closest zzso in terms in fold conservation were the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gated transport proteins zzso zzso The zzso gene sequence was identified using the zzso peptides to search the published zzso zzso data zzso We found that zzso is located immediately downstream of zzso and confirmed this with zzso zzso zzso has no known zzso but does share some characteristics with the zzso zzso zzso
