In mice, defense against an zzso zzso infection depends on a vigorous innate immune zzso zzso which lead to an inadequate early response to the pathogen thus identify genes involved in innate zzso The best studied host resistance factor, zzso is an zzso membrane protein whose loss leads to an inability of the animals to hold the infection in zzso However, innate defense against zzso is not restricted to mechanisms which directly attack the pathogen within zzso Here we have examined the contribution of the zzso zzso and zzso gene products to innate defense against zzso To this end, we have generated mice which carry a zzso zzso of zzso but which are deficient for the zzso zzso or zzso zzso Loss of any of these genes leads to a zzso to zzso as dramatic as that seen in animals lacking functional zzso zzso This indicates that zzso zzso and zzso are all critical elements required in the proper induction of this innate defense zzso
