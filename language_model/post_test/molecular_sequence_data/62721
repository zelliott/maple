zzso zzso zzso are thought to be export from the nucleus as zzso complexes zzso whose exact protein composition remains not completely zzso The zzso zzso a highly zzso member of the zzso repeat protein family, was first shown to be involved in zzso zzso More recently, a role in the cell cycle was also zzso To get new insights into the functions of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was first zzso then the corresponding protein characterized and its function investigated by zzso zzso This paper shows that zzso mainly zzso to the nuclear membrane like its zzso in zzso zzso However, unlike its zzso and despite this particular zzso distribution, its depletion does not impair the export of zzso zzso Interestingly, the presence of zzso is important for normal proliferation and, more importantly, for the progression through the zzso phase of the cell zzso Given that zzso is closely related to the human form, results suggest that the human zzso zzso may also play a similar role during the cell zzso
