When zzso zzso cells are zzso with zzso in zzso the zzso form long zzso structures on the surface of the zzso The strands connecting the zzso are composed of zzso zzso of von zzso factor zzso and can be rapidly zzso when zzso with normal plasma or zzso zzso zzso but not with plasma from patients with either zzso or acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso strings anchor to the surface of the zzso cell at least partly through zzso as their formation is prevented by either soluble zzso or zzso zzso They are also able to support the attachment of beads coated with zzso The zzso binds to both the A1 and A3 zzso of zzso the latter with higher zzso This attachment zzso the zzso close to its zzso site within the zzso zzso We propose that attachment of newly released zzso to the zzso cell surface zzso its zzso by zzso by allowing zzso force to be applied to the zzso domain, thereby exposing the zzso zzso zzso
