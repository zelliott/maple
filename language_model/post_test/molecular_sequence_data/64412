In this study, we performed systematic candidate gene analyses of the Pulmonary zzso resistance 2 zzso zzso gene expression in lung zzso and zzso zzso in coding regions between zzso and zzso mice were examined using reverse zzso and direct zzso Although not all genes in the zzso were analyzed at this moment due to the recent database zzso we have found that the Pol iota zzso zzso the DNA zzso iota, contains 25 zzso zzso in its coding region between zzso and zzso mice, resulting in a total of ten zzso acid zzso zzso extension zzso with zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso demonstrate that both forms of Pol iota are active but that they may differ in zzso discrimination, which may affect the formation of zzso zzso in mouse lung zzso zzso expression of zzso iota protein and an zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in human lung cancer cells, suggesting a possible role in the development of lung zzso Thus, our data support the Pol iota gene as a modifier of lung zzso by altering DNA zzso zzso
