During studies of the zzso of human zzso five strains of zzso zzso rods were isolated following growth in a zzso zzso These strains belonged to the zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between one of the zzso zzso and recognized species within the zzso zzso was zzso zzso The DNA zzso content (44 zzso and major fatty acid composition zzso : zzso zzso zzso supported the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso tests and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that strain zzso was distinct from zzso zzso and zzso zzso to which it was related most zzso On the basis of these data, a novel zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
