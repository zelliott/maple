We determined the complete sequence of the zzso gene from five strains of zzso species zzso Both distance and zzso methods were used to zzso the evolutionary relationships of the zzso gene sequence of this zzso species in comparison with the zzso gene sequence of zzso zzso and the zzso gene sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso species obtained from sequence zzso The zzso analysis revealed that the zzso species zzso strains clustered in a separate zzso which was consistent with data from previous zzso zzso experiments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso length zzso analysis was used to identify zzso species zzso and to differentiate it from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, signature zzso positions were identified for each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In accordance with DNA zzso values, our findings suggest that zzso species zzso can be more clearly defined and identified, and we propose that it should be referred to as a new species, zzso zzso The type strain is zzso
