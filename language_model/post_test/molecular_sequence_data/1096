zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are present in wheat flour and are known to inhibit zzso zzso family 11 zzso zzso which are commonly applied in grain zzso Here, we describe the zzso molecular identification of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso proteins from barley ( zzso zzso and rye ( zzso zzso zzso The zzso coding sequence encodes a mature protein of zzso zzso acids preceded by a 19 zzso acid long signal zzso zzso has an open reading frame zzso a signal zzso of 21 zzso acids and a mature protein of 375 zzso zzso As for zzso no zzso were detected in the untranslated regions and coding sequences zzso These newly identified sequences allowed us to perform a multiple sequence alignment with zzso and similar zzso Rice zzso proteins clustered together with the cereal zzso zzso zzso proteins with sequence similarity to zzso including the tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso formed a different zzso The zzso proteins may hence be part of a zzso of proteins all involved in plant responses to zzso or zzso stress and for which a function as zzso zzso zzso can be zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso gene identified on wheat zzso 3B, of the zzso gene identified on rye zzso zzso and the presence of a cluster of zzso genes on rice zzso 1, allowed us to assign the location of zzso genes to the zzso zzso area zzso characterized by zzso markers zzso and zzso and zzso zzso In rice, zzso marker zzso zzso to a zzso protein zzso zzso
