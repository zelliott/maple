zzso zzso DNA amplification was performed exploiting the zzso protein zzso A zzso The system was primarily tested on zzso activated zzso plates as a zzso and later translated to an zzso zzso In both cases, forward primer for zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was surface zzso via a zzso or an zzso zzso and then zzso during the zzso zzso amplification, carried out in the presence of specific target sequence and reverse zzso The formation of the subsequent surface zzso zzso was either zzso or zzso monitored using a zzso zzso zzso DNA secondary probe complementary to the zzso zzso The amplification time was zzso to amplify even low amounts of DNA copies in less than an hour at a constant temperature of zzso achieving a limit of detection of zzso M zzso copies in 50 zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso M zzso copies in 10 zzso for the zzso zzso The system was demonstrated to be highly specific with negligible zzso with zzso targets or zzso
