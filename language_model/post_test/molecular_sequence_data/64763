In zzso zzso the zzso regulated zzso zzso sensitive factor attachment protein zzso zzso protein zzso mediates the fusion of zzso with the zzso zzso which is required for the formation of zzso zzso is subject to both positive and negative regulation by separate sequences in its zzso zzso We report that the positive activity is zzso by a short, zzso zzso that is sufficient to zzso plasma membrane or zzso membrane zzso to green fluorescent zzso In zzso this zzso binds to zzso zzso and zzso that reduce or eliminate zzso binding in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso manipulation of zzso pools indicates that the likely in zzso zzso of this domain is zzso zzso The zzso activity is a nuclear targeting zzso which zzso nuclear zzso in zzso cells and in cells entering zzso However, as cells initiate spore formation, zzso containing the zzso domain exit the nucleus and zzso to the nascent zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is both positively and zzso regulated by control of its zzso zzso
