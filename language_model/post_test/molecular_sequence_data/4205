The role of a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso loop of a zzso zzso zzso clone zzso zzso was investigated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When zzso was replaced with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso a current response to zzso zzso zzso zzso through the zzso zzso was zzso When replaced with zzso zzso the response was not zzso but a reduced current response to zzso was zzso The zzso of a zzso zzso in zzso at positions close to position 256 failed to recover the responsiveness to zzso These results suggest that an zzso acid zzso with a side chain of an aromatic ring with a zzso group zzso or zzso is necessary exactly at position 256 for zzso zzso zzso
