While there have been numerous reports concerning the possible zzso of zzso in zzso development and their zzso or lack zzso as possible therapeutic agents for the treatment of zzso injury, the molecular mechanisms by which they induce specific cellular effects are not well zzso This review presents evidence for the existence of cell surface molecules able to adhere to the zzso portion of specific zzso and describes methods employed for their zzso The identification of such cell surface molecules permits the hypothesis that the binding of the zzso portion of the zzso by its cell surface zzso is responsible for initiating the zzso reactions that lead to modified cell zzso
