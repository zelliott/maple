Using a zzso zzso library, we have identified the zzso recognized by a new panel of five zzso zzso zzso raised against full-length zzso human zzso zzso The zzso were found to recognize both zzso A and C by Western zzso and zzso at the nuclear zzso A zzso acid consensus sequence zzso in the common zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso contains the binding site for all five zzso zzso structure of the zzso domain of zzso zzso shows this sequence is a complete zzso This sequence includes zzso zzso which is zzso in most cases of zzso familial partial zzso zzso zzso may be part of an interaction site on the surface of zzso zzso for zzso proteins associated with zzso
