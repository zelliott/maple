The objective of this study was to use next-generation sequencing technologies to dissect quantitative trait zzso zzso for southern zzso zzso zzso resistance into individual genes in zzso Two hundred zzso zzso zzso lines zzso derived from a cross between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for zzso resistance in a greenhouse and zzso at an average of zzso zzso A sequence analysis pipeline was developed to identify and validate zzso zzso zzso zzso the parental source of each zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso Based on zzso phased zzso zzso events in zzso were identified, and a total of zzso bins and zzso zzso intervals were zzso About zzso of bins contain 1 to 10 zzso A linkage map was subsequently constructed by using bins as molecular zzso Three zzso for zzso resistance were zzso Of these, one major zzso was mapped to bin 10 of zzso 10, which is zzso zzso in size and harbors three true genes and two zzso Based on sequence variations and zzso analysis, the candidate genes underlying the major zzso for zzso resistance were zzso They are zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor and a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso This zzso mapping approach not only combines zzso discovery, zzso zzso and zzso but also zzso the issues caused by zzso zzso and repetitive zzso zzso it can be widely used in crops with a reference zzso to enhance zzso mapping zzso
