The zzso zzso zzso is the most primitive zzso in which the major zzso complex zzso has been defined at the zzso functional, and molecular genetic zzso We previously described the isolation and characterization of zzso clones zzso zzso zzso zzso class II beta zzso In the present study, zzso clones zzso class II beta chains were isolated from zzso zzso zzso for the zzso f zzso Three class II beta chain zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso analysis of these genes showed that zzso and zzso zzso to the previously characterized zzso clones F3 and zzso respectively, whereas zzso encodes a third, zzso unidentified class II beta chain of the zzso f zzso As a representative of zzso zzso class II beta chain zzso the zzso gene underwent detailed structural zzso In addition, the zzso sequence of zzso zzso clones was zzso The zzso gene is made up of at least six zzso with an zzso organization similar to that of a typical zzso class II beta chain zzso The zzso region of the zzso gene contains zzso control elements known as zzso zzso and Y, but lacks typical zzso or zzso zzso A notable feature of the zzso zzso class II beta chain genes is that the sizes of the zzso are larger than those of their zzso zzso As assessed by northern zzso analysis, the three class II beta chain genes had similar expression patterns, with the highest level of zzso detected in the zzso Identification of the zzso zzso and zzso genes is consistent with our previous zzso which suggested that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso at the zzso level and contains three class II beta chain genes per zzso that zzso to one another under reduced stringency zzso
