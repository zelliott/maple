A zzso zzso with a molecular mass of about 25 zzso was zzso from the skin zzso of a zzso zzso common skate zzso zzso The complementary DNA sequence of the zzso was zzso zzso long and contained a reading frame zzso 226 zzso zzso which showed approximately 38% identity to zzso of zzso and zzso Gene expression was observed in the skin, zzso stomach and zzso in the healthy zzso We also identified an zzso gene from the liver whose deduced zzso sequence shared zzso identity with the skin type zzso The zzso detected protein in the skin, where the zzso is localized in the zzso cells, and in the blood zzso The zzso genes are zzso in the common skate zzso Although zzso are acute phase zzso zzso of both the zzso were not zzso after the in zzso challenge with zzso zzso coli, which suggests that they are constantly present in the skin zzso and blood plasma to protect against zzso zzso This zzso is the fifth type of zzso found in the zzso zzso of fish, demonstrating that skin zzso zzso have evolved with marked molecular diversity in zzso
