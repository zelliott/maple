zzso zzso zzso zzso protein toxins via the type II zzso system, an export mechanism comprised of numerous proteins that spans both the inner and outer zzso Two components of this zzso system, zzso and zzso form a complex in the inner membrane that functions to locate and/or assemble the zzso zzso in the outer zzso In the studies reported here, zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed that an zzso at zzso acid zzso in the zzso region of zzso did not alter zzso complex formation yet completely zzso its involvement in zzso zzso assembly and thus rendered the bacteria zzso zzso In zzso analysis of protein motifs with similar zzso acid profiles revealed that this zzso acid is located within a putative zzso zzso binding motif in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso of three highly zzso zzso acids in the motif were zzso In cells expressing each of these zzso the ability to assemble the zzso zzso or zzso zzso was lost, while zzso retained the ability to form a complex with zzso In in zzso zzso experiments, zzso zzso could be zzso to zzso whereas the three substitution zzso of zzso could zzso These data indicate that PG binding and/or zzso plays a role in the function of the zzso complex during assembly of the zzso zzso
