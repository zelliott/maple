A large number of zzso protein sequences have become available recently from a range of zzso species and especially from zzso zzso However, zzso structures are still only known for zzso zzso In this review, we use a multiple sequence alignment of all published zzso zzso zzso proteins to locate the structurally important zzso critical for maintaining the zzso fold and we investigate the degree to which functionally important zzso involved in zzso binding are zzso across zzso zzso We find that although there is a high level of zzso of positions involved in zzso zzso the mode of binding and overall shape of the zzso complex is probably zzso This implies that each species has evolved its own unique zzso zzso system through zzso zzso Nonetheless, the zzso processing mechanism in zzso zzso remains unclear because, with the exception of three zzso fish, all zzso zzso sequences discovered so far lack an ICE zzso zzso zzso cut zzso The zzso system has become an important drug target because of its significance in inflammatory zzso Research on peptides derived from zzso has identified peptides that possess zzso activity in humans and in trout, and peptides with zzso zzso The zzso peptides map to two distinct loop regions of zzso that are known to interact with the flexible domain III of the corresponding zzso Further analysis of the zzso system may prove useful in engineering zzso with improved features and in suggesting new avenues for therapeutic zzso
