zzso such as zzso zzso undergo a derived form of zzso termed long zzso zzso In long zzso insects, all of the body regions are specified by the zzso zzso Thus, the entire body plan is zzso represented on the zzso This is in contrast to short and intermediate zzso insects where only the most anterior body regions are specified by the zzso zzso zzso segments are specified later in zzso during a period of zzso zzso Although we know much about zzso zzso we still know very little about how the zzso of short and intermediate zzso insects is allocated into only the anterior zzso and how the remaining zzso segments are zzso In order to gain insight into this type of zzso we have investigated the expression and function of the zzso of the zzso gap gene zzso in an intermediate germ zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso is expressed in two zzso first in a zzso domain in the zzso and later in the zzso growth zone during zzso zzso In order to determine the genetic function of zzso we have developed a method of parental zzso in the zzso zzso Using this technique, we find that zzso zzso has two roles in zzso axis zzso First, zzso is required to suppress abdominal identity in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso it is then required for proper zzso growth and zzso In zzso bug zzso depleted for hunchback, these two effects result in animals in which a relatively normal head is followed by several segments with abdominal zzso This zzso is reminiscent to that found in zzso zzso zzso but in zzso is generated through the combination of the two separate zzso
