A gene zzso a small zzso zzso zzso protein zzso related to the zzso gene family of zzso was identified during the analysis of a salt stress suppression zzso zzso zzso expression library from the model grass species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was found to have a low-level zzso expression and was strongly induced by salt stress in zzso crown and leaf zzso The expression pattern of the zzso gene was compared against two additional stress genes identified in the zzso expression library, the zzso zzso stress tolerance zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso for a key zzso in zzso zzso and the cold response gene zzso The genes were analyzed for their response to zzso as well as their responses to 7 different forms of zzso stress in zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene displayed an expression pattern similar to the zzso zzso suggesting a role in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso gene was found to be zzso in response to all stresses tested and has utility as a general stress marker in grass zzso
