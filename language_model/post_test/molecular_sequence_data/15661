We report a targeted, cost-effective method to zzso rare zzso zzso from pooled human zzso DNA using second-generation zzso We pooled DNA from zzso individuals and targeted four genes to identify rare zzso zzso Our zzso algorithm, zzso derived from large zzso theory, detected zzso zzso present at zzso below the raw error rate of the sequencing zzso
