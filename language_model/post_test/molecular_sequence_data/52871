The zzso zzso is comprised of zzso localized within three distinct cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso by nuclear zzso translated in the zzso and targeted into these distinct zzso zzso One likely means by which to regulate the expression of the genes zzso zzso zzso is coordinated zzso zzso We have previously shown in zzso that a zzso clock regulates the expression of the nuclear genes zzso both zzso zzso small zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso components of the zzso zzso To determine whether a zzso clock also regulates the expression of genes zzso zzso components of the zzso pathway, we characterized a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We examined zzso zzso for two of these family members, including one probable zzso gene zzso and a second gene expressed zzso in roots zzso and show that both exhibit zzso zzso in zzso abundance that are in phase with those described for other zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso accumulates in zzso zzso although this response is probably an indirect consequence of the induction of photosynthesis and zzso by zzso
