The zzso zzso within zzso a zzso zzso zzso induce zzso zzso zzso zzso and are important for the zzso of mast cell zzso disease in humans as well as in zzso Despite the clinical importance of zzso mast cell tumors, no zzso has been shown within the zzso gene in zzso In the present report, we analyzed the zzso zzso sequence in the case of a cat that showed systemic zzso and zzso Within the zzso zzso prepared from the zzso mast cells, we identified an zzso internal tandem zzso at the region corresponding to zzso 8, resulting in a four zzso acid zzso between zzso zzso and zzso within the fifth zzso domain of zzso The cat underwent therapy with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso at a dose of zzso The tumor masses greatly responded and were zzso after 5 weeks of zzso zzso the number of mast cells in the peripheral blood was markedly zzso It is, therefore, considered that the internal tandem zzso within the domain contributes to the zzso transformation of mast cells in the cat by increasing zzso zzso
