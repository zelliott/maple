We have cloned two members of the zzso zzso channel family zzso and zzso from zzso zzso libraries of the zzso zzso zzso zzso At the zzso acid level, zzso is zzso identical to rat zzso and zzso is zzso identical to rat zzso zzso protection zzso revealed that zzso was mainly expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso adapted zzso Although the zzso of zzso was broadly expressed in zzso of zzso and zzso tilapia, the most intense signals were observed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso into zzso zzso did not elicit zzso zzso but these clones did functionally complement the zzso zzso of zzso a zzso strain in which a single zzso channel zzso has been disrupted by zzso zzso These results clearly indicated that zzso channels closely related to the zzso zzso zzso and -5 zzso exist also in zzso and that zzso and zzso function as zzso zzso zzso
