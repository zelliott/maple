zzso zzso of zzso zzso molecules include zzso zzso and zzso zzso For the zzso zzso E zzso in zzso zzso the corresponding zzso gene cluster contains an zzso zzso by zzso that was suspected of producing the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and not any known form of zzso zzso zzso The only known function of zzso DC is, together with zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso and we hypothesized that zzso DC zzso present in zzso zzso clusters in the absence of zzso AT zzso would be novel zzso We confirmed this by correctly predicting the zzso activity of a zzso DC zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was confirmed for a zzso DC zzso adjacent to a zzso AT zzso in a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso which was shown to be a bona fide zzso zzso These findings enable prediction of whether a zzso zzso will zzso zzso or zzso and suggest that the majority of bacteria use zzso AT and zzso DC for zzso rather than zzso zzso
