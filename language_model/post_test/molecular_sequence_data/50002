zzso cancer related gene 2 zzso is a novel candidate of the tumor zzso gene identified from human zzso To study the biological role of the zzso zzso we performed a zzso zzso zzso screening of a human fetal liver zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso as zzso we identified nine putative clones as associated zzso The interaction of zzso and zzso 2A zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso pull-down zzso in zzso and zzso experiments in zzso zzso zzso with zzso mostly to zzso and slightly to zzso as shown by zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene inhibited cell proliferation and induced zzso in zzso cancer zzso In the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso cell proliferation was inhibited and zzso was slightly induced compared with control zzso When we used zzso zzso to zzso the effect of zzso the zzso of cell proliferation and induction of zzso were significantly zzso When we used zzso zzso to zzso the effect of zzso in the group of zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso the zzso of cell proliferation and induction of zzso zzso The results provide evidence for zzso in zzso cancer cells acting as a zzso protein associated with the regulation of cell proliferation and induction of zzso zzso might reduce the function of zzso on the regulation of cell proliferation and induction of zzso The physical interaction of zzso and zzso may play an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso
