A zzso zzso technique was employed to make a library enriched for zzso zzso zzso One cloned fragment, zzso zzso under stringent conditions to DNA of 82 zzso zzso strains representing all zzso of the zzso Other zzso bacteria, including closely related species such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso did not zzso to zzso A minimum number of between 4 zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells could routinely be detected with zzso zzso either with zzso or with zzso To improve the sensitivity of zzso zzso was zzso to allow the construction of specific zzso zzso to be used for zzso chain reaction zzso zzso After 50 cycles of amplification, 5 to 116 cells, depending on the strain, could zzso be detected by zzso of a zzso zzso product on an zzso zzso A preliminary field trial in zzso with the probe and zzso zzso has confirmed that they are sensitive tools for specifically detecting low-level infections of zzso zzso in potato zzso
