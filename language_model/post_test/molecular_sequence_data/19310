We report the zzso of the first zzso zzso from the zzso zzso an zzso zzso which includes a number of important human and veterinary zzso The G zzso zzso zzso was identified from the model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the presence of motifs widely zzso amongst zzso In two different zzso zzso zzso expression in Chinese zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso was most zzso activated by zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The most potent zzso zzso in both zzso was zzso a zzso zzso known to be present in zzso zzso There was no zzso by zzso zzso another class of zzso zzso Also active were zzso peptides derived from other zzso but not known to be present in any zzso Most potent among these were zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso gene which share a zzso zzso terminal zzso The ability of zzso peptides to stimulate a zzso zzso demonstrates a degree of structural conservation between zzso zzso receptors from these two zzso distant zzso which contain zzso zzso
