DNA was extracted from an zzso zzso zzso from the zzso Desert, Chile and the zzso and animal zzso DNA zzso gene sequences were zzso to investigate the floral environment surrounding the zzso and the identity of the zzso zzso The plant zzso together with the zzso zzso suggest the presence of 13 plant families and three orders that no longer exist today at the zzso zzso and thus point to a much more diverse and humid climate zzso years zzso The zzso sequences suggest the presence of at least four different zzso which have been zzso identified as a zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso bird zzso To identify the zzso agent, DNA was extracted from pooled zzso zzso three small overlapping fragments of the zzso zzso b gene were amplified and multiple clones were zzso These results were zzso along with complete zzso b sequences for several modern zzso species to place the zzso sequence zzso The results identified the zzso agent as belonging to an ancestral zzso zzso Today, zzso zzso is not found at the zzso locality but it can be found 100 zzso to the north, indicating at least a small range zzso The more extensive sampling of modern zzso reinforces the suggestion that zzso zzso is recently derived from a peripheral zzso
