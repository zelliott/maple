zzso of different strains and zzso is a hallmark of zzso infections, particularly for human zzso virus, and contributes significantly to viral diversity and evolution both within individual hosts and within zzso zzso viruses are generated in individuals zzso or zzso with more than one zzso strain or zzso This, however, has never been described in zzso for the zzso zzso zzso virus of sheep and its closely related zzso counterpart, the zzso zzso zzso zzso infections occur in animals living under natural conditions, which suggests that dual infections with zzso zzso zzso are zzso In this paper we describe the first documented case of zzso and viral zzso in two naturally infected zzso DNA fragments encompassing a variable region of the envelope zzso were obtained from these two animals by zzso dilution zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells or infected zzso zzso zzso including zzso sequencing and zzso mobility zzso showed that these zzso zzso two distinct populations of zzso zzso analysis permitted us to assign these sequences to the zzso virus group zzso group zzso or the zzso zzso virus group zzso group zzso zzso analysis showed clear evidence of zzso zzso within the zzso gene segment of a virus detected in one of the two zzso This case provides conclusive evidence that zzso by different strains of zzso of groups A and B can indeed occur and that these viruses actually recombine in zzso
