A zzso and zzso bacterial strain, zzso isolated from desert soil of zzso China, was subjected to zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso the isolate showed closest relationship to members of the zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The strain differed from its zzso zzso by its swimming zzso in liquid cultures and the presence of long zzso and large amounts of the zzso fatty acids 16 : 0 and 18 : zzso Growth was observed at zzso degrees C zzso 30 degrees zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and in the presence of 0-3 % zzso zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso were zzso The major zzso zzso was zzso The DNA zzso content of zzso was zzso zzso The data presented in this study indicate that the isolate should be classified in a novel zzso and species within the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso AB zzso zzso zzso
