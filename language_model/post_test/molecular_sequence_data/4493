A full-length zzso to guinea pig pulmonary zzso protein zzso A was cloned by screening a newborn guinea pig lung zzso library with a human zzso zzso zzso The full-length guinea pig zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso and is highly zzso at both zzso and zzso acid sequence levels with those from other zzso As expected, guinea pig zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in adolescent lung tissue and is zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies clearly show a unique cellular distribution pattern of zzso zzso within the guinea pig zzso zzso zzso expression is confined to cells of the zzso zzso with no expression in the zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso is expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso This distinct expression pattern suggests that the guinea pig lung will be a useful model in which to study expression of zzso factors implicated in the regulation of SP zzso
