From zzso investigations and clinical studies it is known that zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit additional local actions, which are not related to zzso changes and which cannot be explained simply by interference with the zzso system with subsequent zzso of zzso II zzso Because zzso is identical to zzso II, which zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of BK might be responsible for these additional effects of zzso zzso To prove the specificity of zzso effects by zzso zzso we used the specific B2 zzso zzso zzso zzso 140 in different models: zzso cell cultures; zzso in zzso zzso zzso formation with smooth cell proliferation and migration after zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in rats, zzso and dogs; and left zzso zzso in zzso The beneficial effects of zzso or BK given in zzso zzso doses in these models were abolished by zzso 140 zzso zzso exerts zzso effects in different experimental zzso The formation of the zzso zzso zzso oxide and zzso enhanced when BK degradation is inhibited by zzso zzso may contribute to the observed beneficial zzso
