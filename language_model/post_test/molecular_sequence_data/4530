A zzso DNA region, located immediately downstream of zzso contains the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whose sequences are highly zzso to those of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso These genes occur on a transcript that does not include zzso and are transcribed from a promoter different from that zzso zzso this is the fourth promoter described within the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso were constructed and shown to be completely impaired in zzso zzso zzso shares zzso identity and zzso similarity to zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso catalyzing the formation of zzso zzso A zzso model is predicted, which supports the idea of zzso being the zzso responsible for zzso zzso
