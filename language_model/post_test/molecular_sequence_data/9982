Chemical modification studies and zzso zzso experiments have provided evidence that human zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso human gastric zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso Loss of zzso and zzso activity was also observed in the presence of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso are likewise essential for zzso zzso To study the functional role of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso we replaced these zzso acids with zzso by zzso zzso zzso at positions 227 and zzso alone or together, drastically reduced zzso activity in a zzso manner while the other zzso were not affected to any great zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were essentially inactive against zzso zzso but retained about zzso zzso and zzso of zzso activity for both zzso and zzso zzso The data obtained with the corresponding zzso zzso confirmed the importance of zzso 227 and 236 in maintaining zzso activity towards long- and zzso zzso In order to assess the contribution of the eight zzso acids zzso by zzso and zzso to zzso we generated zzso replacement zzso containing the corresponding zzso zzso of zzso or zzso Both zzso zzso were zzso active towards all three zzso zzso indicating that these zzso acids do not determine zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso as well as disruption of its zzso surface, in contrast, abolished zzso zzso Our studies suggest that zzso zzso and the zzso zzso formed by zzso zzso are essential for zzso and zzso neutral zzso zzso
