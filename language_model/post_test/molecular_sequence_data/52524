zzso the coat protein complex of coat protein zzso zzso is involved in the budding of these zzso Its interaction with the zzso zzso of some zzso members, type I zzso proteins of the zzso has been shown to induce a zzso change of zzso that zzso zzso of the zzso From zzso data it is likely that interaction of zzso with the small tail zzso involves an zzso form of the zzso zzso Here we present the structure of zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso a member of the zzso family, as determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance zzso in the presence of zzso An improved strategy for structure calculation revealed that the tail domain peptides form zzso and adopt a zzso zzso Based on these results we propose an initial model for the binding of zzso by zzso and the induced zzso change of zzso that results in its zzso zzso of the zzso membrane to form a zzso and finally a zzso zzso
