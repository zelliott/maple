Recent efforts have zzso the role of zzso protein zzso in growth, zzso and cell wall metabolism in zzso zzso Although most zzso have been investigated for their zzso roles, little information is available regarding how zzso protein zzso zzso regulates the activity of zzso zzso zzso we focused on zzso tuberculosis zzso a protein of unknown function, zzso in zzso and recently identified as a zzso of the zzso zzso We solved the solution structure of zzso by zzso zzso and demonstrated that it possesses an original winged zzso zzso indicative of a zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was subsequently confirmed by zzso zzso as well as in zzso mobility shift zzso Mass zzso analyses using a combination of zzso and zzso identified zzso as the unique zzso This was further supported by complete loss of zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity was completely zzso in a zzso zzso designed to mimic zzso zzso but not in a zzso lacking the first 13 zzso This implies that the function of the zzso extension is to provide a zzso zzso which, following zzso zzso regulates the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso extension, which bears the zzso was found to be restricted to members of the zzso tuberculosis complex, thus suggesting the existence of an original mechanism that appears to be unique to the zzso tuberculosis zzso
