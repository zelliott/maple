A naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned from the zzso zzso 1 clinical isolate and expressed in zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso zzso had a zzso of 8 and a relative molecular mass of 37 zzso and showed 50 and zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It had zzso zzso acid identity with the recently described zzso zzso zzso from zzso pneumoniae, suggesting the zzso origin of zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso was a peculiar zzso since it significantly zzso zzso Once its gene was cloned and expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso and zzso but also an uncommon reduced zzso to zzso A zzso transcribed zzso gene with an overlapping promoter compared with zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso 1, zzso an zzso protein that shared zzso zzso acid identity with the closest zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso induction experiments showed that the zzso gene was zzso in the absence of zzso and was activated when zzso or zzso was added as an zzso From zzso zzso 1 cultures that expressed an zzso zzso several zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso were obtained upon selection on zzso or zzso plates, and zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Transformation of zzso zzso 1 zzso or zzso coli zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso and zzso from zzso zzso 1 with a zzso zzso containing zzso from zzso coli resulted in a decrease in the zzso of zzso and recovery of an zzso zzso for zzso zzso 1 zzso Thus, zzso and zzso proteins may regulate zzso of the zzso zzso zzso similarly to other zzso zzso
