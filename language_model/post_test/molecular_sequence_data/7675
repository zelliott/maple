The use of the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso appears to be a particularly promising technique for detecting minimal residual disease zzso However, a major obstacle to successful zzso of this technique involves the problem of zzso evolution, in which instability of the zzso region leads to the generation of further zzso of the zzso gene over zzso Such zzso evolution results in a high likelihood of false negative results when detecting zzso using zzso zzso based on the zzso present at zzso Since in acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso evolution commonly involves zzso of the zzso joining but not the zzso joining, we have devised a novel zzso strategy to circumvent the problem of false zzso in these evolved zzso The strategy, which involves construction of overlapping zzso zzso zzso for use with a consensus zzso segment zzso can be used to amplify both evolved and zzso ALL populations with high sensitivity and zzso The method does not require zzso and should prove valuable for improving the effectiveness of zzso detection of residual zzso
