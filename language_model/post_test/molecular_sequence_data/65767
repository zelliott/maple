zzso zzso zzso can quickly locate zzso bases in an excess of undamaged zzso DNA zzso may use diffusion along DNA to facilitate zzso search, resulting in zzso the ability of zzso to zzso closely spaced zzso without zzso from zzso We propose a new zzso for correlated zzso and analyze the zzso of zzso zzso conducted correlated zzso on double- and zzso zzso the correlation declined with increasing salt zzso zzso in cell extracts also decreased zzso zzso The correlated zzso was reduced by nicks in DNA, suggesting the intact zzso backbone is important for zzso zzso
