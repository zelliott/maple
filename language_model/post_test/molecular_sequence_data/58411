Within the framework of the international zzso to sequence the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso we were allocated the region between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sequencing of this region is now complete and we report our primary analysis of the 114 zzso region containing 114 zzso In addition to previously characterized zzso we have identified genes involved in the zzso of plant cell wall zzso stress responses and the metabolism of zzso zzso cell walls, DNA and fatty zzso We also discuss various structural and physical features, including the orientation of genes with respect to zzso putative start and stop zzso zzso binding sites and zzso zzso zzso
