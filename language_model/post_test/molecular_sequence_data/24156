zzso damage represents a major threat to zzso stability, as the major product of DNA zzso zzso zzso frequently zzso with zzso during zzso In order to prevent these zzso events, organisms have evolved zzso zzso that remove this oxidized base from zzso We were interested to find out how GO is processed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso which lives at temperatures around 100 degrees zzso To this end, we searched its zzso for open reading frames zzso bearing the principal hallmark of zzso zzso a zzso motif and a zzso sequence followed by an absolutely zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, although the zzso zzso encodes three such zzso none of these encodes the potent zzso activity detected in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso followed by analysis of the active zzso by zzso zzso gel zzso showed that the zzso zzso has a molecular size of approximately 30 zzso Mass zzso analysis of proteins in this size range identified several peptides originating from zzso zzso zzso We now show that zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso the founding member of a new family of DNA zzso which can remove GO from zzso and zzso zzso with great zzso
