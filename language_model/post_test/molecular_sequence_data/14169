The complex symbiotic relationship between zzso and their zzso partner zzso is believed to be sustained through close associations with zzso bacterial communities, though little is known about coral associations with bacterial groups able to fix nitrogen zzso In this study, we investigated the diversity of zzso bacterial communities associated with three common coral species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from three zzso locations of the Great zzso zzso zzso by profiling the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso iron zzso Comparisons of zzso community diversity among coral tissue and zzso zzso and the surrounding seawater revealed that zzso harbor diverse zzso zzso that differ between tissue and zzso zzso Coral zzso zzso sequences displayed high zzso and many bacterial groups overlapped with those found in zzso Moreover, coral zzso zzso were specific neither to coral species nor to reef location, reflecting the ephemeral nature of coral zzso In contrast, the dominant zzso bacteria in tissue samples differed among coral species, with differences remaining consistent at all three zzso indicating that zzso associations are species zzso zzso dominant zzso for all coral species were closely related to the bacterial group zzso which represented zzso of the total sequences retrieved from tissue zzso The species specificity of zzso associations further supports the coral zzso model that bacterial groups associated with zzso are zzso Our results suggest that, as in zzso plants, zzso have developed a zzso relationship with zzso and may contribute fixed nitrogen to zzso
