zzso of the gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein cardiac zzso T are responsible for zzso of all cases of familial zzso zzso the leading cause of sudden death in young zzso zzso proteins are thought to act through a zzso mode that zzso function of heart zzso zzso zzso can also lead to zzso zzso a leading cause of heart zzso Despite the importance of cardiac zzso T in human disease, its zzso zzso has not been zzso We show that the zzso silent heart zzso zzso affects the gene zzso We characterize two zzso zzso of zzso that severely reduce zzso expression: one affects zzso zzso and the other affects gene zzso zzso together with zzso zzso and cardiac zzso C and I zzso forms a zzso regulatory complex within zzso zzso in addition to loss of zzso expression in zzso zzso hearts, we observed a significant reduction in zzso and zzso and consequently, severe zzso zzso This zzso of zzso protein expression led us to zzso that some zzso in zzso may trigger zzso of zzso protein zzso resulting in zzso loss and zzso zzso the life-threatening hallmarks of zzso zzso in mice and zzso
