zzso zzso zzso has the capacity to zzso a 76 zzso acid protein that is highly zzso in other zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso The time course analysis by Western zzso using zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso is expressed as a typical zzso late zzso The zzso protein can be detected in both the virus infected zzso and membrane zzso even though the zzso protein does not possess a predicted zzso zzso The protein was found to be associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mature virus zzso as determined by Western zzso with zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso protein associated with the zzso can be surface labeled with zzso zzso and is released from the zzso zzso with treatment of zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso protein is associated with the outer membrane of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso protein zzso was observed to bind tightly to zzso zzso unlike the six other zzso zzso zzso surface zzso suggesting an unusual zzso zzso such as zzso zzso attempts to generate the zzso deletion zzso using standard zzso zzso technique with zzso coli zzso gene as a positive selection marker were zzso Although zzso analysis clearly indicated the presence of the correctly targeted zzso deletion zzso in mixed zzso virus plaques selected with zzso acid zzso repeated passages and zzso failed to segregate the pure zzso deletion zzso from either single crossover zzso or zzso wild type parental zzso Taken together, our data strongly indicate that the zzso is a novel zzso zzso associated protein that is essential for virus zzso
