The zzso portion of the zzso protein from the zzso A virus has been studied in hydrated zzso zzso zzso with solid-state zzso zzso constraints were obtained from zzso labeled zzso samples mechanically aligned between thin glass zzso zzso chemical shifts from single site labeled samples zzso the molecular frame with respect to the magnetic zzso When these constraints are applied to the zzso modeled as a uniform zzso the tilt of the zzso with respect to the zzso normal was determined to be 33 degrees zzso 3 zzso Furthermore, the orientation about the zzso axis was also determined within an error of zzso 30 zzso These results imply that the packing of this zzso protein is in a left-handed zzso zzso Only with such a large tilt angle are the zzso zzso aligned to the channel zzso
