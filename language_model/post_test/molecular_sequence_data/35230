zzso zzso zzso blood stages express zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso which is implicated in regulating zzso during red blood cell zzso Recent data using the zzso zzso zzso malaria model suggested an additional role for zzso in the infection of zzso by zzso and during zzso zzso Here we further characterize the role of zzso zzso during infection with zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso was zzso to targeted gene deletion indicating an essential function during asexual zzso zzso but significant zzso of zzso using a regulated system did not impact zzso zzso zzso localized to zzso within the asexual zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso and was exported to dynamic zzso structures in the infected zzso In zzso expression was observed in zzso in addition to zzso zzso distinct from zzso containing zzso During zzso development, zzso was confined to the zzso compartment until the final phase of zzso development when, after zzso zzso breakdown, it was released into the infected zzso Finally, we identified the zzso zzso zzso as a binding partner of zzso during zzso zzso These data show that zzso may be important in regulating zzso processes during zzso development, and is likely playing a role in liver zzso interactions at the time of zzso zzso zzso
