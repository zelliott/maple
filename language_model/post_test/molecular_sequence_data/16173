The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and growth factor that is zzso by various neural and neuroendocrine zzso The major zzso hormone zzso I) contains both zzso and a novel zzso extension zzso termed zzso In order to define potentially active zzso that could be generated from this novel protein domain, we analyzed the zzso processing of zzso human zzso in a zzso lung cancer cell zzso Because such studies are much easier in an zzso system, we investigated at the same time the zzso processing of zzso human zzso in an insect zzso cell zzso In the zzso lung cancer cell line, zzso was zzso as expected from the zzso zzso at a pair of basic zzso acids (29 and 30) and zzso at its zzso zzso however, a number of novel peptides were generated by additional zzso in the zzso zzso In the insect zzso cell line, zzso was zzso from the expressed zzso by a different zzso as were a number of other peptides that appeared to be similar in size to those produced by the human neuroendocrine tumor cell zzso These data show for the first time that an insect zzso cell line that is widely used to zzso proteins can process a human zzso zzso They also reveal the existence of novel zzso peptides that are candidates for biologically active zzso
