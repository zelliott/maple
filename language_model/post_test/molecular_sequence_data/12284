Two species belonging to a novel zzso of zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been isolated from two different zzso locations in northern zzso One habitat harboring both organisms was a dry, extremely zzso soil zzso zzso zzso that was heated by zzso gases to about 55 degrees zzso In the laboratory both species grew zzso on zzso extract and poorly on zzso under zzso conditions at temperatures between 45 and 65 degrees zzso they grew zzso at 60 degrees zzso The pH optimum was zzso but growth occurred even around pH zzso Under optimal conditions, the generation time was about 6 zzso yielding zzso of up to zzso cells per zzso The cells were surrounded by a highly filigreed regular zzso zzso and the core lipids of the membrane were mainly zzso The zzso zzso sequences of the two species were about zzso zzso The complete zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso was zzso different from that of the closest relative, zzso zzso The zzso and zzso properties of the two species characterize zzso as a novel zzso that is a member of a novel family within the order zzso
