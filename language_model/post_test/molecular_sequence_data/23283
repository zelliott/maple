The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is zzso at the zzso transition of the cell cycle by the zzso zzso Although the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso is implicated in zzso degradation, zzso of zzso at the zzso transition proceeds normally in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is exported from the nucleus to the zzso at zzso zzso zzso These data suggest the existence of a zzso zzso for the degradation of zzso at zzso zzso We now describe a previously unidentified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso and zzso zzso contains a zzso domain, and zzso contains a zzso domain and two zzso zzso zzso interacts with and zzso zzso and is localized to the zzso zzso of zzso promoted the degradation of zzso whereas a zzso zzso of zzso delayed zzso zzso The nuclear export of zzso by zzso seems to be necessary for zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference also inhibited zzso zzso zzso thus probably controls degradation of zzso in zzso phase after export of the latter from the zzso
