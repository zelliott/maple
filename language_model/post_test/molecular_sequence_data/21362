Since the discovery of the zzso fever agent, zzso zzso in the 19th century, six zzso zzso zzso species were recognized over the next zzso More recently the number of novel zzso species has increased and among them, isolation of species zzso zzso and zzso zzso from marine zzso raised many questions about their origin as well as on the evolutionary history of the whole zzso 

We report here on the first complete zzso sequence of a zzso strain isolated from marine zzso zzso zzso strain zzso A whole zzso zzso analysis shows that five main groups of zzso zzso species rapidly zzso from a likely zzso zzso close to the recently isolated zzso zzso However, this tree lacks the resolution required to resolve the order of divergence of those zzso Comparative analyses focusing on a) zzso segments zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso b) gene zzso events and c) positions and numbers of zzso specific zzso elements in the available zzso zzso provided enough information to propose a branching order for those five zzso 

In this study, it appears that the closest relatives of marine zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from a zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and finally the group consisting of zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and the group consisting of the single zzso zzso zzso We were not able, however, to resolve the order of divergence of the two latter zzso
