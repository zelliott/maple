The expression of many genes of zzso zzso such as zzso is regulated by zzso and zzso In this work, a zzso strain has been constructed in which zzso expression is controlled by the zzso zzso Using this strain, three genes were isolated which, when introduced as zzso abolish the repression caused by zzso via the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that two of these three zzso designated as zzso and zzso clearly increased the expression of zzso zzso is more effective for zzso expression than zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso was essential for the expression of zzso but that zzso was zzso The sequence of the zzso gene was shown to be identical to that of zzso (also called zzso which encodes a protein required for the expression of zzso zzso is a new gene and is capable of zzso 525 zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso involving zzso fusion genes showed that zzso zzso resulted in an increase in the expression of both zzso and zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso and zzso gene products have an important regulatory function for gene expression of not only zzso but also zzso
