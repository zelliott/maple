The zzso for zzso a structural protein of the zzso of zzso zzso had been previously cloned and characterized zzso zzso Schwartz, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso a structure protein of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the labeled zzso for zzso as a probe to screen a library of zzso DNA from zzso zzso we isolated a zzso clone for zzso A zzso pair zzso restriction zzso containing the zzso gene was zzso The coding region is separated by a zzso zzso which is located close to the translation start zzso Three putative zzso response elements zzso are identified in the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso regions of the zzso gene with those of the zzso gene expressed in the accessory zzso of zzso reveals similar sequences present in the zzso regions of the two zzso The zzso organization of the coding region of the zzso gene shares similarities with that of the zzso zzso three zzso accessory zzso genes and two zzso zzso zzso zzso
