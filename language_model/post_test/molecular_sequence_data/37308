zzso zzso zzso zzso is a universal second zzso that, in zzso was believed to act only on zzso protein zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso exchange factors specific for the small zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso were zzso which are also activated directly by zzso Here, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the regulatory domain of zzso which consists of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first structure of a zzso domain in the absence of zzso and comparison with previous structures, sequence alignment and zzso experiments allow us to delineate a mechanism for zzso zzso zzso change and zzso that is most likely zzso for all zzso zzso We identify a hinge region that couples zzso binding to a zzso change of the zzso zzso zzso in the hinge of zzso can zzso zzso binding from its exchange zzso
