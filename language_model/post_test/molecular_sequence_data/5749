zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso cause sensory organ zzso and loss zzso indistinguishable at the cellular level from those caused by zzso zzso in the genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have carried out a molecular analysis of the structure and expression of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We find that the zzso transcript is truncated and accumulates to substantially higher levels in the zzso zzso due to the zzso of a zzso element of the blood family in the zzso 3' untranslated region zzso The zzso zzso 3' zzso includes three copies of a zzso sequence zzso that we refer to as the zzso zzso Moreover, the 3' zzso of zzso and of the zzso zzso unit of the zzso of split gene complex zzso exhibit an unusually high degree of sequence identity that includes not only zzso box sequences but also a second motif we refer to as the zzso zzso zzso We find that both the zzso box and the zzso box are also present in the 3' zzso of several basic zzso zzso genes of the zzso often in multiple copies, suggesting that a novel mode of zzso regulation applies to zzso and many zzso zzso The fact that the more abundant zzso zzso zzso lacks the zzso box and two of the zzso boxes present in zzso zzso zzso suggests that either or both of these elements may zzso instability on transcripts that contain zzso Finally, we find that zzso encodes a novel small protein of only 81 zzso acids that is predicted to include a basic zzso zzso The deduced zzso protein shows sequence similarity to the zzso zzso which is likewise expected to include a basic zzso zzso suggesting that the two proteins have related zzso zzso
