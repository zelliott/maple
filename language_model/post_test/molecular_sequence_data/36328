zzso is associated with a neurological syndrome designated Tropical zzso zzso associated zzso zzso To determine whether zzso can replicate in human primary zzso and thus contribute to zzso dissemination in the nervous system, zzso human zzso were infected zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso from patients with adult zzso leukemia and zzso zzso zzso production was monitored by measuring the viral zzso gag zzso in the cell culture zzso by electron zzso zzso and by zzso chain reaction zzso on viral DNA and zzso The zzso zzso gag zzso was detected 21 days after infection with either zzso and the presence of mature viral particles was demonstrated by electron zzso one month after zzso zzso sequences were amplified by zzso analysis of the infected zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso and zzso proteins zzso by the zzso region were readily identified by reverse zzso zzso Altogether, these data indicate that zzso replication occurs in zzso in primary human zzso Whether zzso infection occurs also in zzso and is a crucial step in the induction of the neurological manifestations observed in zzso remains an open zzso
