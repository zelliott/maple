zzso factor zzso was reported as a zzso regulator that binds to a specific zzso sequence in the zzso growth factor zzso zzso gene promoter and zzso its zzso In this paper, we present the data on three revisions of the zzso sequence that lead to significant changes of the zzso acid sequences of the published zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso end zzso analysis revealed that the 308 zzso of zzso of the previously published zzso zzso does not exist at the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the correct zzso zzso sequence of 31 zzso was zzso zzso the zzso at the position 787 of the published zzso zzso was not zzso Finally, a new sequence of 114 zzso was identified between the positions zzso and 852 of the published zzso zzso The revisions result in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso that encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso replacing the highly basic region of the zzso of the published zzso with a new sequence of 147 zzso zzso In this era of massive gene cloning and sequencing, this study is a warning to the biological research of recent zzso
