zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is an zzso cell surface zzso that mediates zzso of zzso melanoma cells to lung zzso Here we analyze the organization of the zzso protein complex, report the sequence of zzso zzso and reveal a novel function of the zzso zzso zzso from bovine zzso zzso cells zzso consists of tightly associated zzso of 90, 38, and 32 zzso with minor components of 130 and 120 zzso We present evidence that all of these protein species are zzso by a single open reading frame whose initial translation product is zzso processed to yield the other zzso zzso processing in zzso was demonstrated by zzso of the longest zzso into human embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the approximately zzso precursor gave rise to zzso and zzso zzso zzso blots of zzso zzso detected messages in agreement with the sizes of the zzso clones in addition to several of high molecular zzso DNA zzso analysis showed that zzso is zzso throughout its length in all zzso tested, usually as a single or low copy zzso In the zzso zzso protein is zzso identical to a zzso zzso channel described recently in zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and protein confirmed the presence of a zzso in this zzso We show that messages for both proteins are present in lung while only zzso is present in trachea and only zzso is present in zzso These results suggest that zzso cells express a zzso channel that is related to, but distinct from, that expressed in zzso zzso They further suggest that an zzso zzso can also be a zzso zzso
