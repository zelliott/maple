Like the zzso and zzso the zzso also perform N zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso as a model system, a series of zzso proteins involved in the zzso version of this zzso modification has been zzso In the present study, the participation of zzso in N zzso was considered, given its zzso to a known component of the zzso zzso zzso and because of the zzso proximity of zzso to zzso genes zzso known elements of the zzso zzso zzso zzso By combining the deletion of zzso with mass zzso analysis of both zzso zzso zzso carriers and the zzso zzso evidence was obtained showing the participation of zzso renamed zzso in adding the first zzso of the zzso zzso decorating this reporter zzso The deletion of zzso however, did not fully prevent the attachment of a zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Moreover, in the absence of zzso the level of only one of the three zzso zzso zzso carriers detected in the cell was zzso Nonetheless, in cells lacking zzso no further sugar zzso were added to the remaining zzso zzso zzso carriers or to the zzso zzso zzso pointing to the importance of the sugar added through the actions of zzso for proper N zzso Finally, while zzso can be deleted, zzso zzso surface layer integrity is compromised in the absence of the zzso zzso
