The target zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso disease is the zzso domain of the alpha 3 chain of type IV zzso A panel of zzso peptides was used to identify zzso regions within the zzso and the significance of the binding by zzso studies using soluble zzso and by a structural analysis of the zzso was zzso A total of 117 overlapping zzso peptides spanning the entire zzso was simultaneously zzso as individual spots on a cellulose zzso All nine patients' zzso bound to the zzso with a zzso pattern of peptides recognized by all zzso zzso studies were performed using a panel of overlapping zzso zzso also spanning the entire zzso zzso from the regions that bound zzso were able to inhibit the binding of zzso to native zzso zzso of the secondary structure of the zzso domain of the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen were performed by a conventional zzso plot and by multiple alignment of zzso alpha chains of type IV collagen and comparison with a structural data zzso The core peptides binding and zzso zzso zzso were predicted to be surface exposed and zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso can be mapped using linear zzso
