In this study, we describe the first zzso molecular models of the zzso zzso II, that is found in the primary cell walls of all higher zzso The 750 zzso zzso zzso data previously reported and new zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso and zzso were first reassigned in light of the modifications in the primary zzso In turn, the experimental zzso data revealed the presence of an additional sugar, zzso zzso and also the zzso repeating unit of zzso another component of the zzso zzso Due to a fuller picture of the primary structure of zzso a much more complete assignment of the zzso data has been zzso A systematic zzso study based on these zzso lead us to a realistic three-dimensional description of the zzso in excellent agreement with the molecular dimensions obtained from various experimental zzso
