To clone zzso zzso zzso zzso to construct zzso expression system of the gene and to identify zzso of the fusion zzso 

The zzso gene from a clinical isolate zzso of zzso was amplified by high zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the target DNA amplification zzso was zzso after zzso zzso The expression zzso zzso with inserted zzso gene was zzso zzso fusion protein was expressed in zzso strain zzso induced by zzso at different zzso Western zzso using zzso against whole cell of zzso as well as zzso zzso using zzso of rabbit against the fusion protein was applied to determine zzso of the fusion zzso 

In comparison with the reported corresponding zzso the zzso of zzso sequence of the cloned zzso gene was from zzso zzso equals zzso while the zzso of its putative zzso acid sequence was as high as zzso zzso equals zzso The expression output of zzso protein in zzso system was approximately zzso the total bacterial zzso zzso protein was able to combine with zzso against whole cell of zzso and induce rabbit to produce high zzso zzso after the animal was zzso with the zzso 

An expression system with high efficiency of zzso zzso gene has been established zzso The expressed zzso protein with satisfactory zzso and zzso can be used as zzso in zzso zzso
