The activity of Ras family proteins is modulated in zzso by the function of zzso zzso zzso which increase their intrinsic rate of zzso zzso We have isolated zzso zzso a GAP for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes an zzso acid protein with a central region that displays substantial sequence similarity to human zzso This domain, when expressed in zzso coli, zzso stimulates zzso zzso activity in zzso Unlike zzso which is zzso zzso zzso expression is highly zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in the developing zzso cells and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is also localized in the pole zzso in an zzso zzso Although zzso that completely abolish zzso function display no obvious zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a rough eye zzso that is exacerbated by reducing zzso gene zzso Thus, zzso can function as a negative regulator of zzso signaling in zzso
