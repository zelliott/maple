Two overlapping zzso clones spanning zzso zzso of cotton DNA were found to zzso a zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso A partial zzso zzso clone was also zzso The zzso gene has one large zzso of zzso zzso entirely within its zzso region, only 12 zzso upstream from the zzso initiation zzso Several potential promoter zzso including several zzso zzso occur in the zzso zzso The continuous zzso coding region is 1155 zzso and would zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso The zzso has four putative zzso zzso indicative of an integral membrane zzso and is most likely localized in the zzso zzso zzso cells transformed with a zzso construct containing the cotton zzso coding region accumulate an appreciable amount of zzso acid zzso not normally present in zzso zzso cells, indicating that the gene encodes a functional zzso zzso
