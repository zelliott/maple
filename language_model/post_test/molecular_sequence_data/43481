The in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso human zzso K zzso zzso was examined by zzso zzso K was expressed as a zzso zzso using zzso zzso insect zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso K occurred at pH 4 and was zzso by zzso mature zzso zzso Three zzso were identified as resulting from zzso after zzso zzso and zzso The mature zzso was composed of mixture of zzso with N zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with varying ratios depending on the zzso zzso weight zzso were consistent with the absence of zzso in the mature zzso while zzso mass zzso indicated that six of the eight zzso zzso were in zzso linkage, and that the protein had zzso as the zzso zzso A zzso was constructed in which the active site zzso was changed to zzso zzso K zzso zzso zzso failed to spontaneously process and was only partially processed in the presence of zzso zzso zzso mature zzso K forming zzso which were identical to those observed in the zzso of zzso zzso K could be fully processed to mature zzso by including one equivalent of zzso zzso K in the zzso zzso These results indicated that in zzso zzso of the zzso K was an zzso zzso
