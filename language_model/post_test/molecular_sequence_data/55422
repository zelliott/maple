In northeast China there are large areas of nearly bare soda zzso soil, in which plant survival is zzso difficult because the land has a pH greater than zzso In order to obtain resistant microbial resources able to grow in such conditions, we analyzed environmental microbial samples from this extreme zzso soil zzso Through selective culture conditions, 8 bacterial strains were isolated from medium with no less than zzso M zzso 12 were isolated in the medium with a pH value of no less than zzso and 8 were isolated in the medium with of no less than 200 zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence analysis 20 novel strains of bacteria were identified and classified into four groups: 8 group I strains belong to the zzso zzso three group II belong to zzso zzso (2 zzso and zzso zzso (1 zzso eight group III strains belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso one group IV strain belongs to zzso zzso These four groups belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sequence zzso of zzso zzso in strains zzso zzso and zzso with that of known strains was zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the zzso identity zzso commonly used to discriminate bacterial species, our data suggest that zzso zzso and zzso may be new species, and zzso may be belong to a new zzso of classified into order zzso The zzso characteristics by scanning electron zzso zzso showed that, in addition to the zzso zzso the majority zzso of the zzso are zzso of various zzso In culture the colonies appeared red, orange, yellow, light yellow, and zzso with zzso being zzso Based on the resistance to zzso and zzso the 20 novel strains were classified into zzso zzso and zzso bacteria, zzso zzso zzso bacteria, and zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first study reporting the isolation and characterization of bacterial resources from extreme zzso zzso from northeast zzso
