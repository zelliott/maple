zzso is a zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso portion of the B3 zzso in a zzso form, which serves as the targeting zzso is fused to zzso a truncated form of zzso zzso A, which serves as the zzso zzso zzso is specifically zzso to many human cancer cell lines and is currently evaluated in a clinical zzso zzso zzso B3 zzso and B5 zzso recognize related zzso zzso on human zzso zzso The zzso regions of these zzso were previously cloned and expressed as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso binds to zzso cancer cells with a higher affinity than zzso and is a more potent zzso agent than zzso However, it is less stable and rapidly zzso upon incubation at 37 degrees zzso The zzso zzso of the two zzso are very similar, differing by only three zzso the fourth and seventh zzso zzso and the fifth zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the two zzso vary zzso To investigate whether any of the different zzso zzso may influence the stability of the zzso we constructed a zzso zzso containing the zzso and the zzso This zzso had an improved stability and a higher apparent zzso binding affinity and zzso activity when compared with zzso zzso zzso was used to show that the zzso zzso zzso has an important role in stabilizing zzso although zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also play a role in the increased zzso When tested in an in zzso model system, the zzso containing the zzso and the zzso had an improved zzso activity in a human zzso mouse zzso These studies indicate that the common use of zzso zzso zzso to clone zzso fragments may introduce zzso zzso
