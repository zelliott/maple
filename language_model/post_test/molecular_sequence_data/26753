Recently, zzso et zzso zzso presented a zzso revision of the zzso zzso based on zzso zzso They identified five main zzso genetic lineages and suggested to zzso several of zzso According to these authors, the genetic lineage previously thought to belong to zzso zzso zzso zzso should be assigned to zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso should be considered as a junior synonym of zzso zzso Using molecular and zzso data from a large sampling of zzso zzso the aim of the present study was to investigate the zzso status of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study reveals that, contrary to zzso et zzso statement, both genetic lineages zzso and zzso occur in zzso zzso Province, close to the type locality of zzso zzso We also show that the external zzso and color pattern of zzso zzso are highly similar to those of zzso specimens but are not consistent with the zzso of zzso zzso Therefore these results strongly suggest that zzso zzso should be assigned to the genetic lineage zzso zzso zzso zzso should not be considered as a junior synonym of zzso zzso and this study confirms that the appropriate name of the genetic lineage zzso is zzso zzso Moreover, as our results show that zzso zzso should be assigned to the lineage zzso this name has zzso priority over zzso zzso the species name suggested by zzso et zzso zzso for this zzso
