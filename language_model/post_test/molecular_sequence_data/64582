zzso is a zzso zzso protein from zzso coli that has been shown to inhibit zzso many zzso zzso zzso of widely varying zzso zzso To help zzso the zzso function of zzso we examined the family of zzso zzso which are present in a subset of zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso has an zzso target, possibly zzso zzso zzso protein was expressed and zzso from zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso all species that encounter the zzso immune system, and also from the plant pathogen zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less zzso than the other zzso All four zzso are zzso proteins that zzso inhibit zzso zzso the pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso while showing more variable zzso (5 zzso to 24 zzso of the blood zzso Factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To test whether zzso does, in fact, protect bacteria from zzso zzso an zzso strain was generated in zzso zzso This strain is significantly more sensitive in zzso zzso to human zzso zzso which causes increased zzso of the outer membrane that persists even during renewed bacterial zzso zzso affects primarily the ability of zzso coli to recover and grow following treatment with zzso zzso rather than the actual rate of zzso This suggests that an important part of the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso may be a zzso zzso effect of zzso that has zzso across the damaged outer zzso
