The zzso zzso zzso zzso the first two reactions in the zzso leading to the formation of zzso from zzso zzso zzso are potent zzso acid zzso possessing biological activities that suggest a role in the zzso of allergic and inflammatory zzso To obtain structural information about zzso for use in developing zzso zzso agents, the zzso was zzso from human zzso zzso and the zzso acid sequences were determined for several zzso zzso zzso A zzso clone zzso a zzso acid protein containing all of the derived zzso sequences was isolated from a zzso zzso differentiated zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was detected only in differentiated zzso cells and not in the zzso cell line, indicating that the expression of zzso in this cell line is zzso zzso In addition, the human protein displays some zzso acid sequence zzso with several zzso and significant zzso with the partial sequences of soybean and zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to be a member of a larger family of related zzso
