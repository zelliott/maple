zzso of the zzso growth factor transforming growth zzso 1 zzso beta 1) has been connected to numerous diseases in zzso zzso beta 1 expression is largely governed by three zzso binding sites located in two different promoters of this zzso We have examined the ability of zzso receptors to inhibit the activity of the two promoters (especially the promoter 1) by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso When the zzso beta 1 promoter activity is induced by zzso zzso (an zzso of zzso gene zzso this activity can be strongly zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso X zzso zzso zzso as well as other members of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso was hormone dependent and a function of zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha or zzso beta with zzso alpha did not modify the zzso activities of these zzso indicating that zzso formation is not required for zzso of zzso zzso On further examining the zzso activity of zzso alpha we observed that three different zzso promoters zzso beta 1, zzso and zzso can be zzso Using gel shift zzso we demonstrated that zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso DNA binding and that zzso zzso enhances this zzso suggesting that a mechanism involving direct zzso interaction between zzso and zzso components mediates the zzso effect observed in zzso zzso analyses with zzso alpha point zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso activity of zzso alpha in zzso Thus both types of zzso receptors can inhibit zzso zzso including the zzso beta 1 gene promoter, via a mechanism that involves zzso zzso
