Blood vessels change their caliber to adapt to the demands of zzso or zzso for oxygen and zzso This event is mainly organized at the zzso level and requires a zzso zzso However, the molecular regulatory mechanism involved in caliber size modification in blood vessels is not zzso Here we show that zzso a protein zzso from zzso cells under the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells, plays a role in the regulation of caliber size of blood vessel through its zzso zzso zzso which is expressed on zzso zzso During early zzso zzso is expressed on zzso cells of the new blood vessels zzso from the zzso zzso but not on pre-existing zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso mice showed narrow blood vessels in zzso vessels during zzso zzso enhanced zzso cell proliferation in the presence of vascular zzso growth factor and promoted zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso system is involved in the regulation of blood vessel diameter during zzso
