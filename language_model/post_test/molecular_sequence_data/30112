The folding mechanism for zzso T4 zzso is best described by a zzso box zzso zzso where N indicates native, zzso the unfolded form with the zzso zzso zzso zzso unfolded with the trans zzso zzso and It a compact form with a trans zzso zzso Both manual mixing zzso and zzso zzso indicate that there is a zzso zzso zzso that is important to the folding zzso Furthermore, the data suggest that the zzso zzso can also occur in a compact zzso state which is referred to as zzso The slow phase seen in zzso seems to be monitoring the zzso zzso in the compact form, not the zzso which occurs in the zzso zzso
