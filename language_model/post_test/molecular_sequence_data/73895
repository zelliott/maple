zzso chain zzso techniques were used to study the molecular defects of zzso unrelated zzso zzso in zzso Analysis of artificially created restriction sites and zzso chain reaction were performed to detect four common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso zzso and a zzso form of delta zzso in the Chinese zzso In cases with negative or ambiguous results with the aforementioned methods, direct DNA cycle sequencing using either zzso or a fluorescent dye zzso was carried out to determine the zzso A total of 14 different zzso have been found in this zzso The zzso zzso was the most common zzso followed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The four common zzso accounted for zzso of zzso Two new zzso were zzso zzso 31 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both defects resulted in a zzso and a premature zzso the former at zzso 60, the latter at zzso zzso Although we have studied our cases zzso the molecular defects in seven zzso are still zzso
