A novel zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from oil production water collected from Alaska, zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso rods zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA of strain zzso was zzso zzso The optimum temperature, pH and zzso concentration for growth of strain zzso were 55 zzso pH 7 and 10 g zzso zzso The zzso fermented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso When grown on zzso zzso zzso hydrogen and zzso zzso zzso were produced per zzso zzso zzso sulfur and zzso were reduced to zzso and zzso was reduced to zzso with zzso as the electron zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that strain zzso was related to zzso zzso zzso similarity to the type zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso strain zzso fermented zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The major cellular fatty acid of strain zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso also contained zzso zzso zzso which was absent from zzso zzso and zzso zzso which was absent from zzso zzso On the basis of these results, strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso
