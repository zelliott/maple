A full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library constructed from the zzso zzso isolated from lettuce seeds incubated under red zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso and the deduced sequence of zzso acids showed a high degree of zzso to those of the zzso zzso zzso from other zzso Northern and zzso analyses of zzso zzso extracted from the seeds incubated under various light conditions showed that the zzso of the gene for zzso zzso during zzso of lettuce seeds is directly or indirectly regulated by zzso
