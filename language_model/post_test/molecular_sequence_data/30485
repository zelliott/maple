We describe the construction and use of two classes of zzso cloning zzso The first class comprises the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that can be used for the expression in zzso coli of proteins zzso by zzso zzso This is achieved by the fusion of zzso open reading frames to the zzso gene 10 promoter and zzso zzso The second class, the zzso zzso zzso allows the generation of large amounts of zzso DNA or synthetic zzso that can be used in zzso zzso zzso Both classes of zzso are designed to allow directional zzso cloning with zzso protection of internal restriction zzso In addition, they are designed to facilitate conversion from zzso zzso to zzso clones using a genetic method based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso system; we refer to this as automatic zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso arms, zzso zzso used in the construction of these zzso have unique restriction sites positioned between the two zzso zzso zzso of a specialized zzso between these sites will convert it into a zzso zzso zzso cloning zzso with automatic zzso zzso zzso
