The zzso gene expression zzso system, which was discovered in zzso zzso was adapted to zzso zzso by zzso zzso promoter zzso and zzso DNA fragments into the zzso zzso zzso shuttle zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso was capable of expressing the zzso zzso gene zzso under zzso zzso zzso of induction factors for this zzso zzso system, including zzso concentration zzso 50 zzso growth phase of culture at which zzso be added zzso at the early exponential zzso and the best time for analyzing the gene product after zzso zzso at the 3rd zzso allowed the zzso product to be expressed in high zzso zzso up to about zzso of the total zzso zzso Furthermore, the signal zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso was zzso to the downstream of zzso in zzso upgrading this zzso to a zzso zzso level, which was then designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso using an zzso gene zzso gene lacking its zzso as a reporter revealed the 3rd h after induction as the zzso peak of this system, at which the zzso efficiency and the amount of zzso being zzso into the culture zzso were estimated to reach zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso products by zzso in zzso zzso was also confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso
