zzso regulatory mechanisms zzso zzso control upon zzso switches characteristic of gene zzso We have exploited zzso modeling with experimental validation to resolve an anomalous relationship between zzso expression and protein zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso complex zzso zzso synthesis to a low, constant rate independent of zzso zzso expression zzso Dynamic model simulations predicted an zzso zzso factor to account for this relationship and led to the identification of a truncated form of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso constituent that mediates binding to target zzso The truncated zzso zzso shields zzso transcripts from the zzso zzso complex, thereby dictating a zzso zzso of zzso target zzso zzso zzso is generated by zzso conversion of a zzso zzso in the zzso sequence to a stop zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed multiple candidate zzso targets, including the zzso target zzso suggesting a general mechanism for production of C zzso regulatory zzso
