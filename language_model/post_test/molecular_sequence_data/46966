The human zzso virus type 1 zzso is a zzso protein that is incorporated in trans into viral zzso presumably via an interaction with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso Recently, several studies demonstrated that zzso fusion proteins could be used as zzso zzso zzso In this study, we compared different zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins for their zzso incorporation ability and their effect on the zzso of zzso zzso Our deletion analysis indicates that both the zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso domain located in the middle region of zzso are required for optimal zzso incorporation of zzso fusion zzso The zzso basic region, associated with zzso ability to mediate cell cycle arrest in zzso was not required for zzso zzso thus allowing the development of zzso zzso proteins devoid of any effect on cell zzso The fusion of zzso at the zzso or zzso of zzso targeted with equal efficiency the zzso protein into zzso While the zzso incorporation of most zzso fusion proteins tested in this study was dependent on the presence of an intact zzso domain, fusion proteins containing only the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso acid 1 to zzso were incorporated into zzso in a zzso zzso zzso incorporation of zzso fusion proteins was shown to decrease viral zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso zzso sites between zzso and zzso not only efficiently delivered and released the zzso zzso product into zzso viral zzso but also greatly zzso the zzso of progeny zzso zzso Overall, our zzso zzso defines the zzso sequence requirement and zzso necessary for the specific and optimal incorporation of zzso fusion protein into zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso fusion proteins have the ability to suppress zzso zzso by targeting multiple steps of viral zzso
