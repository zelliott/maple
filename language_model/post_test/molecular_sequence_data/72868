In this article we describe the molecular cloning of zzso a novel highly zzso zzso protein consisting of 290 zzso zzso zzso was isolated by a zzso zzso screen as an zzso of nuclear factor zzso box zzso factor zzso which is known to stimulate zzso DNA replication and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso in all human zzso zzso About zzso of all zzso zzso contain a short zzso pair zzso in their zzso regions, indicative of alternative zzso zzso Multiple zzso transcripts are expressed in skeletal muscle and zzso Western blots and zzso employing zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso is a nuclear zzso Moreover, zzso zzso experiments demonstrate a zzso zzso of zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso searches using the zzso zzso indicate the existence of zzso zzso in mouse and zzso The zzso half of zzso is significantly zzso between zzso plants, zzso and even zzso zzso zzso Southern and Western blots demonstrate the presence of zzso genes and their zzso respectively, in all zzso cell lines zzso The expression pattern, the concentrated zzso in zzso structures, and its interaction with zzso in the zzso system zzso zzso as a putative zzso zzso which might help to gain new insights in zzso zzso
