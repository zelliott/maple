zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes of zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso and zzso were successfully expressed in zzso zzso Determined zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso showed more similarity with those of zzso than with self-sufficient zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso from zzso coli cells as functional zzso and their properties were characterized in zzso zzso zzso zzso of strains zzso and zzso have similar zzso properties to those of zzso but zzso of strain zzso exhibited higher temperature stability than that of strain zzso zzso of strains zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of vinyl zzso of zzso and its derivatives and produced zzso from zzso derivatives and showed high zzso Both zzso showed higher specific activity on zzso zzso derivatives than on zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso could catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso to the corresponding zzso zzso compounds including zzso zzso zzso oxide, and zzso exhibited marked zzso of zzso reaction, although linear zzso showed no zzso of zzso activity at any zzso
