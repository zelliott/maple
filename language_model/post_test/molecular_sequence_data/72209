Cloning of zzso beta converting zzso zzso and zzso zzso death protein zzso revealed the structural and functional zzso between these two zzso It also suggested the involvement of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Several zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have previously described a mouse zzso of zzso zzso zzso beta that shares strong zzso with ICE and zzso Here, we describe the cloning of mouse and human zzso another member of this family of zzso zzso Mouse zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso that contains all the known zzso zzso required for zzso function, including the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso for internal zzso sites, and the zzso required for zzso zzso Three zzso zzso of human zzso were also zzso zzso acid sequence analysis indicated that zzso shared high zzso with zzso zzso and zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that a zzso zzso zzso was expressed in various zzso except zzso Mouse zzso zzso mapping allowed zzso of zzso to the zzso region of mouse zzso 19, linked to zzso zzso and zzso
