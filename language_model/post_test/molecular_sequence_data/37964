We report on the identification of a zzso highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which elicits zzso zzso zzso against zzso The protein was extracted from zzso strain zzso with zzso and zzso it migrated as a single band on a sodium zzso zzso gel with an apparent molecular mass of 63 zzso Mouse zzso generated against the zzso protein was zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with seven zzso strains and type b zzso and zzso strains and exhibited zzso activity to zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the protein is made in small amounts in zzso as zzso by zzso zzso To further study this zzso we zzso zzso and expressed it zzso in zzso zzso The zzso protein is localized in the zzso of zzso coli and has been zzso to zzso Both the zzso and native proteins possess zzso zzso zzso the protein has been called zzso Mouse zzso directed against the zzso zzso protein was zzso on Western zzso and zzso zzso with all zzso zzso strains tested including zzso and was zzso for two zzso strains zzso The zzso also resulted in a log reduction in zzso in an zzso protection study with zzso zzso type b as the challenge zzso These features suggest that zzso is a potential zzso vaccine candidate against zzso zzso
