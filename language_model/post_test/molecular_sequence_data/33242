In the zzso of zzso zzso 12 genes have been predicted to zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso activities of the proteins zzso by these genes have not yet been confirmed zzso In this study, we have constructed three of these 12 genes zzso strains using zzso zzso and characterized their zzso zzso zzso Of these three zzso one was previously named zzso the other two have not been reported yet, and zzso we named them zzso and zzso The zzso proteins released zzso acid zzso from the C zzso of zzso and the activity of the zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso indicating the zzso to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were stable at 45 degrees C, 55 degrees C, and 55 degrees C, respectively, at a low zzso The zzso properties of zzso zzso were different from those of any reported zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso had similar zzso properties to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The DNA and zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso of zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso suggest differences in zzso regulation between these zzso
