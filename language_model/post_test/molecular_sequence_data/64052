Earlier, we detected zzso of zzso as a zzso protein in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso using different region zzso revealed that the zzso and central domain of the zzso contain zzso sites and are not exposed on the surface of zzso zzso This suggested that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be exposed on the zzso and may be used as a site for incorporation of zzso peptides or zzso We constructed zzso zzso containing a small zzso (21 zzso zzso including the zzso motif or zzso zzso containing enhanced zzso fluorescent protein zzso fused to the zzso of zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso was incorporated into zzso zzso zzso of the zzso motif into the zzso resulted in significant zzso of zzso fiber zzso infection of the zzso cells, suggesting that zzso motifs are displayed on the surface of zzso zzso and are accessible for binding to zzso Analysis of zzso revealed that the zzso zzso is incorporated into zzso zzso and zzso containing the zzso of zzso is exposed on the surface of the zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso was maintained without change through successive rounds of viral zzso These results suggested that in contrast to major zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso the minor zzso protein IX can be use for the incorporation of targeting zzso based on either small peptides or longer zzso
