zzso evolved from an zzso zzso in a process that required the transfer of genes from the zzso to the host cell nucleus, and the zzso of proteins thereby made in the host cell zzso into the internal compartments of the zzso According to current models for this evolution, two highly improbable events are required to occur zzso creation of a protein zzso machinery to import proteins back into the zzso and creation of targeting sequences on the protein zzso zzso Using a combination of two independent prediction methods, validated through tests on simulated zzso we show that at least zzso of proteins zzso by an extant zzso are predisposed for targeting to zzso and propose we that zzso targeting information was zzso for many proteins of the zzso We analyzed a family of proteins whose members exist both in bacteria and in zzso of zzso and show that the zzso extensions occasionally found in bacterial family members can function as a crude import sequence when the protein is presented to isolated zzso This activity leaves the development of a primitive zzso channel in the outer membrane of the zzso as a single hurdle to initiating the evolution of zzso
