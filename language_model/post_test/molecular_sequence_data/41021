zzso zzso strain zzso isolated from a sewage sludge sample is able to grow on minimal medium supplemented with steroids, showing a broad zzso zzso This paper reports the characterization of three different zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso of this strain does not contain any zzso of a zzso zzso or zzso that appears in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Growth experiments with zzso zzso either a zzso single zzso zzso double zzso in combination with zzso or zzso or the triple zzso zzso proved that zzso is involved in the transformation of zzso zzso to zzso zzso and in the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (both lacking zzso and zzso did not grow in minimal medium with cholesterol as the only carbon source, thus demonstrating the involvement of zzso and zzso in cholesterol zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso does not alter the bacterial growth on the steroids tested in this study and therefore, the role of this protein still remains zzso The absence of a functional zzso in zzso zzso zzso provoked in all cases an zzso of zzso as a branch product probably formed by the action of a zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso while zzso is involved in cholesterol zzso
