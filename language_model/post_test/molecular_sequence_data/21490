zzso and efficient recognition of import zzso is essential to ensure zzso zzso To this end, the zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with import zzso directly or, more commonly, through import zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins bind the nuclear zzso sequence zzso of import zzso while recruiting zzso zzso via an zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso The use of zzso greatly expands and zzso the repertoire of cellular zzso that zzso zzso can efficiently import into the cell nucleus and allows for fine regulation of nuclear zzso zzso the zzso domain is a dedicated zzso unique to zzso proteins that functions as a molecular liaison between zzso zzso and import zzso This review provides an overview of the molecular role played by the zzso domain in orchestrating zzso zzso Recent work has determined that the zzso domain has specialized functions at every step of the import and export zzso zzso this stretch of zzso zzso acids plays an essential role in regulating processes such as formation of the import complex, zzso and zzso through the nuclear pore complex zzso release of import zzso into the cell nucleus and finally recycling of import zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso Thus, the zzso domain is a master regulator of zzso zzso whose complex molecular function is only recently beginning to zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso of Signaling and Cellular Fate through zzso of Nuclear zzso zzso
