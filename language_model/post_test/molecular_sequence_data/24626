Presented is a method for analyzing zzso zzso and zzso the zzso modification zzso from its zzso counterpart zzso using zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and positive zzso zzso zzso A set of commercially available zzso and zzso standards was analyzed via zzso zzso and zzso to generate fragmentation signatures that were used to characterize and differentiate the two zzso All of the zzso peptides retained their zzso Da modifications under zzso decomposition zzso conditions and zzso backbone fragmentation allowed for the zzso identification of the zzso In sharp contrast, zzso peptides lost zzso from the precursor as the collision energy zzso was increased until only the zzso form of the zzso was zzso The number of 80 Da losses indicated the number of zzso zzso By continuing to ramp the zzso further, it was possible to zzso the zzso peptides and obtain detailed sequence zzso It was not possible to obtain zzso information on the location of the zzso zzso using positive zzso zzso as none of the original precursor zzso were present at the time of zzso backbone zzso This method was applied to the analysis of zzso human zzso deleted factor VIII zzso which has six well-documented zzso sites and several potential zzso sites located in two of the zzso regions of the zzso Seven peptides with single and multiple zzso Da modifications were isolated and analyzed for their respective zzso The fragmentation patterns obtained from the zzso peptides were compared with those obtained for the standard zzso and in all cases the peptides were zzso None of the potential zzso sites were found to be occupied, and these results are consistent with the zzso
