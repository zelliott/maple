The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso III is part of a zzso of three zzso which have no counterpart in the other two nuclear zzso zzso This zzso interacts with zzso and is therefore thought to participate in pol III zzso To study the role of zzso in transcription, we have zzso zzso the gene zzso zzso and found that zzso affecting growth also altered zzso interaction with zzso The two zzso pol III that were zzso had zzso properties indistinguishable from those of the zzso pol III on a zzso template, while specific zzso of pol III genes in the presence of general zzso factors was zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso could be compensated by increasing the amount of pol III present in the reaction, suggesting that the zzso had a lower affinity for zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso was defective in zzso initiation due to impaired open complex zzso These observations demonstrate that the zzso zzso is a major zzso in pol III recruitment by the zzso complex and further acts at a subsequent stage that involves the zzso of an zzso form of zzso zzso
