The zzso properties of novel zzso zzso zzso and beta which were zzso from zzso soybean zzso were zzso The zzso activities were exhibited in the presence of a zzso zzso such as zzso and apparently inhibited by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso activities toward zzso were detected at a pH above zzso The optimum temperature for activities was about 40 degrees zzso The zzso point of zzso and beta was zzso and zzso 7, zzso The molecular mass of zzso and zzso measured by zzso mass zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso were examined using zzso and zzso and zzso zzso broad specificity was observed at pH zzso These results demonstrated that these zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso
