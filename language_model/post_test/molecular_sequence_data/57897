A simple zzso protocol for zzso typing suitable for a routine practice is zzso The method zzso first, a zzso amplification with seven different, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and second, typing of zzso zzso more exactly in zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups by zzso of zzso products with restriction zzso distinguishing different zzso types within each of the zzso zzso 24 zzso zzso or any combination of these, can be zzso The whole zzso starting from a blood sample, can be carried out during a single zzso The method was tested by typing a set of zzso cell lines, as well as a local panel previously typed by zzso Also, 227 patients waiting for transplantation were typed to test the method in a routine zzso The results suggest that this kind of approach gives reliable zzso types and works well in the routine zzso
