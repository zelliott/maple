In recent years, the zzso and function of zzso tissue proteins zzso extracted by zzso et zzso have been extensively zzso the genetic code has been identified for each of the zzso The present study was carried out to clarify the zzso expression and protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso at the cell level and also to define zzso the nature of which has remained zzso zzso was said to be zzso zzso zzso zzso was not expressed in zzso normal zzso tissue or zzso normal cells, but was expressed in zzso normal zzso zzso and in zzso and zzso zzso suggesting its involvement in zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso normal zzso tissue or zzso normal cells, but was not expressed in zzso normal zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that this protein serves in the function of normal zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso and the zzso cells, zzso was localized in more differentiated regions, where cells tended toward zzso in both normal and zzso zzso zzso In zzso cell zzso zzso was localized in more differentiated cells with a large zzso zzso zzso was not expressed in normal zzso zzso but was detected in zzso zzso suggesting its involvement in cell differentiation in cervical zzso zzso
