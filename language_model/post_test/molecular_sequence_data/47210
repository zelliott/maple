A 44-year-old woman with a 12-year history of zzso syndrome zzso developed a zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Two years later, she presented with generalized zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso was zzso To investigate the relationship of the two zzso distinct zzso we zzso their zzso and zzso and studied the zzso tissue from the zzso cervical zzso zzso and zzso using molecular genetic zzso zzso and zzso studies confirmed the previous diagnoses and also identified a previously unnoticed focus of zzso zzso in the second zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of the rearranged zzso zzso gene showed the same sized dominant product in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso analysis of the zzso zzso yielded an identical sized band from both zzso and zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso products showed an identical zzso sequence from each zzso indicating a common zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso showed an identical zzso signature to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso may have resulted from colonization of zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells, following which the tumor cells were induced to express a zzso zzso zzso due to zzso zzso caused by zzso leading to a change in clinical behavior resulting in rapid widespread dissemination of zzso These observations suggest that the distinct zzso of zzso zzso zzso may be the consequence of interplay between genetic and local zzso zzso
