A novel zzso signal zzso system zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso functions as a response regulator and a zzso protein zzso respectively, were zzso The zzso disruption zzso was generated by zzso zzso with the zzso resistance zzso The zzso response to the absence of zzso gene was determined by a zzso profiling technique in which the concentration changes of zzso zzso were measured by gas zzso with zzso mass zzso zzso Although the zzso analyses of the zzso gene disruption zzso showed no significant change with respect to zzso zzso production and zzso zzso the global zzso analyses found the concentration levels of some key zzso in the zzso cycle and zzso zzso were affected by an zzso gene disruption zzso The primary results suggested that zzso genes might be involved in the regulation of central zzso metabolism in zzso zzso zzso
