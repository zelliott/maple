zzso are believed to play an important role in plant zzso against bacterial and zzso zzso In peanut zzso zzso zzso genes form a small zzso zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from cultured peanut zzso zzso of individual zzso genes was zzso by the zzso chain reaction zzso followed by analysis of restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso zzso dilution of cell cultures and treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso extract were used to induce expression of zzso zzso The zzso 3 gene is zzso expressed at a low level in zzso as well as in treated cultures; the expression of zzso 4 gene is induced by each of the stimuli tested, whereas the zzso 1 gene is activated by cell culture dilution and by zzso extract zzso The zzso 2 gene is strongly activated by treatment with cell wall components from the fungus zzso zzso but not by the other zzso These results indicate that zzso 2 gene expression may be controlled by zzso regulatory zzso
