The zzso zzso zzso form a large family of essential pregnancy zzso but their biological function is zzso We have investigated whether one function of the zzso is to interact with cells of the maternal immune zzso zzso human peripheral blood zzso cells, activated with zzso zzso are shown to bind to zzso zzso zzso This binding activity can be zzso using a chemically zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso motif present in the zzso domain of zzso The zzso receptors are present on cells of the zzso cell lineage but not of the T cell or B cell zzso The binding is zzso in part by the zzso motif and can be zzso against by appropriate zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso binding requires a functional zzso By examining the zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, the presence of receptors with two different binding characteristics are zzso The zzso zzso is identified by chemical zzso as a protein of 46 zzso zzso and affinity zzso demonstrates the presence of three protein species of 32 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the zzso has multiple zzso
