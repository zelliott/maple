zzso zzso forms of influenza A virus zzso and zzso have been produced in cells of lower zzso and shown in a mouse model to induce complete protective immunity against a lethal virus zzso zzso zzso produced in a zzso system, consisted of zzso zzso and zzso Only the zzso were zzso zzso The zzso decreased very considerably in the order zzso zzso di zzso zzso zzso we fused the head part of the zzso gene to a zzso zzso zzso zzso the resulting product was zzso active, zzso zzso The protective immunity induced by this engineered zzso however, remained fairly zzso A third influenza A virus zzso the zzso zzso has only 23 zzso acids exposed on the outer membrane zzso This zzso part, zzso has been remarkably zzso in all human influenza A strains since zzso By fusing the zzso sequence to zzso B virus core zzso we could obtain highly zzso particles that induced complete, zzso long-lasting protection in mice against a lethal viral zzso Native zzso is a zzso protein and this zzso of the zzso part can also be zzso by fusing this sequence to a zzso zzso zzso The potential of the resulting protein as a vaccine candidate remains to be zzso
