Several species of the zzso zzso produce zzso antibiotics which are zzso either through a zzso or zzso zzso The antibiotics zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also zzso zzso but by a mechanism that, apparently, is distinct from that of the zzso zzso Other antibiotics such as zzso are gene zzso and are zzso zzso zzso genetic and DNA sequence analysis have shown that zzso genes for some antibiotics are clustered into zzso zzso units and are under the control of global regulatory systems that govern the expression of genes that are induced when zzso cells enter stationary phase of zzso Future experiments involving the molecular dissection of zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso will be attempted in hopes of further examining the mechanism and regulation of zzso zzso
