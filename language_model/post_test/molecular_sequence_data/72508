The zzso zzso gene is expressed in bone and kidney as well as in many other zzso Using primer extension followed by rapid cloning of amplified complementary DNA ends, we have isolated new zzso zzso complementary zzso with different zzso patterns and have characterized a new upstream zzso start zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso U2 and zzso located zzso zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the zzso that encodes the putative signal zzso of the classical zzso zzso zzso have been zzso Four types of zzso patterns were zzso Type I zzso pattern is transcribed from zzso zzso and is spliced to zzso S and zzso this pattern was found in most zzso zzso zzso II, III, and IV zzso patterns are transcribed from zzso zzso and have a restricted tissue zzso Type II zzso pattern, containing zzso zzso U2, and S and type III zzso pattern, containing zzso zzso U2, and E1 zzso zzso zzso was found only in zzso Type IV zzso pattern, containing zzso zzso and S was found both in kidney and zzso Because the type III zzso zzso skips zzso zzso translation of this zzso zzso zzso at a different zzso zzso The type III zzso zzso was zzso expressed on the cell surface of zzso cells, as assessed by double zzso binding zzso and no zzso zzso binding was observed on intact zzso The type III zzso zzso however, increased zzso zzso in zzso cells when challenged with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso that are similar to those observed in zzso cells expressing the type I zzso but with a maximum stimulation that was lower than that observed in zzso cells expressing the type I zzso These data indicate low levels of cell surface expression of the type III zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso decreased the size of the type I zzso zzso from a broad band of 85 zzso to a compact band of about 60 zzso The type III zzso zzso did not change in size in zzso cells treated with zzso indicating that the type III zzso zzso did not undergo any zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso gene uses alternate promoters in a zzso manner that results in several zzso alternatively spliced zzso One of these zzso the type III zzso zzso is expressed in kidney and lacks the signal zzso
