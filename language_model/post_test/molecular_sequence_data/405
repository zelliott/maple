The sequence of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso was determined and found to contain unique open reading frames zzso and zzso similar to those of other zzso as well as 3' zzso regions that shared a high degree of zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso extracted from zzso plants identified zzso zzso corresponding to six prominent internal zzso and detected several novel zzso stranded zzso zzso zzso replication in tobacco zzso was investigated and results indicated that zzso replication proceeded with novel zzso zzso zzso zzso wherein viral zzso zzso exhibited a temporally similar expression pattern early in the zzso This was noticeably distinct from the zzso zzso zzso pattern previously observed for zzso infectious zzso virus zzso the type member of the zzso suggesting that replication of the two viruses likely operate via dissimilar zzso
