The zzso dye zzso was zzso bound to a single zzso zzso introduced by zzso zzso in position 101 on the zzso surface or in position 130 on the zzso surface of the zzso pump zzso Using zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso a transient increase was observed in the apparent zzso of the dye attached at zzso zzso At pH zzso the rise and zzso times of this zzso zzso 2 zzso and approximately 60 zzso correlate well with zzso times observed for the M and O zzso and with the zzso zzso zzso Interpreting the zzso of zzso zzso in terms of a zzso more negative surface charge density, we calculate a change of zzso elementary charge per zzso at the zzso zzso It is likely that this charge change is due to the transient zzso of zzso With the label in position 130 on the zzso surface no transient zzso was zzso
