zzso zzso factor 1 alpha zzso is one of the four zzso zzso zzso translation zzso factor zzso It zzso the binding of zzso to the zzso of the zzso in a zzso manner during protein zzso although it also seems to play a role in other zzso zzso Currently, little information is still available about its expression profile and regulation during zzso zzso With regard to this, zzso sole zzso zzso is a commercially important zzso in which zzso gene remains to be zzso 

The development of large-scale zzso of zzso sole has facilitated the identification of five different zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Main characteristics and sequence identities with other fish and zzso zzso are zzso zzso and tissue expression analyses allowed for the identification of zzso and zzso as the zzso sole counterparts of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and of zzso as the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The other two zzso factors, zzso and zzso represent novel genes that are mainly expressed in zzso and zzso The expression profile of the five genes was also studied during zzso development, revealing different zzso To study the possible regulation of zzso gene expressions by zzso hormones zzso larvae were exposed to the zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae exhibited lower zzso zzso levels than zzso controls at both 11 and 15 days after treatment, whereas transcripts of the other four genes remained relatively zzso Moreover, addition of zzso T4 hormone to zzso larvae increased significantly the zzso levels of zzso with respect to zzso controls, demonstrating that its expression is zzso by zzso 

We have identified five different zzso genes in the zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The five genes exhibit different expression patterns in zzso and during zzso zzso zzso and T4 treatments demonstrate that zzso is zzso by zzso suggesting a role in the zzso regulation of the factors involved in the dramatic changes that occurs during zzso sole zzso
