zzso zzso is major zzso zzso by zzso in Syrian golden zzso and shows high potency toward zzso B1 zzso We have isolated and zzso zzso clones to zzso by zzso a zzso liver zzso library in zzso zzso The longest clone contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso and encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso The sequence of zzso shares a zzso and zzso zzso with that of mouse zzso 15 alpha zzso and rat zzso zzso respectively, indicating that zzso is a unique gene of the zzso zzso The apparent concentration of a zzso species zzso to the clone as well as the concentration of a protein zzso to zzso was increased significantly by the treatment with zzso which indicates that the increase in zzso protein is due mainly to an zzso of the zzso
