To address the question of how the geometry of a zzso native zzso affects its folding and stability, we studied three model zzso on a cubic zzso The native structure of one of these model zzso consisted mostly of local zzso while that of a second consisted mostly of zzso zzso The third native structure had a typical compact native zzso and served as our zzso For each zzso the zzso acid sequence was designed to have a pronounced energy minimum at its native zzso We observed dramatic differences in zzso dependent on the presence or absence of zzso zzso For the proteins with a typical large number of zzso zzso the folding transition was zzso whereas for the one with mostly local zzso it was zzso Although the maximum rate of folding was similar for all three zzso we found that under conditions at which each native zzso was stable, the structure with mostly zzso contacts folded two orders of magnitude faster than the one with mostly local zzso The statistical analysis of protein structure agrees fully with the implications of the zzso We discuss the importance of zzso in protein folding for its zzso
