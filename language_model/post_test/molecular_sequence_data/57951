We searched for zzso zzso in gastric zzso by analyzing tumor zzso from 29 zzso We detected 13 different zzso zzso in 15 patients zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso 6 (5 zzso zzso The zzso zzso were mainly localized in the sequences corresponding to the highly zzso zzso of the zzso Twelve samples showed a single base change: 11 zzso and 1 nonsense zzso Three samples showed deletions leading to a frame shift, to the zzso loss of 2 zzso zzso and to the deletion of a zzso zzso All point zzso except one, were zzso and zzso of them were zzso zzso We previously analyzed this panel of tumors for zzso loss at the zzso zzso region, where the zzso gene had previously been zzso the results showed an increasing zzso of zzso loss in late-stage zzso On the contrary, in the present study no trend between zzso zzso and tumor stages was zzso This observation indicates that zzso events zzso zzso loss in gastric zzso Half zzso of the zzso occurred in samples without zzso loss, suggesting that specific zzso zzso acting in a dominant negative fashion, can alter in zzso the zzso protein zzso
