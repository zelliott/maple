Water flooding plays an important role in recovering oil from depleted petroleum zzso Exactly how the microbial communities of production zzso are affected by zzso introduced with injected water has previously not been adequately zzso Using zzso zzso gel zzso zzso approach and zzso zzso gene clone library analysis, the comparison of microbial communities is carried out between one injection water and two production waters collected from a working block of the zzso zzso petroleum zzso located in the Yellow River zzso zzso fingerprints showed that the similarities of the bacterial communities between the injection water and production waters were lower than between the two production zzso It was also observed that the zzso composition among these three samples showed no significant zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene clone libraries showed that the dominant groups within the injection water were zzso zzso and zzso while the dominant groups in the production waters were zzso and zzso Only 2 out of 54 bacterial operational zzso units zzso and 5 out of 17 zzso zzso in the injection water were detected in the production waters, indicating that most of the zzso introduced by the injection water may not survive to be detected in the production zzso Additionally, there were zzso and zzso unique zzso in the two production waters respectively, suggesting that each production well has its specific microbial zzso despite both zzso being flooded with the same injection zzso
