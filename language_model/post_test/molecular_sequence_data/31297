zzso disease is inherited in an zzso zzso manner and is the most prevalent zzso storage zzso zzso disease has marked zzso variation and molecular zzso and seven point zzso in the acid zzso zzso gene have been zzso By means of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been detected zzso in zzso type 2 zzso and type 3 zzso patients, as well as in children with severe visceral involvement who are apparently free of zzso zzso To investigate the molecular basis for this puzzling finding, amplified zzso zzso from zzso zzso type 2 and type 3 zzso disease patients were cloned and zzso The Swedish type 3 zzso disease patient was truly zzso for zzso only containing the zzso zzso In comparison, the type 2 patient contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso with multiple discrete point zzso zzso zzso and zzso Each of the zzso in the complex zzso also was present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed that both type 2 patients contained additional zzso in one zzso whereas the zzso alone was detected in both type 3 and in young severe type 1 zzso disease zzso These results suggest that the presence of the complex zzso influences the severity of zzso disease in zzso zzso and reveal the central role played by the zzso in the formation of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Analysis of additional zzso clones also identified two new zzso in a type 3 patient, emphasizing the molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso
