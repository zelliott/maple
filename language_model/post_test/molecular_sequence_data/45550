zzso analysis has indicated that the system II zzso for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso requires at least four zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, the eight genes zzso associated with the system I zzso in zzso coli were zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso as a reporter for zzso c zzso it is demonstrated that a single fused zzso zzso can replace the function of the eight system I genes in zzso zzso Thus, the zzso and zzso membrane complex of system II is likely to possess the zzso delivery and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso system II and system I, both under control of zzso we have begun to study the capabilities and characteristics of each system in the same zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso was used to zzso zzso levels in zzso and it is shown that system I can use zzso zzso at much lower levels than system zzso Additionally, while system I encodes a zzso bound zzso zzso zzso no zzso intermediate has been found in system zzso It is shown that this allows system I to use zzso as a zzso zzso a capability system II does not zzso
