zzso B zzso zzso also known as zzso is generated from zzso zzso zzso by the zzso at a single zzso zzso An zzso activity capable of processing at this zzso site has been previously reported in zzso zzso of the bovine zzso and zzso cell zzso This zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to apparent zzso from the zzso lobe of the bovine zzso using zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso in a zzso gel between pH 4 to zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a zzso of about zzso and a molecular mass of about 54 zzso under reducing zzso zzso is a zzso and exhibits a neutral pH zzso zzso zzso of soluble zzso such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso generating neutral zzso zzso zzso do not inhibit zzso activity indicating that zzso is distinct from these two zzso zzso site determination with zzso laser zzso zzso time of flight zzso mass zzso shows that zzso zzso the zzso zzso N zzso to the zzso generating zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among other peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso only those peptides that fit the predicted zzso zzso for zzso zzso These data are consistent with a broader role for the zzso converting zzso in the zzso of many zzso hormones and zzso by processing at zzso zzso
