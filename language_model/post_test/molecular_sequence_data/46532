A method is presented for rapid sequencing and mapping of elements which support autonomous replication in zzso The strategy relies on a novel zzso zzso zzso which allows detection of zzso zzso replicating zzso function in cloned zzso zzso mapping of an zzso element linked to the HO gene of zzso zzso has identified a zzso region 3' to the zzso which is essential for autonomous zzso This region shows sequence zzso to other zzso zzso
