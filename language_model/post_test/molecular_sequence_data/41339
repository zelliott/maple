Plant zzso bacteria with the ability to tolerate heavy metals have importance both in sustainable agriculture and zzso The present study reports on the isolation and characterization of mineral zzso zzso bacteria associated with the zzso zzso zzso plant zzso zzso flower zzso Out of 35 bacterial zzso 6 zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with high zzso activity were selected and subjected to the assessment of zzso activity under various stress conditions, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity by the selected zzso was observed at zzso of as high as zzso M zzso zzso improvement in plant growth was observed on zzso of seeds zzso zzso with all of the six selected zzso Plant growth was measured in terms of root zzso shoot zzso fresh weight and % increase in root zzso The molecular diversity among the zzso bacteria was studied employing zzso repetitive zzso zzso zzso Representative strains from each ERIC type were identified, on the basis of a partial sequence of the zzso zzso zzso as members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among all the zzso zzso was the best in terms of zzso activity and its response to various zzso The ability of zzso and other zzso to exhibit zzso activity at high zzso zzso suggests their potential as efficient zzso for growing plants in metal zzso zzso
