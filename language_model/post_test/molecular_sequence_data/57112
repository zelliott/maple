Recent evidence has implicated zzso factor zzso proteins as critical regulators of the protein zzso pathway, particularly in the zzso zzso zzso We have examined whether zzso zzso contain zzso of zzso and the consequences of zzso zzso and zzso on its membrane zzso Two means were used to assess zzso zzso First, zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso binding to protein was found to be greater when zzso and zzso were incubated together than when either was incubated zzso These data suggested that zzso zzso gamma S was zzso This was confirmed by showing that the zzso gamma zzso protein functioned as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a reaction for which activated zzso is a necessary zzso zzso treatment of zzso an zzso zzso zzso and zzso A each inhibited zzso zzso by approximately zzso demonstrating that a specific protein interaction is required for the majority of the zzso zzso This zzso protein is a strong candidate for the molecular target for zzso zzso The ubiquitous nature of zzso proteins and their importance in both the zzso and zzso pathways may explain the effects of zzso A on both zzso and zzso membrane traffic in animal zzso A zzso zzso of zzso by zzso could also be demonstrated and was the dominant activity observed in zzso zzso of zzso We believe this to be the zzso process described previously for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in tight association of zzso with zzso zzso zzso association required zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso did zzso These studies indicate that the zzso zzso zzso protein and other factors that determine the level of zzso of zzso in animal cells are fundamental regulators of membrane traffic in animal zzso
