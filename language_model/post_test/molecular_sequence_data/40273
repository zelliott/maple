zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso with zzso DNA depletion and mild zzso zzso zzso in zzso the gene zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been reported in 17 patients until zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso have been described in two zzso zzso 

In this study, two unrelated patients zzso three novel zzso zzso in zzso were zzso The first patient had a severe disease at zzso He was compound zzso for a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso which leads to the complete skipping of zzso 1 in a zzso expression zzso The involvement of zzso was confirmed by western zzso analysis, which showed absence of zzso protein in zzso The second patient has a milder zzso similar to that of patients with zzso zzso and is still alive at 12 years of zzso Western zzso analysis showed some residual zzso protein in patient's zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso zzso that lead to complete absence of zzso protein are responsible for a very severe disorder with zzso manifestations, whereas a zzso zzso is found in patients with residual zzso zzso Furthermore, it is shown that in the absence of zzso zzso no zzso protein is found in zzso by western zzso zzso This result is consistent with a degradation of zzso when its zzso partner, zzso is zzso
