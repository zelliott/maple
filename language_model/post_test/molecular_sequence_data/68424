We have isolated the zzso fork head zzso zzso gene zzso zzso appears to be most similar to the rat liver zzso factor zzso zzso with zzso zzso acid identity throughout the protein and zzso zzso acid identity within the zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso is present in the vegetal pole and marginal zone but not the animal pole of zzso and in equal levels in the zzso and zzso halves of both zzso and zzso By in zzso zzso we know that the zzso component of expression is concentrated in the zzso in zzso In zzso zzso zzso is detected in the zzso the brain, and in two lines of cells just zzso and zzso to the zzso the zzso and the floor plate of the spinal zzso Finally, although zzso animal caps will turn on zzso autonomously at zzso stage, zzso zzso early expression at zzso zzso The early, growth zzso expression does occur in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso suggesting that zzso expression during zzso stage may be an immediate early response to zzso zzso
