When zzso with the zzso protein zzso zzso is a potent zzso and an inhibitor of a zzso zzso zzso that leads to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A recently cloned zzso protein zzso is the likely zzso of these zzso Using zzso zzso that do not bind zzso we demonstrate here that zzso is a zzso regulator of zzso in zzso and that the zzso activity of zzso is required for this zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso in zzso zzso with an essential role for zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso of zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso studies indicate that the zzso activity of zzso alone is not sufficient for control of zzso and that an zzso domain in zzso is also zzso
