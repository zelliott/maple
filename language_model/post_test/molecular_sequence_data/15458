zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that plays a critical role in energy metabolism in zzso In this paper, the full-length zzso of AK was cloned from shrimp, zzso zzso by using zzso and zzso zzso It was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The quantitative real-time reverse zzso zzso analysis revealed a broad expression of AK with the highest expression in the muscle and the lowest in the zzso The expression of AK after challenge with zzso was tested in zzso and muscle, which indicated that the two peak values were zzso times (at 3 zzso and zzso times (at 24 zzso in the zzso compared with the control values, respectively zzso zzso zzso while the highest expression of AK was 41 times (at 24 zzso in the muscle compared with the control zzso zzso zzso In addition, AK was expressed in zzso coli by zzso expression zzso zzso The zzso protein was expressed as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso which was zzso by affinity zzso using zzso zzso zzso After zzso from zzso by using a zzso zzso the zzso protein was identified by zzso and showed AK zzso After treatment with 10 zzso zzso the zzso activity significantly zzso However, the zzso activity was inhibited by 10 zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso and 200 zzso zzso This research suggested that AK might play an important role in the zzso of energy production and zzso and the immune response in zzso
