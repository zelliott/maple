The zzso acid type A zzso zzso carries both high zzso zzso zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity binding sites for zzso We have used zzso zzso to identify a specific zzso in the rat zzso zzso that is involved in high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso at positions 62 and 74 were zzso to either zzso or zzso and the effects on zzso binding and zzso channel zzso were investigated after the expression of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells or in zzso zzso None of the zzso affected zzso binding or impaired zzso interactions between the low affinity zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso at position 74 had little effect on zzso zzso the zzso zzso decreased the affinity of the high affinity zzso binding sites by approximately zzso and the zzso zzso led to a loss of zzso high affinity binding zzso After expression in zzso the zzso values for both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso receptors were increased by zzso and zzso compared with the zzso We conclude that zzso of the beta zzso is an important zzso for high affinity zzso binding to the zzso zzso
