The aim of the study was to characterize a zzso isolated from the zzso of a cow with digital zzso zzso 

The characterization was on the basis of its light and electron microscopic appearance, zzso profile and DNA sequence analysis of its zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso long and zzso zzso in diameter, and possessed seven to eight zzso zzso with three to five zzso zzso The zzso profile of the zzso zzso but is not identical to that of zzso zzso Its zzso gene sequence was identical to that of zzso zzso but distinct from that of an zzso zzso Analysis of a zzso region of the zzso zzso genes indicated that this is a zzso species and that it is indistinguishable from some zzso made from cases of bovine zzso in the United zzso Finally, electron zzso revealed the presence of zzso zzso particles in all cultures of the zzso zzso 

The zzso isolate was identified as a zzso species closely related to some zzso from the United States (by zzso zzso and to zzso zzso (by zzso gene zzso and is associated with zzso zzso 

The fact that the zzso with the same or very similar zzso zzso sequences have been obtained from cases of bovine zzso in cattle in different countries at different times, lends further support to the hypothesis that zzso play a role in the zzso of this zzso
