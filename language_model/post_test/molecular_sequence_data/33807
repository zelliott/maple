The zzso zzso zzso domain is part of many zzso proteins with diverse functions from structural components to zzso The zzso zzso is a protein of 336 zzso acid zzso containing a single zzso domain and a putative signal zzso at the zzso of the zzso It is 1 component of a zzso structure called the zzso membrane which is involved in transforming sound waves into zzso signals and is important for normal auditory zzso zzso is specifically expressed in the zzso and avian inner zzso 

We identified and cloned the gene zzso zzso zzso Through zzso in zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso and specialized sensory patch of the inner ear during zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso affected the position and number of zzso in the ears of zzso Finally, swimming behaviors of zzso zzso were abnormal since the development of the inner ear was zzso 

Our results reveal that zzso zzso is specifically expressed in the zzso inner ear, and is important for regulating the development of the zzso inner zzso Lack of zzso zzso caused severe defects in inner ear formation of zzso and zzso
