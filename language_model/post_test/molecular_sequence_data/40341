zzso protein dynamics is essential for studying protein zzso However, the zzso of dynamic modes varies over zzso and segments of a zzso Here we describe an approach using zzso zzso with zzso materials for protein dynamics in confined zzso that may mimic the crowded nature within a cell where proteins evolve to zzso While zzso zzso permits the separation of dynamic motions in different zzso we demonstrate its capability to capture dynamics can still be significantly enhanced by the zzso of zzso zzso into zzso Two zzso of a zzso prion protein zzso at temperatures from 2 to 27 zzso are zzso The zzso provides the zzso with an ordered environment such that the global tumbling of zzso is slow, and zzso on the zzso zzso The local dynamic modes of the zzso in zzso are, therefore, distinctly reported on the zzso The zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso forms differ zzso demonstrating the significant improvement of zzso zzso capability due to our zzso Such distinctly different spectral patterns between the two secondary structures of the zzso cannot be obtained from zzso studies in viscous zzso zzso The dynamic modes on the zzso are thus zzso identified in our zzso experiments at the zzso and zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso for each zzso and temperature are simultaneously fitted to the rigorous models, zzso the zzso model, for slow-motion zzso zzso correlations are revealed and characterized zzso for the backbone flexibility between the zzso and zzso forms of the prion protein zzso Confirmation of the slow collective dynamic modes extending across the zzso is also provided through the spectral zzso
