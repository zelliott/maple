The zzso gene is expressed in fetal pancreatic zzso cells, but after birth expression is selectively zzso as the zzso terminally zzso DNA zzso studies identified a zzso regulatory domain between zzso and zzso in the zzso promoter which controls zzso zzso in zzso zzso This zzso regulatory domain comprises adjacent positive and negative zzso The negative element zzso to zzso contains the sequence zzso which is also found in the negative element of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies demonstrated that specific zzso nuclear zzso bind to the zzso negative zzso In zzso competition studies demonstrated that the zzso factors which bind to this element specifically repress zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso Immediately downstream of the negative element lies a positive element zzso zzso zzso which activates zzso zzso in zzso zzso The sequence of the positive element resembles the zzso zzso elements of the insulin gene zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and in zzso competition studies indicate that this positive element activates the zzso promoter by binding to the same zzso cell zzso factor which binds zzso elements in the rat insulin zzso The tandem organization of the negative and positive elements suggests that this regulatory domain may act as a switch controlling the transient zzso of the zzso gene during fetal zzso zzso
