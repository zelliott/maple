A sensitive, rapid zzso method has been developed for the characterization of human zzso disorders with very small volumes zzso zzso of zzso As an alternative to conventional zzso zzso a zzso chemical zzso method has been established using zzso zzso acid under zzso conditions for short time zzso for example, less than 10 zzso zzso analysis was performed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso chains with zzso acid occurred at either side or at both sides zzso and zzso of zzso acid zzso but zzso zzso The method has been applied to blood samples from zzso S carrier zzso and zzso S zzso compound zzso with a reduced expression level of zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis allowed the identification of the zzso S zzso zzso This alternative method of sample preparation is compatible with zzso techniques and is expected to significantly contribute to the further development of zzso zzso zzso and sensitive zzso methods in zzso and biomedical zzso where protein zzso characterization is a crucial factor for zzso discovery and disease zzso
