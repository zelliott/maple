We used zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify a segment, about zzso base pairs zzso of zzso gag DNA prepared from peripheral blood zzso cells of a zzso Taiwanese pair of mother and zzso zzso and zzso clones of zzso DNA derived from the mother and infant, respectively, showed a zzso zzso with each zzso However, the zzso and zzso sequences exhibited lower degrees of zzso zzso only zzso and zzso respectively, with the corresponding gag segment of a North American zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, with that of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The divergence of zzso and zzso sequences from those of zzso and zzso is particularly prominent in the first zzso zzso 200 zzso of the cloned DNA segment, involving transitions more frequently than zzso Two additional clones zzso and zzso derived from the mother and infant were zzso for the first 200 zzso These four clones showed a high degree of zzso zzso among themselves, providing an evidence for transmission of the virus from the mother to the zzso These findings show the zzso value of zzso and indicate the presence of a gag zzso of zzso which is distinct from both the North American and zzso zzso according to the zzso tree zzso
