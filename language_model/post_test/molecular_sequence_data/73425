zzso IV was found to be highly expressed in various human zzso cell lines, but not in an zzso cell line, zzso We investigated the effects of zzso of human zzso IV zzso into zzso cells on cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be more sensitive to zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and wheat germ zzso than mock zzso The results of flow zzso analyses with various zzso showed that the zzso expressed more sugar chains which bind to zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso than mock zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso IV zzso increases the expression of zzso and/or zzso sugar chains on the zzso
