zzso structures of complexes of 66 zzso zzso binding zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso with ten base pair DNA zzso zzso and zzso were obtained using computer modeling and molecular mechanics zzso Cartesian coordinates for the proteins were obtained zzso 1) structural data of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso 2) zzso constraints imposed by zzso coordination of the zinc zzso to zzso zzso and 3) energy zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The proteins were made to interact with DNA (in zzso in major groove through zzso zzso between the two zinc zzso The geometry of the complexes was obtained by allowing them to slide, zzso penetrate in to and out of the groove, and to rotate about the zzso zzso The complexes were energy zzso Also zzso was the number of zzso between proteins and zzso The complex structures were refined by molecular mechanics using zzso zzso zzso parameters of DNA were analyzed in each complex and compared with those of native DNA zzso zzso The zzso differences of the complexes are zzso
