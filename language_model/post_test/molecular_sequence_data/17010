New insights into the zzso structure of the hinge region and the zzso domain of the zzso major coat protein of the zzso zzso are deduced from a single zzso approach using zzso zzso New zzso coat proteins are labeled and zzso into zzso zzso with varying zzso compositions zzso zzso and zzso and thicknesses zzso zzso and zzso Information about the polarity of the local environment around the labeled sites is deduced from the wavelength of maximum zzso using zzso attached to the zzso groups of the zzso as a fluorescent zzso It is found that the protein is almost entirely embedded in the zzso whereas the zzso zzso composition of the membrane hardly affects the overall zzso of the protein in the zzso From the assessment of a zzso and zzso face of the zzso zzso it is concluded that the zzso is zzso with respect to the membrane zzso As compared to the thicker zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the protein in the thin zzso zzso results in a loss of zzso structure and in the formation of a stretched zzso of the hinge zzso It is suggested that the hinge region acts as a flexible spring between the zzso zzso arm and zzso zzso zzso On average, the zzso state of the coat protein can be seen as a gently curved and zzso zzso zzso which is strongly anchored in the zzso interface at the zzso From our experiments, we propose a rather small zzso adaptation of the major coat protein as the most likely zzso mechanism for responding to environmental changes during the zzso zzso and assembly zzso
