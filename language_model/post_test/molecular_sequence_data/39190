The analysis of repeated elements in zzso is a fascinating domain of research that is lacking relevant tools for zzso elements zzso the most complex zzso The dynamics of zzso which provides the main mechanism of zzso in some zzso is an essential component of zzso zzso In this study we introduce a new concept of domain, a zzso unit useful for describing the architecture of different copies of zzso Our method extracts zzso of a zzso family of zzso zzso the zzso finds the zzso in the alignment and searches the distribution of each domain in zzso After a zzso step relative to the presence or the absence of zzso the method results in a zzso view of sequences segmented into zzso 

Analysis of the new zzso TE zzso in the model plant zzso zzso reveals copies of very different sizes and various combinations of zzso which show the potential of our zzso
