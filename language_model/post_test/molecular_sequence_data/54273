Aquatic plants, and especially the emblematic zzso zzso zzso are among the most threatened organisms, due to unprecedented human-driven habitat zzso Therefore protection plans are zzso needed and call for thoroughly documenting the genetic diversity and clarifying the zzso of this endangered zzso Our sampling included 282 individuals from 42 natural populations and covered the whole geographical range of the zzso across Europe and the zzso We combined sequencing of nuclear internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions with amplified zzso length zzso zzso zzso to investigate the zzso zzso and produce a zzso of zzso Our zzso strongly supported the zzso of zzso and placed it as the sister zzso to zzso and zzso therefore zzso as previously zzso a close genetic zzso to the predominantly zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso outlined patterns consistent with a hypothesis considering glacial zzso located in the zzso Peninsula and the zzso region from which two distinct genetic lineages zzso zzso These two lineages corresponded respectively to zzso zzso zzso derived zzso and zzso zzso zzso recovered from the zzso Peninsula zzso therefore supporting differences outlined between the two zzso in previous ecological and zzso zzso These results allowed clarifying zzso uncertainties by confirming the genetic zzso of zzso zzso according to zzso zzso A third zzso zzso zzso originated and remained endemic to the mountainous regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso populations collected in northern Africa, appeared to be genetically distinct from their European counterparts, this calls for further investigation to fully address their genetic and conservation zzso Finally, we detected a large zzso zone in northwestern Europe between zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results were discussed in light of conservation approaches for zzso zzso
