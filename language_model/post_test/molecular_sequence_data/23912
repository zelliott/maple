The zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso zzso resistance protein 1 zzso zzso a broad spectrum of zzso and zzso compounds, including natural product zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated the importance of the zzso region of zzso for transport activity and zzso plasma membrane zzso The zzso regions of some zzso proteins have been implicated in protein trafficking, but the function of this region of zzso has not been zzso In contrast to results obtained with other zzso zzso we found that the zzso 30 zzso acids of zzso can be removed without affecting trafficking to zzso zzso However, the truncated protein is zzso Furthermore, removal of as few as 4 zzso zzso acids profoundly decreases transport zzso Although zzso acid sequence conservation of the zzso regions of ABC proteins is low, secondary structure predictions indicate that they consist of a broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso with a conservation of secondary and zzso structure, zzso hybrids containing the zzso regions of either the zzso zzso or the zzso related zzso were fully active and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have identified structural elements containing five zzso zzso zzso acids that are required for zzso We show that these are important for binding and zzso of zzso by zzso binding domain zzso Based on crystal structures of several ABC zzso we suggest that the zzso zzso acids may stabilize a zzso bundle formed by the zzso three zzso and may contribute to interactions between the zzso region and the zzso two zzso binding zzso
