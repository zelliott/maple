The relative contributions of the three zzso of zzso factor Tu zzso to the zzso function and zzso stability were established by zzso the zzso apart with zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso and domain III zzso of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso in zzso coli and zzso A zzso consisting of domain II and III zzso was prepared by limited zzso of native zzso with zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Reiser, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso As determined by circular zzso zzso the isolated zzso have the secondary structure elements found in the native zzso zzso and zzso binding as well as zzso activity are maintained by the zzso and zzso however, the rate of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complex is increased as compared to native zzso zzso zzso reflecting a constraint imposed by domain III on the ability to release the zzso from its binding pocket located in domain zzso A weak interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso suggests that domain I provides a part of the structure interacting with zzso The domain III is capable of regulating the rate of zzso in zzso since the zzso consisting only of zzso zzso has a zzso higher intrinsic zzso compared to the native zzso No in zzso zzso zzso synthesis was zzso with a mixture of zzso amounts of zzso zzso and domain III, demonstrating the necessity of zzso linkage between the zzso of zzso for zzso zzso In contrast to native zzso and zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent the zzso consisting of zzso zzso are unstable at elevated zzso This indicates that zzso zzso strongly contribute to the zzso stability of this zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso from domain I of zzso zzso zzso decreases the zzso to that of zzso from zzso coli, which does not have these zzso zzso interactions must be important for the zzso of the structure of domain I, since isolated zzso zzso zzso is zzso despite the presence of the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
