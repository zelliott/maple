The zzso zzso B zzso and the zzso protein zzso are involved in the response of potato zzso induction to the zzso However, whether they act in the same zzso zzso is zzso Here we show the effect of a zzso zzso on this zzso zzso zzso levels are higher under zzso short days than under zzso long days and are zzso in zzso at the onset of zzso zzso of this zzso in potato promotes zzso zzso zzso under moderately zzso zzso and triggers zzso formation under long zzso In plants with a reduced abundance of zzso which zzso under long days, both zzso zzso and zzso levels are reduced in leaves and increased in zzso This, together with the presence of zzso in vascular zzso and the graft zzso of its effect on zzso indicates that either zzso might be mobile or it regulates long-distance signals to induce zzso zzso with this, plants zzso zzso show increased levels of zzso zzso which has been reported to be zzso through zzso Furthermore, we identify an zzso zzso containing a zzso binding site, which is zzso in plants zzso zzso and plants in which zzso is zzso Altogether, our results suggest that zzso probably acts downstream of the zzso zzso zzso and upstream of the zzso promoter zzso and allow us to propose a model for the control of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso
