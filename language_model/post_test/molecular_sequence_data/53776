zzso the zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system, zzso the zzso reduction of an zzso zzso bond in the other zzso zzso which in turn reduces zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso of zzso is zzso identical to that of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso contains an additional zzso zzso domain possessing a second zzso zzso center also required for zzso zzso Our studies indicate that this zzso contains a tandem repeat of two zzso zzso zzso the second of which contains the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso properties of independently expressed fragments of zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain zzso have been zzso zzso zzso reductive zzso and circular zzso studies of the fragments indicate that each folds properly and retains many functional zzso zzso transfer between zzso and zzso is, however, relatively slow (4 zzso zzso zzso zzso at 25 degrees zzso and zzso up to 100 zzso zzso zzso is nearly as efficient at zzso reduction as is zzso although neither the latter fragment, nor intact zzso can reduce zzso An engineered zzso zzso zzso with a zzso attached via a zzso bond has been used to demonstrate that only zzso and not zzso is capable of electron transfer to zzso thereby establishing the direct role this zzso domain plays in zzso electron transfer between the zzso part of zzso and zzso
