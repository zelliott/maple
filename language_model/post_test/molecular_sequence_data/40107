To identify genes specifically activated during zzso zzso suppression zzso zzso was performed with zzso from zzso and intact zzso zzso a zzso zzso that can zzso a complete zzso from small body fragments within 4-5 zzso zzso array screening subsequently revealed that about 38% of the zzso zzso clones contained genes that were zzso during zzso Two hundred zzso of these clones were zzso and found to contain 165 different sequences (79 known and 86 zzso Nine clones were fully zzso and four of these sequences were matched to known genes for zzso zzso zzso 1, retinal protein 4, and zzso zzso zzso The remaining five clones zzso an unknown zzso zzso The expression levels of these genes were highest during zzso zzso Our present results, therefore, demonstrate the great potential of zzso as a new experimental subject for the exploration of unknown genes that play critical roles in animal zzso
