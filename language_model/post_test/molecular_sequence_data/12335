Recent advances in molecular biology are making it possible to diagnose genetic diseases and identify pathogens through the analysis of zzso As clinical applications for molecular diagnosis increase, zzso reliable methods for determination of DNA size will be zzso Mass zzso offers the potential of analyzing amplified DNA quickly and zzso without the need for zzso separation and sample labeling steps that are conventionally zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso have been evaluated for the size analysis of DNA using both synthetic zzso and zzso samples corresponding to bases zzso to 1701 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso Both technologies have been demonstrated to have mass range and sensitivity required for the analysis of zzso DNA in this size range using minimal sample zzso Steps required to incorporate either zzso technique into a reliable zzso scheme for the zzso routine analysis of DNA are zzso
