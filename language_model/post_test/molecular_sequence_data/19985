zzso protein identification sometimes requires careful discrimination between closely related protein zzso that may differ by as little as a single zzso acid substitution or zzso zzso The zzso zzso Research Group sent a mixture of three zzso each of three closely related proteins to laboratories who requested it in the form of intact zzso and participating laboratories were asked to identify the proteins and report their zzso The primary goal of the zzso Study was to give participating laboratories a chance to evaluate their capabilities and practices with regards to sample zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso methods zzso zzso zzso zzso and approaches to protein identification zzso use of software, and/or manual techniques to facilitate zzso as well as determination of zzso acid or zzso zzso Of the 42 laboratories that responded, 8 zzso correctly identified all three zzso and zzso zzso of each, 16 zzso labs correctly identified two zzso 9 zzso correctly identified two zzso but also made at least one incorrect zzso and 9 zzso made no correct protein zzso All but one lab used mass zzso and data submitted enabled a comparison of strategies and methods zzso
