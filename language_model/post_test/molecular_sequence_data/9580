The overuse of antibiotics in medicine, animal zzso and zzso industry increases the emergence of zzso resistant bacteria and zzso resistance genes zzso and also, zzso the dissemination of zzso within environmental zzso In this study, the total DNA was directly extracted from environmental samples, and the upstream and downstream of zzso resistance genes were directly amplified by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso the zzso program, the multiple zzso sequences of zzso including 6 upstream sequences and 9 downstream zzso were simultaneously zzso Through the zzso analysis, the upstream of zzso presented a perfect zzso repeat zzso a known zzso regulator zzso and an zzso sequence zzso whereas the downstream of zzso presented a most conservative zzso and a common open reading frame zzso coding zzso This study not only revealed several zzso zzso zzso gene zzso but also supplied a zzso and convenient methodology for the research of zzso dissemination within bacteria, zzso zzso several zzso sequences could be concisely obtained from one sample by using zzso zzso
