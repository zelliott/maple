In the early zzso following breakthroughs in zzso chemistry, the total chemical synthesis of zzso has been zzso representing the zzso binding domain of zzso (the active zzso The selective zzso of zzso factor zzso thus obtained represent a new type of zzso zzso In a further step, based on the knowledge of the mechanism of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso an zzso binding domain prolonged by a zzso binding domain, were designed and zzso in the zzso zzso These compounds inhibit both factor zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso with the full zzso activity of zzso but devoid of zzso zzso zzso particularly with zzso factor 4 zzso they might represent zzso ideal zzso zzso
