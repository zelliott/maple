Previous studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rice, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso zzso in zzso virus zzso protein 4 zzso that zzso zzso synthesis after its normal zzso at the end of the early phase of zzso We now report identification of two different zzso zzso in zzso of zzso to zzso in zzso or zzso to zzso in zzso that also zzso zzso zzso These same zzso caused severely reduced zzso processing by zzso and recognition of the internal promoter for zzso zzso synthesis and were responsible for the conditional zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso zzso of zzso synthesis by zzso in zzso resembled that in zzso it was a zzso property of stable replication complexes and did not require continuation of viral protein zzso zzso viruses expressing both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso synthesis more efficiently than did either zzso protein alone, consistent with the hypothesis that both zzso and zzso participate in template zzso We propose that these zzso cause zzso and zzso to switch from their normal preference to recognize negative strands as templates to recognize positive strands and thereby mimic the initial formation of a replication zzso
