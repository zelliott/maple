The zzso zzso gene sequences from three zzso canine distemper viruses zzso isolated during zzso were zzso to determine whether contemporary strains had undergone significant genetic changes relative to the currently used vaccine zzso The new zzso were closely related to each other zzso zzso and displayed about zzso sequence zzso to the zzso and zzso vaccine zzso There were one to four additional potential zzso sites compared to the vaccine strains which were also present in a German dog zzso isolate dating from zzso However, only a very slight reduction in zzso zzso against the new zzso was found when compared with the zzso and zzso vaccine zzso zzso and zzso zzso were well zzso indicating a zzso three zzso structure for the zzso By zzso analysis the recent zzso showed a narrow zzso close to the previous canine zzso indicating a linear pattern of evolutionary zzso A comparison with published zzso H gene sequences suggested the presence of different lineages of zzso on a global scale and possible zzso of more than one zzso of zzso
