The zzso are a family of related zzso found in the embryonic zzso zzso To date, five members of this family have been zzso zzso and zzso have similar primary structure, but are expressed in different zzso at different times during zzso zzso zzso and cartilage zzso protein belong to a second zzso zzso in which the zzso of each zzso is most similar to zzso and zzso Here we report the cloning and sequencing of a novel probe to avian zzso We have used this probe to determine the origins of zzso in the chick zzso by in zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts first appear in the zzso surrounding bone zzso coinciding with the initial stages of zzso The expression in zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso are not seen in the zzso of bone collars in developing long zzso This pattern is distinct from avian zzso which is expressed in zzso and embryonic zzso zzso zzso Our observations indicate that zzso zzso are the principal site of zzso expression in the zzso The diverse origins of different zzso gene family members imply distinctive roles for these proteins related to the growth and differentiation of cartilage, zzso and zzso
