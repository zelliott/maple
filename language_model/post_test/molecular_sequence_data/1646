zzso zzso island 1 zzso harbors a zzso resistance zzso gene cluster which is a complex class 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso gene clusters zzso different zzso profiles have also been identified in several zzso zzso zzso and classified as zzso to zzso A retrospective study was undertaken to characterize zzso regions from zzso zzso strains harboring zzso isolated from poultry in Belgium between 1992 and zzso A total of zzso zzso zzso zzso displaying resistance to at least one antibiotic, were studied for the presence of zzso zzso was detected in 94 zzso zzso zzso The most prevalent zzso was zzso zzso which harbors within the zzso complex class 1 zzso a common region zzso containing zzso a putative zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso resistance zzso A new zzso zzso named zzso was identified in two zzso It consisted of the zzso gene zzso as in zzso but with additional zzso of the zzso region zzso Seven strains displaying the typical zzso zzso profile zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed genetic variation at the 3' end of zzso These strains zzso the zzso of the zzso containing zzso as in zzso zzso and zzso However, downstream the right end of zzso they presented different zzso to zzso deletions of the zzso 3' end that extended to the zzso genes zzso and zzso These results suggest a possible role of zzso in deletion formation, as has been reported for some zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis showed that all the zzso zzso zzso strains belonged to a single zzso Thus, zzso is largely encountered in zzso zzso strains isolated from poultry in Belgium, the most prevalent zzso being zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso events resulting in a diversity of zzso gene zzso
