zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso anchored in the zzso zzso zzso by a single zzso segment zzso located at the C zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to catalyze zzso degradation to zzso and its zzso zzso Previous studies suggested that zzso functions as a zzso Using chemical zzso zzso and zzso resonance energy transfer zzso experiments, here we showed that zzso forms zzso in the zzso However, zzso was not observed with a truncated zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso acids zzso which exhibited zzso and nuclear zzso indicating that the zzso is essential for the zzso of zzso in the zzso To identify the interface involved in the zzso interaction, zzso zzso predicted by molecular modeling as a potential zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso and the effects on protein zzso zzso and activity zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso was present exclusively in the zzso and formed zzso with similar activity to those of the wild type zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso was localized not only in the zzso but also in the zzso and nucleus, suggesting it is susceptible to zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso HO activity of the zzso zzso was significantly lower than that of the wild zzso The zzso zzso appears to interfere with the zzso state, as revealed by a lower zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso driven by zzso zzso is crucial for the stabilization and function of zzso in the zzso
