The gene of zzso zzso that protects DNA against zzso with the zzso zzso was inserted into zzso zzso carrying genes of zzso which are rare in zzso zzso The zzso of the gene zzso into zzso was reasoned by zzso of zzso and the zzso carrying the gene zzso because both plasmids contained the same zzso Upon transformation of zzso coli zzso cells with both the zzso zzso zzso and the expression zzso zzso containing the zzso gene zzso under the zzso zzso promoter, a strain of zzso coli was obtained which produced 7 zzso zzso units of the zzso zzso per 1 g wet zzso and this yield was two orders of magnitude higher than the yield of the zzso from the strain free of zzso
