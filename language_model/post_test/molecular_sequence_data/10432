The middle molecular weight zzso protein zzso is relevant to our understanding of zzso zzso in growing zzso both because it exists in all zzso and because it zzso characteristic changes in its zzso state during zzso zzso Indeed, all zzso zzso proteins are believed to have originated by gene zzso from an zzso zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso development has been studied extensively in the frog, zzso zzso through the use of zzso zzso To acquire a better understanding of the relationship of zzso zzso zzso to that of other zzso and to obtain additional zzso to study and zzso zzso in developing zzso we isolated zzso clones from the nervous zzso These clones zzso two forms of zzso which exhibited zzso zzso acid identity overall and zzso zzso and zzso identity over their head, rod, and tail zzso zzso zzso zzso substitution rates between the two forms tied their origin to an ancestral zzso of the zzso zzso which occurred approximately 30 million years zzso zzso substitution rates indicated that the tail domain is evolving more rapidly than the rod zzso Both forms shared structural features in common with other zzso zzso but had only a single example of the zzso zzso motif that is repeated multiple times in the zzso of bird, goldfish and zzso In zzso zzso the zzso transcript was consistently expressed at higher levels than that of zzso although their anatomical patterns of expression were zzso zzso During development, however, only zzso was zzso in retinal zzso cells through stage zzso We speculate that the differences observed between these two forms may represent early stages of protein diversification akin to what occurred after the gene zzso that gave rise to other zzso zzso zzso
