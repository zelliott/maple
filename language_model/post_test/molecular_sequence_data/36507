zzso advances in the technology for the isolation of peptides and small proteins have permitted their identification as zzso markers and enhanced the study of the zzso life of zzso The protocol described here examined large numbers of zzso peptides and small zzso extracted in low pH and boiled so that zzso was zzso These were then zzso zzso using size exclusion and zzso zzso zzso of species in the zzso pools were then generated on zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso The zzso profiles were evaluated with zzso analysis software to identify and zzso zzso zzso and with data compilation programs to sort this information into spreadsheets for comparison of profiles among zzso Using zzso brain, the effects of zzso delay or age were zzso zzso delay produced limited zzso to the profiles, but the effect of age was more zzso Many changes were apparent until 12 months, after which the profiles became more zzso Additional zzso profiling of the zzso demonstrated changes in zzso content as a function of zzso zzso zzso The major strengths of zzso zzso profiling are that it lends itself to automation and can be used to detect changes in peptides and small proteins among experimental groups or subjects without any prior assumptions concerning which ones might be zzso
