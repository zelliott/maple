zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso that zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso and reduces cellular levels of zzso and zzso Although zzso is zzso and zzso is generally zzso zzso zzso signaling promotes cell zzso survival, and zzso zzso zzso is thus in a strategic position to regulate important cell fate decisions which may contribute to normal animal zzso To facilitate studies examining the potential role of zzso zzso and long chain base metabolism in zzso development, we characterized two putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both genes functionally and zzso complement a zzso zzso zzso zzso express predominantly zzso activities, and are capable of zzso a range of zzso and zzso zzso base zzso The two genes demonstrate overlapping but distinct zzso and spatial expression patterns in the zzso zzso and timing of expression is consistent with observed changes in long chain base levels throughout zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated elevated long chain base levels, impaired flight performance, and diminished zzso This is the first reported zzso of a zzso zzso in an animal zzso the associated zzso indicate that zzso and zzso are not redundant in biological function and that zzso zzso is essential for diverse zzso functions in this zzso
