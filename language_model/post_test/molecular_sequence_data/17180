The zzso zzso family of sensory zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso control plant zzso transitions in response to informational light signals throughout the life zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has been shown to zzso into the nucleus where it zzso changes in gene expression by an unknown zzso Here, we have identified two basic zzso zzso zzso factors, designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso which interact specifically with the zzso form of zzso These two factors cluster tightly with zzso and two other zzso zzso proteins in a zzso zzso within the large zzso zzso zzso zzso We have identified a novel sequence motif zzso the active zzso binding zzso zzso that is zzso in these zzso zzso but not in other zzso Using the isolated domain and zzso zzso we have shown that this motif is both necessary and sufficient for binding to zzso zzso expression of the native zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso rescued the zzso zzso in this zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso did zzso These data indicate that the zzso motif is necessary for zzso function in zzso zzso development and suggest that zzso binding of zzso to zzso via the zzso motif is necessary for this function in zzso zzso zzso with the isolated zzso domain detected interaction with zzso but none of the other four zzso zzso zzso the data suggest that the zzso domain provides a zzso recognition module within the zzso family, thereby zzso zzso target specificity on a subset of these zzso factors and, thus, the potential for selective signal channeling to segments of the zzso zzso
