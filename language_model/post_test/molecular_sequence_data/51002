zzso zzso V and zzso zzso IV are zzso zzso peptides with zzso and zzso chain zzso zzso They were isolated from in zzso cultures of zzso species and their sequences were determined by the combined use of positive zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso In organic zzso solution, both peptides exhibited the same zzso zzso secondary structure including a hinge at the level of the central Pro zzso as deduced from zzso zzso Their interaction with neutral zzso zzso was shown to induce leakage of the material zzso in small zzso zzso composed of egg zzso zzso When incorporated into neutral zzso zzso zzso they promoted zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso induced by these peptides were studied in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that whilst zzso IV developed zzso zzso states similar to those induced by zzso but with faster zzso the shorter zzso zzso V promoted much zzso conducting zzso in agreement with zzso zzso zzso
