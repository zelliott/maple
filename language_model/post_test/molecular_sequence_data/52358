The mouse zzso tumor virus zzso zzso gene was cloned into zzso an zzso coli expression zzso containing the zzso zzso coding region of zzso zzso The zzso protein was formed by fusion of the zzso zzso with a zzso which contains a zzso zzso site, followed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso column was used to isolate the zzso zzso After zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso were separated by gel zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso The overall yield of the zzso zzso procedure was about 1 zzso of zzso of culture, and the specific activity was 380 zzso of zzso Like other zzso zzso the zzso zzso was active as a zzso showed maximum activity at pH between 4 and 6, and could be inhibited by zzso A and a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of this zzso reveals its broad zzso showing a clear preference for the zzso zzso mimicking the zzso site at the zzso end of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was also an active zzso and showed a similar zzso (17 zzso for such an zzso although its zzso was about 10 times zzso zzso processing of the zzso zzso was observed after expression of clones containing the natural zzso site, as it occurs at the zzso end of the viral zzso instead of the zzso zzso
