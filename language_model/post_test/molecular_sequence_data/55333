The Venezuelan zzso were, until recently, free of human zzso virus zzso zzso However, in 2007, zzso infection was detected for the first time in the zzso zzso population living in the Eastern part of Venezuela, in the delta of the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to analyze the genetic diversity of the zzso circulating in this zzso 

The pol zzso region was zzso for 16 zzso zzso and for some of them, sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions were zzso All zzso zzso were classified as zzso B, with exception of one that was classified as zzso zzso The 15 zzso B zzso exhibited a high degree of genetic similarity and formed a highly supported zzso cluster in each zzso region zzso zzso analyses of the pol zzso region indicated that the date of the most recent common zzso of the zzso zzso B zzso dates back to the late zzso 

At least two independent introductions of zzso have occurred in the zzso zzso from zzso The zzso zzso B was successfully established and got zzso in the community, while no evidence of local dissemination of the zzso zzso C was detected in this zzso These results warrant further surveys to evaluate the burden of this disease, which can be particularly devastating in this zzso population, with a high prevalence of zzso zzso B, among other infectious diseases, and with limited access to primary health zzso
