zzso play critical roles in zzso trafficking in normal and inflammatory zzso The primary roles of zzso are to activate zzso for zzso adherence on zzso cells and to induce zzso of zzso in tissue zzso zzso in zzso migration is regulated at multiple zzso First, it is achieved through differential tissue expression of zzso and zzso zzso Second, it is achieved by limited and differential expression of zzso receptors by zzso zzso Third, zzso expression of multiple zzso receptors and zzso molecules makes zzso migration more zzso zzso of zzso into various tissue sites zzso inflamed skin, small zzso zzso zzso T cell areas zzso B cell zzso requires different zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, distinct immune responses and diseases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involve different sets of zzso and zzso zzso This review examines the recent advances in research on zzso and zzso receptors in zzso migration of immune cells, and discusses potential targets of intervention in zzso zzso migration in normal and diseased zzso
