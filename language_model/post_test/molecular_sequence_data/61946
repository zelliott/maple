The formation of zzso complexes of zzso binding protein zzso with the minor groove of DNA results in the burial of large zzso surfaces and the exclusion of water from these zzso The release of water is thus expected to provide a significant zzso driving force for formation of the zzso complexes zzso by the binding of zzso to specific zzso In this article are described zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso to 14 zzso zzso bearing either the tightly bound and efficiently transcribed zzso major late promoter zzso or its zzso zzso zzso as a function of neutral zzso zzso These two DNA sequences present the same pattern of minor groove zzso donors and zzso to the zzso zzso complex formation was monitored by zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso interpretation of the results obtained with the zzso sequence required careful consideration of the optical properties of the zzso as a function of zzso concentration to demonstrate that the relative change in the zzso distances for zzso and zzso zzso is the same upon zzso zzso Although the affinity of zzso is slightly greater for the zzso compared with the zzso zzso sequence in the absence of zzso the zzso distances of the bound DNA in complex with zzso the zzso and zzso components of zzso are identical within experimental zzso However, approximately 18 additional molecules of water are released upon zzso binding the zzso as compared with the zzso sequence resulting in an zzso advantage to the binding of the natural promoter zzso These results are considered with regard to differences in the flexibility and zzso of the two DNA zzso
