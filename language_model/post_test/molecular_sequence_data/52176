The interaction of Japanese elderberry bark zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso was investigated by zzso When a low affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was mixed with zzso each zzso signal of beta zzso was zzso The signal of zzso was markedly zzso while those of zzso zzso and zzso of beta zzso were rather zzso The specific broadening of Gal zzso was more evident when zzso was mixed with zzso zzso zzso zzso signal broadening suggests that beta zzso binds to zzso such that zzso is closely involved in the contact region, but zzso zzso and zzso are far from this zzso In the case of a high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signals of the zzso mixture did not change at zzso But when a small amount of zzso was added to the zzso zzso mixture, the broad signals of bound beta zzso became dramatically zzso This indicates that the added zzso molecules liberated the bound beta zzso from zzso On the other hand, the zzso with the zzso zzso could not substitute for bound beta zzso because of its lower zzso This demonstrates that the competitive binding experiment between two zzso is a useful technique to detect the interaction of zzso with high affinity zzso which could not be observed directly by zzso signal broadening and/or chemical shift zzso
