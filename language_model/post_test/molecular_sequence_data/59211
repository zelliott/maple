zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing affinity zzso tags zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso were constructed in order to investigate whether or not these zzso interact with other zzso coli zzso These zzso zzso and zzso had specific activities in zzso that were similar to zzso zzso Crude extracts made from zzso coli cells expressing zzso or zzso were zzso over zzso and proteins zzso with the zzso proteins were identified by zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso At high levels of zzso zzso two zzso proteins zzso and zzso were associated with the zzso zzso but not with the zzso Another major protein recovered with zzso (both at low and high levels of zzso was the zzso zzso zzso zzso The latter interaction was specific, since zzso did not bind the affinity zzso when the affinity tag was present on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso together under some conditions, but these zzso were smaller than and distinct from inner zzso Our findings suggest a possible new mechanism by which the zzso pathways for zzso A and zzso may be zzso
