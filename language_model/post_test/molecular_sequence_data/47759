zzso pathogens have been recognized as a cause of serious systemic diseases among zzso cultured and ornamental fish in the recent zzso zzso of fish due to systemic zzso infection reaching zzso were observed in Europe, Australia, Japan and zzso Up to now, the molecular biology of these important pathogens has been poorly zzso To get better insights on the zzso organization of these zzso zzso we have constructed a zzso viral DNA library from the zzso zzso necrosis virus zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been selected for systematic zzso zzso and 12 are localized side by side along the zzso and cover the 2/3 part of the total zzso zzso which has been estimated to be approximately zzso zzso in zzso Thirty five zzso pairs zzso from zzso and 10 zzso from zzso have been zzso zzso analysis revealed open reading frames zzso sharing zzso with sequences from the zzso virus 3 such as the zzso and zzso zzso Among the others identified zzso some of them presented zzso with known protein zzso such as the human zzso zzso and some did not show any significant zzso with sequences available in the zzso But, none were related to zzso virus, a member of the zzso family, for which the full zzso zzso sequence has been zzso
