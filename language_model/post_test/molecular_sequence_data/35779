We have recently isolated a functional promoter zzso the human zzso protein zzso gene from zzso zzso cells by zzso chain reaction (The zzso Data Library zzso number zzso zzso This promoter DNA segment zzso zzso was fused to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso reporter gene and expressed in zzso zzso zzso retains zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso deletion zzso we found three zzso expression elements zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which is contained in a segment spanning zzso caused a 50% loss of the zzso zzso removal together with the middle zzso zzso which is contained in a segment spanning zzso resulted in a further zzso loss of the zzso Further removal of the zzso zzso zzso which spans zzso abolished greater than zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, an zzso element zzso appeared to be associated with the zzso At least a zzso zzso remained as long as the zzso promoter retained the sequences zzso Using an in zzso gel mobility shift zzso an zzso nuclear factor zzso was detected from zzso zzso DNA binding competition experiments indicate that the zzso segment contains a sequence motif which interacts with this cellular zzso Further analysis showed that the two direct repeats, ranging zzso and zzso are the target for zzso zzso A zzso fold increase of the zzso binding to both repeated sequences was detected from induced zzso Similar results were also demonstrated in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso control of zzso gene expression in zzso cells is zzso These findings also imply that the identified nuclear factor may be important in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
