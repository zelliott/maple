The main goal of this work was to develop rapid and accurate molecular tools to discriminate species of white industrial zzso We applied three different zzso chain reaction zzso based zzso zzso of the ITS region of the zzso gene unit and of the zzso end of the beta zzso gene yielded zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso restriction sites were found in both zzso These may be used in diagnostic zzso analysis to rapidly distinguish between the two zzso zzso Random amplified zzso DNA zzso markers were also useful to differentiate these two species, but no zzso was found at the zzso level, which evidenced a high level of zzso of the zzso zzso By means of these three techniques, the real identity of industrial strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso could be zzso The comparison of these zzso with type strains of the two species suggested that the former zzso to zzso zzso The genetic zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso was also zzso
