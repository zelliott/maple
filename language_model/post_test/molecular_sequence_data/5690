The zzso DNA for a novel member of the zzso family zzso was cloned and characterized from the colonial marine zzso zzso zzso Using a differential display of zzso by means of zzso a small zzso zzso of 380 zzso was found to be specifically expressed in a colony undergoing zzso rejection zzso as compared with zzso parts of the same zzso This zzso zzso was used as a probe to screen a zzso library of zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing an zzso of zzso zzso with no zzso was zzso The zzso protein exhibits a typical structure of zzso an zzso domain with zzso repeated sequences zzso zzso a single zzso domain and a zzso zzso tail zzso The zzso zzso sequence shows zzso identity to mature classical zzso type I, zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as mature classical zzso type II, zzso human zzso zzso and zzso This zzso represents a new zzso gene family, zzso distant to all other known classical zzso
