zzso II zzso zzso is an zzso generated by the sequential zzso action of zzso and zzso converting zzso on the zzso zzso While numerous zzso zzso have been shown to express some or all of the components of the zzso system zzso the function of most of these tissue zzso remains a matter of zzso To test for zzso functions of zzso II and as an alternative to zzso all the components of zzso we have engineered a fusion protein that leads to direct zzso II release within specific zzso The zzso zzso is zzso from the fusion protein within the zzso zzso by the ubiquitous zzso zzso and is released from the cell by zzso zzso zzso injection of an expression zzso zzso such a fusion protein into rat cardiac zzso results in a highly localized expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso (an zzso responsive marker of cardiac zzso demonstrating the utility of this approach for local targeting of mature peptides to zzso in animal zzso
