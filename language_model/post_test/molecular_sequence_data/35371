The zzso and V2 variable regions of the zzso zzso viruses contribute to the zzso association domain of the zzso exterior envelope zzso A pair of V2 zzso zzso at 183 and 191 zzso zzso is present in several zzso zzso zzso human zzso virus type 2 zzso and some zzso zzso but not in zzso To examine the role of this potentially zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso envelope zzso were individually and zzso zzso by zzso zzso All of the zzso zzso exhibited decreases in zzso association with the zzso zzso zzso activity, and ability to support virus zzso Thus, the zzso motif plays a role in zzso zzso stabilization in zzso and may do so in zzso and some zzso as zzso This implies that zzso lost the zzso and may have relatively unstable zzso zzso compared to zzso and zzso
