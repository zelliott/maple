Through extensive isolation of zzso zzso against zzso influenza viruses representing the in zzso repertoire in a human zzso we examined the relationships between zzso drift of influenza virus and protective zzso generated in an infected zzso The majority of zzso isolated from a donor born in 1960 were divided into three major groups with distinct strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the present study, we developed a new method that allowed us to zzso determine the location of zzso recognized by many zzso Original zzso zzso of several strains and zzso zzso in which one of the seven sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D or zzso was replaced by some other zzso zzso were artificially expressed on the cell zzso The binding activity of zzso to the zzso was examined by flow zzso By using this method, we determined the location of zzso recognized by 98 different zzso zzso that neutralize the zzso strains bind to site zzso A or zzso While sites C, E and B were recognized by clones that neutralized the zzso zzso the majority of these clones bind to site zzso zzso that neutralize the zzso strains bind to site B, zzso zzso or zzso
