zzso detection of proteins with zzso zzso that are dependent on the native spatial zzso of the protein can often pose problems with conventional two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso For example, many zzso zzso are readily destroyed by reducing agents and/or zzso zzso which are critical components of many of the conventional zzso focusing and zzso zzso protocols used in the first zzso zzso Here we describe the use of commercially available zzso zzso gels for performing zzso zzso of proteins extracted from the human colon cancer cell line zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso that permit the identification of zzso with zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso related studies demonstrated the usefulness of zzso zzso for identifying zzso resolved zzso Here we show how partial protein sequence data obtained by rapid zzso zzso using zzso column liquid zzso directly coupled with zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso enhances the usefulness of this approach for identifying incompletely resolved zzso The zzso zzso gel images reported in this study, along with our master zzso gel protein database for both normal human zzso zzso and several zzso cell lines, and information regarding zzso employed in this laboratory for obtaining structural data on zzso resolved proteins can be zzso over the Internet using World Wide Web zzso address: zzso
