Two conservative gene zzso the zzso zzso protein region and one (of the zzso set of zzso zzso were split in a zzso crossover zzso event in zzso zzso As a result of the zzso the major part of the zzso zzso protein cluster is located upstream of genes for zzso zzso zzso but the genes zzso are located immediately downstream of the isolated gene for zzso zzso zzso A new zzso protein cluster zzso was zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis revealed that this zzso protein cluster is an zzso
