Water deficit and the resulting zzso stress affect plant zzso To understand how plant cells monitor and respond to zzso change from water stress, we isolated a zzso from dehydrated zzso zzso This zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso mapping showed that the zzso gene is on zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein has two putative zzso regions in the zzso half and has structural similarity to the zzso zzso synthetic lethal of zzso rule 1 zzso The zzso transcript was more abundant in roots than other zzso under normal growth conditions and accumulated under conditions of high or low zzso zzso analysis of zzso activities driven by the zzso promoter further indicates that the zzso gene is zzso zzso in response to changes in external zzso zzso of the zzso zzso suppressed the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso in which zzso His or zzso zzso had been zzso failed to complement the zzso zzso indicating that zzso functions as a zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso zzso into the zzso double zzso zzso zzso which lacks two zzso suppressed zzso in zzso media and activated the zzso zzso response 1 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso These results imply that zzso functions as an zzso and zzso the stress signal to a downstream zzso zzso
