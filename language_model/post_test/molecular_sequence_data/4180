We present a structural study of zzso zzso zzso interacting with the zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso using grazing zzso X-ray zzso and zzso space mapping zzso zzso The short-range order of zzso chains in zzso is found to be strongly reduced by the zzso From the scattering intensity of the chain correlation peak, we can zzso the lateral length scale R over which the zzso structure is affected by zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso is discussed in the framework of zzso elasticity zzso
