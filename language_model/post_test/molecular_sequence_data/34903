The structures of zzso zzso I zzso from zzso album zzso with zzso and zzso have been determined at zzso A resolution and refined to R factors of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and belongs to the class of zzso proteins of type II, which consist of two zzso The zzso has zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso and zzso binds to zzso zzso and zzso on cell zzso zzso binding is performed by two binding sites in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso separated by approximately 62 A from each zzso The zzso binding of zzso in zzso zzso is achieved via hydrogen bonds connecting the zzso and zzso groups of the sugar zzso with the side chains of zzso zzso and zzso and the main chain of zzso The aromatic ring of zzso on top of the preferred binding pocket supports van der zzso packing of the zzso face of zzso and zzso the zzso zzso In the zzso site II of zzso zzso zzso provides the zzso stacking and the side chains of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso partners for zzso In the case of the zzso site I, the zzso group also zzso the zzso complex, an interaction thus far rarely detected in zzso zzso Finally, a potential third zzso zzso site in zzso zzso was identified in the present zzso structures, in which a zzso zzso from the zzso buffer has bound, mimicking the sugar zzso
