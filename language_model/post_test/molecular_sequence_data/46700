zzso I is a zzso protein of unknown function that binds to zzso a zzso that is implicated in zzso and recycling of synaptic zzso Here we show that zzso I is essential for the formation of zzso zzso zzso from the plasma zzso zzso I exhibits zzso acid zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso formation requires the transfer of the zzso fatty acid zzso to zzso acid, converting it to zzso zzso A deletion zzso lacking the zzso domain through which zzso I interacts with zzso still exhibits zzso activity but no longer mediates zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso I may induce negative membrane zzso by converting an zzso zzso to a zzso zzso in the zzso leaflet of the zzso We propose that, through this action, zzso I works with zzso to mediate synaptic zzso zzso from the plasma membrane and zzso
