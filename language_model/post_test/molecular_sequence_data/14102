zzso restriction fragments were genetically mapped to a previously described linkage map of zzso zzso using zzso identified by a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequences was observed in progeny zzso creating a potential for zzso of zzso Therefore a consensus segregation data set used to minimize mapping zzso zzso of the 14 zzso were found to be genetically linked to existing zzso zzso zzso zzso of restricted zzso confirmed these linkage assignments and revealed the zzso location of the two zzso zzso We were thus able to assign all 14 zzso zzso zzso to their respective zzso zzso The Achilles' zzso zzso technique was employed to determine that zzso 1 markers 11 and zzso were approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, from their nearest zzso zzso was also used to determine that zzso zzso 6 was approximately zzso zzso from marker zzso in strain zzso and 580 zzso in zzso These experiments indicated that large portions of some zzso ends are zzso by genetic markers and provided estimates of the relationship of genetic to physical distance in these regions of the zzso
