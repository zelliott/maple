A series of zzso cell lines which zzso express zzso zzso carrying point zzso at zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso 2 has been zzso The zzso generate zzso zzso zzso sites and activate a common 3' cryptic zzso site upstream leading to zzso spliced zzso zzso zzso zzso which in zzso blocked zzso zzso sites and restored correct zzso of the zzso revealed major differences in the sensitivity of these sites to zzso zzso Although the targeted zzso differed only by single point zzso the effective zzso of the zzso required for correction of zzso varied up to zzso The differences among the zzso zzso zzso sites affected sensitivity of both the zzso and 3' zzso zzso in particular, sensitivity of both zzso sites was severely reduced by modification of the zzso zzso zzso sites to the consensus zzso These results suggest large differences in zzso of very similar zzso in zzso They also indicate that zzso zzso may provide useful tools for studying the interactions of zzso machinery with zzso
