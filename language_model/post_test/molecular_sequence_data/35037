zzso is a newly characterized gene family involved in early zzso zzso interactions and iron zzso In this study, we searched the zzso of zzso by extensive zzso survey and found no zzso zzso in zzso zzso but 12 in zzso zzso zzso and 21 in zzso zzso zzso Some zzso zzso cortical zzso zzso zzso have unknown zzso sequences between zzso domain zzso and zzso zzso the boundaries of which are equivalent to zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso located in the base, zzso tree comprises four main zzso representing zzso frog, fish, and zzso indicating that zzso genes undergo extensive zzso zzso or gene zzso However, zzso neighborhood surrounding analysis shows that clear zzso are difficult to be established among these zzso In addition, sequence comparison and zzso analysis of zzso from zzso and other zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso and human indicate zzso of zzso are zzso Likewise, these zzso and zzso genes may be close to zzso zzso
