zzso zzso against rat liver zzso zzso zzso were used to develop a rapid zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a single band upon sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The sequence of the zzso 24 zzso acids was zzso This part of the sequence showed only zzso zzso with that of rat pancreatic zzso zzso but was zzso identical to that of rat zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are distinguished from pancreatic zzso zzso by the absence of zzso In rat liver zzso zzso activity has been reported in various zzso zzso All of these require zzso and have a pH optimum in the alkaline region, but little is known about the structural relationship and quantitative distribution of these zzso We have investigated these points after zzso of the zzso zzso activity from total zzso and crude zzso zzso by extraction with 1 M zzso zzso Essentially all of the zzso activity could be zzso by this procedure indicating that the zzso occurred in soluble or peripherally zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso zzso zzso from membrane zzso shared a common zzso with the zzso zzso The quantitative distribution of the zzso zzso activity among zzso zzso followed closely that of the zzso marker zzso c zzso zzso liver zzso contained additional zzso and zzso zzso zzso
