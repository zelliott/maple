zzso binding at the zzso response element of the rat alpha 2 zzso gene were zzso by a combination of zzso procedures including binding zzso zzso zzso as the principal zzso Three zzso of 92, 91, and 86 zzso were enriched approximately zzso from zzso of rat zzso excised 12 h after the induction of an experimental acute phase zzso zzso acid sequence analysis identified the zzso and zzso species as two forms of the zzso factor zzso and the zzso species as the factor zzso This identification was confirmed by gel mobility zzso experiments using specific zzso for zzso and zzso zzso activated zzso was also detected in the zzso of zzso control zzso zzso clones representing zzso and two zzso of zzso were isolated from a zzso library prepared with zzso from rat zzso excised at the peak of an experimental acute phase zzso zzso zzso predicted from zzso consisted of zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso delta zzso lacked 41 zzso acids at the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of rat zzso showed zzso overall identity with rat zzso zzso with sheep zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso
