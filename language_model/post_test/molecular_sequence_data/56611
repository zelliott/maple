A zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso IV has been zzso that contains the zzso gene which, when present on a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The open reading frame of zzso is zzso zzso in size and encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The predicted protein shows strong zzso to several zzso alcohol zzso and contains a sequence characteristic of binding sites for zzso zzso of the zzso gene leads to enhanced consumption of formaldehyde, which is most probably the reason for the observed zzso zzso In zzso disruption zzso sensitivity to zzso is correlated with reduced degradation of the zzso The zzso gene shares an zzso zzso divergent promoter with zzso a gene of yet unknown zzso zzso deletion studies with a zzso zzso gene fusion construct revealed negative interference on expression of zzso by upstream zzso The upstream region between positions zzso and zzso is totally or partially responsible for control of zzso of zzso by chemicals such as zzso zzso ethanol and zzso zzso The 41 zzso zzso protein was zzso from a zzso zzso it zzso zzso alcohols and, in the presence of zzso is able to zzso zzso zzso is predicted to code for a zzso alcohol zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
