Recently, the study of zzso zzso zzso has contributed enormously to understanding of gene zzso and function evolution, particularly in zzso We identified four zzso zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso and zzso The complex displayed tandem array structure in the zzso Analysis of spatial expression profiles showed that they all were expressed in obviously higher levels in wing disc than in other zzso suggesting that they might play important roles in the development of the zzso Furthermore, we found that their expression profiles in the wing discs were mostly correlated with the development of the zzso especially the zzso zzso zzso interference results further indicated that zzso was necessary for scale formation in zzso zzso
