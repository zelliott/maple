In contrast to zzso species zzso has a single zzso heavy chain gene that apparently encodes all zzso heavy chain zzso zzso also contain a zzso zzso heavy chain zzso that by zzso and zzso mapping criteria is clearly different from the major zzso muscle zzso Here, we identify the gene that encodes this zzso zzso and demonstrate that it is distinct from the muscle zzso heavy chain zzso Thus, fly zzso heavy chains are the products of a gene zzso Our data suggest that the zzso function required to power zzso based movement in zzso cells requires zzso diversity beyond that available in a single heavy chain zzso In addition, we show, that zzso of zzso zzso transcripts is regulated in a zzso stage specific fashion, consistent with a key role for this protein in the movements of early zzso
