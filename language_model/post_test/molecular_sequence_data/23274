The zzso form of zzso also known as low molecular weight zzso is found in increased zzso in patients chronically infected with a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens or suffering from various zzso zzso Whether zzso zzso contributes to the disease process, however, is not zzso To address this question, transgenic mice were created that zzso elevated levels of zzso zzso In normal mice zzso the presence of zzso zzso did not alter the composition of the immune system zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso levels were normal, with the exception of increased levels of zzso due to the presence of the zzso zzso responses also appeared to be zzso zzso mice did develop antinuclear zzso zzso earlier than zzso zzso but did not develop further indications of zzso zzso When the zzso was expressed in the zzso strain of mice, zzso zzso these mice developed zzso manifestations more rapidly than zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice also displayed earlier evidence of immune complex deposition in the zzso From these results, we conclude that zzso zzso does not induce zzso disease, but its presence can accelerate the onset of zzso manifestations in otherwise zzso prone zzso
