zzso zzso zzso of activated protein zzso C zzso zzso is zzso by their binding to zzso zzso zzso for activated zzso Our laboratory has previously isolated one such zzso zzso and demonstrated that this protein displays specificity for zzso We have recently shown that at least part of the zzso zzso site on zzso lies within the unique zzso region of this zzso zzso zzso zzso Gray, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we have used the zzso zzso region to clone a zzso zzso which was identified as the zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso contains seven repeats of the zzso motif and fulfills the criteria previously established for zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in cardiac zzso and binds to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso A role for zzso in control of zzso has been previously suggested, but this is the first report of direct zzso interaction of zzso with a protein involved in zzso zzso
