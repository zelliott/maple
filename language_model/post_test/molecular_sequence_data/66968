zzso outer membrane protein is one of the candidates for a vaccine zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso children who have zzso episodes of acute zzso media due to zzso fail to respond adequately to zzso An innovative approach to vaccination is therefore required to augment such children's immune zzso To develop an effective zzso zzso we established zzso zzso zzso lines zzso restricted by the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and revealed a human zzso zzso on zzso and its core zzso sequence zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that 3 analog zzso zzso (the substitution of E at position 77 with zzso zzso and zzso induced high zzso responses as well as marked zzso production when compared to the zzso zzso zzso These peptides may be candidates for a zzso vaccine zzso effective against zzso infections, even in zzso zzso
