The zzso zzso degradation zzso is increasingly being recognized as important in regulation of protein turnover in zzso zzso One zzso of this zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the reductive zzso of zzso to form zzso and is essential for DNA replication during cell growth and zzso Previous work from our laboratory showed that degradation of zzso is zzso and zzso by an zzso zzso zzso region at the zzso end of the zzso In the current study we show that this region, in cooperation with an zzso formed by the next 15 zzso functions as a zzso zzso it is capable of zzso a zzso protein to which it is zzso Comparative analysis of the primary sequence of zzso from a number of zzso species revealed that the zzso domain is zzso among species yet is zzso with regard to its zzso nature, its high Pro content, and the occurrence of Pro at the penultimate zzso zzso of zzso proteins showed that zzso protects the N zzso against zzso a zzso process that zzso zzso zzso However, although a free zzso group at the N zzso is necessary, it is not sufficient for degradation of the zzso The implications of these findings to the zzso function of the zzso domain, particularly with regard to its intrinsic flexibility, are zzso
