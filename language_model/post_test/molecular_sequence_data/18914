Active DNA zzso are important tools for gene functional zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in rice zzso zzso zzso is expected to generate various zzso zzso because zzso elements tend to insert into zzso regions under natural growth zzso We have developed a specific method zzso for efficient detection of zzso insertions and successfully identified the zzso zzso zzso gene in a variegated zzso zzso zzso obtained from the zzso rice tagging zzso The variegated zzso zzso was caused by zzso and zzso of zzso in the zzso region of the zzso gene predicted to zzso an unknown protein with the zzso zzso transit zzso zzso expression was detected in various rice zzso at different zzso zzso However, zzso analysis indicated that zzso protein zzso was strictly regulated in a zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso bodies were zzso This study revealed that zzso is essential for the beginning of zzso membrane organization during zzso zzso Furthermore, we provide a zzso perspective on the zzso tagging line to characterize unidentified gene functions in zzso
