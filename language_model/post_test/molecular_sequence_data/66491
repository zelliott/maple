Despite longstanding interest in parallel evolution, little is known about the genes that control similar traits in different lineages of zzso zzso reduction in zzso fish zzso zzso provides a striking example of parallel evolution in a genetically zzso zzso Previous studies suggest that zzso regulatory changes at the zzso locus control pelvic reduction in a population of zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, progeny from zzso crosses between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed severe pelvic reduction, implicating a similar genetic origin for this trait in both zzso Comparative sequencing studies in complete and zzso zzso revealed no differences in the zzso coding zzso but zzso expression was absent from the prospective pelvic region of larvae from zzso zzso A much more zzso distant example of pelvic reduction, loss of zzso in zzso shows a similar zzso size bias that is a zzso signature of zzso pelvic reduction in both zzso and zzso These multiple lines of evidence suggest that changes in zzso may represent a key mechanism of zzso evolution in multiple zzso species, and zzso of zzso as well as in zzso related zzso zzso
