We cloned and determined the sequence of a DNA region of approximately zzso containing the cluster of genes required for zzso zzso expression in the zzso coli K-12 strain from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequencing analysis revealed that the minimum essential region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene cluster had a size of approximately zzso and contained 9 zzso open reading frames zzso which were almost identical to the corresponding zzso of zzso zzso form I zzso gene region, except for zzso zzso at the DNA as well as zzso acid zzso The putative function of most of the zzso could be determined on the basis of zzso acid sequence similarities and zzso In addition, the zzso content of the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes was lower than that of the zzso DNA of zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso form I zzso genes had been derived from the same origin with a low zzso zzso
