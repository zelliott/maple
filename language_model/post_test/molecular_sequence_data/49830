zzso zzso modifications mediate zzso and zzso interactions and are often essential for zzso The purposes of this study were to examine the zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso D zzso that could be a target for zzso and to clarify the function of this zzso zzso is an integral membrane protein that cycles between the trans zzso network and the plasma zzso We constructed zzso cells zzso expressing various zzso carrying a reporter protein zzso fused to a zzso domain and the zzso zzso zzso Some of the zzso contained the three zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso region, while other zzso contained Ala in place of the zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso were zzso while those zzso lacking the zzso zzso were zzso Because zzso of several proteins affects their association with cholesterol and zzso membrane zzso or zzso we tested zzso zzso and several of the reporter zzso for resistance to extraction with zzso zzso A construct containing the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain was soluble in zzso zzso as was zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso does not target zzso to zzso membrane zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso that lack zzso sites have an increased zzso a slightly more diffuse zzso zzso and a slower rate of exit from the zzso as compared with zzso containing zzso zzso Thus, the zzso attachment of zzso acid to the zzso zzso of zzso has a functional significance in the trafficking of the zzso
