A zzso acid zzso zzso for the detection of the zzso gene of zzso zzso has been zzso The method involves solution zzso of zzso specific synthetic zzso zzso to zzso DNA in crude cell zzso This is followed by capture of the zzso complex onto a zzso dish well, signal amplification and zzso based on zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso is achieved with a zzso zzso zzso With a detection limit of about 20,000 cells, the zzso zzso is as sensitive as a radioactive zzso zzso Over 150 strains of zzso zzso collected from a variety of sources were detected with the zzso Several zzso zzso zzso were also found to react zzso No zzso was observed with zzso zzso zzso or with other known zzso or normal microbial inhabitants of the human zzso zzso
