It is zzso that basic zzso in the regulatory region of zzso light chain zzso are important for zzso zzso by binding to the zzso zzso To investigate this proposal, 10 basic zzso acids within the regulatory region of rabbit smooth muscle zzso light chain zzso zzso were replaced either singularly or in combination with zzso or zzso zzso by zzso zzso All active zzso zzso were dependent on zzso for zzso zzso None of the zzso was active in the absence of zzso suggesting that the zzso region has not been defined zzso zzso reversal zzso at zzso zzso and zzso resulted in loss of high affinity binding of zzso and increased the concentration of zzso required for zzso zzso zzso The charge reversal zzso at zzso also increased zzso but to a lesser zzso zzso reversal zzso at zzso and zzso resulted in an inactive zzso light chain zzso that could not be zzso zzso When these zzso were zzso to Ala, the expressed zzso was dependent upon zzso for activity and exhibited a decrease in zzso zzso reversal zzso in zzso and zzso also had decreased zzso zzso These basic zzso zzso of the zzso binding domain may play an important role in the zzso of the zzso
