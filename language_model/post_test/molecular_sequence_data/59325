The zzso or zzso class of zzso zzso factors is represented in zzso by zzso and zzso alternative zzso products of the zzso zzso zzso has been previously reported to inhibit DNA binding by the zzso class factor zzso via the formation of zzso zzso Here we report that expression of the zzso message is zzso late in the embryonic phase of zzso development, and zzso is the preferred zzso zzso Although zzso lacks two basic zzso acid zzso in the zzso found in zzso and zzso these three zzso class proteins exhibit very similar zzso zzso In contrast to previously published reports, the results presented here show no effect of zzso on DNA binding by zzso and no evidence for zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene products function by zzso mechanisms similar to those of the zzso zzso class factors expressed in other species, not by unique zzso zzso
