The zzso regulated zzso locus in zzso coli has two zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso respectively, by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the equivalent of the zzso promoter does not appear to exist in zzso zzso We demonstrate in this study that zzso zzso zzso has a cryptic zzso promoter that is recognized by zzso zzso zzso in zzso and that a zzso deletion from zzso to zzso zzso to the start site of zzso zzso zzso in zzso expression of a reporter gene fusion to zzso zzso extension analysis of zzso isolated from cells carrying the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that a primer which zzso zzso to zzso is able to detect zzso transcripts from both zzso but a primer which zzso zzso to zzso is able to do so only from the zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso promoter in zzso zzso may be rendered cryptic because of zzso zzso zzso within a short distance downstream of the promoter start zzso
