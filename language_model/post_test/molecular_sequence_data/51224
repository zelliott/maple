zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso fixation and zzso zzso in zzso root zzso The zzso can comprise up to zzso of the soluble protein in root zzso We report here the isolation and characterization of a zzso zzso the zzso form of zzso Initially, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected by screening an effective alfalfa zzso zzso library with zzso prepared against root zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso the zzso region of the protein was obtained by zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of alfalfa zzso was deduced from these zzso sequences and shown to bear striking similarity to other plant zzso Southern blots of alfalfa zzso DNA indicate that zzso zzso is a member of a small gene zzso During the development of effective root zzso zzso zzso activity increases to a level that is zzso to zzso greater than that in root and leaf zzso This increase appears to be the result of increases in amount of zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso have substantially less zzso zzso zzso protein and activity than do effective zzso zzso expression of root zzso zzso appears to be related to two zzso The first signal is associated with zzso initiation while the second signal is associated with zzso zzso zzso of root zzso zzso activity may also involve zzso processes affecting zzso activity and/or zzso
