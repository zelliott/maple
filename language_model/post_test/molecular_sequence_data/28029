In a previous study, we zzso three zzso proteins zzso masses 56, 14, and 12 zzso from mouse liver using column zzso and sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The aim of the present study was to determine the zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein thereby establishing any relationship with known zzso Although the zzso zzso of the zzso protein was zzso separate in zzso zzso of the protein with zzso zzso and zzso gave overlapping peptides that provided a continuous sequence of 93 zzso zzso This sequence exhibited a zzso sequence zzso with rat liver fatty zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and partial sequencing of a zzso zzso protein revealed identical zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso protein bound specifically to an zzso column from which the protein and zzso zzso zzso or sodium zzso zzso treatment failed to remove zzso from the zzso indicating that the zzso zzso was tightly bound to the zzso These observations confirm that the mouse liver zzso zzso protein is a fatty zzso zzso The nature of the zzso linkage to the protein still needs to be zzso
