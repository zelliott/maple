Regulatory small zzso zzso in bacterial zzso have become a focus of research over the past 8 zzso Whereas more than 100 such zzso have been found in zzso coli, relatively little is known about zzso in zzso zzso Using a zzso approach, we identified two zzso in zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Recently, we demonstrated that zzso zzso the translation initiation of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe detection of zzso its expression profile, and its regulation by zzso Furthermore, we mapped the secondary structure of zzso zzso is expressed in complex and minimal media in all growth zzso in zzso zzso and, with a similar expression profile, also in zzso zzso Neither zzso nor deletion of zzso affected the growth of zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso in complex and minimal zzso Analysis of 13 putative zzso factor binding sites upstream of zzso revealed only an effect for zzso Here, we showed by using Northern zzso zzso reporter gene zzso in zzso transcription, and zzso I zzso that the zzso of zzso is activated by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso acids and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was increased zzso to zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and this increase was independent of the known zzso zzso zzso is the second target for which zzso zzso by zzso has been zzso
