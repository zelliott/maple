zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be essential to survival of zzso A producing zzso zzso In this study, zzso peptides 12 zzso acids in length were identified from a zzso random zzso library zzso Three peptides displayed zzso activity when expressed zzso one of which zzso represented zzso of the total zzso zzso binds to zzso coli zzso with a zzso of 6 zzso and is competitive with zzso zzso zzso can be zzso fused in zzso with zzso or zzso modified in zzso with zzso and maintain zzso zzso The latter was used to develop an zzso fluorescent binding zzso used to evaluate zzso zzso and is amenable to small zzso library zzso Furthermore, zzso also binds to and zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of 20 zzso unearthing the possibility for the development of small zzso zzso zzso zzso as novel zzso
