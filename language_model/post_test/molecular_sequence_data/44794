In a previous large scale screen for zzso expressed genes in pancreatic cancer, we identified a gene highly zzso in cancer zzso a novel protein with four zzso zzso zzso zzso are found in a subset of zzso zzso including zzso zzso K protein and the fragile X mental zzso gene product zzso By zzso in zzso zzso zzso the identified gene named zzso zzso domain containing protein zzso in zzso was assigned to zzso zzso Two zzso were zzso on zzso 6 and zzso The cloned zzso zzso has a 250 zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso region of zzso contains eight zzso and four zzso reiterated zzso The deduced zzso protein with 580 zzso has a relative molecular mass zzso of approximately zzso (65 zzso The zzso transcript is highly zzso in pancreatic cancer cell lines and in pancreatic cancer tissue as compared to both, normal zzso and chronic zzso zzso High levels of expression were as well found in tissue samples of other human zzso As the zzso domain has been shown to be involved in the regulation of zzso synthesis and zzso we speculate that zzso may assume a role in the regulation of zzso cell proliferation by interfering with zzso and or zzso zzso However, the precise role of zzso in human zzso cells is unknown and remains to be zzso
