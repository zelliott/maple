The zzso protein of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso acts by binding specifically to a 34 zzso zzso zzso where it carries out zzso A limited zzso digest of zzso resulted in two fragments of sizes 25 and zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso of the zzso 25 zzso zzso demonstrates that this zzso represents the zzso portion of the zzso zzso A truncated version of the zzso gene was constructed which produces only the 25 zzso zzso The 25 zzso zzso is capable of specific binding to the lox site, but binds at lower affinity than does zzso zzso zzso with zzso indicates that the 25 zzso zzso protects the zzso repeats of the lox site but shows only partial protection of the zzso zzso This is in contrast to the footprint obtained with zzso zzso which protects the entire zzso zzso
