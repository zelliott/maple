zzso of mouse zzso tumor virus zzso DNA is zzso by steroid zzso To determine the DNA sequences involved in this regulation, we constructed a zzso containing the zzso long terminal repeat zzso in front of the coding region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from which the promoter had been zzso zzso of the zzso were removed by the zzso zzso and the deleted molecules were zzso and tested for zzso activity in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell clones were selected and zzso zzso from the zzso promoter was studied by the zzso zzso mapping zzso The results show that DNA sequences between zzso and zzso base pairs upstream from the initiation site of viral zzso are required for zzso zzso
