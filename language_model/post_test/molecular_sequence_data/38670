We have cloned a zzso from zzso zzso zzso that contains an zzso frame of 132 zzso acids coding for a fatty acid binding protein zzso of approximately 15 zzso Multiple sequence alignment revealed extensive zzso acid identity between this zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from other zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso to single restriction fragments of total zzso zzso DNA zzso with the restriction zzso zzso zzso or zzso suggesting that a single copy of the zzso gene is present in the zzso zzso An zzso probe complementary to the zzso zzso zzso zzso to an zzso of approximately 800 bases in Northern zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso was expressed exclusively in the zzso of the adult zzso
