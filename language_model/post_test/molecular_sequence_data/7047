A critical overview is given on the application of zzso acid composition data for the establishment of the zzso identity zzso acids composition zzso protein identity, the zzso zzso Several criteria are used to measure the differences between the zzso acid compositions of various zzso The zzso method zzso identifies proteins which belong to the families with a high zzso zzso of their zzso The identification of pure proteins can be accomplished with a relatively high level of zzso The zzso method, however, sometimes needs the support of zzso or internal sequencing of proteins since, alone, it cannot distinguish whether the lack of finding a candidate protein in protein data bases is because the investigated zzso acid composition zzso to an unknown protein or its processed form or because it is a sum of at least two protein zzso or whether it is due to other experimental zzso The identification of a few new proteins such as zzso zzso zzso migration zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso factor present in the calf brain zzso is also zzso
