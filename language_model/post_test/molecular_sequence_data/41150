Two previously zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso bacteria, designated strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso were recovered from human wound specimens and characterized using zzso zzso and molecular zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis and zzso and zzso characteristics demonstrated that these organisms are zzso and zzso distinct and represent previously unidentified zzso within the order zzso in the zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis demonstrated that the novel organisms had zzso sequence similarity to each other and were most closely related to members of the zzso zzso The major zzso fatty acids of both strains were zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on the zzso and zzso findings, strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represent two novel species, for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are proposed, zzso
