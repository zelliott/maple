The response of zzso cells to zzso radiation zzso zzso DNA breaks is highly zzso and involves a DNA repair mechanism zzso by the early zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso the active form zzso Although the expression of an induced zzso zzso has been detected in zzso zzso the expression and radiation response of a zzso zzso has not been reported in economically important fruit zzso We use zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fruit fly or zzso to investigate this response with a view to developing molecular zzso to zzso exposure of fruit flies to zzso and zzso DNA zzso Deep sequencing confirmed the presence of a zzso zzso that we have termed zzso zzso zzso zzso and has an identical sequence to a zzso reported from the human disease zzso zzso zzso A linear zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in whole zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was detected at doses as low as 20 zzso zzso signal peaked at zzso after zzso exposure and at zzso zzso the signal remained elevated but declined significantly by 5 zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal could be detected and zzso either by western zzso or by laser scanning zzso up to 17 days zzso exposure in zzso extracts or isolated zzso from adult zzso zzso as zzso We conclude that zzso exposure in zzso leads to persistent zzso signals (over a period of zzso that can easily be detected by western zzso or quantitative zzso zzso These approaches have potential as the basis for zzso for detection and zzso of prior zzso exposure in zzso fruit zzso
