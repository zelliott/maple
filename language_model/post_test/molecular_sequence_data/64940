The zzso repertoire in nature is zzso by generating hybrid zzso from a limited set of gene zzso In zzso several unique complex lipids are produced by the combined action of fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso although it is not clear how the zzso zzso zzso zzso are transferred from one zzso complex to zzso Here we show that some of the 36 zzso zzso zzso located adjacent to the zzso genes in the zzso tuberculosis zzso constitute a new class of zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso These proteins activate zzso fatty acids as zzso which are then transferred to the zzso zzso for further chain zzso This mode of zzso and transfer of fatty acids is contrary to the previously described universal mechanism involving the formation of zzso A zzso Similar mechanisms may operate in the zzso of other zzso zzso and could have implications in engineering novel hybrid zzso
