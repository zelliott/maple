Small direct repeats, which are frequent in all zzso are a potential source of zzso zzso To study the occurrence and genetic control of zzso zzso we developed a system in the zzso zzso zzso that was based on small direct repeats separated by either random sequences or zzso zzso zzso were examined in the zzso zzso using a set of zzso to zzso zzso that included zzso with no apparent potential for secondary structure as well as two zzso All zzso were flanked by 6- to zzso direct repeats of zzso zzso providing an opportunity for zzso zzso via precise zzso zzso could arise by extended deletions involving either direct repeats or random sequences and by zzso zzso zzso zzso The deletion zzso were always associated with short zzso to zzso perfect or imperfect direct zzso Compared with the zzso strain, deletions between small direct repeats were increased as much as zzso and the spectrum was changed in a zzso DNA zzso delta zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso The type of deletion depended on orientation relative to the origin of zzso On the basis of these results, we propose zzso that extended deletions between small repeats arise by replication zzso and zzso that the deletions occur primarily in either the leading or lagging zzso The zzso and zzso zzso which are required for the zzso repair of many kinds of DNA zzso breaks, appeared to be required also for the production of up to zzso of the deletions arising between separated repeats in the zzso zzso suggesting a newly identified role for these genes in zzso stability and possibly zzso
