The zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso expresses reduced levels of zzso activity in a tissue specific zzso In order to pinpoint the molecular zzso that zzso the zzso zzso in zzso mice we have zzso the zzso chain reaction technique to isolate zzso zzso clones from control and zzso mouse zzso zzso analyses of these zzso clones have revealed a single zzso difference within the coding region of zzso between control and zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso is located in the third position of zzso acid 11 in the zzso zzso In control mouse strains zzso zzso is zzso at zzso acid 11, while in zzso mice this zzso zzso encodes zzso This zzso acid is located within a region that forms the first major zzso in the zzso arm of the zzso zzso and, as such, may render the zzso zzso unstable under certain zzso zzso
