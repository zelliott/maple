zzso contamination by the explosive zzso zzso is a global zzso Israel's coastal zzso was contaminated with zzso This zzso is mostly zzso and we therefore sought zzso bacteria that might be involved in natural zzso of the compound in the zzso zzso bacteria were captured by passively sampling the indigenous bacteria onto sterile sediments placed within sampling zzso zzso zzso zzso potential was detected in the sediments sampled from different locations along the zzso zzso degradation with the native sampled consortium was accompanied by zzso zzso Two bacterial strains of the zzso zzso were isolated from the sediments and identified as zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso was partially zzso zzso from both zzso The obtained DNA sequences had zzso identity with corresponding gene fragments of previously isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation by both strains was prevented by zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that zzso zzso indeed mediates the initial step in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by the zzso isolate was inhibited in the presence of nitrate or ammonium zzso above zzso and zzso respectively zzso while the zzso zzso activity was retarded only by ammonium zzso above zzso This study shows that bacteria from the zzso zzso potentially degrade zzso in the saturated zone as well, following the same zzso degradation zzso defined for other zzso zzso zzso activity by the zzso species isolate zzso may have important implications for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
