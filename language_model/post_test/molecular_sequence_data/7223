zzso of earlier investigations have indicated that the zzso phase of zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso activity which has been suggested to be specific for this zzso zzso In the present study we have determined the zzso and partial internal zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso zzso cloned the gene which encodes this zzso and confirmed that the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso sequences are reported and reveal that the zzso gene which encodes this zzso has no zzso A zzso open reading frame encodes a zzso protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso The zzso gene was localized on zzso I of three representative zzso zzso clinical zzso on the basis of Southern zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso coli using the zzso zzso zzso yielded a zzso protein that was recognized in zzso zzso by zzso raised to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the native zzso is suggested to occur by zzso of a putative zzso signal zzso The native zzso showed a low degree of zzso Analysis of the zzso composition of the zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the zzso zzso showed no affinity for zzso zzso A zzso method with specificity and high sensitivity for detection of zzso zzso zzso DNA, using a pair of synthetic zzso zzso whose sequences were based on that of the zzso zzso was zzso A zzso product was amplified only when zzso zzso zzso DNA was used as the zzso The lower limits of DNA detection using this zzso method were 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA by zzso zzso zzso and 100 zzso after Southern zzso The zzso zzso zzso method for detection of zzso zzso DNA is useful for culture identification and may have clinical applications for the diagnosis of zzso zzso
