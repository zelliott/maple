Because of their simple organization the zzso have been considered to be either primitive zzso or descendants of zzso through secondary loss of derived zzso zzso data of zzso zzso DNA genes from zzso evolving species of zzso and other zzso reveal that this group does not belong to the zzso but represents the extant members of the earliest divergent zzso an interpretation that is supported by recent studies on the embryonic zzso pattern and nervous system of zzso This study has implications for understanding the evolution of major body plans, and for perceptions of the zzso evolutionary zzso
