In 2010, yam beans in a field trial in Peru showed viral disease zzso zzso and positive zzso results using zzso zzso suggested that the symptoms could be the result of a zzso zzso Small interfering zzso zzso were extracted from one of the samples and sent for zzso zzso The full zzso of a new zzso could be assembled from the resulting zzso zzso and it was sufficiently different from other sequences to be considered a member of a new species, which we have designated zzso bean mosaic virus zzso zzso similarity suggests that zzso has also been detected in yam beans in zzso
