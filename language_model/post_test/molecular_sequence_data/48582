The zzso domain, which mediates zzso zzso was first discovered as a motif in the large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Later, the domain was also found in zzso zzso zzso where it interacts with many zzso zzso In both zzso the zzso domain is a target of zzso zzso of diverse zzso zzso It was found to be an essential component of several specific zzso pathways in zzso and zzso Not much is known about zzso domain proteins in zzso This study aims to characterize all the zzso domain proteins zzso by the zzso of zzso and zzso All identified zzso domain proteins are zzso together with their zzso locations, zzso analysis, expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso were found not only in zzso and zzso plant zzso but also in zzso proteins in rice and DNA zzso in zzso suggesting roles of zzso zzso in zzso zzso degradation and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed overlapping expression of zzso zzso and zzso in different stages of rice seeds zzso Moreover, an association analysis of 136 in zzso zzso zzso zzso in 23 different rice zzso with zzso information identified three zzso zzso zzso in these three rice genes showing strong association with long- and zzso zzso Interestingly, these zzso were located within zzso domain zzso zzso Overall, this study lays a foundation for functional analysis of zzso domain proteins in zzso
