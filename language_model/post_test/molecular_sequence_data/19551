Through zzso gene expression analysis of lung zzso we detected in the great majority of lung cancer samples zzso of cell division cycle associated 8 zzso and aurora zzso B zzso which were considered to be components of the zzso zzso passenger zzso zzso analysis of lung cancer tissue zzso showed that zzso of zzso and zzso was significantly associated with poor prognosis of lung cancer zzso zzso directly zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso and seemed to stabilize zzso protein in cancer zzso zzso of zzso expression with small interfering zzso against zzso significantly suppressed the growth of lung cancer zzso In addition, functional zzso of interaction between zzso and zzso by a zzso zzso corresponding to zzso acid sequence of a part of zzso zzso which included two zzso sites by zzso significantly reduced zzso of zzso and resulted in growth suppression of lung cancer zzso Our data imply that selective suppression of the zzso zzso could be a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of lung cancer zzso
