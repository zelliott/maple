zzso of zzso is a key process in the regulation of zzso gene expression in animal zzso To investigate zzso termination in sea zzso zzso we cloned the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and used a zzso form of the zzso in a zzso zzso system, in the presence of the zzso protein zzso Cloning of zzso was performed by a combination of zzso with zzso zzso and library zzso The zzso contains 10 zzso zzso zzso two zzso motifs and a zzso zzso The protein expressed in insect cells supports zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso caused arrest of the zzso zzso when the zzso approached the zzso site in the direction of zzso of zzso zzso When the zzso encountered the zzso site in the opposite direction, termination occurred in a zzso manner, inside the zzso zzso zzso experiments show that zzso caused true zzso termination rather than zzso These data indicate that zzso acts as polar termination factor and suggest that zzso termination in sea zzso zzso could take place by two alternative modes based on zzso or zzso zzso
