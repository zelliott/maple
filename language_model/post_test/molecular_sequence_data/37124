zzso plays various roles in the biology of diverse zzso The past decade has produced new information on the molecular structure of several zzso zzso in various zzso zzso of DNA zzso has revealed that the presence of zzso zzso is not confined to the zzso kidney but is also evident in zzso and brain, raising new questions about the possible zzso role of zzso in these zzso Cloning of the genes zzso the two closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has helped in identifying molecular mechanisms affecting expression of zzso zzso in the zzso such as zzso control for zzso zzso On the basis of analysis of zzso sequences of individuals lacking the zzso zzso zzso have been found that explain deficits in their capacity to concentrate zzso More zzso zzso are being characterized in marine organisms and lower zzso and studying the role and regulation of zzso transport from an evolutionary perspective can certainly enrich our understanding of zzso zzso
