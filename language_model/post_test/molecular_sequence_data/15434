The zzso zzso zzso gene product shows about zzso sequence identity to zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso considered to catalyze a key step in the zzso of cardiac zzso zzso zzso does not accumulate zzso but protein extracts prepared from its leaves were capable of reducing zzso to zzso A full-length zzso clone zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso family, was isolated from zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene zzso was cloned into the zzso zzso system and transformed into zzso zzso The gene was functionally expressed and the zzso zzso fusion protein was zzso zzso values and specific activities for putative zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and for the zzso zzso were zzso zzso was zzso reduced to zzso and none of the zzso tested were accepted as a zzso The gene zzso zzso was strongly transcribed in stems and zzso A three-dimensional model of zzso highlights a close structural similarity to the zzso previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso extends to the active site where single zzso acid zzso might be responsible for the increased zzso efficiency of zzso when compared to the activity of the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso
