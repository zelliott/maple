zzso targeting to the zzso zzso in zzso cells is zzso by signal recognition particle zzso zzso experiments have shown that the zzso of relative molecular mass zzso (Mr zzso zzso interacts directly with signal sequences as they emerge from the zzso Here we present the sequence of a complementary DNA clone of zzso which predicts a protein that contains a putative zzso domain and an unusually zzso zzso The properties of this latter domain suggest that it contains the signal sequence binding zzso A previously zzso zzso coli protein has strong zzso to both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are also found in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso membrane and in a second zzso coli zzso zzso which resembles zzso zzso Recent work has shown that zzso alpha is a zzso protein and that zzso is required for the release of zzso from the signal sequence and the zzso on targeting to the zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso alpha use zzso in sequential steps of the targeting reaction and that essential features of such a zzso are zzso from bacteria to zzso
