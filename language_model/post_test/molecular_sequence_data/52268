Ras zzso protein zzso contains two zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso which are implicated in binding to zzso sites in specific activated growth factor receptors and to a zzso zzso zzso zzso We have used zzso zzso of the two GAP zzso zzso zzso and zzso to identify zzso involved in zzso and zzso zzso A bacterial fusion protein containing the precise zzso domain, as defined by sequence zzso associated with both the activated beta zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso and zzso in zzso However, short deletions at either the N or C zzso of the zzso domain abolished zzso suggesting that the entire zzso sequence is required for formation of an active zzso Conservative zzso of 2 highly zzso basic zzso in the zzso domain, an zzso and a zzso resulted in complete loss of zzso and zzso zzso whereas other basic zzso and zzso at variable zzso sites, were more tolerant of zzso The zzso zzso and zzso therefore appear critical for association with zzso zzso possibly through an interaction with zzso The GAP zzso domain, unlike zzso does not bind efficiently to activated receptors or zzso in zzso The zzso domain lacks 3 zzso which are otherwise well zzso and contribute to high affinity zzso zzso Replacement of 1 of these zzso a zzso with the consensus zzso zzso zzso binding activity toward zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the GAP zzso zzso can therefore be used to identify zzso that are critical for zzso and zzso zzso
