zzso from a patient with systemic lupus zzso which recognize zzso and U2 small nuclear zzso particles zzso were used to map zzso zzso on the zzso zzso A zzso This protein contains two regions that are highly similar to regions in the U2 zzso zzso zzso A site termed zzso 2 maps in one such region and was found to react with zzso zzso between A and zzso A second site, zzso 1, is situated in a zzso region that shows no zzso with zzso This zzso can bind three different zzso with distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso from different patients react with either zzso the A protein zzso zzso proteins A, zzso a synthetic zzso for part of the N zzso and an unidentified protein with a molecular mass of 50 zzso or zzso proteins A, zzso C, and the zzso zzso zzso of the primary structures of proteins zzso zzso and C reveals multiple zzso zzso sequences in all of zzso The possibility that these repeating regions act as zzso in patients with zzso disease is zzso
