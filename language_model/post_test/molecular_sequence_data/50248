zzso and satellite III sequences are arranged as large tandem zzso in the zzso regions of human zzso Several recent studies using in zzso zzso to investigate the relative positions of these sequences have shown that they occupy adjacent but zzso zzso in zzso zzso We have zzso the DNA sequence at the junction between zzso and satellite III sequences in a zzso previously mapped to zzso zzso The zzso sequence consists of zzso arranged zzso which are distinct from the known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction experiments confirm the integrity of the sequence zzso These results, together with zzso field gel zzso data place the boundary between zzso and satellite III sequences in the mapping zzso 10 zzso The sequence data shows that these repetitive sequences are separated by a partial zzso zzso repeat sequence less than zzso in zzso The arrangement of the junction suggests that a zzso event has brought these sequences into close zzso
