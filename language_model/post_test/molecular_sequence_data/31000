zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso hormone zzso receptors were characterized by using zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso At 4 C equilibrium binding of zzso to zzso zzso was achieved after 90 zzso of zzso binding of zzso to zzso membrane zzso reached its maximum at 60 zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso was a function of tissue zzso with a positive correlation over the range zzso tissue zzso per zzso One zzso and one zzso per tube were used as standard experimental zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with increasing zzso of zzso indicated zzso binding at zzso zzso of 1 zzso and above while for the zzso membrane preparation zzso was achieved using 5 zzso zzso The binding of zzso was found to be zzso after addition of the cold analog and the displacement zzso could be resolved into one linear component for both zzso zzso analysis suggested the presence of one class of binding sites for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displaced the labeled zzso with a lower zzso as compared with zzso cold standard, while zzso zzso was completely zzso confirming the specificity of zzso
