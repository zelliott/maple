zzso zzso zzso were used to amplify, zzso and analyze sequence zzso and zzso distribution of 23 zzso fragments corresponding to the reverse zzso domain of zzso zzso in zzso Of the 23 fragments 22 could be aligned by their deduced zzso acid sequences and were divided into 6 groups according to the zzso and Southern zzso zzso zzso acid sequence differences among the 22 aligned fragments ranged from 1 to zzso Southern zzso analysis of 10 rice zzso including zzso zzso and common wild rice, using these 23 fragments as zzso showed that zzso zzso were present in moderate to high copy numbers in all the rice zzso although the exact copy number cannot be zzso The major difference revealed by southern analysis is a differentiation between the four zzso varieties as one group and the four zzso varieties and the two wild rice zzso as another zzso zzso were also detected among the zzso and zzso varieties by major bands and zzso minor zzso Five zzso bands were mapped to zzso 3, 4, 8, and 9, zzso All the five bands were inherited in a dominant zzso fashion and were not zzso with each other, indicating that the same element did not reside on the same location in different rice zzso No transcript of the zzso reverse zzso was detected on northern zzso The results suggest that the sequence zzso and zzso zzso of zzso may be one of zzso factors causing genetic diversity in zzso
