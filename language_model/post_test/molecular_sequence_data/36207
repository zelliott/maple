zzso zzso zzso originally zzso as components of zzso have also been implicated in zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso The zzso is particularly noteworthy in zzso larvae, where it generates large zzso potential differences and zzso currents across the zzso zzso A zzso library from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was screened with a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and a zzso zzso zzso in its zzso The sequence contains a long open reading frame, zzso a putative zzso of 156 zzso acids zzso and with an zzso of zzso in close agreement with values previously suggested by sodium zzso zzso gels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso sequence with those of other species, particularly zzso zzso was extremely zzso Northern blots of zzso zzso zzso zzso at high stringency revealed two transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso Southern blots suggest that there is only a single copy of the gene in zzso zzso The possibility that members of the zzso gene family might serve multiple roles in transport and membrane communication is zzso
