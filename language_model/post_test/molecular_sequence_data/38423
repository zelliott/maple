To examine the distribution of the zzso zzso zzso zzso among marine bacteria, we developed a simple screening method for the detection of this zzso By reference to the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso a pair of zzso was designed for amplification of a part of the sixth zzso zzso of the zzso zzso When zzso was performed using zzso DNA from 13 marine bacteria, a zzso zzso corresponding to zzso was amplified in 10 zzso Although there were three zzso strains zzso based on the sequence of the zzso zzso these were placed far from the zzso zzso No product was observed in the case of zzso zzso The zzso and predicted zzso acid sequences of zzso were highly zzso among the zzso marine zzso A zzso analysis of marine bacteria, based on zzso sequencing, was zzso
