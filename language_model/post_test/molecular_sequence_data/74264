During zzso zzso class II molecules associate with the zzso zzso As the result, the zzso groove is occupied by an zzso chain zzso termed zzso zzso zzso chain zzso sequence zzso By mass zzso we have now characterized peptides that are naturally present in zzso This analysis revealed that 22 zzso of zzso peptides are associated with zzso zzso the large majority of those do not contain the conventional zzso sequence zzso but instead a zzso that partially zzso with zzso sequence zzso zzso binding studies indicate that this alternative zzso zzso has superior zzso binding properties compared to the conventional zzso and that the minimal zzso binding core consists of the sequence zzso findings that could be zzso by molecular zzso The alternative zzso zzso was also found to be present in zzso molecules isolated from human zzso Moreover, the alternative zzso zzso was also found in association with zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso and zzso associate with an alternative zzso zzso a property that may relate to the strong association between zzso molecules and human zzso zzso
