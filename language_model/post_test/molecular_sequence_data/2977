zzso proteins are a family of zzso factors that regulate the expression of a myriad of genes in a variety of zzso and cell zzso This functional versatility emerges from their interactions with other structurally unrelated zzso zzso Indeed, zzso control is a characteristic property of zzso family members, involving interactions between zzso and other key zzso factors such as zzso zzso and zzso family zzso zzso recent molecular modeling and zzso data suggest that not only the zzso zzso domain, but also the DNA recognition zzso zzso are often directly required for zzso partner's zzso Indeed, while most zzso proteins appear to exploit differences within their DNA recognition zzso for sites selection, the zzso proteins exploit differences in their surfaces that interact with other zzso factors, which in turn may modify their zzso properties in a zzso zzso Taken together, the zzso architecture of these unique complexes can mediate the selective control of zzso zzso
