Ten strains of zzso zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from the burial mound soil collected before the dismantling and samples collected during the dismantling work on the zzso zzso in zzso village, zzso zzso Japan in zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso gene sequence analysis of the zzso they were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and can be separated into four groups within the cluster containing the zzso zzso One of the groups demonstrated a zzso position identical to that of zzso zzso which was isolated from small holes on plaster walls of the stone chamber interior of zzso zzso in zzso village, zzso zzso zzso The remaining three groups consisted of novel lineages within the zzso zzso A total of four zzso were selected from each group and carefully identified using a zzso zzso The zzso were characterized on the basis of their possessing zzso as the major zzso system and zzso zzso as the zzso fatty zzso A zzso zzso test was used to determine that the three lineages represented novel species, for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The type strains are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
