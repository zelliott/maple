Human zzso Y zzso and the zzso zzso zzso have been characterized by CD zzso zzso zzso in zzso solution with a zzso constant in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso with an increase in zzso content which was studied as a function of zzso temperature and zzso The effects of temperature were measured in water zzso degrees zzso and in zzso (2 : 1) zzso degrees to zzso degrees zzso A zzso zzso zzso affects the zzso zzso and zzso properties of zzso The CD results are correlated with zzso induced dynamic nuclear polarization zzso experiments which show that the zzso at the interface between two zzso units present limited accessibility to a zzso zzso An equilibrium state is zzso involving a zzso zzso form and a handshake zzso form, that zzso the zzso properties of zzso
