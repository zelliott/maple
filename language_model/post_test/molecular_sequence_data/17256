zzso signaling plays an important role in embryonic development and zzso These biological effects are exerted by zzso of the zzso zzso complex and zzso regulation of a set of downstream zzso zzso elements have been found in the promoter regions of many zzso target genes and characterized by a highly zzso consensus zzso zzso this consensus zzso we performed an in zzso screening for new zzso target zzso Through zzso screening and subsequent experimental analysis, we identified a novel zzso target zzso zzso which has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso Our finding suggests the existence of a novel feedback loop in zzso zzso
