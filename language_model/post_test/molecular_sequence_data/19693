zzso virus zzso gene zzso encodes a protein with sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso short and long members of the zzso family inhibited zzso development, whereas in zzso only short zzso caused arrest of zzso zzso zzso 176 protein zzso is most closely related to short zzso however, when expressed zzso in zzso cells, zzso did not inhibit cell zzso zzso is a predominantly zzso 57 zzso protein that is expressed throughout zzso Several other zzso zzso zzso zzso but the zzso gene is fragmented in all zzso zzso virus and zzso virus zzso zzso zzso with this, all 16 zzso strains tested do not express a zzso detected by zzso serum raised against the zzso zzso In the absence of a small animal model to study zzso zzso the contribution of zzso zzso to zzso zzso was studied via its expression in an attenuated strain of zzso zzso viruses expressing zzso zzso or zzso zzso at its C zzso with a zzso zzso zzso were less virulent than control zzso However, a virus expressing zzso zzso with the zzso zzso at its N zzso had similar zzso to controls, zzso that the N zzso has an important zzso A greater recruitment of zzso into infected lung tissue was observed in the presence of zzso zzso but, interestingly, these cells were less zzso Thus, zzso is an zzso zzso factor that affects the host immune response to zzso
