The sequence of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing genes for a small and a large zzso zzso and six additional zzso was zzso Until now only 11 of the 14 zzso of the zzso of zzso coli were found in zzso By sequence zzso we suggest that the missing zzso of the peripheral part of the zzso containing most of the zzso are zzso by three zzso of this zzso This hypothesis is discussed in relation to the zzso zzso of zzso
