Fifteen zzso having high affinity for the zzso zzso zzso were identified from a zzso library containing more than 52 million different zzso The five compounds with the highest affinity were characterized further by use of a variety of in zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that these five peptides have affinity for zzso in the zzso range, similar to the recently discovered zzso zzso called zzso and zzso zzso zzso The activity of these compounds was investigated in three different zzso stimulation of zzso binding and zzso of zzso zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso of zzso induced zzso in the mouse zzso zzso In each zzso the five zzso acted as partial zzso The zzso values for stimulation of zzso binding and zzso of zzso zzso were in the range of that for zzso but zzso effects ranged from 70 to zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso and 30 to zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso The positive zzso identified were found to have minimal structural similarity to zzso The peptides are positively charged, which could enable them to bind to the zzso charged second zzso loop thought to be a likely binding site for zzso
