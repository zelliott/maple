The zzso related genes zzso zzso zzso zzso factors that play key roles in body patterning and zzso in a wide array of zzso zzso It is thought that the zzso of the last common zzso of zzso contained a unique zzso gene linked to a unique ancestral zzso zzso During subsequent evolution, two rounds of whole zzso zzso followed by individual gene losses gave rise to three zzso zzso zzso and zzso Then, zzso was maintained in zzso lineage but not in zzso To explain this zzso we examined the expression patterns of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and that of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We show here that zzso is expressed in a manner that closely reflects the zzso expression pattern of the zzso gene in the last common zzso of zzso zzso in zzso the central nervous system, the zzso gut, and the tip of the growing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are expressed in zzso cell lineages of the central nervous system and of the zzso gut, but zzso was zzso in the zzso and the tail zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso gene of zzso to be expressed in these two latter zzso Thus, the ancestral expression pattern of zzso in zzso appears to have been distributed between zzso and zzso in zzso We propose that zzso and zzso underwent a complementary loss of expression domain in zzso that allowed the maintenance of the two zzso in accordance with the zzso zzso It is important to note that, in zzso zzso and zzso have lost most of the protein domain upstream of the zzso In addition, zzso has accumulated zzso in positions that are highly zzso in all other zzso zzso Thus, the reduction of the expression domain of both zzso and zzso in zzso appears to be associated with the modification of constraints on the protein zzso allowing the zzso of both genes and an accelerated substitution rate in zzso
