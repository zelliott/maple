zzso zzso zzso zzso are a zzso distinct T cell population of unknown zzso The majority of human zzso zzso express the zzso zzso the zzso accessory zzso and the zzso zzso suggesting that they are zzso class zzso memory T zzso Recent analyses of the zzso zzso and zzso expressed by these cells have shown marked skewing toward one or several V region genes in individual donors and revealed the presence of zzso expanded zzso In addition, functional data has suggested that the zzso class zzso zzso molecules may be the target zzso for some human zzso zzso zzso This report examines in detail the zzso repertoire of human zzso zzso to determine what fraction of these cells are zzso expanded and to determine whether a particular subset of V beta genes are zzso by the zzso expanded zzso The results demonstrate that the majority of zzso are derived from the expansion of a relatively few T cell clones and that these clones can zzso a large number of different V beta zzso zzso expansion is also demonstrated among zzso zzso zzso zzso with overlapping but distinct clones detected in the zzso vs the zzso zzso These results indicate that most zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso are specific for a limited number of zzso and place constraints on the possible roles played by zzso in the defense against diverse environmental pathogens or in the generation of oral zzso
