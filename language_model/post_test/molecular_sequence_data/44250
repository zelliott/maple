zzso zzso complexes derived from distinct regions of the zzso and individual zzso proteins of the 30 S zzso zzso from zzso coli were isolated and zzso zzso sites at the zzso acid and zzso level were determined by zzso zzso acid sequence analysis in combination with zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso zzso analysis performed subsequent to a partial alkaline zzso of zzso zzso complexes allowed for the first time the zzso zzso zzso to be zzso by this zzso In this manner zzso in zzso was determined to be zzso to the zzso at positions zzso on the 16 S zzso zzso either zzso or zzso is the actual zzso zzso zzso in zzso to positions zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso to zzso zzso zzso The novel approach applied here promises to be useful for similar studies on other known zzso zzso
