We determined almost complete zzso zzso DNA sequences of 50 reference strains belonging to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and compared these sequences with previously published zzso Three zzso methods (the zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as a zzso analysis, were used to assess the zzso of each zzso which we zzso The results of comparative zzso analyses confirmed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso zzso within the zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso appeared to be a zzso unit whose members could be divided into four major zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso is doubtful since members of this zzso clearly belong to the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso characteristics within the zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis is probably the most straightforward method for confirming that a zzso belongs to this zzso
