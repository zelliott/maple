The zzso zzso zzso expressed by activated human T cells is zzso zzso and zzso limited zzso zzso zzso at the cell surface releasing a zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso of activated T cells through the zzso rapidly increased the rate of zzso shedding zzso zzso more than zzso cells, demonstrating that shedding is a specific, zzso zzso The protein zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso zzso and blocked zzso shedding of zzso suggesting that zzso may be important for zzso of the zzso zzso However, a deletion zzso of the entire zzso domain of human zzso was shed when expressed in zzso zzso cells, albeit relatively poorly compared with full length zzso This demonstrates that the zzso domain is important but not essential for zzso of the zzso domain of zzso Moreover, a requirement for zzso of proteins other than the zzso was revealed by the finding that zzso completely blocked zzso of the zzso deletion zzso zzso these results demonstrate that protein zzso is essential and the zzso domain is important for regulating the zzso production of soluble zzso proteins by activated zzso T zzso
