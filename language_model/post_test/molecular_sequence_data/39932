zzso zzso was initially described as a zzso species containing a single strain CBS zzso isolated from decayed algae in zzso zzso zzso Later, a second strain of this species was isolated from an zzso patient affected by zzso in Germany and recently several strains from this species have been found in human patients and pigeon droppings of the same zzso In this study, we isolated from sheep droppings in Spain a zzso strain named zzso that was zzso related to the strain CBS zzso and showed a zzso similarity in the zzso domain and zzso region sequences with respect to the remaining described strains of zzso zzso These findings suggest that this species has a wide geographical distribution and that the animal zzso are a common habitat for zzso zzso The zzso analyses showed the absence of zzso amounts of zzso in the cell walls of the strains zzso and zzso in contrast to other zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso study showed the presence of zzso in these two strains that could be involved in the attachment to the host cells and, as occurs in zzso zzso they could also be a zzso factor for the zzso
