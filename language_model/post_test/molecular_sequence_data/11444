The zzso zzso surface zzso of zzso zzso has potential as a diagnostic zzso and as a component of a zzso zzso This zzso is known to be zzso diverse, and it is important to determine the nature and extent of this zzso In the present study zzso zzso representing zzso of the gene zzso zzso this zzso in zzso zzso were compared to each other and to sequences of zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This analysis revealed that a region of the zzso which contains putative zzso zzso sites is particularly diverse and, in zzso to zzso systems, may indicate selection of variable zzso sites or zzso acid zzso to evade the bovine immune zzso This conclusion was also made from the results of a zzso analysis which compared the variable region of the genes with a second region, which appeared to show no bias for diversity or functional zzso The results indicated that the variable sequence zzso putative zzso sites has diverged, both within and between zzso species, at a much faster rate than the rest of the zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso populations from within a single geographical region detected six possible zzso zzso zzso However, a correlation between zzso zzso zzso patterns detected by the zzso gene probe and geographical location could not be zzso In addition, although a high prevalence of one particular zzso was found, this is unlikely to be the result of a zzso population structure, as we present evidence for significant zzso zzso zzso within a single endemic zzso
