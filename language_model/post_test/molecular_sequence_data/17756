In order to zzso the function of the zzso zzso gene derivatives of zzso zzso with insertions of synthetic zzso were zzso The latter are equal or multiple of 9 zzso in length and are located in the zzso site within each of the two zzso copies of the zzso zzso The insertions of the nine base zzso code for the neutral zzso acids and do not shift the reading zzso One of the zzso zzso obtained - zzso was studied on the ability to form simple insertions and zzso zzso For this purpose the zzso derivatives carrying the wild type and zzso zzso were mobilized by zzso zzso zzso It was found that the damage of the zzso gene does not influence the ability of zzso to form simple insertions and zzso zzso in both zzso - and zzso cells of zzso zzso However, the frequency of the zzso formation in the subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso to zzso was by zzso times lower in comparison to the wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formed by interaction zzso and zzso were zzso It was shown that in the zzso coli zzso such zzso zzso as a rule, zzso zzso they segregate mainly plasmids of types zzso and zzso The data obtained zzso with the notion that the gene zzso product is not essential for zzso but is, zzso involved in the formation of the zzso zzso
