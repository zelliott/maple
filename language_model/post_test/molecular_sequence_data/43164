Identification of genes expressed zzso or exclusively in zzso will facilitate the understanding of zzso biology as well as provide candidate genes for inherited retinal zzso To achieve this goal we performed a differential zzso screen of zzso zzso zzso clones from a human retinal zzso zzso zzso were selected for further study if they zzso exclusively or strongly zzso to a probe derived from zzso isolated from the zzso zzso of zzso ground squirrels as compared to a probe derived from human zzso zzso Twenty percent of clones zzso identified by this screen were derived from zzso genes and an additional zzso zzso were from zzso zzso demonstrating the utility of this strategy in identifying genes important for retinal zzso
