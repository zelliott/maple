Thirty-five zzso collections from the zzso Islands and zzso zzso were examined zzso and subjected to molecular zzso zzso These zzso almost all collected on endemic and/or zzso zzso were similar in zzso and ecological characteristics to zzso zzso from the Sonoran Desert zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso new ITS zzso sequences from these zzso including the zzso type of the zzso species, were obtained and aligned with zzso sequences from zzso These collections were distributed in two strongly supported zzso zzso However, similar patterns of zzso zzso shared by specimens included in both zzso and their differences with related species suggest that they should be described as a single new zzso Therefore zzso zzso is zzso Studies will be required to test, in a more robust zzso zzso zzso whether these populations constitute two cryptic species or whether they are the same zzso The position of zzso zzso in the resolved tree and its zzso characters suggest that it should be included in zzso and the new combination zzso zzso is zzso
