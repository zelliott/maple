zzso zzso results have shown that the Z and M bands of the zzso are interconnected by the long zzso zzso Here we have characterized by zzso zzso zzso cloning and zzso zzso the two zzso proteins zzso and 165 zzso zzso which seem responsible for the formation of a head structure on one end of the zzso zzso long zzso zzso The human 165 zzso zzso zzso and 190 zzso zzso zzso proteins have unique zzso zzso some 110 zzso in zzso Both proteins show 12 repeat zzso with strong zzso to either zzso type III zzso I) or zzso C2 zzso zzso zzso which are arranged in the order zzso Over these repeat zzso the two proteins share 50% sequence identity zzso zzso zzso situated in the zzso 138 or in the preceding 206 zzso of the 165 zzso protein locate in zzso zzso to stripes situated 18 or 15 zzso from the center of the M zzso An zzso situated 277 to 129 zzso prior to the zzso of the 190 zzso protein zzso repeats 10 and zzso locates to the center of the M zzso Thus the head structure of the zzso zzso extends into the center of the M zzso zzso data on peptides from the zzso bovine 165 zzso protein and from conventionally zzso bovine zzso argue together with the zzso of the zzso that 165 zzso protein and zzso are zzso The zzso structure of the zzso which is based on zzso and its zzso zzso and 86 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso protein and 165 zzso zzso associated proteins arises from zzso members of the zzso of zzso zzso
