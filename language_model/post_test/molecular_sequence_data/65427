zzso zzso 6 zzso is an essential zzso zzso zzso among zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso called zzso depends on association with zzso domain zzso This study used a human zzso domain zzso zzso to identify zzso interacting zzso Mass zzso identified zzso proteins as zzso zzso zzso and three zzso repeat proteins zzso zzso and zzso These proteins have extensive sequence identity to one another but segregate into separate branches on a zzso tree for zzso species, suggesting individual biological zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso not with zzso or zzso and with zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso and zzso The zzso region of zzso was sufficient to zzso zzso but not zzso demonstrating that zzso acts as a scaffold with separate regions for binding to zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso were resolved by zzso zzso and zzso together with zzso at Mr zzso 440 zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso but not zzso produced equivalent enhancement of zzso degradation in response to zzso The results suggest that zzso functions as a zzso composed of the zzso zzso zzso bound to a zzso domain scaffold zzso that associates with zzso We propose that the zzso and zzso repeat regulatory zzso determine the function and specificity of zzso
