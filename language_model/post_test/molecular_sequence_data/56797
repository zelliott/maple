Evidence that rat liver zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in liver zzso has been zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso by zzso renders this zzso even more resistant to zzso zzso in the presence of zzso compared with zzso zzso Upon examining the effect of seven zzso zzso on zzso zzso it was found that only those that serve as good zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can inhibit zzso zzso The lack of zzso by the other five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso shows the specificity of the protection and rules out any zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso at 50 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso + zzso zzso zzso do not inhibit the zzso protection of rat liver zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The resulting zzso contained functional zzso and did display zzso zzso zzso induced by 75 zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso This model system was used to investigate whether zzso zzso zzso could inhibit zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The results show that 5 zzso zzso did inhibit zzso zzso when functional zzso zzso zzso was zzso This was not the case when the zzso had been zzso with zzso Furthermore, the protective effect of zzso could be partly reversed by an inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Apparently, rat liver zzso zzso zzso has the capacity to inhibit zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
