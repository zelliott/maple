We and others have recently uncovered the existence of human zzso zzso virus type 3 zzso the third member of the zzso zzso We have now zzso the full-length zzso zzso As expected, zzso contains open reading frames corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso tax, and zzso zzso Interestingly, its long terminal repeat zzso includes only two zzso zzso as is the case for type 3 zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso zzso analyses reveal that zzso is closely related to central African zzso zzso the zzso zzso region of zzso lacks zzso zzso compared to its zzso zzso Because of this zzso the previously described zzso sequence is zzso At the zzso acid level, zzso displays strong similarities with zzso Tax, including the sequence of a zzso class I binding zzso In zzso zzso zzso activates the transcriptions from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that two functional zzso zzso and zzso important for zzso through the zzso or zzso zzso are similar but not identical in zzso and zzso We also show that zzso zzso the human zzso and zzso promoters through the induction of the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso tumor zzso protein as well as the zzso zzso Altogether, these results demonstrate that although zzso and zzso have only zzso identity, zzso is functionally closely related to the transforming protein zzso and suggest that zzso like zzso might be zzso in zzso
