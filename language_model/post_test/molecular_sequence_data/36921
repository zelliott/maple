The published DNA sequence that includes the gene for the envelope zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus also contains a segment that shows zzso zzso acid identity to zzso a zzso zzso from the zzso plant zzso zzso The viral zzso sequence is apparently affected by a zzso zzso but otherwise appears capable of zzso a functional zzso zzso essential zzso acids appear to be zzso as do zzso zzso The overall structure of the putative protein is similar to that of zzso as judged by zzso zzso Secondary structure prediction using a consensus of seven methods indicates that the putative viral zzso retains the zzso domain structure of zzso including the long zzso beginning with zzso zzso zzso cells with the virus did not lead to a detected increase in zzso zzso activity, and a zzso zzso zzso appeared to have no effect on zzso zzso of whether the sequence encodes a functionally active zzso zzso this is the first example of a zzso sequence in a viral zzso
