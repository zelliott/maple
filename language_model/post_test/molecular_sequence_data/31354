The mouse zzso zzso zzso which recognizes the terminal zzso beta zzso of zzso and zzso was used for the detection of zzso zzso The method involves separation of zzso on thin layer zzso plates, followed by zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment and final zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and the zzso zzso producing the specific zzso zzso are commercially available and therefore accessible to all researchers working in this zzso zzso from mouse T zzso and the mouse T cell zzso zzso have been used as zzso This technique may be used for fast screening of zzso with the zzso core structure which have been described as T cell zzso zzso in human zzso disease and receptors for certain zzso zzso
