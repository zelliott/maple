Studies on members of protein families with similar structures but divergent sequences provide insights into the effects of sequence composition on the mechanism of zzso Members of the peripheral zzso domain zzso family fold zzso and approach the smallest size for zzso folding zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and zzso reveals folding via zzso through structurally very similar, polarized transition zzso Here, we present a zzso analysis of the family member zzso and found that it also folds by a zzso zzso The mean zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso were near zzso indicating similar zzso of zzso interactions being formed in the transition zzso Despite the overall conservation of folding mechanism in this protein family, however, the pattern of zzso values determined for zzso revealed a larger zzso of the folding nucleus across the entire structure, and the transition state was less zzso The observed plasticity of zzso structure can be rationalized by the different zzso zzso of zzso zzso The very strong zzso propensity in the first zzso of zzso relative to zzso and zzso appears to recruit more structure formation in that zzso in the transition state at the expense of weaker interactions in the second zzso zzso in sequence composition can zzso zzso structure of even the smallest natural protein zzso
