zzso molecules harboring single zzso acid changes in the zzso zzso region of the zzso show altered trafficking in zzso chain zzso cell zzso Since zzso zzso and zzso form hydrogen bonds with the backbone of bound zzso zzso in this region may result in distinct zzso class II zzso that are targeted zzso We examined the assembly and zzso binding properties of the zzso zzso molecules generated by in zzso zzso Indeed, loss of a single hydrogen bond at zzso or of two hydrogen bonds at zzso is sufficient to render zzso incapable of stable interaction with zzso and other zzso zzso despite normal assembly with intact zzso zzso These results suggest that stable interaction of zzso class II molecules with zzso requires the integrity of the zzso network between zzso in the zzso class II zzso and bound zzso and that zzso features revealed by stable zzso binding are critical for zzso class II zzso zzso
