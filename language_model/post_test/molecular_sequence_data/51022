To decipher the early events preceding the re-entry of zzso cells into the cell cycle, we constructed a zzso library from zzso zzso of zzso zzso We characterized three zzso via their zzso that accumulate at very high levels 6 h after the beginning of the zzso Two of them could be identified by comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequence to zzso zzso is a novel type I zzso zzso which has the zzso of being devoid of the zzso zzso described to be essential for transport to the zzso zzso is a novel, moderately zzso zzso zzso belongs to a gene family not yet zzso These genes are highly expressed in zzso at the beginning of the culture and moderately in roots, but are neither expressed in response to chemical treatment, heat zzso pathogen attacks nor during tumor zzso These findings suggest that the zzso of these genes zzso not only to a specific adaptation of zzso to the new environment but also, since their level of expression decreases at the onset of division, to a sequence of events connected with the establishment of the new program of gene expression of the dividing zzso
