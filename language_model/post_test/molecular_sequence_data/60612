zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso were characterized using positive zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso found in many insect zzso was oxidized using mushroom zzso and the resulting zzso derivatives were reacted with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso with zzso were readily identified as zzso + zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of selected zzso confirmed the zzso of 1-3 zzso zzso with zzso In addition to zzso modification by the zzso derivatives of zzso other zzso were consistent with the formation of zzso with zzso and zzso formed by zzso zzso following zzso The primary zzso of zzso was involved in initial zzso formation, but the sites for subsequent additions of oxidized zzso to zzso presumably via zzso groups, could not be identified by zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso films infused into the zzso following zzso in zzso zzso produced zzso similar to that of zzso up to zzso zzso zzso of gradually decreasing intensity consistent with zzso where zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso films following incubation with zzso plus zzso rendered the films zzso in dilute acid, simulating the zzso process proposed to occur during insect zzso zzso Acid zzso of the zzso stage of the zzso zzso zzso using only two zzso zzso for the zzso were infused into the mass zzso without preliminary zzso Eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a variety of zzso incorporating these compound classes were zzso
