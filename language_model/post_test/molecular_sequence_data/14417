zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso are important components of current combination therapies for human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso In screening of chemical libraries, we found zzso zzso and zzso zzso to be highly active and selective zzso of zzso replication in zzso To determine the resistance profiles of these compounds, we conducted a long-term culture of zzso zzso cells with escalating zzso of each zzso After serial passages of the infected cells, escape viruses were zzso and they were more than zzso resistant to the zzso derivatives compared to the wild zzso zzso analysis was conducted for zzso of the escape viruses at passages 12 and zzso The zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso was detected for all escape zzso zzso studies using the crystal structure of zzso showed that zzso requires the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for exerting its zzso effect on zzso Four additional zzso acid changes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified in the zzso H domain of zzso however, their precise role in the acquisition of resistance is still zzso In conclusion, the initial zzso zzso seems sufficient for the acquisition of resistance to the zzso derivatives zzso and zzso Further studies are required to determine the precise role of each zzso in the acquisition of zzso zzso
