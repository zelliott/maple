By direct sequencing of zzso using zzso designed from the known zzso zzso we identified 19 zzso in the human zzso zzso and zzso the corresponding zzso and 3' zzso zzso By zzso search in the database of the Washington University Genome zzso Center zzso we identified one additional zzso These 20 zzso together with a previously reported zzso bring the total zzso number of zzso to zzso zzso zzso were designed to amplify each zzso and adjacent zzso sequences to permit examination of each zzso for zzso By restriction zzso we assembled a 110 zzso zzso zzso that covered almost the entire zzso zzso This information is relevant for the screening of recently reported zzso of the zzso gene which cause zzso zzso zzso zzso and for the search for additional zzso of the same gene which may play a role in the zzso of common human zzso including zzso of the breast, zzso and zzso
