The zzso compositions of the zzso C2 zzso zzso zzso receptors of adult zzso zzso were determined by using a combination of zzso zzso and zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors were zzso by sodium zzso pH 9, and zzso by zzso C2 zzso affinity zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was subjected to zzso using zzso zzso and the zzso immune zzso zzso by zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were all zzso zzso of the zzso showed that zzso of the zzso C2 zzso was associated with the zzso zzso Of this, zzso zzso zzso of total) were zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso of total) were zzso zzso thus identifying the triple combination as a minor zzso zzso These results demonstrate directly, for the first time, the coexistence of the zzso and zzso zzso in native zzso zzso They show the coexistence of two zzso forms of the zzso zzso zzso zzso C2 and zzso zzso in native receptors and, in addition, they imply an zzso zzso zzso containing four types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which, in zzso with molecular size zzso predicts that the zzso zzso is at least zzso These results are the first quantitative study of zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate molecular zzso for both the zzso and the zzso zzso in native zzso zzso zzso
