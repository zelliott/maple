We have previously reported that high level human zzso expression depends on a zzso pair zzso zzso which can function not only in zzso but can also activate gene expression in zzso We report here that this zzso contains two different regions, one active in zzso and the other in zzso In the zzso region, one zzso site and one zzso site are necessary for full zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding site revealed that the intact site is essential for gene expression in zzso and for zzso by zzso or zzso in zzso zzso In the zzso region, four regions are protected by nuclear factors from the zzso cell line zzso 7; three regions contain a zzso sequence sharing zzso with the zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that at least two zzso sequences are required for zzso activity in zzso In addition, another zzso zzso designated zzso is also required for full zzso activity in zzso
