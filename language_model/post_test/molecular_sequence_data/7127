A rapid increase in zzso zzso expression demonstrated by zzso in zzso zzso after avoidance conditioning on goldfish suggested a molecular demand for newly zzso zzso translation zzso To inhibit de zzso synthesis of zzso molecules without interference with zzso ones, 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were injected into the zzso brain fluid before active avoidance zzso zzso animals learned the avoidance zzso however, they were zzso in the zzso When injected into zzso animals, zzso did not interfere with retrieval or performance of the avoidance zzso Fish treated with zzso zzso sequences served as further zzso zzso of zzso was analyzed by injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso observation revealed strong zzso zzso in zzso zzso the only known site of zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that selective zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso can specifically prevent memory zzso We conclude that in particular the newly zzso zzso molecules are involved in memory consolidation, possibly because they have not yet undergone irreversible molecular changes, which have been reported of this zzso in a zzso zzso
