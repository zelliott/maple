zzso growth factor zzso B is a zzso and zzso for smooth muscle cells in zzso and expression of a zzso zzso B gene in zzso arteries stimulates zzso zzso To define the mechanisms by which zzso B gene expression zzso zzso zzso in zzso we examined its effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, zzso zzso zzso and inflammatory cell zzso in zzso zzso of pig arteries after direct gene transfer of a zzso zzso B zzso zzso B gene expression was associated with rapid formation of an zzso including 3- to zzso increases in zzso thickness and zzso area ratio 4 to 21 days after gene transfer compared with control zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle cell proliferation was detected at 2 days, peaked at 7 days zzso zzso zzso and declined by 14 days, although the total number of zzso zzso progressively increased to 21 days zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso ratios of zzso cells, based on zzso proliferation indexes, demonstrated that the increases in zzso cell number on days 2 through 7 could not be accounted for by proliferation alone, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso acts to stimulate cell proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells into the zzso zzso zzso deposition and zzso synthesis were observed after 7 days zzso zzso zzso and were associated with a decline in cell density in the zzso suggesting that zzso zzso synthesis may contribute to progressive zzso zzso in response to zzso B gene zzso There was minimal zzso of inflammatory cells, including zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso B gene expression promotes zzso expansion by both proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells followed by synthesis of zzso zzso and therefore acts through several mechanisms to play a role in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
