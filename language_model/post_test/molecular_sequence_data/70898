The zzso zzso from zzso zzso mediates the active transport through the plasma membrane of zzso zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso potential difference as an energy zzso Analysis of the activity of strains zzso in a zzso segment zzso of the zzso chain has shown the involvement of this segment in the maintenance of the active three-dimensional structure of the zzso In an attempt to identify zzso zzso that could interact functionally and/or physically with this segment, we looked for zzso zzso that could suppress the effects of zzso acid changes in this zzso This paper describes a positive screen that has allowed the isolation of one zzso from a zzso zzso displaying the zzso change zzso zzso a substitution that zzso a dramatic decrease in the affinity of the carrier for zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso to the replacement of the zzso zzso by zzso Its zzso effect is shown to be a partial restoration of the binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso To test whether this zzso zzso is specific for the zzso zzso two double zzso were constructed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso obtained with these two double zzso showed that the zzso effect of zzso L replacement was not specific for the original zzso zzso To understand the general effect of this zzso acid replacement for the three distinct double zzso a strain zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis of this strain showed that, by itself, the zzso L change induced an improvement in the zzso step that could account for its global zzso zzso Moreover, zzso L induced a decrease in the turnover of the zzso thus showing the involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso Taking into account the zzso model of the zzso proposed here, this zzso zzso is probably located in a zzso zzso zzso zzso The location and the observed decrease in the turnover of the carrier observed with the zzso L change lead us to propose that zzso could be part of a zzso pore involved in the zzso of the base and/or the zzso
