At least three zzso class II zzso are zzso in the human major zzso complex zzso zzso DC and zzso zzso clones zzso beta chains of zzso zzso derived from zzso of a zzso zzso line, were isolated and could be divided into four subsets, clearly distinct from zzso clones zzso DC beta zzso zzso at least two zzso DR beta chain genes zzso The complete sequence of one of the DR beta chain zzso clones is zzso It defines a putative signal zzso two zzso zzso a zzso region and a zzso zzso zzso with a DC beta chain zzso clone revealed a zzso of zzso between the two beta chains and that the two genes zzso under relatively little selective zzso A set of zzso acids zzso in zzso molecules was found to be identical in both DR and DC beta zzso zzso of the DR beta chain sequence with the zzso acid sequence of another DR beta chain revealed a zzso of zzso and that most differences are single zzso acid zzso zzso zzso in DR beta chains has probably not arisen by changes in long blocks of zzso
