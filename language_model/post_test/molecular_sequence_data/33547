The zzso of six zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are members of the zzso and contain zzso DNA zzso of between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a unique zzso and features a zzso zzso zzso zzso features 3' overlapping zzso zzso ends, whereas the other viruses contain collections of terminally zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso have a broad host range and lack zzso functions, zzso with their virulent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso integrate into bacterial zzso zzso whereas zzso targets the 3' end of translation zzso factor gene zzso This is the first reported case of zzso integration into such an zzso zzso genetic zzso zzso zzso of viral proteins revealed that both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso programmed zzso zzso for generating major zzso and tail zzso proteins with C zzso of different zzso In both cases, the unusual zzso zzso at the 3' ends of the zzso coding sequences is induced by overlapping zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso feature a zzso organization, they also show extensive zzso within the zzso building zzso Of particular interest is zzso which harbors a collection of zzso and sequences with zzso not only to other zzso zzso but also to viruses infecting other members of the zzso In conclusion, our results yield insights into the composition and diversity of zzso zzso and provide new information on their function, zzso adaptation, and zzso
