The plasma from many zzso contains a component that specifically binds and zzso zzso zzso II with zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso the previously identified zzso zzso zzso inhibitor isolated from zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso 31, zzso and sequencing of four zzso fragments of zzso revealed that each of the partial sequences has zzso sequence identity with members of the zzso protein zzso We describe here the isolation of a full-length zzso clone of zzso from a zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso expression of this zzso clone in a zzso zzso expression system led to the zzso into the medium of 5 zzso of a zzso protein that specifically zzso with zzso zzso and binds tightly to a zzso zzso affinity zzso zzso sequential alignment of zzso with various zzso reveals an zzso acid identity as high as zzso and predicts that 16 zzso zzso bonds are zzso However, despite these structural similarities, the properties of zzso are distinct from the properties of zzso zzso exhibits a significantly decreased affinity for iron that can be attributed to the loss of one of the eight zzso acids that coordinate iron in the zzso as well as both of the zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso are not zzso These data imply that zzso along with zzso is a member of a diverse zzso of zzso proteins with functions other than iron zzso
