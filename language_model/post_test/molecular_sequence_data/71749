zzso codes for the zzso factor zzso which plays an important role in zzso zzso B cell development, and zzso zzso zzso is known to control gene expression by recognizing its target genes via the zzso paired domain and by regulating zzso through a zzso regulatory module consisting of zzso and zzso zzso The central region of zzso contains a sequence with significant zzso to the first zzso of the zzso zzso This partial zzso has been highly zzso throughout zzso evolution because it is found not only in zzso but also in the related zzso and zzso members of the same zzso zzso Here we report that the partial zzso binds the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso Both zzso and zzso were shown by zzso experiments to directly associate with zzso in zzso The zzso core domain of zzso and the pocket region as well as zzso sequences of zzso are required for interaction with the partial zzso of zzso in in zzso binding zzso Furthermore, zzso was specifically bound only by the zzso form of zzso These data indicate that zzso is able to contact the zzso zzso machinery through the zzso initiation factor zzso and that its activity can be controlled by the cell zzso association with zzso
