zzso zzso of proteins bound to immobilized zzso combined with zzso assisted laser zzso zzso mass zzso identification of the zzso zzso can be a powerful technique for zzso zzso zzso of the protein to the zzso is done while the protein is in its native, folded zzso A zzso protein is not required for this zzso because only proteins containing the zzso zzso will bind to the zzso in the initial zzso The method makes use of the resistance of the zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso products of the zzso protein not containing the zzso are washed off the zzso leaving the zzso fragments affinity bound to the immobilized zzso zzso of the zzso complex prior to mass zzso analysis is unnecessary because the zzso peptides are released by the zzso zzso zzso process, although the zzso remains zzso attached to the zzso zzso This zzso protocol has been used in the determination of both continuous and zzso zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso
