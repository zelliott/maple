The sensing of zzso calcium is a general paradigm for regulating diverse cellular functions in many zzso A zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso family of zzso receptors zzso that zzso the effects of zzso calcium in the zzso zzso as well as other zzso has been zzso The diversity of zzso families and the recent finding of calcium sensing in cells lacking the known zzso suggest the existence of additional receptors related to zzso By zzso chain reaction zzso amplification and screening of zzso libraries, we have identified multiple zzso sequences zzso in the zzso Using zzso designed to regions of the first and third zzso zzso of zzso we initially zzso amplified a zzso zzso sequence zzso with high zzso to zzso The deduced protein sequence of zzso is zzso similar and zzso identical to zzso over the available zzso zzso We screened a mouse zzso library with a zzso probe and identified two additional zzso sequences zzso and zzso In the predicted zzso domain, zzso and zzso are zzso identical to zzso We mapped zzso to mouse zzso zzso 7 by zzso zzso analysis, whereas the known zzso zzso to mouse zzso zzso By zzso in zzso zzso zzso also localized to mouse zzso 7 and zzso mapped to mouse zzso zzso We were able to zzso zzso from zzso by zzso using specific zzso suggesting that they are distinct genes clustered on zzso zzso By zzso we identified additional zzso transcripts in mouse zzso brain, zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in lung or zzso The zzso sequence in mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso designated zzso has a deduced zzso acid sequence that is zzso similar and zzso identical to that of zzso The sequence amplified from mouse brain, zzso has a deduced protein sequence that is zzso similar and zzso identical to that of zzso Our findings establish the existence of a novel zzso family of zzso sequences in the mouse which may zzso receptors that zzso responses to diverse zzso zzso
