A spontaneous high-level zzso zzso zzso for which the zzso of zzso is zzso zzso was isolated on a plate containing 400 zzso of the zzso on which had been cultured the low-level zzso zzso zzso zzso for which the zzso is zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso of the zzso and the parental strains by the restriction landmark zzso scanning method with two-dimensional zzso of restriction fragments revealed a zzso deletion in the zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso containing this deleted region was cloned into a zzso zzso and introduced into the parental zzso A deletion zzso reconstructed in the presence of a low concentration of zzso by integration and zzso of the zzso zzso exhibited a high level of resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso confirming that the deletion had caused the zzso of the resistance zzso zzso analysis indicated that the deletion occurred in three consecutive open reading frames zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the first zzso showed high zzso with both zzso and zzso of zzso coli, which are involved in the synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso and that of the third zzso showed a relatively high zzso to the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene of zzso zzso We also isolated another high-level resistant zzso with a deletion within the third ORF, which suggested that zzso of some zzso zzso resulted in the increased zzso
