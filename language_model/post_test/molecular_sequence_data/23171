The zzso proteins zzso are a family of zzso factors that have three highly zzso zzso located towards the zzso that bind zzso and assist in the initiation of gene zzso Human zzso genes have been zzso Recently, the zzso of zzso zzso mice has been zzso being zzso and having severe zzso of both fore and hind zzso They also have zzso brains with defective closure of the anterior and zzso zzso during brain zzso 

The human zzso gene is a zzso gene that maps to zzso close to the related zzso zzso From an zzso cell line we cloned two transcript zzso that use two different first zzso and have a common second zzso One clone encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) and the other a shorter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These two zzso are zzso being found also in mice and zzso Analysis of the zzso protein sequence reveals an zzso zzso zzso that is disrupted in zzso a zzso box and three zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in a wide range of zzso at a low level, with the highest levels being found in zzso Treatment of the zzso zzso cell line zzso with 100 zzso zzso induced zzso zzso after 24 zzso 

There is conservation of the two zzso protein zzso between zzso zzso and fish, suggesting that the zzso have differing roles in gene zzso zzso may play a role in zzso differentiation in addition to its role in brain and limb zzso
