The gene zzso zzso zzso protein of zzso C virus zzso was isolated from a Thai blood donor infected with zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of this clone showed a high degree of zzso to that of 4 zzso strains isolated from other Thai blood donors as well as that of the zzso prototypes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The entire region of the core gene was cloned into an expression zzso zzso to be expressed as a fusion protein with zzso zzso zzso coli zzso containing this zzso did not express the fusion zzso However, zzso core fusion protein could be produced when the core gene was truncated at the 3' end resulting in a gene zzso only the first 123 zzso acid zzso of the core zzso This fusion protein was zzso in standard zzso but could be zzso by zzso and thus subsequently zzso using zzso zzso The zzso fusion protein was zzso and could react with zzso from blood donors infected with all zzso of zzso found in zzso In addition, two zzso zzso clones zzso zzso zzso specific to the zzso zzso core protein were zzso The zzso zzso core protein and the zzso zzso to the zzso protein will be useful for developing zzso systems for detecting zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
