zzso zzso interactions can drive rapid zzso evolution in genes of the immune system, and such arms races may be an important force shaping zzso in the zzso The zzso interference zzso gene zzso zzso is a key component of zzso defense in zzso and we have previously shown that genes in this zzso experience unusually high rates of zzso zzso Here we study patterns of genetic variation in a zzso region around zzso in three different species of zzso Our data suggest that recent independent selective sweeps in zzso have reduced genetic variation across a region of more than 50 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and we estimate that selection has fixed zzso zzso in this gene every zzso thousand zzso The strongest signal of recent selection is evident in zzso zzso where we estimate that the most recent selective sweep involved an zzso with a selective advantage of the order of zzso and occurred roughly zzso zzso To evaluate the potential consequences of the recent zzso on the structure and function of zzso we used zzso and zzso modeling to derive a structural model for the zzso zzso and this suggests that recent zzso in zzso zzso are overrepresented at the protein zzso In zzso our results show that selection by zzso can consistently target the same genes in multiple species, resulting in areas of the zzso that have markedly reduced genetic zzso
