zzso zzso syndromes involving zzso of zzso (also zzso a tumor zzso are important to identify because the relatively high zzso of zzso zzso associated with such zzso warrants a specific surveillance zzso However, there is a dearth of reports describing experience with surveillance and early detection informed by genetic insight into this zzso 

zzso isolated zzso zzso is a rare cause of zzso zzso tumors without other zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and rarely, zzso have been identified in zzso with zzso zzso zzso may be enriched in zzso families with zzso zzso zzso the importance of identifying zzso zzso 

A 13-year-old boy, whose father had died of zzso zzso developed primary zzso A left superior zzso mass was identified by zzso and removed zzso zzso zzso features of the boy's tumor included zzso zzso zzso and microscopic zzso zzso Two years later, under close zzso zzso primary zzso recurred 5 months after documentation of zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso identified a newly enlarged right superior zzso zzso but indicated no zzso disease in the left zzso zzso features typical of a benign zzso were evident after surgical zzso of the zzso 

zzso DNA analysis revealed a zzso zzso in zzso 2 of zzso The initial tumor zzso the expected zzso zzso zzso plus a distinct zzso zzso zzso consistent with the zzso zzso zzso concept of zzso zzso of a classic tumor zzso zzso zzso screening of the patient's 7 zzso and previously zzso siblings revealed three with the same zzso zzso zzso One of the siblings newly identified as zzso was noted to be zzso at the time of the genetic zzso He was found to have a zzso zzso with aggressive zzso Two of the five children of another zzso sibling also carry the same zzso zzso 

Despite the reported rarity of zzso zzso in zzso a personal or family history of zzso zzso in zzso mandates serious consideration of zzso zzso zzso zzso This information can be used in diagnostic and management considerations, leading to early detection and removal of potentially zzso zzso zzso
