We have identified and characterized a novel zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso (for B cell zzso zzso of 32 zzso zzso zzso the human and mouse zzso coding sequences were isolated and the human zzso gene was mapped to zzso zzso zzso is expressed by B zzso but not T zzso or zzso zzso Human zzso center B cells show increased zzso zzso and resting B cells rapidly zzso expression of zzso after zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso is zzso upon B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso stimulation and associates with zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso is recruited to the plasma membrane through its zzso zzso zzso recruitment requires zzso zzso zzso activity and an intact zzso zzso zzso suggesting that membrane association occurs through binding to zzso zzso of zzso in B cells leads to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso of nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso which is blocked by deletion of the zzso domain or zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso represents a novel B zzso zzso that regulates zzso signaling downstream of zzso
