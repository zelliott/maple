In contrast to our knowledge of the shoot zzso zzso our understanding of zzso zzso differentiation and maintenance is zzso Class III zzso zzso zzso proteins have been shown to play a regulatory role in vascular zzso The hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso class III zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso 166 zzso family were cloned from hybrid zzso using a combination of in zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso analyses of zzso and zzso were performed by Northern zzso zzso The expression of zzso was closely associated with wood formation and regulated both zzso and zzso with the highest expression during the active growing zzso Also, its expression was zzso correlated with the level of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was confirmed using modified zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso The expression of zzso was much higher in the winter than in the growing seasons, suggesting seasonal and zzso regulation of zzso in this perennial plant zzso
