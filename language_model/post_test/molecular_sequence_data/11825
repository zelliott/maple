Studies of gene regulation by oxygen have recently defined the existence of a widely operative system that responds to zzso but not zzso zzso and involves the induction of a zzso complex termed zzso factor zzso This system has been implicated in the regulation of erythropoietin, certain zzso growth factors, and particular zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is induced by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso the operation of a different mechanism of oxygen zzso To explore that possibility, we analyzed the zzso sequences that convey these zzso An zzso lying zzso to the mouse zzso gene was found to convey responses both to zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, detailed analysis of this zzso demonstrated that distinct elements responded to zzso and the zzso zzso The response to zzso was zzso by sequences that contained a functionally critical, although zzso zzso factor 1 binding site, whereas sequences lying approximately 100 zzso zzso to this site, which contained a critical serum response element, conveyed responses to the zzso zzso Thus, rather than reflecting an entirely different mechanism of oxygen zzso regulation of zzso gene expression by zzso and zzso zzso arises from the function of two different sensing zzso One of these responds to zzso alone and resembles that involved in zzso regulation, while the other responds to zzso zzso and involves zzso of a serum response zzso
