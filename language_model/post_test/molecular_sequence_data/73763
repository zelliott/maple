The three-dimensional structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso comprised of multiple zzso with a zzso fold, are consistent with having evolved from a common zzso The presence or absence of copper sites has complicated zzso the structural and evolutionary relationship among these and related zzso zzso structural zzso of the zzso zzso and their known zzso relatives shows clearly that there are at least six zzso classes, and that the evolution of the zzso core of these zzso is independent of the presence or absence of copper zzso zzso among the variable zzso in these structures show that the zzso zzso of the blue zzso contained a zzso interface but could not have functioned in a zzso zzso zzso of the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso transport zzso from zzso to the structurally defined core and loop zzso of the zzso suggests specific zzso that could be involved in the zzso activity of zzso
