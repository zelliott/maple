zzso zzso results in the loss of fertilizer nitrogen and greenhouse gas emissions as nitrous zzso but ecological factors in soil influencing zzso communities are not well zzso zzso the potential for zzso by land zzso Communities vary in the relative abundance of the alternative zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso and the nitrous oxide zzso gene zzso however, the significance for nitrous oxide emissions is zzso We assessed the influence of different long-term zzso and zzso treatments in a zzso field experiment, comparing the potential for zzso by soil samples with the size and diversity of their zzso zzso zzso potential was much higher in soil from an area left to develop from zzso into zzso than from a zzso zzso zzso treatment, which in turn was significantly higher than zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This correlated with abundance of zzso but not zzso the least abundant of the genes tested in all soils, showing an inverse relationship with zzso Most genetic variation was seen in zzso where sequences resolved into separate groups according to soil zzso We conclude that bacteria containing zzso are most probably responsible for the increased zzso potential associated with nitrogen and organic carbon in this zzso
