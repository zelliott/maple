zzso is a zzso zzso known to activate the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Studies of zzso zzso mice reveal a clear zzso in tumor necrosis zzso production, although very little detail is known about its regulation and the signaling events zzso In the present study we demonstrated that zzso of zzso was required for its zzso activity as zzso treatment of zzso decreased its zzso zzso The zzso sequence contains a zzso zzso at position 290 in the zzso loop of the zzso zzso We found that zzso of this zzso to zzso eliminated its ability to activate zzso and zzso zzso whereas a zzso zzso to zzso acid could rescue the ability to activate zzso zzso was also required for robust zzso of zzso zzso generated to zzso recognized both zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso did not occur through zzso but via another zzso We showed that zzso was zzso zzso at zzso in zzso human embryonic kidney zzso cells as well as human zzso as this zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso cells to the same zzso Treatment with zzso A inhibited zzso activity in the zzso zzso but did not inhibit zzso at zzso Together these results showed that zzso of zzso at zzso is necessary but not sufficient for full zzso activity in the zzso zzso
