Human zzso zzso is a well-known zzso acid cycle zzso and is therefore a key component in energy zzso zzso studies on human patients have shown that zzso in the zzso gene are responsible for diseases such as zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso As a first step in zzso the molecular basis of the mechanism of zzso zzso in genetic disorders, the zzso gene was cloned in zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, zzso by zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso X-ray zzso experiments were performed at a zzso source and the structure was solved at zzso resolution by molecular zzso
