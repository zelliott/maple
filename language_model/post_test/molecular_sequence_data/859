zzso evidence has suggested that zzso zzso play an important role in zzso As zzso regulators, altered zzso expression may affect many zzso biological zzso indicating that zzso can function as tumor zzso and/or zzso We first performed a genetic association analysis by screening genetic zzso in 15 zzso genes and detected that a common sequence zzso in zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with decreased breast cancer risk (for zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso of a zzso island upstream zzso zzso of the zzso precursor was also associated with reduced breast cancer risk zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso By delivering expression zzso containing either zzso or zzso precursors of zzso into breast cancer cells, we showed that this zzso led to less efficient processing of the zzso precursor to its mature form as well as diminished capacity to regulate target zzso A zzso expression zzso was done and a zzso analysis identified a zzso network formed by genes significantly altered following enforced expression of zzso zzso analysis further showed that cell cycle response to zzso challenge was significantly enhanced in cells treated with zzso zzso compared with cells treated with the zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso might have a potentially zzso role in breast zzso and the functional genetic zzso in its mature region could serve as a novel zzso for breast cancer zzso
