zzso classified in group zzso zzso a wide range of plants and are transmitted by zzso zzso of the family zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence identity and biological properties, group zzso encompasses several species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Other group zzso zzso strains are associated with zzso disease in wild and cultivated zzso and woody plants and with zzso noir disease in zzso zzso zzso zzso Such latter strains have been informally proposed to represent a separate species, zzso zzso zzso but a formal description of this zzso has not previously been zzso In the present work, zzso disease strain zzso zzso was distinguished from reference strains of previously described species of the zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso gene sequence similarity and a unique signature sequence in the zzso zzso zzso Other zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains shared zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with strain zzso and contained the signature zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso known to be transmitted by zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular characteristics are consistent with the concept that diverse zzso zzso zzso strains share common properties and represent an ecologically distinct gene zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences supported this view and yielded zzso trees in which zzso zzso zzso strains formed, within the group zzso zzso a zzso zzso that was most closely related to, but distinct from, that of zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on distinct molecular and biological properties, zzso and zzso zzso strains are proposed to represent a novel species level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is designated the reference zzso
