zzso 2 zzso is a recently cloned human zzso that shows zzso expression in zzso zzso skin, and zzso The protein level and zzso activity of zzso have been shown to be zzso in prostate zzso compared with normal and benign prostate zzso The biological function of zzso and the role of loss of zzso expression in prostate zzso however, remain zzso We report the cloning and functional characterization of zzso and its three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from primary prostate zzso zzso Western zzso with multiple primary prostate cell strains and prostate cancer cell lines reveals that the expression of zzso is lost in all prostate cancer cell lines, accompanied by decreased zzso activity revealed by liquid zzso mass zzso zzso Further experiments show that the loss of zzso expression results from zzso repression caused by zzso other than promoter zzso or zzso zzso zzso functional studies indicate the zzso 1) the zzso product, zzso acid, zzso prostate cancer cell cycle zzso 2) zzso expression in primary prostate zzso cells is zzso correlated with cell zzso and 3) restoration of zzso expression in prostate cancer cells partially zzso cell cycle zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso could be a zzso of prostate cancer development, which functions by restricting cell cycle zzso
