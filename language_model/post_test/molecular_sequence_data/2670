zzso relationship studies were conducted on the zzso zzso previously characterized in both bovine zzso and corpus zzso zzso using as a reference zzso a synthetic zzso zzso the entire zzso zzso domain of the zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was found to be a good competitive inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso while the zzso zzso was zzso This allowed the complete zzso of two zzso of the zzso (Mr zzso and zzso zzso by affinity zzso using zzso immobilized zzso zzso zzso as the affinity zzso The use of selectively modified or truncated forms of the reference zzso or of the zzso competitive inhibitor of the zzso established clearly that this basic pair specific zzso is sensitive to modification of the zzso structure either at the basic zzso of the zzso locus or at zzso acids around this site zzso zzso and zzso It is concluded that longer distance interactions between zzso acids situated on both the zzso and zzso sides of the basic zzso zzso may contribute to the stabilization of a preferred zzso zzso allowing recognition by the zzso zzso
