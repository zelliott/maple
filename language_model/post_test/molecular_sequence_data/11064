To assess the zzso of zzso prediction for band 3 zzso we determined the zzso sites of the protein and the portions of the protein tightly bound to the membrane zzso zzso by means of in zzso zzso zzso For the removal of all anticipated zzso zzso zzso from zzso we had to zzso the band 3 protein zzso in zzso by zzso zzso When the zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso and zzso the majority of the anticipated zzso portions remained in the membrane zzso However, five anticipated zzso portions were released into the zzso zzso Thus, the first, second, third, sixth and tenth anticipated zzso portions, in accordance with the zzso zzso were released into the zzso with the zzso zzso zzso This indicates that these anticipated zzso portions are not bound with the boundary lipids although the zzso of these portions is comparable to that of the portions zzso remaining in the membrane zzso It is conceivable that the membrane zzso portions of band 3 protein could be classified into at least two categories, zzso one bound to the boundary lipids and the other free from the boundary zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of the band 3 protein are recovered in either the zzso fraction or the membrane zzso The zzso of zzso prediction for zzso membrane proteins and the nature of the membrane embedded zzso portions are zzso
