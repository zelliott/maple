The zzso zzso of the zzso usher zzso was studied in zzso coli whole cells by using zzso zzso density zzso zzso of isolated zzso the zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso and zzso with a specific zzso zzso zzso containing the complete zzso zzso as well as cells containing the zzso zzso gene in various expression zzso were zzso Most of the zzso was present in the outer zzso in a zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso coli cells expressing zzso confirmed an outer membrane zzso and indicated the presence of zzso at the cell zzso zzso zzso degradation indicated that the mature zzso contained 777 zzso acid zzso and confirmed that zzso is zzso with a rather long signal sequence of 35 zzso acid zzso Twelve different zzso fusion proteins were prepared and characterized by zzso sequencing and zzso Most of these fusion sites were located in the zzso and zzso regions of zzso Six zzso fusion proteins were soluble proteins in the zzso whereas the other fusion proteins were associated with the outer zzso The zzso accessibility of zzso and of the six outer zzso zzso fusion proteins was studied using whole cells, cells with zzso outer zzso and isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso K were zzso Based on the results of these experiments and computer predictions, a model for the membrane zzso of zzso was developed in which zzso contains a large central domain containing 24 zzso segments and two relatively large zzso regions, at the zzso and zzso end of the zzso zzso
