zzso differentiation in zzso zzso is controlled by a zzso signal zzso zzso zzso by Ras and a zzso cascade that includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso of this cascade is positively regulated by a number of proteins such as zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso We describe the functional characterization of zzso and several genes that regulate signaling downstream of zzso We identified zzso by zzso a zzso that suppresses an activated zzso zzso and showed that zzso is a divergent member of the zzso diffusion zzso family of heavy metal zzso zzso that is probably localized to the zzso zzso membrane and regulates cellular zzso zzso zzso double zzso analyses suggest that the zzso effect is not a general toxic zzso Instead, zzso zzso target a specific step of the pathway, probably regulation of the scaffolding protein zzso zzso analysis in zzso cells indicates that high zzso concentration causes a dramatic increase of zzso zzso zzso analysis also indicates that zzso zzso and zzso zzso act downstream of zzso to positively and zzso regulate zzso activity, zzso
