zzso studies of human DNA zzso B zzso have suggested that its activity is critical for the zzso transition of the cell cycle, but the nature of its role remains zzso In this study, we show that during zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso in nuclear zzso induced by DNA damaging agents and that this focal pattern requires active zzso During S and zzso zzso zzso primarily in the zzso A zzso domain from zzso zzso cell zzso zzso but not the focal pattern, to a reporter zzso A cluster of potential zzso zzso zzso sites in this domain was modified at the zzso transition and maintained through zzso of the cell cycle in zzso zzso with nuclear export of zzso zzso 967 of zzso was the major site zzso in zzso and in zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso of zzso 967 is crucial in regulating the zzso zzso of zzso expressed zzso We propose that the zzso of zzso operates primarily during zzso to process zzso DNA damage before the zzso transition, and it is largely zzso in the zzso during zzso
