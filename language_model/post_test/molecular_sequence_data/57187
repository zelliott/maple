zzso zzso zzso the key regulatory zzso for de zzso zzso zzso zzso is subject to feedback regulation by zzso and zzso zzso zzso labeling with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to identify zzso zzso sites for feedback control of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso the zzso with zzso zzso zzso for zzso was shown by the zzso attachment of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso per zzso and protection by zzso and zzso against zzso and incorporation of zzso Six zzso peptides modified with zzso were isolated and identified by differential labeling followed by high performance liquid zzso and zzso Mass zzso and zzso degradation analysis were used to identify 5 zzso that were zzso modified by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was also modified by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had activity similar to that of the wild type zzso However, both zzso exhibited decreased sensitivity to zzso by zzso and decreased binding of zzso but were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were normally zzso but were defective in zzso zzso transfer and zzso functions, zzso Therefore zzso and zzso are important for activity and modification by zzso and zzso accounts for zzso zzso These results zzso zzso important for zzso in close proximity to a site for zzso zzso Two additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso were constructed which were zzso to zzso by zzso with little change in zzso by zzso A replacement of zzso indicates that this zzso is not essential for zzso or feedback zzso Overall, these results are interpreted in terms of a zzso site model with zzso zzso zzso and zzso defining a site required for zzso by zzso A second zzso site not affinity labeled by zzso is very close to or zzso with the zzso zzso
