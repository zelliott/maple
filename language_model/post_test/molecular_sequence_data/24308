To identify molecular interaction partners of the cellular prion protein zzso we sought to apply an in zzso zzso method that maintains the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso cells zzso that are susceptible to prion infection revealed the presence of zzso in high molecular mass zzso protein complexes of 200 to 225 zzso zzso analysis identified three zzso zzso of the neural cell zzso zzso zzso in the complexes, which isolate with zzso zzso zzso zzso removal of zzso sugar zzso did not disrupt the complexes, arguing that the interaction of zzso with zzso occurs through zzso acid zzso Additionally, similar levels of zzso complexes were found in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso With the use of an zzso zzso library, the zzso site was determined to comprise zzso C and zzso within the two consecutive zzso type III zzso zzso found in proximity of the zzso site of zzso As revealed by in zzso zzso of zzso deletion zzso the zzso face of the binding site is formed by the N zzso zzso A zzso zzso and the adjacent loop region of zzso zzso zzso mice that were zzso challenged with zzso zzso succumbed to disease with a mean incubation period of 122 zzso zzso days, arguing that zzso is not involved in zzso zzso Our findings raise the possibility that zzso may join with zzso in carrying out some as yet unidentified zzso cellular zzso
