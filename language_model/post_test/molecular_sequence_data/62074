The repair of zzso breaks in DNA is an essential process in all organisms, and requires the coordinated activities of zzso zzso protein zzso One of the most critical of these is the zzso zzso complex, which is present in all three biological zzso but is not zzso at the zzso zzso Previous structural analysis of a zzso zzso from zzso illuminated the zzso core of the zzso an zzso domain related to the ABC zzso family of zzso Here, we present the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso signature motif zzso changes the key zzso zzso in the signature motif that is zzso among zzso zzso and ABC zzso The zzso zzso is analogous to the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso that results in zzso zzso We show here that the zzso to zzso change in the zzso protein prevents zzso binding and zzso the communication among the other zzso zzso This structural change, in turn, alters the communication between zzso zzso and thus prevents zzso zzso The equivalent zzso was made in the human zzso zzso and the resulting zzso protein did form a complex with zzso and zzso but was specifically deficient in all zzso zzso zzso This signature motif zzso zzso extends to zzso because the same zzso introduced into the zzso zzso zzso gene generated an zzso that failed to complement a zzso deletion strain in DNA repair zzso in zzso These structural and zzso results extend our understanding of the zzso zzso domain and validate the use of the signature motif zzso to test the role of zzso zzso binding in diverse zzso
