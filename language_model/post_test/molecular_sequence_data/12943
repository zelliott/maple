The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been zzso in zzso zzso The zzso protein can be zzso in 8 M zzso and directly diluted into buffer containing ethanol and zzso to obtain zzso that is as biologically active as zzso zzso from zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso folded in this manner zzso the zzso activity of soluble and zzso zzso deficient in zzso and restores zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso with zzso deficient in zzso zzso zzso was used to generate zzso and single zzso acid zzso in the primary structure of zzso In the five zzso tested, zzso that weaken zzso zzso by zzso zzso affect its ability to restore zzso zzso to a similar extent, with one zzso zzso of zzso with zzso appears to zzso zzso zzso and the restoration of zzso zzso As in the case of zzso coli, it appears that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso have more profound effects than zzso deletions on the function of zzso zzso zzso with six zzso acids deleted from the C zzso which is the only region of significant mismatch between the zzso of spinach and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity with a reduced potency similar to that of zzso pea zzso Four of the six zzso acids are zzso or zzso These zzso zzso acids may be important in zzso zzso
