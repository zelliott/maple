zzso zzso zzso is an unusual zzso zzso zzso that can grow on zzso acid zzso as the sole source of carbon and zzso zzso of zzso by this zzso is carried out by a zzso zzso zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA revealed four tightly linked genes zzso this novel zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso zzso sequences indicated that the zzso contains a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The large zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a typical zzso zzso center with an unusual zzso motif and, together with the small zzso of the zzso zzso (20 zzso showed a high degree of identity with a number of zzso zzso However, the other components of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso more closely resemble those found in other classes of zzso zzso has a high degree of identity to zzso from zzso and methane zzso which are zzso characterized by possessing zzso containing zzso bridge zzso iron zzso zzso is a zzso of 38 zzso with a typical zzso zzso center and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso motifs and is similar to a number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the genes zzso zzso from a marine zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of zzso genes highly related to those found in zzso suggesting that zzso is a novel type of zzso that may be zzso in all zzso zzso
