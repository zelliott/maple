A zzso zzso zzso gene zzso affecting expression of the surface array protein gene zzso in zzso coli was zzso The zzso gene starts 205 zzso after zzso and codes for a protein with a deduced molecular weight zzso of zzso containing an zzso zzso and significant zzso to the zzso cassette transport protein zzso zzso was identified by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso by using zzso zzso expression and zzso translation and was zzso with the zzso zzso membrane zzso The protein displayed zzso migration during zzso A zzso fusion containing 128 zzso of upstream sequence and zzso bases in the zzso end of zzso was constructed, and the zzso activity of the zzso fusion gene was shown to be similar in zzso coli and zzso zzso The zzso zzso fusion protein was zzso and by using an zzso affinity column, the 129 zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to bind zzso
