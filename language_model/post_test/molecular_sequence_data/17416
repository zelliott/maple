zzso for detection and differentiation of nine avian zzso zzso were carried out by the use of a zzso chain reaction zzso combined with restriction zzso analysis zzso and further zzso sequence zzso With one primer set, which framed a region within the zzso zzso zzso core protein zzso we were able to detect zzso DNA from 19 tested strains and zzso belonging to five defined zzso species and four previously undefined isolated zzso zzso results revealed no recognizable differences in size of amplified fragments among the different zzso zzso of zzso products with zzso and zzso allowed us to differentiate most of the tested zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the amplified fragments showed a zzso similarity of zzso among the different zzso zzso analysis documented five distinguishable sequence clusters in accordance with results obtained by zzso zzso in combination with zzso and sequencing of the amplified fragments is a rapid and effective diagnostic system, and it is a new approach to refine zzso studies of zzso zzso
