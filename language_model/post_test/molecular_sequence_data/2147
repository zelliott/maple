zzso zzso hormones, zzso and zzso are known to be zzso as part of two larger precursors zzso respectively, a zzso and a zzso together with its associated zzso Starting from ostrich zzso a zzso zzso was isolated and chemically zzso Following sequence determination of the zzso fragments and of peptides obtained from zzso and zzso zzso of the oxidized zzso this zzso zzso was found to contain an zzso zzso zzso zzso still zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the ostrich zzso sequence closely resembles all known zzso sequences and that, zzso it does not contain the single zzso acid zzso shown previously in the ostrich zzso It is also shown that the stretch of zzso zzso linking the zzso and the zzso is clearly different from its zzso zzso and lacks the zzso zzso normally recognized by the zzso zzso This study also demonstrates that the ostrich zzso is more closely related to the zzso zzso sequence than to its zzso zzso leading to the hypothesis that two families of zzso molecules might zzso Thus, the ostrich zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso reported in birds and, together with the guinea pig and zzso zzso represents the third example of partial or no zzso zzso
