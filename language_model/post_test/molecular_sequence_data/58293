Three of the four zzso zzso required for growth of zzso zzso zzso exist as zzso pairs specific for zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso However, only two tandem zzso zzso are found, and are expressed only as zzso in transformed zzso zzso zzso peptides spanning zzso of the native zzso zzso revealed a sequence identical to that deduced from zzso zzso zzso except that zzso lacks zzso 2 and 3 zzso is zzso zzso is zzso Also, mass zzso indicates that native zzso and zzso zzso are identical in mass adjusted for the first three zzso Furthermore, the native zzso have identical zzso pH values, indicating an equal number of charged zzso To enable zzso coli to express zzso having the native zzso zzso zzso 2 and 3 were deleted from the zzso portion of the tandem zzso resulting in expression of protein having the zzso and regulatory properties of native zzso including zzso stimulation of zzso activity by zzso or zzso (not zzso or zzso and zzso zzso of the respective activities by zzso and zzso zzso normal and zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso strongly resembles human zzso with a low zzso for zzso the ability to zzso zzso and zzso at much higher zzso values, and zzso zzso by zzso Thus two distinct and specific zzso evidently are derived from a single zzso zzso The mechanism by which this occurs in zzso has yet to be zzso
