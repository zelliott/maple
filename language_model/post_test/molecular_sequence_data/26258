The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso factor protein zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene showed about zzso zzso to the sequences of zzso genes of other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and about zzso similarity was found when comparing the deduced zzso acid sequences of the various Tu zzso The relatively low G + C content zzso of the zzso zzso DNA was reflected in a low G + C content zzso of the zzso zzso and in a preferential use of zzso and zzso at the third position of zzso yet zzso usage analysis revealed the presence of almost all of the zzso of the genetic code in the zzso zzso Southern zzso zzso of zzso zzso of 11 zzso species with the entire zzso zzso zzso gene and with its zzso part suggested the presence of one copy only of this gene in the representative species of the zzso In this respect, the zzso resemble zzso bacteria and differ from the zzso bacteria, which carry two copies of the zzso zzso
