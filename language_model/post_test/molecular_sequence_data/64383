zzso expression of genes is related to development and progression of zzso zzso zzso however, the detailed mechanism is unclear yet because the known genetic information is not sufficient at zzso This study was to explore cloning and identification of zzso gamma zzso zzso gene zzso expressed in human zzso zzso 

The suppression zzso zzso was used to obtain zzso zzso products of zzso then the products were cloned by zzso zzso The differential expression of gene in zzso was identified by DNA sequencing analysis, Northern zzso analysis, rapid amplification of zzso end zzso and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso a zzso zzso of 787 zzso was screened from the zzso zzso zzso and it was further discovered that the expression of the zzso zzso was higher significantly in human zzso zzso cell strains of zzso and zzso than in normal zzso by Northern zzso zzso The zzso was carried out and the gene of 1 zzso zzso containing zzso in zzso was zzso which has an entire open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that this was a gene zzso human zzso zzso analysis of zzso showed that the amplification of zzso zzso especially in zzso of zzso was raised as compared to that of adjacent zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso was discovered in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso may be associated with the zzso of zzso
