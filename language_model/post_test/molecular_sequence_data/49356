The zzso zzso zzso zzso and the related species zzso zzso and zzso zzso whose zzso have been completely zzso are presently used as model organisms in different laboratories to study zzso DNA replication and gene expression and to develop genetic tools for zzso We have performed an extensive zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso to obtain an integrated view of its zzso molecular biology and zzso Many new functions are predicted for both informational and operational zzso Moreover, several candidate genes have been identified that might zzso missing links in key zzso zzso some of which have unique zzso zzso The great majority of zzso proteins are typical zzso proteins and their zzso pattern agrees with its position near the root of the zzso zzso However, proteins probably from bacterial origin, including some from zzso bacteria, are also present in the zzso zzso zzso
