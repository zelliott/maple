zzso root development is a zzso zzso event that gives rise to most of the underground parts of higher zzso zzso promotes lateral root formation, but the molecular mechanisms involved are still zzso We have isolated a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which has reduced sensitivity to zzso This dominant zzso zzso completely lacks lateral roots, and this zzso cannot be rescued by the application of zzso zzso Analysis with zzso and zzso markers revealed that the zzso zzso blocks cell divisions of zzso cells in lateral root zzso The zzso zzso is also defective in root hair formation and in the zzso responses of its roots and zzso zzso zzso cloning and isolation of an zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso encodes zzso a member of the zzso protein zzso Green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso protein was localized in the nucleus, and the zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso suggesting that zzso acts as a zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso is a key regulator in zzso growth and development, particularly in lateral root zzso
