The zzso gene is zzso in patients with Usher syndrome type zzso which is the most common zzso of Usher syndrome and is characterized by hearing loss and zzso zzso Since zzso analysis by DNA sequencing of zzso zzso revealed only zzso of the expected zzso zzso we searched for zzso zzso of the zzso We identified 51 novel zzso at the 3' end of the zzso and we obtained indications for alternative zzso The putative protein zzso by the longest open reading frame zzso in addition to the known functional zzso two zzso G and 28 zzso type III repeats, as well as a zzso region followed by an zzso domain with a zzso domain at its zzso zzso zzso expression profile analysis suggested a low level of expression for both the long and the short zzso and partial overlap in spatial and zzso expression zzso zzso analysis in 12 unrelated patients with Usher syndrome, each with one zzso in zzso zzso revealed three different zzso zzso in four patients and two zzso zzso in one zzso The presence of zzso zzso in the novel zzso indicates that at least one of the putative long zzso of the zzso protein plays a role in both hearing and zzso
