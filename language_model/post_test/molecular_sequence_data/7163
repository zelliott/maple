zzso is a highly zzso and ubiquitous zzso zzso protein that binds to zzso core zzso zzso and zzso form a family of zzso proteins that have been reported to bind zzso to regions of active zzso zzso To study the functional role of the zzso chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated by targeted gene disruption in a chicken zzso cell line, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines were generated by two independent selection zzso zzso zzso zzso lines produced about half the normal level of zzso zzso and zzso zzso lines produced no zzso zzso No significant changes in cell zzso were observed in cells harboring either zzso or doubly disrupted zzso zzso and no zzso changes in zzso or zzso protein levels were zzso It is concluded that zzso protein is not required for normal growth of avian cell lines in zzso nor does the absence of zzso protein lead to any major changes in cellular zzso at least in zzso zzso
