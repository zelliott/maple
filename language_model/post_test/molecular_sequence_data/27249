Previous studies from this laboratory have dealt with the zzso and zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso has been described as a major mechanism in the regulation of zzso zzso However, the zzso location of zzso in the human zzso has remained zzso To examine this issue, we cloned the full-length gene zzso zzso for the zzso zzso whose open reading frame encodes for a zzso of 412 zzso acids with an estimated molecular mass of zzso that exhibits similarity to other zzso zzso zzso of the gene allowed us to purify the zzso protein zzso by metal affinity zzso The zzso zzso was used to raise zzso zzso that were zzso to zzso the zzso in zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso was observed to be associated with the plasma zzso in zzso close to the plasma membrane and in the zzso zzso
