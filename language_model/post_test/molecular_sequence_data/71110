To date zinc zzso have only been found in animals and zzso zzso A zzso clone zzso for a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained by using reverse zzso differential display zzso chain reaction to identify zzso zzso zzso resembles pancreatic zzso in being zzso as a precursor species zzso zzso zzso containing a large zzso zzso (99 zzso zzso The mature zzso form of zzso shows closest zzso acid identity to human zzso A1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso was expressed in an insect cell line yielding an zzso with dual A1 + zzso specificity for zzso zzso and aromatic zzso zzso zzso However, in contrast to the very broad spectrum A + zzso bacterial zzso zzso lacks zzso activity against charged zzso zzso This is predictable as key zzso zzso determining the specificity of zzso are zzso with those of zzso zzso zzso Thus, in evolutionary terms the zzso zzso is an intermediate between the divergence of A and B forms and the differentiation of the A form into A1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso of infected host zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso with the zzso produced zzso in zzso zzso an equivalent function to zzso pancreatic zzso
