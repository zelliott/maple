zzso mosaic virus zzso is an economically important zzso causing a severe disease of commercial lettuce zzso Based on molecular data, three zzso groups of zzso have previously been zzso reflecting their geographical origin zzso zzso Greece, or zzso zzso information for the entire coat protein domain was only available for one of the Western zzso zzso zzso We have now zzso the 3' terminal region of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which belong to the Greek zzso group and of zzso the sole known representative of the third zzso zzso zzso The region zzso encodes the last 62 zzso of the zzso and the entire coat protein of the four zzso plus the 3' zzso region of zzso and zzso The Greek and zzso zzso studied are all very aggressive on lettuce, are able to overcome the resistance genes zzso and zzso and belong to the two zzso groups which have so far been only partially zzso As for other zzso the core and the zzso regions of the coat protein are highly zzso among all zzso whereas the zzso is more zzso No zzso acid change in the coat protein or zzso part of the zzso could be related to the zzso properties of the zzso zzso The sequences obtained provide the basis for the rapid typing of zzso zzso using the restriction pattern of segments of zzso amplified by zzso
