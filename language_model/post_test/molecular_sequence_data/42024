Some human leukemia cell lines, such as zzso and zzso differentiate to zzso by treatment with chemicals such as zzso zzso or zzso vitamin zzso In this report, we demonstrate that cellular protein zzso zzso zzso activity (especially in zzso in zzso leukemia zzso cells increased up to zzso during the course of zzso zzso We have cloned 13 zzso gene fragments from the differentiated zzso cells using the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Two of these were found to be genes of novel zzso zzso and zzso We investigated the changes in expression of each zzso during the differentiation of the cells and found that nine zzso (both zzso and zzso were expressed more in the differentiated cells than in the zzso zzso Among them, zzso and zzso were greatly induced by zzso zzso Interestingly, there were two zzso zzso that were zzso during the course of zzso Our present data suggest that the functions of the zzso zzso during zzso maturation are not always equivalent to each other, and zzso zzso may participate in several different pathways of signal zzso during the differentiation of leukemia zzso
