The zzso characterization of zzso degradation is an important basis for a better understanding of both the immune response and zzso diseases zzso by zzso class II zzso In this study we used zzso liquid zzso and mass zzso to analyze the processing of zzso basic protein zzso a potential zzso implicated in the zzso of multiple zzso We resolved the zzso of zzso processing by zzso extracts or zzso zzso zzso identified the major zzso sites during this process and assigned them to the activity of zzso zzso zzso processing of zzso is mostly guided along the zzso regions of the zzso It is initiated by two zzso steps (after zzso and zzso that are performed by an zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting processing zzso are converted into more than 60 different species of zzso due to the activity of zzso including zzso D and zzso The fragments thus generated are subsequently zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso the initial zzso during zzso processing affect two zzso regions of the potential zzso zzso and zzso in an inverse zzso zzso directly generates the N zzso of the zzso zzso in large quantities during the initial phase of processing, which might explain the zzso of this region in spite of its relatively poor binding to zzso In contrast, the dominant zzso by zzso mediates the destruction of zzso unless the zzso is protected, zzso by binding to zzso Our results thus characterize the zzso events during processing of zzso on a molecular level and suggest a zzso basis for the zzso of the zzso zzso which could serve as a zzso for future therapeutic zzso
