The zzso and zzso DNA databases were searched for zzso sequences of the rat containing zzso repeats of zzso and zzso Among those zzso 23 sequences were analyzed by zzso chain reaction to examine the size variation of the amplified zzso in zzso rat zzso All of the 23 zzso sequences varied in size among the strains zzso The 23 zzso zzso in a pair of zzso separated from the same zzso strain were then zzso zzso identical in size were observed in all zzso of the two zzso indicating the stability of the zzso over a large number of zzso The zzso zzso therefore, should be useful markers for linkage analyses in the zzso
