zzso syndrome zzso a zzso qualitative zzso disorder, is now proved to be caused by a qualitative or quantitative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated the genetic background of two Japanese females with zzso and identified the molecular defects underlying this zzso The first case was a single base pair deletion within seven zzso repeats at position zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulting in a zzso and a premature stop zzso The second case was a single zzso substitution at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulting in zzso zzso The latter case is of interest in considering the zzso of zzso because all four zzso consisting of the zzso complex have the same structural unit called zzso repeat zzso Because this zzso is located within the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso substitution may result in an zzso of the zzso that leads to impaired surface expression of the zzso zzso To clarify the effect of this zzso on surface expression of the zzso complex, we performed zzso studies with a zzso having this zzso zzso zzso could not increase surface expression of the zzso complex, thus demonstrating an important role of the zzso of the zzso zzso during zzso
