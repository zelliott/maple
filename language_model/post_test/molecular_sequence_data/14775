Given that live zzso zzso is one of the major causes of zzso for aquatic products even in chill storage, the rapid and accurate detection process is the first zzso In the present study, a novel reverse zzso zzso zzso amplification zzso detecting zzso was developed by targeting internal transcribed zzso zzso sequence between zzso and zzso zzso At the same time, a new zzso zzso isolation strategy was also established by introducing a zzso tail to zzso during zzso synthesis zzso Under the optimal reaction time zzso zzso and temperature zzso zzso zzso zzso could be specially identified from a variety of other tested bacteria by zzso The sensitivity analysis showed that zzso could be identified as lower as zzso copies per reaction, which is over zzso higher than that of standard zzso zzso zzso zzso copies per zzso The method could be effectively identified zzso zzso in artificially contaminated or zzso fish samples with zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report using zzso zzso to detect live zzso zzso in zzso 

The study provided a rapid and accurate detection method for live bacteria in aquatic food and established a new zzso zzso isolation strategy at the same time, which will be useful for food zzso
