Members of the zzso zzso complex are associated with functional foods and dietary supplements because of zzso health benefits they impart to the zzso Many characteristics of these zzso are reported to be strain zzso zzso proper strain typing is essential for safety assessment and product zzso and also for monitoring strain integrity for industrial production zzso zzso strains of the zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso using two established methods and compared to a novel zzso sequence typing zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene with zzso and zzso successfully clustered 51 of the 52 strains into the six species zzso but it lacked zzso zzso Random amplified zzso DNA zzso zzso targeting the zzso sequence resulted in highly zzso profiles but lacked zzso In this study, an zzso scheme was developed using the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which identified 40 sequence types that successfully clustered all of the strains into the six zzso Analysis of the observed zzso suggests that zzso zzso within five of the seven zzso zzso have reached zzso a finding that emphasizes the highly diverse nature of the zzso zzso complex and our unconventional application of a typically zzso molecular typing zzso Our zzso results indicate that this method could be useful for characterization and strain discrimination of a zzso complex, with the potential for zzso expansion to a broader collection of zzso zzso
