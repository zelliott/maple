The slow zzso zzso mouse zzso is a zzso strain of zzso with the unique zzso of prolonged survival of the zzso zzso following zzso The zzso zzso is an 85 zzso tandem zzso on zzso mouse zzso zzso The dominant slow zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a hybrid gene within the zzso zzso a gene of previously unknown function, zzso and the zzso end of zzso factor zzso zzso It encodes an zzso fusion protein consisting of the zzso 70 zzso acids of zzso and zzso zzso acids derived from the zzso zzso We have identified the human zzso of zzso and mapped it to zzso zzso Additional zzso in zzso zzso signals indicate the presence of several zzso human zzso Northern zzso analysis shows two zzso widely expressed at varying levels in different human zzso The human zzso which encodes a protein of 279 zzso zzso has zzso zzso identity with the mouse zzso The derived human and mouse protein sequences share zzso zzso acid identity and zzso zzso acid zzso The human zzso and protein sequences are identical to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso We have also determined the zzso structure of the zzso which will facilitate the screening of these zzso for zzso in human neurodegenerative zzso
