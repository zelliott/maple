The effect of the zzso zzso on the electrical activity of the zzso zzso zzso cell was investigated using zzso zzso zzso and six structurally related zzso increased the zzso of the R cell in several distinct ways that could act in concert to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the cell leading to a barrage of action zzso This zzso was followed by a phase of rhythmical bursting that appeared intrinsic to the zzso zzso also broadened the plateau of the zzso action zzso The results suggest that the terminal zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso are critical for the activity of these zzso
