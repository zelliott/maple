The use of the zzso chain reaction in conjunction with zzso zzso has allowed the isolation of zzso clones derived from each of the zzso family zzso factors expressed in the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso In addition to the previously characterized zzso zzso and zzso factors, zzso cells have been shown by this means to express a novel zzso zzso This factor is closely related to zzso but differs at seven zzso acids in the zzso domain, one of which is located in a region which is critical for zzso interactions between different zzso zzso Like zzso the novel factor is expressed at high levels in embryonic brain and declines in abundance during zzso zzso In contrast to zzso however, it is absent in mature sensory zzso and its expression declines during the in zzso differentiation of zzso cells to a zzso zzso whilst zzso expression zzso The significance of these distinct but overlapping expression patterns is discussed in terms of the possible role of these two factors in regulating zzso gene zzso
