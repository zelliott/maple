The sequence and temperature effects on random zzso DNA carbon chemical shifts have been investigated using zzso zzso zzso zzso effect correction parameters have been determined for the aromatic zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The carbon chemical shifts of a specific zzso in a random zzso sequence have been shown to depend mainly on the type of its nearest zzso A carbon chemical shift database containing all 64 different types of triplets has been established for predicting random zzso DNA carbon chemical zzso The use of this zzso database for carbon chemical shift predictions shows good accuracy with experimental data, with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and correlation zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
