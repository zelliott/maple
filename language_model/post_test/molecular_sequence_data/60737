zzso of split zzso refers to a gene complex in zzso zzso which contains a number of target genes of the zzso signaling zzso The complex was originally identified by a dominant zzso zzso that displays zzso interactions with a zzso zzso in the zzso locus called split zzso The zzso zzso is characterized by smaller eyes with zzso spaced zzso and it is strongly enhanced by zzso This enhancement is correlated with a zzso of one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso causing an increased stability of the zzso transcripts and an altered zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso of a middle repetitive element in the adjacent zzso zzso gene was zzso In this work, three different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which have lost the ability to enhance zzso completely, were analyzed at the molecular zzso In each case, the structure of the zzso zzso protein was affected, suggesting a specific involvement of the zzso protein in the enhancement of the zzso zzso This hypothesis is supported by the finding that a perfect zzso of zzso enhancement can be achieved with hybrid zzso where the altered zzso of zzso was fused to other zzso zzso zzso Thus, the ability to interact with zzso is not restricted to zzso but instead can be induced by an appropriate zzso in other zzso zzso genes within the context of zzso In a zzso background, zzso behaves like a zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso protein has lost the ability of binding to the zzso zzso which is an essential feature for normal zzso zzso Yet, other protein zzso notably those with other zzso proteins of either zzso or zzso family, are still zzso These findings suggest that the structural changes associated with the zzso zzso protein are the primary cause for the zzso interactions with the zzso zzso zzso zzso
