zzso zzso from zzso expressed zzso are useful for functional and structural analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we developed a new method for the expression and zzso of zzso human zzso The human zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were expressed well in zzso coli cells, but the human zzso zzso gene was poorly zzso zzso we designed a new zzso zzso gene with zzso zzso for the zzso coli expression system and constructed the zzso gene by chemically zzso zzso The zzso human zzso were expressed as zzso proteins and were zzso by zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso in the presence of 6 M zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso by dialysis against buffer without zzso and the zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were removed by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso obtained by this method were confirmed to be zzso in zzso formation by the salt dialysis zzso The human zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains 28 minor zzso for zzso zzso A new zzso gene zzso for the zzso coli expression system was also constructed, and we found that the zzso zzso zzso protein formed a zzso structure with zzso zzso zzso and zzso
