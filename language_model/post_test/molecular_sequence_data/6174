We have investigated the role of an open reading frame upstream of and overlapping that coding for rabbit zzso zzso zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso initiating translation of the upstream open reading frame by zzso zzso (to an zzso zzso was assessed by a zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso repression with a zzso increase in expressed zzso zzso activity compared to zzso cells and in the absence of any increase in the level of zzso zzso zzso The upstream open reading frame may play a regulatory role in changing levels of expression of zzso zzso through a zzso control zzso
