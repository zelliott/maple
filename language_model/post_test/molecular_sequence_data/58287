We have characterized the dynamic nature of beta zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, the turnover of zzso zzso is rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to the turnover rate of the zzso protein itself zzso zzso 109 zzso 10 zzso This suggests that an equilibrium between the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso exists at resting zzso zzso of the zzso by the zzso zzso reduces the zzso of the beta zzso zzso zzso by zzso fold without affecting the turnover rate of the zzso zzso Upon sustained zzso this increased zzso turnover rate shifted the equilibrium toward the zzso form of the zzso suggesting that prolonged zzso either increases the rate of zzso or prevents zzso zzso zzso with the latter possibility, zzso of cells with zzso prior to zzso zzso reduced the incorporation of zzso into the beta zzso zzso by more than zzso This suggests a link between zzso zzso occurring upon sustained zzso stimulation and the decrease in zzso zzso Supporting this hypothesis, zzso of zzso zzso sites known to be involved in zzso zzso abolished the zzso reduction in zzso zzso We have previously reported that zzso of the beta zzso zzso is important in controlling zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 12, zzso Moffett, zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study now demonstrates that the zzso zzso state is regulated by zzso stimulation and suggests the existence of concerted zzso regulatory interactions between zzso and zzso upon sustained zzso zzso
