The gene zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and its complete zzso sequence was zzso The zzso structural gene consists of zzso zzso and encodes 484 zzso acid zzso The molecular weight of zzso was calculated to be zzso This value agreed well with the apparent molecular weight of 52,000 found for the zzso zzso from zzso zzso by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence zzso predicted by the zzso sequence exactly matched those of the zzso zzso both from zzso zzso and from cloned zzso coli zzso zzso with the exception of the removal of the zzso zzso processed after zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed almost the same zzso properties as the native zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso with zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso
