zzso species are important enteric pathogens causing disease in humans and zzso There is a lack of a good zzso test that can be used routinely to separate zzso zzso from other zzso zzso We produced zzso zzso zzso directed against the major outer membrane protein zzso of zzso zzso using zzso zzso as the zzso One zzso designated zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso was found to be potentially specific for zzso zzso zzso blots demonstrated that zzso reacted with all 29 zzso of zzso zzso tested but did not react with 2 zzso zzso zzso 26 other zzso zzso zzso and 19 zzso zzso Western zzso showed that zzso bound to a single protein band approximately 43 zzso in size, corresponding to the expected size of zzso zzso zzso The detection limit of zzso in a dot zzso zzso was determined to be about 5 zzso zzso zzso The zzso on the zzso was mapped to a region six zzso acids in length with the sequence zzso which is zzso zzso among zzso zzso strains but divergent in other zzso zzso a zzso search indicated that zzso of zzso zzso zzso will be able to be detected from zzso zzso based on the highly specific and zzso region of the zzso zzso The zzso is predicted to be located in a region that is exposed to the zzso zzso is a potentially specific and sensitive zzso that can be used for the specific detection and identification of zzso zzso
