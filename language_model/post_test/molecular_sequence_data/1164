A zzso library was constructed from zzso wild rice zzso zzso by suppression zzso zzso zzso in combination with mirror orientation selection zzso To distinguish between zzso expressed transcripts and false positive zzso DNA chips containing 960 random clones were applied as a form of reverse Northern zzso Based on the signal zzso and expression ratios obtained from experiments performed in zzso 371 clones were zzso zzso produced from the zzso library showed zzso zzso and zzso of all clones could be matched to the zzso zzso zzso zzso categorization placed the identified enriched genes in categories of zzso zzso zzso cell rescue and defense, and zzso These zzso resistance mechanisms could be used in investigations into the defense mechanisms of wild species, and to provide new routes to improving the zzso of cultivated zzso
