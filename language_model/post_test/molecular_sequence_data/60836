Tomato bushy stunt virus zzso zzso positioned between a modified cauliflower mosaic virus zzso promoter and the zzso delta virus zzso zzso with a downstream zzso zzso gene zzso zzso established infections upon zzso of plants with intact zzso Application of this methodology produced a zzso zzso gene zzso which yielded readily zzso levels of localized foreign gene expression in zzso zzso This is the first demonstration of an infectious DNA from a member of the zzso which permits rapid zzso zzso expression upon direct zzso of zzso DNA onto a variety of plant zzso
