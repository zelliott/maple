zzso zzso zzso zzso is a genetically zzso zzso disorder characterized by defective zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso disease is caused by abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso propulsion of zzso zzso contributes to male zzso zzso defects in most individuals affected by zzso cause zzso of zzso body zzso approximately half show zzso zzso or zzso zzso Almost 70 years after the zzso mouse possessing zzso zzso was described as a zzso zzso model, we report zzso zzso in zzso persons without zzso By zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso region zzso which contains zzso However, a nearly identical 360 zzso zzso segment zzso in zzso region zzso complicated zzso zzso In three affected German siblings linked to zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso that affect an evolutionary zzso zzso zzso site and that subsequently cause zzso spliced transcripts predicting premature protein termination in respiratory zzso Parallel zzso sequencing identified a zzso nonsense zzso zzso zzso zzso in six individuals from three zzso Island zzso families that all carried an zzso zzso shared zzso across zzso indicating an ancestral founder zzso in this isolated zzso We demonstrate by electron zzso zzso that, consistent with the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso respiratory zzso lack the zzso projection of the central pair zzso zzso similar findings were reported in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated markedly reduced beating zzso of respiratory zzso and stiff zzso zzso Like the zzso mouse model, all nine zzso persons had normal body composition because zzso zzso function is apparently not dependent on the function of the zzso zzso
