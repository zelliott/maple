zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which has been suggested to function as an zzso zzso in zzso zzso We report here the results of several experiments designed to further examine this zzso zzso zzso was unable to detect zzso zzso zzso transcripts in zzso extracted from normal or zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso expression is very low in normal and zzso zzso zzso qualitative and zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed on zzso zzso and revealed variable but significantly increased zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso relative to normal zzso To further examine the ability of normal human zzso zzso to express zzso zzso was extracted from rapidly zzso secondary NHK zzso zzso transcripts were nearly zzso by zzso in zzso grown in zzso zzso zzso but low levels could be induced by treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were strongly zzso after zzso treatment, suggesting that a zzso protein regulates zzso zzso levels in these zzso Finally, the zzso activity of zzso was examined in NHK under varying conditions of cell density and added growth zzso zzso did not stimulate high density zzso growth in the presence or absence of other growth factors, but did stimulate zzso growth in zzso growth factor zzso media at high zzso zzso or zzso 10 zzso The zzso effects of zzso but not of basic zzso growth factor, were zzso by zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
