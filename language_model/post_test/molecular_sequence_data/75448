Type VI collagen is a zzso composed of three zzso zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso By zzso screening of an expression zzso library, human zzso specific for each chain were isolated and zzso Major zzso species zzso these chains have a size of zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso clones were also used to map the genes on human zzso by zzso cell hybrid analysis and in zzso zzso The alpha 1 zzso and alpha zzso collagen genes were both located on zzso 21, in band zzso This represents a third example of a possible physical proximity of two collagen zzso The alpha zzso collagen gene was localized to zzso 2, in the region zzso The alpha zzso collagen gene is the fifth zzso zzso gene to be localized to zzso as four other zzso zzso zzso the alpha zzso and alpha zzso collagen zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso been previously mapped to the zzso region of the long arm of zzso zzso
