Two zzso zzso of the zzso floral zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso show zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso are expressed predominantly in flower zzso zzso produces two different zzso arising from differential zzso at an zzso the shorter zzso protein zzso from the longer sequence after zzso acid 197 and having a translation stop after zzso zzso This truncated protein includes both zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso expression of the zzso or either of the two zzso zzso in zzso driven by the zzso promoter produces effects similar to the corresponding zzso zzso causing plants to flower earlier, have shorter zzso and resemble the terminal flower zzso zzso
