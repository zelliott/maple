The presentation pathways followed by zzso zzso from the fusion protein of zzso virus were zzso By assessing the capacity of various zzso preparations to stimulate fusion zzso T cells, it was shown that the zzso contained within the fusion protein sequence zzso zzso relies on newly zzso zzso protein for its zzso By contrast, the zzso contained within the fusion protein sequence zzso zzso is captured by zzso protein recycled from the plasma zzso In zzso binding analyses showed that the zzso and zzso peptides zzso bind to zzso at pH 4 and pH 5, zzso In addition, it was found that binding of the zzso zzso to zzso is much poorer at pH 7 than at pH 4, while binding of the zzso zzso was decreased only moderately at pH 7 as compared with pH zzso zzso of the zzso acid 261 for an zzso in the zzso zzso resulted in an analogue with an improved capacity of binding to zzso at neutral zzso By contrast, replacement of the zzso 319 by a zzso acid in the zzso zzso generated an analogue with a decreased binding capacity at pH zzso These findings indicated that zzso that do not bear zzso zzso are captured efficiently by zzso molecules over a broader range of pH than zzso containing zzso zzso zzso analyses between zzso and four additional peptides further supported this zzso Altogether, these results suggested that zzso zzso by tuning the optimal pH for the assembly of zzso complexes, determine the processing zzso followed by the zzso
