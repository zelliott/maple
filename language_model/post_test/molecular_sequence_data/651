zzso interference zzso induced through double stranded zzso zzso has been used widely to study gene function in zzso Recently, it has been reported that gene zzso in several insects can be induced successfully through feeding with zzso However, it is still unknown whether zzso zzso of genes not expressed in the zzso occurs after zzso of insect zzso 

Using zzso zzso gene A zzso as the target zzso which is expressed in the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we showed that the growth and development of zzso zzso larvae fed zzso coli expressing zzso of zzso was zzso resulting in zzso In the 4th and 5th zzso zzso zzso and zzso the mean survival rates of insects fed the zzso diet were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The survival rates in the 5th zzso larvae, zzso and zzso stages were significantly lower than those of all controls, and significant zzso differences were also found between zzso treatment and zzso or zzso control in the 4th zzso zzso The effects of ingesting zzso expressed zzso on zzso of the target zzso tissue structure, and survival rates of insects were zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso zzso may be useful as a means of insect zzso zzso
