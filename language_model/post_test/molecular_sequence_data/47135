An approach for analyzing zzso zzso zzso zzso by liquid zzso mass zzso zzso is zzso Two zzso an zzso column and a porous zzso carbon column zzso were zzso zzso were zzso with linear zzso of zzso and water, with 5 zzso ammonium zzso or zzso buffers at a basic zzso The methods were evaluated on a mixture of zzso zzso zzso prepared from zzso zzso from pig zzso zzso from zzso of the mixture were compared with the structural information obtained by high energy collision fragmentation using fast atom zzso tandem mass zzso zzso The separation ability of the two columns was also tested using a more complex mixture of zzso zzso from pig zzso where several zzso were zzso The potential use of zzso zzso zzso zzso to gain sequence information of zzso zzso was also zzso The major zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were sufficient for assigning the zzso sequence and the position of the zzso group within the zzso zzso The zzso approach should be a valuable tool for characterization of zzso zzso and zzso during pathological zzso
