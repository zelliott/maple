Thirty samples of Italian zzso wheat zzso and whole zzso wheat zzso generally used for the production of Southern Italy's traditional zzso were subjected to zzso analysis in order to explore their zzso acid bacteria zzso diversity and to find strains with zzso zzso A total of 125 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were characterized by repetitive zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso leading to the identification of the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso results delineated 17 different patterns whose cluster analysis clearly differentiated zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso each characterized by a different zzso pattern, were screened for their zzso zzso They were grown in a zzso zzso comparable to a real food system, and the resulting zzso products zzso were tested against zzso species generally zzso bakery products, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results of the study indicated a strong zzso activity - comparable to that obtained with the common zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso - of ten zzso strains against the most widespread contaminant of bakery products, zzso zzso The screening also highlighted the unexplored zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1 zzso which inhibited all zzso strains to the same or a higher extent compared with calcium zzso The zzso products of these three strains were characterized by low pH values, and a high content of zzso and zzso zzso
