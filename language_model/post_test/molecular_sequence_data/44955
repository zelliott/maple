The zzso sequence of the gene zzso an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was determined by sequencing fragments amplified by the zzso zzso zzso The gene covering the start and stop zzso was amplified by zzso with two specific zzso which were designed from the sequence data determined by zzso An approximately zzso amplification product was cloned into the zzso zzso forming a zzso termed zzso An zzso that encodes the zzso composed of 324 zzso acids including a zzso signal zzso was zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso with that of an zzso zzso zzso showed 37% identity in a zzso zzso The optimal zzso sequence for zzso repression of zzso zzso was found upstream of the structural zzso In a culture of zzso coli zzso cells harboring zzso no zzso activity was zzso either zzso or zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso is not functional in this zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, production of zzso C was zzso by readily zzso zzso In contrast, productivity zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was increased about fourfold in the presence of zzso M zzso zzso in the culture zzso The zzso zzso seemed to be involved in the stimulation of zzso C production in this zzso
