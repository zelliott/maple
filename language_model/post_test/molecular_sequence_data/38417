zzso blocks within the core region were swapped among zzso zzso II promoters to explore effects on zzso in zzso The pair of blocks zzso zzso strongly influenced general transcription, with an additional effect on promoter zzso These zzso elements induced a change in the ratio of activated to zzso transcription, whereas swapping zzso and zzso sequences only altered general zzso zzso zzso the zzso blocks influenced binding by general zzso factors zzso and zzso The results suggest that the architecture of the extended core sequence is important in determining zzso effects on both general zzso levels and the tightness of zzso
