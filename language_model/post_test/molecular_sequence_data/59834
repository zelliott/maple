This work reports the isolation and structural characterization of zzso a zzso zzso zzso sequence from the zzso fungus zzso zzso Two open reading frames are found within zzso The first shows no similarity with known zzso The second encodes zzso stretches similar to the reverse zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso family of zzso zzso lacks long terminal repeats, having instead short (54 zzso terminal zzso zzso No target site zzso has been zzso A single copy of zzso was detected in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to this sole copy of zzso a cluster of various short sequence repeats, both direct and zzso is zzso These zzso which are reminiscent of zzso zzso zzso zzso are also represented in other regions of the zzso zzso zzso
