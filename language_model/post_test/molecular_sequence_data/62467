Genes zzso zzso and zzso of a putative protein zzso zzso from the enteric zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained and their zzso properties were zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso long with a molecular mass of zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso They showed zzso to zzso identity to and shared common signature zzso and repeats with those from other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso coli, formed a zzso and showed activity to transfer zzso using zzso as a donor to human zzso possessing a zzso zzso but not a zzso zzso possessing zzso Among a number of small zzso that belong to the Ras zzso from this zzso we identified zzso which possesses zzso at the C zzso as a sole zzso zzso for zzso This is in contrast to zzso zzso which zzso a variety of small zzso that possess a zzso zzso zzso where X is zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso also showed remarkable resistance against a variety of known zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that remarkable zzso differences in binding to zzso and zzso exist between zzso and zzso zzso which highlights this zzso as a novel target for the development of new zzso against zzso
