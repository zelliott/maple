Deciphering mechanisms involved in failure of self tolerance to zzso is a key issue in type 1 zzso We used zzso zzso mice lacking zzso to study the immune response to zzso In these mice, a T cell response was detected after zzso with several zzso peptides and confirmed by generating zzso zzso of some of these zzso by zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that two zzso can be generated from the naturally expressed zzso Although T cells from zzso mice responded to zzso zzso we could not detect a response to the naturally processed zzso in these zzso Moreover, after zzso with zzso whole zzso a T cell response was detected in zzso but not in zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso T cells are functionally eliminated in zzso zzso We used a transplantation model to evaluate the relevance of zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso transplanted in zzso mice zzso a zzso cell zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso was further increased by zzso with zzso zzso zzso expression thus shapes the immune response and prevents self zzso to the zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso an immune response to zzso in deficient zzso
