Recent advances are described for the isolation and affinity maturation of zzso that couple in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso cell display, replicating key aspects of the zzso immune zzso zzso is dependent on the action of the B cell specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso in non-B cells, combined with zzso display of a library of human zzso initially zzso to zzso can be used to isolate and affinity mature zzso via zzso cycles of zzso cell sorting zzso under increasingly stringent sort zzso zzso observed in zzso closely resembles zzso observed in human zzso in zzso in both zzso type and positioning in the zzso variable zzso In addition, existing zzso originating from mouse zzso in zzso based libraries, or alternative display technologies such as zzso can also be affinity matured in a similar zzso The display system has been developed to enable simultaneous high-level cell surface expression and zzso of the same protein through alternate zzso where the displayed protein zzso remains linked to zzso allowing soluble zzso zzso to be simultaneously characterized in zzso and zzso functional zzso This approach overcomes many of the previous limitations of zzso cell display, enabling direct selection and maturation of zzso as zzso zzso zzso
