zzso a protein widely zzso in zzso is involved in many cellular zzso including zzso While sequences zzso zzso proteins have not been identified in zzso zzso zzso so far, they have revealed the presence of structural and functional zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso This work describes the amplification and zzso analysis of a zzso DNA zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso displayed structural zzso to zzso proteins such as those of the zzso family and zzso zzso of the zzso DNA sequence in zzso coli cells yielded a zzso zzso that reacted with zzso zzso In addition, a putative open reading frame zzso zzso was identified in the recently zzso zzso of zzso zzso Together, these results evidence the presence in zzso of structural zzso of zzso related zzso
