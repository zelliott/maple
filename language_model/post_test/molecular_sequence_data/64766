zzso zzso are remarkably sensitive to zzso such as zzso which disrupt plant but not animal zzso To explore the basis of zzso action, we isolated 49 independent resistant zzso zzso lines after chemical zzso All 23 of the lines that we examined zzso single point zzso in zzso These point zzso were sufficient to zzso resistance when zzso into zzso zzso Several zzso were in the M or N zzso which coordinate zzso interactions in the zzso but most of the zzso were in the core of zzso zzso studies predict that zzso binds with an average affinity of 23 zzso to a site located beneath the N loop of zzso zzso This binding site included zzso that were zzso in several resistant zzso Moreover, parallel analysis of zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso did not interact with this site and had a significantly zzso zzso affinity for zzso zzso We propose that the zzso act through a novel zzso by zzso zzso loop zzso These compounds also represent the first class of drugs that act on zzso zzso
