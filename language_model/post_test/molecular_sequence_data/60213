A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in an zzso zzso zzso broth and was zzso to zzso This zzso has a molecular weight of zzso zzso as determined by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and its specific activity is 21 zzso for zzso zzso at pH zzso and 25 degrees zzso It has a ratio of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity occurs at pH 4 to zzso and 58 to 60 degrees C for zzso The N zzso of this zzso is zzso Internal fragments, obtained by zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso were then made based on the zzso sequence information, and the full-length gene sequence was zzso An expression zzso that contained the zzso zzso gene was used to transform a zzso zzso host zzso The transformed strain of zzso zzso expressed an active zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso produced two bands which had molecular weights greater than the molecular weight of the native zzso from zzso zzso Although the molecular weights of the native and zzso zzso zzso these zzso have very similar kinetic zzso
