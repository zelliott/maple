Experimental zzso zzso zzso is an animal model for zzso central nervous system disease zzso by zzso T zzso To examine the role of B cells in the induction of zzso we used zzso zzso mice rendered deficient in B cells by deletion of their zzso chain zzso region zzso By zzso zzso and zzso mice with the zzso zzso basic protein zzso zzso zzso we observed no difference in the onset or severity of disease in the absence of mature B zzso There was, however, a greater variation in disease zzso severity, and especially of recovery in the B zzso mice compared to zzso zzso mice rarely returned to normal in the absence of B zzso Taken together, our data suggest that B cells do not play a role in the zzso of zzso T cells, but may contribute to the immune zzso of acute zzso The mechanisms to explain these effects are zzso
