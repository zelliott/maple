zzso receptors can be modulated by zzso although these compounds do not directly activate or inhibit the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso in zzso receptors that contain a gamma zzso Here we have used zzso zzso zzso zzso clamp zzso and zzso modeling to probe the role of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of all of these zzso with Ala and/or a zzso with similar chemical properties to the wild type zzso decreased the level of zzso zzso and one zzso zzso resulted in its complete zzso None of the zzso changed the zzso zzso or the zzso binding zzso suggesting they do not affect zzso or zzso binding zzso we therefore propose that they are involved in the zzso zzso change that results in an increased response to zzso zzso models of the zzso binding pocket in zzso and zzso states suggest that the zzso is flexible and has different zzso in the two zzso Considering our data in relation to these models, we find that the zzso zzso could contribute to hydrogen bond networks and zzso interactions with neighboring zzso that change during zzso zzso
