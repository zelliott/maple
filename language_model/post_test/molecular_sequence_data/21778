A subset of familial Parkinson's disease zzso cases is associated with the presence of zzso point zzso in human zzso zzso including zzso Surprisingly, the human zzso zzso acid zzso is present in zzso zzso sequences of zzso including that expressed by mice zzso Because zzso causes zzso when expressed in zzso the zzso acid changes between the zzso human protein zzso and zzso might act as zzso zzso of zzso toxicity in the mouse zzso restoring its zzso structure and zzso The lack of structural information for zzso in zzso solution has prompted us to conduct a comparative molecular dynamics study of zzso zzso and zzso in water at 300 zzso The calculations are based on an ensemble of nuclear magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso turns out to be more flexible and less compact than zzso Its central zzso region, involved in zzso formation by the zzso is more zzso than that of the zzso zzso in agreement with nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The zzso of zzso is similar to that of the human zzso In addition, its zzso region is less zzso and more rigid than that of zzso All of these features may be caused by an increase in the level of zzso interactions on passing from zzso to zzso We conclude that the presence of zzso zzso in the mouse protein causes a significant change in the protein relative to zzso restoring features not too dissimilar to those of the human zzso
