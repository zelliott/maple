zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso present in many zzso either zzso or zzso which zzso zzso by reducing it to hydrogen zzso The reaction mechanism involves the zzso encounter of zzso with the reduced iron site and zzso formation of an zzso zzso that, upon zzso leads to the formation of hydrogen zzso By the end of this process, a zzso zzso coordinates the zzso zzso acting as a sixth zzso Although this zzso is able to shuttle zzso to the intermediate at low zzso it seems to have a minor relevance to the overall reduction zzso Nevertheless, this zzso is zzso in most zzso known thus far, with the notable exception of zzso from zzso zzso The protein of this zzso was cloned and zzso and its zzso characterization revealed distinct zzso properties in comparison with those of zzso zzso A three-dimensional model of this protein was generated in an effort to identify structural properties that could explain these distinct zzso Pulse zzso zzso showed that the efficiency of this zzso in reducing zzso is comparable to that of zzso zzso thus definitely ruling out the requirement for such a zzso in the reduction zzso
