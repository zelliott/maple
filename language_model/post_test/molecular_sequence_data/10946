Recently we zzso a 900 zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso and zzso cloned one of its zzso zzso a zzso zzso We now describe the molecular cloning and characterization of zzso a second zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is 50% identical to zzso and like it contains a zzso domain, a zzso zzso and a zzso Although zzso and zzso can undergo zzso interaction, they also interact with each other and the functional zzso complex contains both zzso The zzso activities of both zzso and zzso make essential contributions to zzso zzso and zzso zzso While the interactions between zzso and zzso may be zzso through their zzso zzso zzso their zzso motifs may be involved in interactions with essential regulatory zzso
