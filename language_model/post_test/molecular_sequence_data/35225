zzso a zzso from zzso belongs to the C1 family of zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be involved in many disease states and are valid therapeutic zzso zzso has a wide pH activity range and wide zzso zzso which makes it a good model system for studying zzso zzso 

The influence of inhibitor zzso binding on the zzso of zzso was examined by zzso zzso circular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso and molecular dynamics zzso 

zzso differences were observed in zzso mobility of zzso active and zzso zzso CD zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso revealed a difference in zzso between active and inhibited zzso zzso dynamics simulations showed that a loop defined by zzso zzso zzso had greater zzso mobility in the inhibited zzso than in the active zzso During MD simulations, the zzso bound inhibitor was found to change its zzso from extended to zzso with the zzso zzso approaching the zzso 

zzso mobility of zzso changes upon binding of the zzso leading to a sequence of events that enables water and zzso to zzso into a newly formed cavity of the inhibited zzso zzso zzso mobility of zzso a common inhibitor of zzso zzso found in many crystal structures stored in zzso was also zzso 

The analysis of structural changes which occur upon binding of an inhibitor to a zzso zzso provides a valuable starting point for the future design of therapeutic zzso
