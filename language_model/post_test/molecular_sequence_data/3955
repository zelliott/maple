We describe the isolation, zzso and characterization of human zzso a new zzso zzso zzso and its candidate zzso zzso zzso was isolated as a zzso zzso activity in rabbit lung and has an zzso zzso domain zzso to the zzso family of protein zzso zzso also contains a central domain with zzso to zzso a zzso zzso exchange factor for the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso prefers zzso over other zzso zzso has shared zzso requirements for zzso activity, and is capable of zzso and zzso zzso activity is not cell cycle zzso but like zzso levels are consistently higher in zzso zzso During the zzso of zzso a second protein zzso with zzso zzso This zzso zzso is a human zzso of the zzso protein zzso D, a zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso in zzso and the zzso proteins associate in zzso zzso zzso to zzso structures, and its zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso leads to dramatic reorganization of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso This may be indicative of a role for zzso and zzso associated with cell cycle independent zzso zzso
