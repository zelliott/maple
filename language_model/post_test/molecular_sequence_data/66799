There is increasing zzso evidence zzso a role for chronic infection in zzso and that microbial zzso zzso may contribute to this zzso zzso zzso is an agent of acute and chronic inflammatory disease in zzso and has been used extensively as a model for defining the mechanisms involved in arthritis and other inflammatory zzso We have zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a culture of a virulent strain of zzso zzso zzso similarly isolated from zzso mycoplasma medium was without zzso The activity of the zzso zzso was resistant to heat and to zzso with zzso K, but was susceptible to alkaline zzso and zzso zzso zzso profiles of normal zzso and that derived from mycoplasma were zzso Unlike the activity of other zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso component was dependent upon zzso a zzso for zzso Finally, we showed that zzso zzso prepared from zzso zzso grown in zzso medium and also from a zzso known zzso zzso of zzso zzso avidly bound to zzso zzso that separated out by zzso induced zzso and zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso is a key functional component of the zzso zzso cholesterol complex by scavenging and removing unwanted zzso Our finding that this zzso can acquire zzso properties from microbial zzso zzso suggests a novel mechanism zzso some microbial agents might reverse the protective role of zzso thus contributing to the genesis of zzso
