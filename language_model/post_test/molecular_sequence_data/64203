We recently used a differential display zzso screen to identify zzso and zzso proteins that are highly expressed in the developing rat zzso zzso a prominent zzso zzso nucleus used as a model for studies of zzso migration, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we describe cloning and characterization of one of these zzso now called zzso and a closely related zzso zzso zzso of the full-length coding region of zzso and zzso indicate that they zzso proteins that comprise a novel zzso of the zzso zzso and have a unique structural organization consisting of six zzso zzso zzso followed by a single zzso zzso zzso characterization demonstrates that zzso and zzso proteins are highly zzso and that zzso is zzso to the cell membrane by a zzso zzso The zzso are zzso expressed by zzso of zzso in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, including zzso of the zzso zzso inferior olive, zzso cerebral cortex, zzso bulb, spinal cord, and zzso root and zzso zzso Little or no zzso expression is detected outside of the nervous system of developing zzso The similarity of zzso to other zzso molecules and their zzso patterns of expression within restricted zzso zzso for example zzso zzso zzso and D1 spinal zzso suggest a role for these novel proteins in regulating zzso migration, as well as other aspects of neural development, including zzso zzso
