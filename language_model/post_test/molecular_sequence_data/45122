The zzso zzso of zzso zzso constitutes a specific tumor zzso zzso and a target for active zzso zzso results have been reported in phase II trials after zzso vaccination of zzso zzso patients during clinical zzso with zzso produced from zzso cell lines and coupled to an zzso carrier zzso We have developed a good manufacturing protocol for rapid expression of zzso vaccines as zzso zzso fragments in zzso zzso The objectives of this trial were to show safety and feasibility of zzso zzso with this vaccine and to investigate whether immune responses were induced by this zzso zzso Patients zzso zzso zzso with advanced zzso zzso received repetitive zzso zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mixed with zzso zzso in combination with 150 mug zzso zzso zzso factor zzso at the same zzso The patients' immune status was assessed by flow zzso of peripheral blood zzso and zzso zzso B zzso Cellular and zzso immune responses to the vaccine were assessed by zzso zzso and zzso Side effects of a total of 65 zzso were mild and did not affect the zzso zzso No patient developed zzso B surface zzso zzso after two zzso B zzso Of 17 zzso patients, five developed specific zzso zzso and eight developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was independent of the cellular immune status and was zzso specific as shown by statistical zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso and zzso mapping zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso with appropriate zzso may overcome profound clinical zzso and induce specific immune zzso
