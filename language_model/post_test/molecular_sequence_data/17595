zzso patterns of zzso and zzso were compared in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes zzso a major zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso while zzso is required for the synthesis of zzso an zzso frequently zzso by strains infecting zzso zzso zzso A possible zzso at the zzso level of these major zzso zzso was zzso The zzso and zzso genes showed inverse levels of promoter zzso The zzso promoter was active in zzso cells and inactive in zzso cells (in four out of five tested zzso while the zzso promoter was active in zzso cells and silent in zzso cells in all zzso When zzso a model strain for the analysis of control of the zzso system, was grown under conditions promoting zzso the zzso promoter was zzso whereas zzso zzso could not be zzso This effect was reversed when the cells were grown in a medium suppressing zzso zzso zzso of zzso a member of the zzso systems regulating zzso transcription, although abolishing zzso expression and rendering cells zzso did not alter the nature of the induction and repression patterns of zzso seen in the parental strain zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene and the zzso system are zzso regulated at a level parallel to or above the zzso zzso
