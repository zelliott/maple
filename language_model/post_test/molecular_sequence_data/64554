zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to inhibit zzso zzso at the zzso level and appear to mediate zzso dysfunction, including zzso symptoms in zzso syndrome zzso The precise zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso In this study, an active zzso approach to raise zzso with functional activity against the second zzso loop of the zzso was used and their functional properties were compared with those of human zzso zzso corresponding to the second zzso loop of the zzso were used as zzso in zzso and zzso were tested for zzso of zzso colon smooth muscle contraction in parallel with zzso G from a patient with zzso zzso zzso were affinity zzso on a zzso representing a dominant functional zzso at the zzso zzso of the second zzso loop of the zzso and tested for zzso zzso zzso raised zzso zzso like the human zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso of zzso colon zzso zzso activity was detected by functional zzso at zzso as low as 3 zzso which was below the threshold of detection of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso raised zzso zzso share the functional properties of zzso in patients with zzso
