We have used a zzso site selection zzso to determine a consensus binding sequence for the zzso zzso zzso A zzso fusion protein containing the zzso zzso domain was incubated with a pool of random sequence zzso and complexes were isolated by gel mobility shift zzso zzso selected sites were zzso by zzso sequencing and compiled to give a consensus zzso zzso This sequence is comprised of two zzso zzso zzso elements separated by a zzso zzso zzso similar to that described for the zzso response zzso zzso of the consensus revealed a slight preference for G or A zzso at the zzso position in the zzso and for A and T zzso in the zzso zzso zzso a series of zzso was designed in which the zzso and zzso zzso were changed to the least preferred zzso Competition experiments with these zzso and the zzso fusion protein indicated that an zzso with both the zzso and zzso sequences changed had greater than zzso less affinity than the consensus zzso The functional activity of these zzso was also assessed by placing them zzso of a reporter gene in a transient zzso zzso and correlated with the affinity with which the zzso fusion protein bound to zzso zzso sequences surrounding the two zzso zzso influence both the binding affinity for the zzso and the functional activity of the response zzso
