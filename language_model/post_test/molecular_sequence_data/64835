The zzso in generating zzso zzso due to impaired zzso zzso of zzso genes in the zzso center zzso is considered the major mechanism responsible for the compromised zzso responses in zzso Since the intrinsic capability of aged B zzso to respond to initial zzso stimuli is largely intact and the expression of zzso zzso zzso a key component required for zzso zzso zzso is comparable between B cells from aged and young mice, it is possible to restore the age-related zzso in the zzso response by zzso the requirement for signals from other immune zzso Here, we show that zzso B cells from aged mice during a memory response carried zzso zzso genes with zzso zzso comparable to that of zzso B cells from young zzso Additionally, characterization of zzso in zzso zzso and analysis of zzso cells and zzso demonstrated that the processes of zzso zzso selection and affinity maturation are largely intact in aged zzso Thus, we conclude that the diminished zzso responses in aged animals may be significantly improved by repeated zzso These findings may have important implications in designing vaccines and zzso protocols for the elderly population and patients with certain immune deficiencies such as zzso
