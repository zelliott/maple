zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso family 13, have been studied zzso but their zzso roles in microbes and evolutionary relationships with other zzso zzso remain zzso Here, we report the zzso properties of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso for the first zzso The primary structure and zzso properties of zzso were similar to those of zzso such as possession of an extra domain at its zzso and preference for CD over zzso zzso showed high zzso and optimal activity at 75 degrees C and 80 degrees C for zzso and soluble zzso zzso The zzso zzso exists as a high zzso in a solution and the zzso zzso was zzso into zzso and zzso mixture by a high concentration of zzso The zzso preference and zzso of zzso were significantly dependent on the zzso state of the zzso However, zzso exhibited distinguishable characteristics from those of bacterial zzso The zzso pattern of zzso was opposite to that of bacterial zzso zzso formed more zzso linked transfer product than zzso zzso Like as zzso notably, zzso has a longer zzso structure than those of other zzso zzso Our findings in this study suggest that zzso the zzso zzso shares characteristics of both bacterial zzso and zzso and locates in the middle of the evolutionary process between zzso and bacterial zzso
