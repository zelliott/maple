zzso responses to minor zzso zzso are zzso of zzso disease and organ graft zzso We previously identified a human minor zzso zzso that is recognized by zzso zzso T zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso 2 family, zzso zzso zzso zzso which is highly expressed in the liver, zzso and small zzso The zzso is presented by human zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of this minor zzso zzso results from differential protein expression in donor and recipient cells as a consequence of a zzso gene zzso 

An zzso zzso zzso clone was isolated from the same zzso stem cell transplant recipient that exhibited an zzso zzso zzso The minor zzso zzso recognized by the zzso clone was identified, and the ability of the zzso to be presented by zzso was zzso 

The zzso zzso clone recognized a zzso zzso by zzso which is identical to the zzso presented by zzso zzso binding zzso revealed this zzso zzso binds with comparable affinity to zzso as to zzso This patient had acute zzso disease involving liver and gastrointestinal zzso suggesting the zzso response directed against zzso is involved in zzso zzso 

A single zzso zzso by zzso can be presented by zzso zzso and zzso and may serve as an zzso minor zzso zzso in individuals with these zzso zzso that undergo transplantation of stem cells or organ zzso from zzso disparate zzso
