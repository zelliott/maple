We have previously described zzso zzso Sullivan and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell 47, zzso a set of zzso called zzso inducing zzso which cause zzso zzso by adjacent zzso repeats to occur by an abnormal kinetic zzso involving a large zzso region of zzso In this paper we apply statistical zzso DNA zzso melting theory to these zzso We find a marked correlation between the ability of sequences to zzso zzso zzso character zzso and their calculated propensity to undergo cooperative melting, and no exceptions have been zzso The correlations are both qualitative and zzso Thus the zzso zzso sequences behave as single melting units, while the DNA of the zzso zzso zzso exhibits no propensity to melt in the region of the zzso zzso The results of the calculations are also fully consistent with the following experimental zzso zzso the ability of the isolated zzso and zzso fragments of the zzso zzso zzso as well as the short sequence zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction by an A + T rich zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso the effect of changing sequences at a site 90 base pairs zzso removed from the zzso zzso zzso the effects of systematic deletion of the zzso zzso and zzso the effects of zzso of various sequences in between the zzso sequence and the zzso zzso zzso These studies show that zzso effects on zzso zzso as predicted from equilibrium zzso melting theory of linear DNA molecules may explain all the features that are revealed by studying the zzso of zzso in circular DNA molecules subjected to zzso zzso
