The zzso factor zzso activates the expression of numerous genes in response to zzso zzso zzso regulates gene expression both through solitary binding to independent recognition sites and, in cooperation with various zzso zzso factors, through targeting to composite response zzso The two zzso that make up the zzso zzso zzso and zzso possess identical zzso at positions that make zzso contacts to zzso This zzso leaves the protein with no apparent way of zzso itself uniquely on DNA by zzso recognizing its two zzso zzso Here, we have analyzed the orientation of the zzso zzso zzso domain on a zzso site, both alone and in the cooperative complex formed together with the zzso factor of activated T zzso zzso 

The results of affinity zzso experiments demonstrate that, in solution, the zzso zzso binds DNA as a mixture of two zzso zzso However, in the cooperative complex formed with zzso on a composite response element, the zzso zzso adopts a single orientation, with zzso and zzso bound to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso contacts are responsible for this zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate that, through zzso zzso one protein can force another to adopt a single zzso zzso Thus, cooperative interactions between adjacent regulatory proteins can influence not only the zzso of their interactions with DNA, but also their precise geometric and zzso zzso Because zzso zzso present markedly different structures to the zzso apparatus, it seems likely that orientation will exert an effect on the ability to activate zzso
