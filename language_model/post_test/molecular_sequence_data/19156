Identification of the zzso C virus zzso zzso isolate enabled the development of infectious zzso cell culture zzso However, the relatively low virus zzso and instability of some zzso zzso reporter viruses restricts some uses of this zzso We describe a zzso zzso reporter virus where the zzso zzso region was replaced with the zzso gene and adapted by serial passage in zzso zzso Six zzso zzso were zzso one each in zzso zzso and zzso plus three in the zzso zzso These zzso zzso increased the reporter virus zzso to zzso zzso zzso units zzso which is the highest zzso of zzso reporter virus reported to our zzso This zzso virus did not lose zzso expression following 40 days of passage and it can be used to test the activity of zzso zzso by measuring zzso zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, this reporter virus allows living infected zzso cells in zzso three-dimensional zzso cultures to be zzso and produces infectious viral particles in these zzso zzso The zzso zzso infectious zzso reporter virus described should enable new studies of the zzso life cycle in zzso cell cultures and will be useful in identifying zzso that interfere with zzso release or zzso
