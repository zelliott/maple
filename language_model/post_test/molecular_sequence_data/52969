zzso zzso of smooth muscle heavy zzso is activated by zzso of two regulatory light zzso one on each head zzso To understand zzso between heads, we examined the zzso of heavy zzso zzso with one zzso zzso zzso gizzard heavy zzso regulatory light chains were partially exchanged with zzso zzso zzso light zzso and zzso with one zzso head was isolated by zzso zzso In zzso zzso was zzso By zzso kinetic analysis, zzso zzso heavy zzso had a similar zzso value for zzso but a zzso value of approximately 50% of the fully zzso zzso However, single turnover analysis, which is not sensitive to small amounts of active heads, showed that zzso zzso heavy zzso was zzso times more active than zzso zzso but only zzso as active as the fully zzso zzso zzso between the single turnover and zzso values could be explained by a small fraction of rigor zzso These rigor heads would have a large effect on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of one head leads to a zzso with unique intermediate zzso suggesting that zzso of one head zzso alters the zzso of the partner head and vice zzso
