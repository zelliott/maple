We have identified in the zzso malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which have been implicated as zzso of zzso resistance in the latter zzso The sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso and zzso were first determined in the zzso clone zzso and found to be highly similar to those of zzso zzso For zzso there was a zzso sequence identity of zzso and zzso acid sequence identity of zzso within the predicted coding zzso For zzso the sequence identities were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sequences of the genes were then determined in three zzso zzso clones selected from clone AS which possessed three different levels of resistance to zzso The sequences of both genes in all zzso were found to be identical to those of the sensitive AS from which they had been zzso zzso sites were found in both genes between the AS clones and a genetically unrelated sensitive clone zzso Analysis of genetic crosses between zzso and resistant AS clones showed no linkage between inherited parental zzso of zzso and zzso and drug responses of the cloned zzso This showed that neither of these zzso nor genes closely linked to them, were zzso of the zzso resistance in the zzso zzso zzso
