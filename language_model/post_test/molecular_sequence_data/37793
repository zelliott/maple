By replacing two zzso zzso in zzso with zzso the three possible zzso related to the zzso zzso of a zzso were zzso in zzso manner exploiting the low zzso potential of the zzso zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso analysis of zzso analogue zzso with the natural zzso network confirmed the highly zzso character of the sulfur replacement with zzso despite its slightly larger atomic radius and increased bond zzso The comparative zzso analysis of the zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso links with wild type zzso clearly revealed retention of the main structural fold and thus the high propensity of these small molecules to adopt the secondary structure elements present in natural zzso These findings offered interesting hints for a better understanding of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that leads exclusively to the correct natural zzso
