The zzso predicted protein of zzso zzso is related structurally and functionally to zzso the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso in budding zzso zzso and zzso are most similar in their zzso which contain a zzso motif and a novel, zzso zzso zinc zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso shift zzso using zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso is required for initiation of DNA synthesis and for efficient progression through S zzso zzso zzso zzso a cell cycle checkpoint linking S and M zzso by segregating their zzso zzso This checkpoint zzso did not interfere with other checkpoints monitoring zzso assembly and DNA damage zzso zzso but did prevent zzso of a DNA replication zzso The division of zzso zzso was accelerated in cells lacking a component of the zzso complex zzso consistent with the involvement of zzso and zzso in separate checkpoint zzso A zzso deletion zzso DNA synthesis and checkpoint defects similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking as many as zzso zzso zzso acids supported zzso growth, but not asexual development, when zzso in a zzso zzso zzso However, the truncated zzso could not rescue a zzso zzso indicating that the C zzso is essential and suggesting some type of interaction among zzso zzso
