zzso are known to be important to the innate behavior of marine zzso zzso in zzso involves the long-distance zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are released from the zzso zzso during egg zzso Other zzso are predicted to act in concert with these zzso but their identities are zzso To identify additional zzso candidates, we employed differential library screening of an zzso zzso zzso library, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso contraction zzso and zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and encodes a novel protein that does not share significant sequence identity with any proteins in the zzso zzso analysis detected zzso transcripts in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso precursor has a signal zzso sequence followed by a predicted zzso protein sequence containing eight zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso mass zzso analyses demonstrated that mature zzso zzso was processed at a paired basic zzso site to generate an zzso and zzso protein zzso this was consistent with zzso observations on zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso contraction zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein induced zzso zzso whereas the zzso protein did zzso An zzso generated to the zzso protein was used for zzso and zzso analyses and demonstrated that this protein is present in zzso zzso zzso cells, egg cordons and egg zzso Overall, the data suggest that zzso may be processed in the zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso protein released during egg laying may serve a zzso function in concert with zzso zzso zzso and zzso
