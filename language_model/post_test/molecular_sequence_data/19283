zzso zzso growth zzso growth factor zzso Northern analysis demonstrated a novel zzso zzso zzso transcript in addition to the zzso zzso zzso full-length transcript present in zzso lung and liver zzso zzso zzso chain reaction screening of liver zzso suggests that the zzso zzso transcript lacks at least a portion of the zzso zzso zzso In light of these data, we have constructed a human zzso zzso zzso which lacks zzso zzso zzso the majority of the zzso zzso domain, while maintaining the zzso zzso site, zzso and zzso zzso 

The goal of this study is to characterize the ability of zzso to zzso stimulate cell proliferation and zzso determine whether zzso of zzso growth zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso is regulated by zzso mature zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso encodes zzso zzso of zzso 1 linked to zzso zzso of the zzso portion of zzso 3 through zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso in mouse zzso zzso resulted in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and cell proliferation in zzso but lacked the ability to bind zzso zzso Finally, zzso failed to zzso zzso and zzso zzso when expressed in normal rat kidney zzso 

These findings demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso form of zzso stimulates cell proliferation but lacks zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is zzso by zzso mature zzso binding to zzso zzso
