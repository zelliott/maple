The zzso small zzso are crucial proteins involved in regulation of signal zzso zzso from zzso stimuli to cell nucleus and zzso It has been reported that these zzso are directly associated with cardiovascular zzso In this context, we have searched for novel zzso of zzso zzso and here we describe zzso a new zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso encodes a 63 zzso protein containing a zzso zzso domain in tandem with a zzso zzso domain and is most closely related to the second zzso zzso domain of zzso Northern zzso and in zzso analysis have shown that zzso is mainly expressed in heart and zzso In zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso have shown that zzso specifically acts on zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso stress fiber formation in zzso and in zzso cardiac zzso Moreover, we show that zzso zzso of zzso in intact cells is dependent on the presence of the zzso zzso Using a specific zzso zzso we have detected the zzso protein by zzso in human heart and brain tissue zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso is located in the zzso zzso mainly constituted of cardiac zzso zzso Together, these results show that zzso is a zzso zzso that may play a key role in zzso zzso reorganization in different zzso especially in heart cellular zzso
