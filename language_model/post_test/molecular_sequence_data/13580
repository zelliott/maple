zzso of DNA synthesis is triggered by the binding of proteins to replication zzso However, little is known about the order in which specific proteins associate with origin sites during the cell zzso We show that in cycling cells there are at least two different zzso complexes at zzso A factor for inversion stimulation zzso zzso complex, present throughout the majority of the cell cycle, switches to an integration host factor zzso form as cells initiate DNA zzso zzso with binding of zzso zzso zzso binds to its previously unoccupied zzso zzso In stationary phase, a third zzso complex zzso zzso is absent and inactive zzso forms a zzso structure containing zzso that is not observed in cycling zzso We propose that interplay between zzso and zzso aids assembly of initiation zzso complexes during the cell cycle and blocks initiation at inappropriate zzso This exchange of components at replication origins is reminiscent of switching between zzso and zzso zzso states at zzso zzso
