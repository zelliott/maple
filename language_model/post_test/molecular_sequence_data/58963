zzso dominant zzso kidney disease zzso is a common disease and an important cause of zzso zzso It is characterized by considerable zzso zzso variation and focal zzso zzso To zzso the molecular basis for these zzso we have developed a novel method for zzso zzso zzso zzso from single zzso and have used it to show that individual zzso zzso in zzso are zzso Loss of zzso was discovered within a subset of zzso for two closely linked zzso markers located within the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that it was the normal zzso that was zzso This study provides a molecular explanation for the focal nature of zzso formation and a probable mechanism zzso zzso cause zzso The high rate at which zzso zzso must occur to account for the large number of zzso observed suggests that unique structural features of the zzso gene may be responsible for its zzso
