The zzso repeat family of zzso play important roles in the zzso of zzso and zzso Despite recent attention, their finer structural details and precise zzso mechanisms have yet to be zzso zzso zzso protein 1) is the major structural zzso of zzso repeat zzso from zzso zzso and plays an essential role in zzso zzso zzso and the early stages of dental plaque zzso Combining zzso high resolution structural studies with biological zzso we provide new structural insight into zzso by zzso We propose a model in which the zzso repeats of zzso zzso form an extended structure that projects the zzso zzso zzso away from the bacterial surface for zzso to the zzso zzso We also uncover a novel zzso zzso change that zzso zzso and likely plays a role in survival in zzso zzso
