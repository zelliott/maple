zzso zzso anemia and zzso zzso is a zzso disorder characterized by an infantile to early childhood onset of zzso zzso zzso and mild anemia with zzso and zzso A gene zzso an zzso cassette (ABC) zzso was mapped to zzso a region previously shown by linkage analysis to harbor the zzso zzso This zzso zzso is an zzso of the zzso zzso gene whose product zzso to the zzso inner membrane and is involved in iron zzso The full-length zzso zzso was cloned and the entire coding region screened for zzso in a zzso in which five male members zzso zzso An zzso zzso was identified in a predicted zzso segment of the zzso gene in patients with zzso The zzso was shown to segregate with the disease in the family and was not detected in at least 600 zzso of general population zzso Introduction of the corresponding zzso into the zzso zzso zzso gene resulted in a partial loss of function of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the human zzso zzso protein was able to complement zzso deletion in zzso These data indicate that zzso is the zzso gene of zzso and that zzso is a zzso disease caused by a zzso in the nuclear zzso
