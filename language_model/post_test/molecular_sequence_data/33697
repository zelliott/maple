zzso zzso are zzso packaged into zzso by zzso however they are regulated by the differences between zzso which establish various zzso zzso Local zzso cues direct the inheritance and propagation of zzso status via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange could potentially zzso zzso status if zzso exchange zzso such as zzso loaded zzso zzso into wrong zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso is required for loading zzso into specific sites, including the promoters of lowly expressed zzso However zzso zzso zzso has an extra zzso zzso which is a zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not disrupt the zzso zzso zzso or its ability to bind and load zzso into zzso however zzso was zzso found in the inner zzso and in zzso zzso zzso this zzso region not only lacks zzso but also shows zzso lower levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso than zzso and disproportionately contains the most lowly expressed genes during zzso growth, including many zzso zzso Genes within and adjacent to zzso zzso become zzso in the absence of either zzso zzso or paradoxically zzso zzso We also show that zzso is zzso zzso before, and zzso zzso after, loading into zzso and that it physically associates with the zzso zzso zzso However, we find a negative correlation between the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso remove zzso from zzso These data describe zzso action in zzso zzso and identify a new mode of zzso surveillance and maintenance based on negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso
