zzso zzso in zzso zzso seems to play a substantial role, particularly under stress zzso zzso Western zzso analyses were used to estimate the approximate numbers of zzso zzso molecules within a single zzso According to these numbers, the different zzso zzso do not seem to compete for the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed the predicted specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are rapidly zzso in zzso cells during permanent heat stress but remained almost stable in a zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso In particular, zzso appeared to be involved in the degradation of the short-lived zzso zzso indicating a negative zzso circuit for this particular zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso during exponential growth and heat shock revealed precise regulation of the synthesis of each zzso protein at the zzso level as well to meet the needs of zzso zzso
