The discovery of zzso zzso retinal zzso cells has overthrown the long-held belief that rods and cones are the exclusive retinal zzso zzso zzso retinal zzso cells use zzso as the zzso and mediate zzso visual functions such as zzso zzso In fish, in zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso is present in retinal horizontal zzso association zzso critical for creating the zzso receptive fields of visual zzso This raises the question of whether fish horizontal cells are zzso zzso This notion was examined previously in zzso roach zzso but all zzso light response disappeared after synaptic transmission was zzso making any conclusion difficult to zzso To examine this question directly, we have now recorded from single, acutely zzso horizontal cells from zzso and zzso We found that light induced a response in zzso cone horizontal cells, but not rod horizontal cells, consisting of a zzso of the zzso zzso calcium zzso The light response was extremely slow, lasting for many zzso Similar light responses were observed in a high percentage of goldfish horizontal zzso We have cloned two zzso genes and one zzso ancient zzso zzso gene from zzso In zzso zzso indicated that zzso but less likely VA zzso was expressed in the zzso layer of zzso zzso This intrinsic light response may serve to zzso over a long zzso lateral zzso zzso by these zzso Thus, at least in some zzso there are retinal zzso zzso involved primarily in zzso zzso
