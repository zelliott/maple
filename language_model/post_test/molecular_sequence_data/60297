A zzso library for zzso zzso was constructed to study the expression of specific zzso Four positive clones were identified using zzso against the zzso zzso products of the zzso as zzso zzso analysis showed that they contained identical zzso zzso of 606 zzso including a zzso zzso region of 96 zzso a core translated segment of zzso zzso and a zzso 3' zzso It zzso a novel zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso did not zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso A single copy only of its complementary sequence was found in the zzso of zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso expression system, the zzso was induced to express a zzso zzso protein which did not zzso with zzso and zzso zzso against zzso zzso heat shock zzso or four zzso species of zzso The zzso against the fusion protein recognized a zzso band from the zzso products of zzso zzso in zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso protein serum only recognized an zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and not in zzso zzso The protein can therefore serve as a specific zzso for the differential diagnosis of zzso
