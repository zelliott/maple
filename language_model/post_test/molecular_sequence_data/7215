zzso zzso can use zzso zzso as the sole source of zzso Two proteins with molecular masses of approximately 60 zzso zzso and 110 zzso have been shown to specifically bind zzso zzso from the zzso zzso three zzso from zzso zzso zzso 1, 5, and 7 have been identified and characterized by zzso sequence zzso Here we defined the zzso zzso of the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso 7 by zzso zzso random zzso and zzso spot zzso The zzso half of the zzso zzso which has only zzso zzso acid sequence identity among the three zzso was shown to be responsible for zzso binding by zzso zzso This result was confirmed by analysis of six random zzso with decreased zzso binding zzso The subsequent analysis of overlapping zzso peptides zzso the zzso half of the zzso zzso revealed three zzso of 13 or 14 zzso acids in length with zzso zzso They zzso or were very close to, point zzso decreasing zzso zzso The first and third zzso were unique to the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the sequence of the second domain was present in almost identical forms (12 of 14 zzso in the zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso in addition, a sequence consisting of functionally zzso zzso acids was present in the otherwise completely distinct small zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
