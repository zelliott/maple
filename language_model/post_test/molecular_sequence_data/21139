In this study, zzso sequencing and zzso zzso sequencing were used to analyze zzso of the zzso zzso zzso genes and the zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacteria zzso in six municipal wastewater treatment zzso The results showed that zzso zzso genes were quite diverse in different wastewater treatment plants while the zzso zzso genes were relatively zzso Based on the observed complexity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso most of the zzso can be assigned to the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso marina, and zzso zzso being the four most dominant zzso From the sequences of the zzso zzso zzso most zzso observed in this study belong to the zzso group, zzso the soil zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes were zzso by quantitative zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the results from the two approaches show some zzso they both indicated that the abundance of zzso in activated sludge was very zzso
