The zzso relationships among 30 zzso zzso wall zzso IV zzso strains and 12 strains belonging to allied zzso were examined by determining the zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso proteins of these zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso acids of zzso preparations revealed that the members of the zzso containing zzso zzso zzso form two zzso the first cluster contains the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the second cluster contains the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was placed in a zzso containing the zzso zzso The data showed that zzso zzso is closely related zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso clusters identified were entirely consistent with the proposal of zzso that the family zzso should zzso the zzso cell wall type IV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso exhibited zzso zzso acid sequence characteristics intermediate between those of zzso and those of typical zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were each a zzso that consisted of zzso coherent zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso that consist of zzso zzso related zzso In general, my results are consistent with previous zzso zzso sequencing results, but significant differences were also zzso My data, together with previous zzso sequencing data, show that zzso relationships among zzso can be determined by using markers other than the zzso gene zzso
