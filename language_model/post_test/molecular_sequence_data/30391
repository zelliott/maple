A synthetic DNA, carrying the coding sequence for zzso zzso the major basic protein of bull zzso was cloned into the zzso part of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso As a result of the zzso all zzso as well as zzso zzso are replaced by other zzso zzso In the fusion gene zzso of the resulting construct zzso the two proteins are linked through a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso led to production of fusion protein with a yield of approximately 50% of the total proteins zzso All zzso fusion protein was found within the zzso protein fraction and represented zzso of total proteins produced during zzso The fusion protein was subjected to zzso zzso zzso The overall yield of crude zzso with a purity of zzso was 10 zzso of zzso The crude zzso was further zzso by zzso affinity zzso zzso by protein chemical analysis indicated the identity of zzso zzso with authentic zzso zzso from bull zzso
