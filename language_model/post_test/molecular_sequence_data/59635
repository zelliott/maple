In contrast to conventional muscle zzso where two different light chains zzso stabilize the zzso regulatory domain zzso region of the head portion of the zzso unconventional zzso are a diverse group of zzso in which from one to six zzso zzso zzso are bound zzso to the zzso In both cases, the heavy chains of the zzso have special sequences called zzso zzso to which the zzso or zzso zzso A previously puzzling aspect of certain unconventional zzso is their unusual mode of regulation, where zzso of zzso occurs at low levels of zzso Although the atomic structure of the conventional muscle zzso zzso has been determined, no zzso structure of the zzso of an unconventional zzso is yet zzso 

We have constructed a model of zzso zzso bound to the first zzso motif present in the neck region of an unconventional zzso zzso brush border zzso zzso using strict binding rules derived from the crystal structure of the zzso zzso The model accounts for aspects of the regulation of many unconventional zzso where zzso is bound at low levels of zzso and released or changed in zzso at high levels of zzso The zzso changes as a function of zzso depend not only on the precise sequence of the zzso motifs but also on the interactions between zzso molecules bound to adjacent sites on the zzso heavy zzso 

According to our model, the full versatility of zzso binding to target peptides is displayed in the regulation of unconventional zzso At low zzso of zzso zzso binds in a manner similar to the zzso of conventional zzso At higher zzso zzso zzso changes zzso and acts as a switch to regulate the activity of the unconventional zzso zzso
