We found a variable number of tandem repeat zzso sequence with zzso repetitive units in the promoter region of a gene of unknown function on human zzso zzso zzso chain reaction amplification of this zzso sequence using zzso DNA from 80 unrelated individuals revealed two common zzso one with 10 zzso zzso zzso and the other with 14 zzso zzso zzso repetitive units, and two rare zzso with 22 zzso or 30 zzso repetitive zzso We investigated whether differences in the length of this zzso sequence would affect zzso activity of a zzso promoter by transient zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells derived from zzso The activity of the promoter was suppressed significantly when the zzso region was cloned upstream, in a manner dependent on the number of repeats present in the zzso zzso The results implied that this zzso zzso sequence might function as zzso regulator in zzso with differences in the number of repetitive units influencing efficiency of zzso of the gene lying zzso
