The purpose of this study was to identify genes that are zzso expressed in normal versus zzso human zzso cartilage as either potential novel therapeutic targets or diagnostic markers of this zzso 

zzso was isolated from zzso normal and zzso adult human zzso zzso The zzso Display technique was employed which identified zzso expressed genes in the normal and diseased zzso Northern and reverse Northern zzso were used to confirm the gene expression zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to zzso expression of zzso protein and zzso respectively in zzso 

A zzso factor, early growth response zzso zzso was found to be zzso more than zzso in multiple human zzso cartilage samples when compared to normal zzso zzso indicated that zzso was expressed throughout normal adult cartilage, in zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, in zzso cartilage there was expression of zzso zzso and protein only in the zzso undergoing zzso 

zzso is zzso expressed in zzso versus normal cartilage and because of its role in zzso zzso and repression and regulation of zzso differentiation and zzso zzso may play an important role in the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso may therefore provide a novel therapeutic approach for either the prevention or treatment of zzso
