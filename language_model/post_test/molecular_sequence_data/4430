We cloned and characterized the canine A3 zzso zzso zzso and examined zzso zzso of the zzso line of canine zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript is found predominantly in zzso zzso liver, and zzso and encodes a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso binds to two affinity states of canine zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and 16 zzso zzso zzso reflecting G zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bind with similar affinities to human, zzso and rabbit receptors but with zzso lower affinities to rat zzso Although canine zzso zzso cells contain zzso zzso and zzso zzso seems to be zzso primarily by zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not prevented by zzso toxin and is blocked by zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso an zzso zzso with low affinity zzso zzso 100 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso increases canine zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso these responses are antagonized zzso by zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso the cloned canine zzso is structurally and zzso more similar to human than to rat zzso zzso the zzso and not the zzso or zzso is principally responsible for zzso zzso of canine zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso cell zzso couples to both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso receptors play a major role in the regulation of zzso mast cell zzso multiple zzso zzso and G proteins may influence mast cell zzso
