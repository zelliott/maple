In response to DNA damage the zzso tumor zzso protein zzso accumulates in the nucleus of zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the minimal requirement for this reaction the cellular DNA was restricted by two alternative ways: zzso by zzso gamma 1, an zzso which causes zzso zzso DNA damage, as shown by zzso analysis of DNA unwinding and by zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA damage correlated with the nuclear zzso zzso In addition, restriction was generated zzso by the zzso introduction of the restriction zzso zzso which generates zzso DNA breaks, applying a mild zzso shock zzso zzso Previous zzso of linear or zzso zzso or zzso DNA, followed by zzso zzso lead to a dramatic increase in nuclear zzso zzso and zzso activity according to zzso mobility shift zzso The nature of zzso DNA was irrelevant for enhanced zzso The data suggest, that the cellular zzso response to DNA damage is zzso by zzso of zzso zzso
