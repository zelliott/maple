zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso has been shown to be very useful in the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso DNA zzso has a domain at the zzso zzso zzso 1 to zzso that has a zzso zzso activity and a domain at the zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso is classified into the pol I family which is represented by zzso coli DNA zzso zzso The alignment of zzso acid sequences for the zzso zzso zzso of the pol I family DNA zzso shows six highly zzso sequences called motifs A to zzso zzso C contains three positively charged zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso which might be involved in zzso In order to understand the function of those zzso they are zzso to zzso The zzso zzso activities of those zzso zzso zzso decreased by 80 to zzso thereby zzso that three positively charged zzso play certain roles in the zzso zzso zzso
