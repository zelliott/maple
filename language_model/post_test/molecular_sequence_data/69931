Selective enrichment has been used in a number of instances for the isolation of zzso sequences in zzso This paper reports the successful application of the technique to zzso zzso zzso were derived to the target species zzso zzso and zzso zzso The method involves the zzso of zzso zzso DNA prepared from the closely related species zzso zzso and its zzso to zzso sequences in the target zzso zzso molecules were removed from the reaction by incubation with zzso followed by zzso zzso leaving a preparation enriched for target zzso All DNA fragments isolated in the zzso zzso experiments proved to be specific to that zzso Five out of zzso fragments screened in the zzso zzso experiments were specific when screened with zzso DNA and zzso DNA from its sibling species, zzso zzso
