The underlying causes of type I zzso disorders of zzso zzso I) have been shown to be zzso in genes zzso proteins involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that is required for protein zzso Here we describe a zzso I patient displaying gastrointestinal problems but no central nervous system zzso zzso from this patient accumulate mainly zzso but in the presence of zzso an zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso suggesting inefficient addition of the second zzso zzso onto zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed the cells from the patient to possess only zzso normal amounts of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso this zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA revealed zzso 4 to contain a base deletion in one zzso and a base zzso in the zzso Both zzso give rise to premature stop zzso predicted to generate severely truncated zzso but because the translation inhibitor zzso was shown to stabilize the zzso zzso from the patient to normal levels, it is likely that both transcripts undergo zzso zzso zzso As the cells from the patient were successfully zzso with wild type zzso zzso we conclude that these zzso are the underlying cause of this new zzso I zzso that we propose be called zzso zzso
