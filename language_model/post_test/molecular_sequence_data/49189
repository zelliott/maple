zzso zzso zzso express two zzso of the type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Type zzso has previously been cloned and zzso Here, we report the cloning of the zzso transcript from zzso zzso its zzso and its functional zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in a specific zzso zzso amplification of zzso ends yielded a product that contained typical zzso characteristics such as a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso Several approaches were unsuccessful at cloning the zzso end of the zzso products lacked an zzso start zzso The missing information was obtained from an zzso zzso zzso number zzso The combined clone displayed a high degree of zzso with published type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were raised against a zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso mapping revealed zzso expression of both zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso The novel clone was expressed in zzso and function was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The function of the new zzso clone was found to be significantly different from zzso despite strong structural zzso zzso was found to be strongly zzso sensitive, with higher affinities for both sodium and zzso than zzso Also, zzso was significantly less sensitive to external pH than zzso The strong structural similarity but divergent function makes these zzso zzso ideal models for the molecular mapping of functionally important regions in the type II zzso zzso
