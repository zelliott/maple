The zzso family of zzso zzso are important regulators of zzso timing and cell differentiation and are often zzso in human zzso In zzso zzso zzso controls cell fate transitions from zzso stage 4 zzso to adulthood by zzso zzso zzso 41 zzso and zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts are zzso in the zzso yet little is known about what controls this zzso zzso We sought factors that either turn on zzso zzso or keep it zzso until the correct zzso Here we report that one of zzso targets, the zzso factor zzso 1 zzso is responsible for zzso the zzso of zzso in specific zzso until the zzso zzso is a known zzso timing regulator and zzso adult development in zzso zzso zzso one important function of zzso in maintaining zzso stage fates is zzso of zzso Indeed, our results reveal zzso as the first known target of the zzso zzso factor in zzso zzso and suggest a negative feedback loop mechanism for zzso and zzso zzso
