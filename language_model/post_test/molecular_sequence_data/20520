zzso protein alpha zzso is a zzso membrane zzso that interacts with the membrane protein zzso a marker of zzso We have solved the structure of the complete zzso portion of zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso to zzso A zzso These data, together with previous data on the zzso domain and its zzso zzso zzso a single zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso interaction will span a distance of around 14 zzso between interacting cells, comparable with that of an zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain mediates binding to zzso and the two others are found to be constant zzso zzso zzso zzso are restricted to proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso major zzso complex zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso 2 and 3) are structurally more similar to zzso zzso than any cell surface protein not involved in zzso zzso This strengthens the suggestion from sequence analysis that zzso is zzso closely related to zzso recognition zzso
