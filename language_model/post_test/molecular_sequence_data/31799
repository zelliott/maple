zzso of the zzso zzso produce zzso which affects millions people around the zzso zzso the molecular characteristics of the zzso can increase the knowledge about the mechanisms underlying disease development and zzso Thus, the study of the molecular features of zzso has been considered of particular interest because zzso does not zzso the zzso during zzso and, consequently, a different role for these proteins in the biology of the zzso can be zzso Furthermore, the sequence zzso in the zzso and in the zzso zzso of the zzso core zzso convert them in potential diagnostic and/or zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso that are selected in zzso by their affinity and specificity for the target as a consequence of the particular zzso structure that they are able to acquire depending on their zzso Development of zzso molecules with the ability to recognize specifically zzso zzso is essential for the progress of this kind of zzso Two zzso which specifically recognize zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned from a previously obtained zzso enriched zzso These zzso were zzso and subjected to an in zzso zzso zzso slot zzso and Western zzso were performed to establish zzso affinity and specificity for zzso zzso and zzso zzso using peptides corresponding to overlapped sequences of zzso were made mapping the zzso zzso As zzso of zzso zzso were used to determine the number of zzso in an zzso platform and to purify zzso from complex zzso The zzso showed different secondary structures among zzso however, both of them were able to recognize the same peptides located in a side of the zzso In addition, we demonstrate that these zzso are useful for zzso identification and also may be of potential application as diagnostic system and as a laboratory tool with zzso zzso
