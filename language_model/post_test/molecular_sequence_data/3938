zzso is an animal zzso zzso that cycles between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso complex and appears to act as a cargo zzso for a subset of soluble zzso exported from the zzso We have determined the crystal structure of the zzso recognition domain zzso of zzso the rat zzso of human zzso to zzso A zzso The fold and zzso binding site are most similar to those of zzso zzso The structure also resembles that of the zzso of the zzso folding zzso zzso and the zzso a family of zzso proteins expressed on zzso The zzso comprises one zzso and one convex zzso packed into a zzso The zzso binding site resides in a zzso charged zzso formed by zzso zzso A large surface patch of zzso zzso with a putative role in zzso interactions and zzso lies on the opposite side of the zzso binding zzso Together with previous functional data, the structure defines a new and expanding class of zzso animal zzso and provides a starting point for the understanding of zzso sorting between the zzso and the zzso
