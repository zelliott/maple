zzso zzso protein zzso zzso regulate cell polarity as well as proliferation and are activated by the zzso zzso zzso In the present study we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso in zzso and interact with the zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso of zzso and zzso whereas zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso the removal of zzso chains from zzso zzso but not from a zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso attached to zzso and zzso are linked by zzso and/or zzso rather than the more common zzso We find that zzso and other zzso zzso are also zzso in zzso We identified zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and find that these are zzso and not zzso at their zzso zzso targeted by zzso when expressed in cells, suggesting that zzso may inhibit these zzso The results of the present study demonstrate that zzso and zzso are zzso of zzso and provide the first evidence that zzso family zzso are regulated by unusual zzso zzso zzso
