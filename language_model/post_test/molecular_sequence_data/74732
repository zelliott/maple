A bacterial strain designated zzso was isolated from zzso fluid of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the isolate forms a separate branch within the family zzso with zzso as the closest related zzso Within this zzso the closest related species is zzso zzso with zzso % similarity to the sequence of the type zzso The isolate has zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso by polar and zzso zzso zzso zzso central or zzso spores are formed in zzso zzso The strain is zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso whereas zzso starch and gelatin were zzso Growth was supported by many carbohydrates as carbon zzso zzso zzso displayed a zzso profile consisting of zzso zzso an unknown zzso two unknown zzso and an unknown zzso zzso was the zzso zzso and zzso 0 was the major fatty zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso including zzso of carbon sources and zzso production commonly used for zzso within the family zzso showed that strain zzso belongs to a new zzso within this family, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
