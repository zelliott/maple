A recent systematic study of zzso zzso fragments has clearly shown that biological activity resides in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso retains more than zzso of the potency of the full zzso We now examined the effect of replacement of zzso 1 through 11 by either their zzso or by zzso in zzso zzso were zzso using zzso solid phase methodology, zzso by zzso and zzso for their ability to zzso bound zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso and to induce zzso zzso rabbit zzso zzso The negative zzso of the concentration zzso 50% of the zzso zzso or producing 50% of the zzso zzso response zzso was zzso All compounds were still full zzso A reduction in potency of more than two log units was seen for the compounds in which zzso 1 zzso 4 zzso and 7 zzso were replaced by Ala and zzso 3 zzso 4 zzso and 6 zzso by their zzso The largest drop was noted for the zzso zzso at position zzso For all compounds there was an almost perfect correlation between the zzso and the zzso values zzso zzso zzso although the zzso was consistently zzso These results show that the biological activity of zzso is mainly determined by the first seven zzso The zzso consists of the aromatic rings from zzso and zzso and the zzso side chains from zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso may stabilize the zzso zzso
