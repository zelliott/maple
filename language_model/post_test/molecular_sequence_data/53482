Recently, we cloned the human zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and established its map location to zzso zzso a region previously implicated in bipolar zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be inhibited by lithium, an effective therapeutic agent for bipolar disorder, zzso is a plausible zzso and functional candidate zzso To permit comprehensive screening for zzso we characterized the zzso structure and isolated the potential promoter of zzso The gene was found to zzso eight zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso region did not contain an obvious zzso box but multiple potential binding sites for zzso and consensus motifs for zzso and other zzso factors were zzso zzso of the coding region and zzso junctions in unrelated bipolar disorder patients detected novel zzso A zzso zzso in zzso 2, zzso was found in one zzso zzso is zzso zzso and replacement with zzso introduces a potential site for zzso The other zzso included an zzso zzso zzso and a T zzso C silent zzso in the third zzso of zzso 53 in zzso zzso By zzso exact test the silent zzso showed a trend for association zzso zzso zzso with bipolar disorder suggesting that further scrutiny of this gene is zzso
