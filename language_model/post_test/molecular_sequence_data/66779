zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and shares the highest sequence identity and functional similarity with zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso to zzso zzso gel zzso indicated that the protein exists in solution predominantly as a zzso The zzso pH rate profile indicates zzso activity over a broad pH zzso The zzso kinetic zzso determined for a rapid equilibrium ordered kinetic mechanism with zzso binding first zzso zzso 140 zzso 40 zzso are zzso zzso 105 zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are competitive zzso with Ki values of zzso zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso 1 zzso and 210 zzso 10 zzso zzso Three zzso crystal structures have been determined, that of a zzso zzso the zzso bound to zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso bound to zzso and zzso zzso The complex with the inhibitor was obtained by zzso whereas that with the zzso was obtained by briefly soaking zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso prior to flash zzso The zzso structure resembles that of the other members of the zzso zzso and is most similar to the functionally related zzso zzso Each zzso of the zzso of zzso exhibits an zzso barrel fold with the eighth zzso swapped between two molecules of the zzso Both zzso and zzso are anchored to the active site by zzso The loop capping the active site is zzso in all three structures, in contrast to zzso where the equivalent loop adopts an open or zzso zzso in the zzso state but sequesters the inhibitor from zzso in the bound zzso Crystal packing may have favored the open zzso of zzso even when the zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso alignment of zzso with other zzso members revealed two pairs of zzso or conservatively replaced zzso that anchor the flexible gating zzso The proposed zzso zzso mechanism is analogous to that of zzso but includes zzso of a water zzso with the loop zzso zzso
