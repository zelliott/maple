The purpose of this study was to develop a zzso zzso zzso probe in order to examine the zzso zzso zzso expression in major zzso from the zzso zzso The reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was conducted to develop the zzso zzso zzso probe using total zzso extracted from liver of zzso zzso The zzso product was zzso into the zzso zzso zzso Madison, zzso and subjected to restriction zzso treatments and DNA zzso Northern zzso analysis was conducted using total zzso extracted from samples zzso 200 zzso of liver, zzso zzso and whole adrenal tissue that were collected from pigs on day 3 zzso zzso 2) or day 40 zzso zzso 2) zzso A 500 zzso partial zzso zzso zzso zzso 166 zzso acids and had 83, 78, and zzso zzso to a zzso sequence of zzso from zzso human, and zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence of the partial zzso zzso showed 77, 62, 60, and 51% zzso to zzso human, zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso An approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected only in the liver zzso In conclusion, the development of a partial zzso zzso for zzso makes it possible to study the zzso and the regulation of zzso synthesis at the molecular level and, based on zzso examined in this study, the liver appears to be the primary source of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
