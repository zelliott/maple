zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso which recognize zzso chains containing zzso acid zzso linked zzso to penultimate zzso zzso In the present investigation, zzso clones zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso library constructed from zzso zzso zzso seeds and zzso From the reading frame of the cloned zzso zzso was predicted to be composed of zzso zzso acid zzso and showed strong similarity to zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso most zzso acid zzso involved in zzso were previously shown to be zzso However, in both zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be zzso by zzso and zzso acid, zzso zzso were made at position 105 and/or 135 of zzso to examine the roles of zzso acid zzso zzso to be important in binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso with zzso zzso with zzso and/or zzso zzso with zzso did not bind to zzso acid zzso This indicates that these characteristic zzso are important in zzso acid zzso
