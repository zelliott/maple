The zzso soil zzso zzso zzso generally regarded as an zzso grows under strict zzso conditions using nitrate as an electron zzso and should be designated as a zzso zzso Growth experiments demonstrated a lag phase of 24 to 36 hours after the shift from zzso to the onset of zzso respiratory zzso zzso adapted cells grew without further lag phase after their transfer to fresh zzso growth zzso The cells change their zzso from rods to longer zzso structures when moved from zzso to zzso respiratory growth zzso Surprisingly, zzso grown zzso zzso lost the capacity for zzso An investigation of the molecular basis of the switch between zzso and zzso growth was initiated by the cloning of the genes zzso the respiratory nitrate zzso from zzso zzso zzso deduced from zzso zzso acid sequence regions of zzso respiratory nitrate zzso and related zzso were used for the isolation of the zzso Four open reading frames with significant zzso to the zzso coli respiratory nitrate zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated and termed zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso totally abolished nitrate zzso
