Here, we report the first zzso analysis of rice defense response induced by zzso zzso an agricultural chemical that has been widely used to protect rice plants from rice blast and the bacterial blight zzso zzso gel zzso zzso was zzso to identify a total of 40 protein spots including 9 protein spots that are zzso by zzso and 31 abundant protein zzso A total of 11 unique proteins from these 9 spots were identified by zzso and the majority of them were classified and/or possessed zzso in zzso zzso Five protein spots with only one protein species identified in each spot appear to be zzso zzso They are a putative zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso acid zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso However, the other six protein species identified from the remaining four protein spots could not be zzso described as zzso proteins due to either the zzso of two protein species in one spot or the presence of one protein species in two zzso Through real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso it was determined that PAL zzso is likely regulated at the protein level, whereas zzso and zzso were regulated at the zzso level after zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso transcripts of two PAL zzso were found to be zzso by zzso We propose that zzso zzso and zzso are likely to zzso zzso disease resistance via such functions as zzso and transport of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso
