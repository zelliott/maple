zzso beta zzso zzso is a natural zzso normally released into the zzso fluid zzso that plays a key role in Alzheimer's zzso The conversion of the zzso from a native soluble form to a non-native and often zzso form, such as small and large zzso zzso and zzso of zzso appears to be implicated in the zzso of zzso Although the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso are not fully zzso a large body of data suggests that the primary target of zzso peptides is the cell membrane of zzso that may zzso the structural and functional conversion of zzso into zzso involved in pathological zzso In our study, we provide a systematic investigation of zzso ability to incorporate and form zzso events in zzso of different zzso composition and focus on cholesterol and its zzso zzso We propose that cholesterol and its zzso products can be considered zzso factors because a) by zzso zzso zzso into zzso the zzso balance shifts toward zzso b) by shifting channel selectivity toward zzso the membrane potential is moved far from the threshold of membrane zzso thus decreasing the influx of calcium into the zzso
