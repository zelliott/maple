zzso is a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso is more active compared with the zzso zzso it has been shown to be effective in zzso burn patients by decreasing cardiac work, protein zzso and zzso While gene expression profiles have recently been reported in children receiving zzso treatment, variations from one individual to another may have influenced the data zzso Using zzso zzso zzso analysis, we report here the first study of protein profile in vascular smooth muscle cells incubated separately with the two zzso of zzso Four types of cellular proteins including zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and those involved in DNA zzso translation displayed zzso The higher protein level of a number of zzso involved in cellular zzso and zzso activity in cells incubated with the zzso as revealed by zzso was further supported by real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso the increase in the anabolic activity associated with the higher level of zzso zzso was also supported by the higher zzso concentration of the zzso zzso zzso which was a result of an increased zzso of zzso Our findings therefore provide molecular evidence on zzso effect associated with zzso zzso The zzso zzso identified in our study may in turn be useful targets for future pharmaceutical interventions to reduce clinical side effects following zzso zzso
