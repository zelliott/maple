zzso proteins are zzso signal zzso for a number of immune zzso zzso Specifically, zzso interacts with members of the zzso zzso zzso and connects the receptors to downstream signaling zzso It has been assumed that zzso is a zzso zzso like zzso and mediates zzso zzso of zzso a zzso pivotal in zzso zzso zzso Here we report the crystal structure of the zzso and the first zinc finger zzso of zzso We show that the zzso zzso structure is very different from the known zzso zzso zzso The differences are zzso including zzso acid differences at the critical zzso site, local zzso differences, and a unique zzso zzso between the zzso domain and the first zinc finger in zzso These structural differences prevent zzso from interacting with zzso and other related zzso via zzso clash and zzso zzso Our structural observation should prompt a zzso of the role of zzso in zzso signaling and may indicate that zzso proteins such as zzso may be the zzso zzso for zzso zzso
