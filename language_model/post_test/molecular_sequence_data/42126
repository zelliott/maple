The zzso virus zzso III zzso has been identified previously as the major viral component binding to a zzso zzso on the surface of target zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso contains three regions corresponding to consensus sequences for zzso zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso to 141 of zzso bound zzso in a dot zzso zzso In contrast, a synthetic zzso derived from zzso acids zzso of zzso did not bind zzso We therefore conclude that the region containing zzso acid zzso is involved in binding to the zzso cellular zzso
