zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso pathogen of small zzso zzso zzso possesses merits of zzso zzso zzso automation and ease of zzso but has not been used for detection of zzso to the best of our zzso In this study, a real-time zzso zzso was developed for detection and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso probe were designed based on the zzso zzso No zzso were observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Xinjiang zzso Analytic sensitivity results revealed that real-time zzso could detect as few as 10 copies of the zzso zzso The performance of real-time zzso was assessed by testing 254 blood samples from zzso and comparing with the results from conventional zzso This demonstrated that the real-time zzso zzso was significantly more sensitive than conventional zzso Our results indicated that real-time zzso is a useful approach for detecting zzso infections and has potential as an alternative tool for ecological and zzso surveillance of zzso zzso
