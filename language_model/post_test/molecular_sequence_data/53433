We have constructed a series of zzso expression zzso that permit the rapid conversion of single chain zzso zzso zzso fragments, derived from zzso zzso display libraries, into intact fully human zzso zzso zzso of each zzso As a model, a zzso zzso specific for sheep red blood cells zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso display library, and used to produce human zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso protein sequence analysis of zzso zzso heavy zzso and light zzso chains revealed precise zzso removal of the leader zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso human zzso demonstrated that properly zzso molecules of the correct molecular size were zzso The zzso and zzso zzso retained zzso activity, zzso with different zzso zzso and induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso in a pattern consistent with the zzso zzso H chain zzso We conclude that in zzso produced zzso human zzso constructed from zzso display zzso zzso fragments mirror their natural counterparts and may represent a source of zzso for use in human zzso
