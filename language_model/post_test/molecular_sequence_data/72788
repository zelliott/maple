zzso proteins zzso by the larger DNA viruses interact with a wide spectrum of immune zzso molecules that regulate the zzso response in the infected zzso Here we show that certain zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso virus, zzso virus zzso zzso zzso virus, and zzso virus, express a new family of zzso proteins which interact with members of both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso However, zzso virus and zzso virus zzso zzso do not express this activity Using a zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso proteins were identified as zzso members of this family of zzso binding zzso Members of this zzso family of zzso proteins share multiple stretches of identical sequence zzso including eight zzso zzso zzso but are otherwise unrelated to any cellular genes in the zzso The affinity of the zzso zzso zzso interaction with zzso was assessed by zzso analysis and yielded a zzso of approximately 73 zzso In rabbits infected with a zzso zzso virus, in which the zzso gene is deleted, there was an increased number of zzso zzso in the deep zzso during the early zzso of zzso These observations suggest that members of the zzso class of zzso viral proteins bind multiple members of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso the influx of inflammatory cells into zzso zzso in zzso
