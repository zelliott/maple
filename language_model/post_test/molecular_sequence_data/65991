A full-length zzso of a zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso library of the local Egyptian cattle tick zzso zzso The zzso zzso cloned zzso was zzso and showed an open reading frame zzso a protein of 223 zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence with zzso from other species revealed that the sequence is closely related to the zzso zzso zzso The cloned gene was expressed in zzso coli under zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso under native zzso The zzso zzso appeared as a single band on zzso zzso and has a molecular weight of zzso zzso including the zzso tag of the zzso The zzso zzso was zzso upon the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso showed high level of activity even in the presence of the zzso region on its zzso end and showed maximum activity at pH zzso The zzso values for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso The over expressed zzso showed high activity toward zzso zzso zzso zzso and less toward zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity on zzso zzso sharing this property with zzso belonging to the zzso alpha zzso zzso values for zzso blue and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, sharing this property with the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso protein zzso whole zzso larvae, gut, zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso were also detected in other tick species as zzso zzso and zzso zzso while in zzso zzso zzso zzso could not be zzso
