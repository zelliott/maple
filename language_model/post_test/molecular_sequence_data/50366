An zzso is presented for the accurate and rapid generation of multiple protein sequence alignments from zzso structure zzso A preliminary multiple sequence alignment is performed using sequence information, which then determines an initial zzso of the zzso A structure comparison zzso is applied to all pairs of proteins in the superimposed set and a similarity tree zzso Multiple sequence alignments are then generated by following the tree from the branches to the zzso At each zzso of the tree, a zzso sequence alignment and coordinate transformations are zzso with the multiple alignment of all structures output at the zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of Multiple zzso is shown to give alignments in good agreement with published structural accounts within the zzso fold zzso zzso and zzso zzso In order to reduce the need for visual zzso two similarity zzso are introduced to determine the quality of each generated structural zzso zzso zzso the global structural similarity between pairs or groups of zzso whereas zzso provides a zzso measure of the confidence in the alignment of each zzso zzso alignments have the quality of each alignment characterized by zzso and zzso values and thus provide a zzso resource for studies of zzso conservation within structural zzso
