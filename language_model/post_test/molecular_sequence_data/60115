A series of four zzso zzso derivatives was used to investigate drug binding to the zzso response element zzso zzso The drugs, which are active against the zzso zzso pathogen zzso differ by the nature of the terminal basic side zzso zzso zzso is more potent at zzso binding of the zzso protein to zzso than zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso studies using the zzso gene stimulation zzso zzso entirely agree with the in zzso gel mobility shift zzso The capacity of the drugs to antagonize zzso binding zzso with their zzso binding properties determined by melting temperature and zzso protection zzso zzso studies indicate that the zzso region of zzso provides the identity element for the zzso Access of the drugs to the major groove cavity at the zzso zzso depends on the bulk of the zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso show that the zzso of zzso is critical for drug binding but also reveal that the fit of the drugs into the major groove cavity of zzso does not involve specific contacts with the highly zzso zzso zzso or the C zzso zzso base zzso The binding essentially involves shape zzso The results are also discussed with respect to the known activity of the drug against zzso which is the major cause of mortality in AIDS zzso This study provides guidelines for future development of zzso zzso zzso
