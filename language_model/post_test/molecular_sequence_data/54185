The isolation and results of zzso and functional analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso more than zzso zzso exhibited zzso organization and protein sequence likeness to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An unusually high zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proteins were predicted to possess at least one zzso domain, a value much higher than the average of zzso zzso zzso proteins determined from a data set of zzso zzso protein zzso Genome organization and protein sequence comparisons place zzso zzso as the first zzso member of the large zzso zzso zzso which had the broadest host range among the four zzso was not closely related to any zzso or zzso in the database, and only 23 of 105 predicted zzso proteins could be assigned a functional zzso Because of the relationship of zzso to zzso it was anticipated that these zzso should exhibit some of the features characteristic of zzso zzso that were identified as shared by the zzso zzso and zzso include the prevalent zzso zzso and the presence of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Application of zzso zzso to zzso amended with a host strain of zzso zzso reduced zzso bacterial zzso suggesting that zzso may be useful in limiting zzso zzso load in the environment while zzso are susceptible to zzso
