The molecular functions of several zzso are well characterized zzso by analysis of zzso zzso zzso However, their significance in the physiology of water transport in zzso organisms remains zzso The tobacco plasma membrane zzso zzso was used to zzso this zzso By comparing zzso plants that were inhibited in zzso expression with control plants, we found evidence for zzso function in cellular and zzso water zzso The consequences of a decrease in cellular water zzso were determined by measurement of zzso rate and stem and leaf water potential as well as growth experiments under extreme soil water zzso Plants impaired in zzso expression showed reduced root zzso zzso and lower water stress zzso In conclusion, our results emphasize the importance of zzso zzso water transport in zzso water zzso
