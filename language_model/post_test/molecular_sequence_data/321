The purpose of this study was to zzso the molecular bases of the zzso of the B zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso classified by zzso focusing into its three zzso major zzso 

By genetic sequencing and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso length zzso zzso a zzso change was identified in zzso K for the zzso major zzso zzso A transcript containing the novel zzso zzso was detected by reverse zzso zzso using zzso cell lines with this zzso The exclusive existence of a novel zzso zzso in a zzso of zzso was also detected by zzso zzso zzso time of flight mass zzso The zzso zzso had a zzso 15 zzso longer than the other zzso containing two additional basic zzso acids and one extra zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso substitution created an efficient zzso zzso AG zzso which resulted in zzso alternative zzso in zzso zzso When compared with zzso the third major zzso zzso had an zzso change in zzso III, converting zzso to zzso and a rare zzso zzso had an zzso change in zzso zzso converting zzso to zzso 

We found an extremely rare event of complete zzso alternative zzso for zzso The zzso zzso had a distinct zzso zzso while the zzso and zzso zzso had zzso to zzso and zzso to Val zzso respectively, which led to differential zzso points of these zzso Such variations in the zzso acid sequence of zzso may have profound effects on its zzso relationship, plasma zzso levels, and disease zzso
