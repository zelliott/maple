zzso unstable transcripts zzso are widely distributed in the zzso of zzso zzso These zzso generally derive from zzso regions of the zzso and are zzso rapidly and efficiently by the nuclear zzso via a zzso that involves zzso zzso by a new zzso zzso borne by the zzso zzso What is the share of significant information that is encrypted in zzso and what zzso a zzso from other Pol II transcripts are unclear to zzso Here we report the dissection of the molecular mechanism that leads to degradation of a model zzso zzso We show that the zzso pathway, involved in zzso termination of zzso is required, albeit not zzso for efficient degradation of zzso zzso and at least a subset of other zzso Our results suggest an important role for the zzso zzso in the control of gene expression throughout the zzso
