zzso protein zzso is the only known constituent of the agents (called zzso that cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases in animals and zzso zzso derives from a host protein zzso by a single copy gene having three known zzso in mice, cattle and sheep but only two zzso in zzso and zzso We have identified and zzso the missing zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The new zzso zzso zzso is zzso identical to mouse zzso 2 and zzso identical to zzso 2 from cattle and zzso zzso zzso containing the new zzso 2 zzso were expressed in the zzso frontal zzso and zzso of normal zzso at approximately zzso to approximately 50% of the levels of the zzso without zzso 2 zzso zzso of zzso zzso was increased in the zzso beginning 49 days after zzso with zzso zzso and reached a level zzso times normal by day zzso Increased expression of zzso zzso in the zzso correlated with expression of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was not significantly increased in the zzso or the frontal zzso during the zzso Our study shows that zzso 2 plays a role in regulating the cellular expression of zzso zzso and suggests that zzso may be zzso expressed in zzso zzso
