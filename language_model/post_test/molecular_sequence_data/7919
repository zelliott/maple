zzso III of zzso zzso zzso A zzso the transfer of zzso from zzso to a modified zzso zzso of zzso factor 2 in zzso cells, thus zzso zzso factor zzso This domain III is inactive in the intact toxin but is active in the isolated zzso We report here the zzso crystal structure of this isolated domain zzso in the presence of zzso and compare it with the corresponding structure in the intact zzso zzso zzso zzso We observe a significant zzso difference in the active site region from zzso to zzso Contacts with part of domain II in the intact toxin prevent the adoption of the isolated domain zzso and provide a structural explanation for the observed zzso Additional electron density in the active site region zzso to separate zzso and zzso and indicates that the zzso has been zzso The structure has been compared with the zzso domain of the diphtheria zzso which was zzso with zzso
