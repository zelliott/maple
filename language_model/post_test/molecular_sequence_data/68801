zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso The compound inhibited zzso zzso zzso with a Ki of zzso zzso The zzso constant versus human zzso D and human zzso E was 4 zzso Human zzso and zzso were inhibited with zzso of 8 and 500 zzso respectively, and human zzso was inhibited with a Ki of 190 zzso The replication of zzso zzso and zzso was inhibited with a zzso effective dose of zzso zzso in acutely infected zzso zzso The 50% zzso dose was 100 zzso Similar zzso activity was observed when the compound was added up to 10 h after zzso At the effective zzso processing of zzso precursor protein zzso was greatly reduced, confirming an action on the late stage of the virus life cycle, as zzso The efficacy of the inhibitor was also demonstrated by using primary human peripheral blood zzso infected with the zzso strain, zzso clinical zzso obtained from zzso individuals (including a zzso zzso and zzso In these cells, zzso zzso delayed the onset of zzso replication in a zzso fashion zzso effects with zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso as long as the inhibitor was maintained in the zzso zzso zzso was orally zzso in zzso zzso in plasma zzso in excess of the in zzso zzso zzso effective dose could be sustained for several hours after oral application of 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso has the potential to be a zzso useful zzso agent for the treatment of zzso
