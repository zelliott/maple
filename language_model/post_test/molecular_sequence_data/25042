Two novel genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are reported from the snail zzso zzso a prominent intermediate host of the human zzso zzso zzso They resemble other zzso zzso genes that zzso zzso proteins zzso but differ in that they zzso proteins with two zzso arranged zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins that increase in abundance following exposure to a zzso zzso zzso zzso and that bind to and zzso zzso zzso Within each zzso the two zzso regions are dissimilar from one zzso the zzso zzso domain is zzso by a single zzso whereas the downstream zzso domain is zzso by three zzso For both zzso 3 and 7, the zzso domain belongs to the variable zzso type, whereas the zzso domain is not easily classified with respect to zzso zzso The zzso region in both genes is relatively zzso and lacks zzso zzso exhibits extensive variation in the zzso zzso A ratio of zzso versus synonymous zzso of zzso suggests that this region is under positive zzso A zzso zzso identifiable as zzso but lacking an zzso was also found, further suggestive of zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso are hypothesized to function in zzso recognition, the identification of additional novel zzso genes as part of a growing gene family in zzso zzso is of zzso Such zzso particularly given their variable nature, serve as a model to study the complexity of zzso defense zzso
