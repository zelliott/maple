zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a 32 zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene in zzso and zzso the formation of zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in the zzso degradation zzso via zzso leading to the de zzso zzso of zzso zzso and clearing the zzso zzso To improve our understanding of the specificity of the zzso zzso and the course of events associated with zzso we have determined the crystal structures of the zzso and zzso bound forms with the zzso zzso and zzso This reveals that the zzso folds in a manner similar to that of various zzso forms which are approximately zzso identical in zzso In addition, the structure of the zzso complex is zzso by zzso and the zzso analogue zzso bound to the active zzso These results allow insight into the kinetic mechanism of zzso and provide an understanding of structural diversity in the active site of the zzso zzso zzso when compared to zzso zzso
