There have been two recent reports suggesting that zzso zzso can be distinguished from alpha zzso by circular zzso The zzso feature is stated to be a zzso ratio zzso distinctly smaller than zzso This has been reported for a zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso systems of zzso zzso length with modest fractional zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso We report here the changes in the CD spectrum produced by inserting zzso acid zzso zzso into the zzso domain of human pancreatic zzso In order to examine this effect at comparable net fractional zzso CD zzso were measured for each species during the course of a zzso zzso by zzso zzso The addition of five zzso zzso gave results of particular zzso At low net fractional zzso this zzso system displays a diminished zzso zzso 208 zzso zzso strength versus the less zzso zzso However, zzso data and comparisons of CD difference zzso suggest that zzso extension of the short zzso zzso is in the form of an alpha zzso Given the diminished intensity of the minimum at 208 zzso at low net zzso when zzso zzso should zzso we urge extreme caution in using a zzso ratio smaller than unity as a diagnostic for zzso zzso
