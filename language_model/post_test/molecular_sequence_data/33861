zzso zzso are zzso zzso bacteria from dog's mouth that cause rare but dramatic zzso in zzso zzso zzso have the unusual property to feed on cultured zzso cells, including zzso by harvesting the zzso zzso of cellular zzso To understand the mechanism behind this unusual property, the zzso of strain zzso was zzso and zzso In addition, zzso bacteria were cultivated onto zzso zzso cells and the surface zzso was zzso The zzso was found to zzso many zzso zzso within 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso typical of the zzso zzso zzso zzso surface exposed feeding complexes resembling the zzso starch zzso system zzso The products of at least nine zzso were detected among the surface zzso and eight of them represented more than half of the total peptides detected from the surface zzso zzso deletions of the 13 zzso revealed that half of these zzso complexes contributed to growth on animal zzso The complex zzso by zzso one of the most abundant ones, was involved in zzso zzso from zzso It was essential for growth on cells and contributed to survival in zzso It thus represents a fitness factor during zzso
