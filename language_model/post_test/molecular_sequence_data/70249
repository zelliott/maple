We have examined the structure and expression of the products associated with the zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso The zzso 13 gene zzso is identified as a member of the fork head domain family of zzso factors characterized by a zzso DNA binding zzso zzso chain reaction analysis demonstrates that a zzso zzso zzso transcript is expressed in all eight zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments detect the predicted fusion zzso These findings indicate that the zzso generates a potentially zzso fusion zzso factor consisting of intact zzso DNA binding zzso a truncated fork head DNA binding domain and zzso zzso zzso
