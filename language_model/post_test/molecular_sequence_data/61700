Several zzso of zzso zzso produce the zzso zzso zzso which contains an unusual zzso acid, the zzso zzso acid called zzso acid zzso which is zzso linked to a zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, by an zzso zzso The region of the zzso zzso gene cluster proposed to be responsible for zzso zzso was zzso and errors in previously deposited zzso sequences were zzso These efforts allowed overproduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso protein and overproduction of zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso in zzso coli as a zzso zzso both proteins were in an zzso active zzso zzso analysis of zzso indicated that there were two zzso an zzso domain (A zzso and a zzso domain zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso showed that the A domain of zzso zzso the conversion of zzso zzso acids and zzso into the corresponding zzso zzso with a kinetic preference for zzso Additional experiments demonstrated that the T domain of zzso which is zzso modified with a zzso group, zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso to produce an zzso zzso zzso This zzso species was detected by zzso zzso with zzso and zzso followed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso It is zzso that the zzso zzso zzso to zzso serves as the zzso for additional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso that catalyze zzso ring formation, which is followed by zzso zzso yielding free zzso The availability of zzso active zzso should facilitate zzso of the details of the subsequent steps in the formation of this novel zzso zzso zzso
