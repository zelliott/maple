The fundamental role of the light zzso zzso in visual function and zzso cell development has been widely zzso Proper trafficking of zzso to the zzso membrane is of great zzso In human, zzso in zzso involving its zzso zzso are the most frequent cause of zzso dominant zzso zzso a degenerative retinal pathology characterized by progressive zzso zzso is widely used as an animal model in visual and retinal zzso zzso So far, little is known about the requirements for proper zzso targeting in zzso 

Different truncated zzso zzso zzso were expressed in the eyes of zzso and their zzso was analyzed in zzso or by zzso A zzso lacking the last 23 zzso acids was found to properly zzso in the zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This constitutes a major difference to trafficking in zzso which involves a zzso zzso motif at the very zzso Further zzso of zzso indicated that proper zzso requires the last zzso acid zzso of a region called zzso 8 following directly the last zzso zzso Interestingly, the very zzso of zzso visual zzso is extremely variable but zzso 8 shows zzso zzso acid zzso that are not zzso in zzso zzso 

Despite impressive similarities in the folding and zzso of zzso and zzso visual zzso a striking difference exists between zzso and fly zzso in their requirements for proper zzso Most importantly, the zzso part of zzso 8 plays a central role in zzso Since the last zzso acid zzso of zzso 8 are zzso for zzso folding and function, we propose that this domain zzso in the recognition of targeting factors involved in transport to the zzso
