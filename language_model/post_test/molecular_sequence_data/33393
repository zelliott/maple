The formation of harmful zzso zzso zzso by zzso has been correlated with the nitrogen load in coastal zzso zzso is implicated as an important factor in the initiation and maintenance of zzso zzso To characterize the cellular response to zzso zzso was used to compare protein expressions from zzso grown under nitrogen depleted and nitrogen replete zzso A total of 17 zzso expressed protein spots were found, nine of which showed a roughly zzso decrease in zzso zzso Five of these nine spots were all identified as zzso of the zzso Form II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while an additional four protein spots with a molecular weight of 50 zzso were identified as zzso of a novel protein named zzso protein 50 zzso zzso was located in the zzso as shown by the presence of an zzso zzso targeting leader sequence and by zzso zzso of both zzso II and zzso decrease sharply between 24 and 36 h following nitrogen depletion and the decrease can be blocked if the N source is replenished before degradation zzso Both proteins are rapidly zzso if the nitrogen source is replenished after degradation has zzso These results are a first step in the dissection of the behavior of the zzso zzso under nitrogen stress conditions and may provide new insights into the relationship between zzso zzso and the nitrogen zzso
