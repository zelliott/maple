zzso of the gene zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined zzso for 122 healthy controls and 106 lung cancer patients using zzso I restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis, together with a combination of two recently published zzso chain reaction zzso based zzso Three different zzso zzso of the zzso gene were zzso zzso comprised zzso and zzso of the total zzso in the controls and in the lung cancer patients, zzso had zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso had zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Only 17 of the 24 44 zzso zzso I zzso zzso were confirmed as defective zzso carrying the zzso in zzso zzso whereas all four 15 + 9 zzso zzso I zzso contained the zzso zzso Out of the 122 healthy controls, seven subjects zzso were detected as poor zzso zzso of zzso by the presence of two defective zzso whereas only one PM zzso was found in the lung cancer patient group zzso The reliability of this analysis was confirmed in a zzso of the control subjects zzso by zzso where a perfect correlation between zzso zzso and zzso was zzso We observed no significant difference in the zzso zzso between lung cancer patients with a history of heavy smoking and those who smoked zzso However, statistical analysis showed a significant difference zzso zzso zzso in distribution of the zzso zzso between lung cancer patients zzso and healthy controls zzso This data thus supports the hypothesis that there is an increased risk of lung cancer for individuals who are extensive zzso of zzso
