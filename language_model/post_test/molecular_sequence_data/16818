zzso syndrome zzso is a severe zzso disorder caused, in most classic cases, by zzso in the zzso zzso protein 2 gene zzso A large degree of zzso variation has been observed in patients with zzso both those with and without zzso zzso We describe a family consisting of a zzso with a zzso that showed considerable overlap with that of zzso her identical twin sister with zzso disorder and zzso intellectual zzso and a brother with profound intellectual disability and zzso No zzso zzso zzso were found in this family, and the zzso region that contains the zzso gene was not shared by the affected zzso Three other candidate regions were identified by zzso zzso including zzso zzso at zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso zzso at zzso between zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso both of which are located within the zzso region, were zzso in the affected family members, and a deletion of zzso 183 of the coding sequence zzso was identified in zzso in the affected family zzso In a screen of 44 zzso cases, a single zzso zzso zzso was identified in a girl with a severe zzso overlapping zzso In the mouse brain, zzso expression zzso is not identical zzso of zzso and its expression is unaffected by the loss of zzso These findings confirm zzso as another locus associated with zzso and zzso mental zzso These results also suggest that zzso in zzso can lead to a clinical zzso that zzso zzso However, it remains to be determined whether zzso zzso are more prevalent in specific clinical zzso of zzso or in other clinical zzso
