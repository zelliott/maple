Members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso various zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso until now, the only zzso zzso zzso that has been characterized is zzso of zzso zzso zzso the first zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that contains mainly zzso linkages together with zzso and zzso zzso Recently, partial sequences of zzso genes were detected in other members of the zzso zzso This paper reports, for the first time, isolation and characterization of zzso and zzso genes and zzso from various zzso species and the characterization of the zzso products zzso which mainly have zzso and zzso zzso The four zzso zzso characterized from three different zzso zzso strains are highly similar at the zzso acid level, and consequently their protein structures are very zzso Interestingly, these four zzso zzso zzso have relatively large zzso variable regions, containing zzso repeats, and relatively short putative zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The three other zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain smaller variable regions and larger putative zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
