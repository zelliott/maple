The zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso is zzso zzso in cells, but the zzso of this zzso and the zzso responsible for it have not been zzso We show here that the primary site of zzso zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells is zzso and that the zzso of zzso is near 1 zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso that recognize the sequence zzso at the zzso zzso of target zzso and thus we examined the possibility that zzso containing this motif might associate with and zzso zzso zzso experiments and zzso studies revealed that zzso binds with high affinity to a zzso zzso of the G zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso which zzso in the motif zzso zzso does not associate with zzso or zzso alternatively spliced zzso that differ from zzso at their extreme zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently on zzso in zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso do zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cell zzso is sensitive to treatments that alter the activity of zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso interaction and that zzso is the zzso in zzso cells responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso
