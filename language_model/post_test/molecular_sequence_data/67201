zzso zzso zzso is a zzso involved in cancer progression and tissue zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso we identified nuclear zzso of zzso in several cultured cell types and in human liver tissue zzso Western zzso analysis of nuclear extracts revealed two zzso forms of zzso at 35 and 45 zzso with the zzso form exhibiting zzso zzso By transient zzso we expressed active zzso fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso zzso into the zzso A functional nuclear zzso signal was demonstrated by the loss of nuclear zzso after zzso zzso of a putative nuclear zzso signal and by the ability of the zzso nuclear zzso signal to drive a zzso protein into the zzso Finally, expression by Chinese zzso zzso cells of zzso induced a twofold increase of zzso rate, compared with zzso which does not zzso to the zzso Increased zzso was abolished by zzso zzso of the zzso site of zzso or by using the zzso inhibitor zzso This study zzso for the first time the mechanisms of nuclear zzso of a zzso and shows that nuclear zzso can induce zzso via its zzso zzso
