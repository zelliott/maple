zzso zzso proteins function as a family of zzso that bind zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso family zzso receptors on human host zzso In order to define the zzso binding domain on zzso zzso we tested the binding properties of a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso producing zzso and zzso zzso proteins with zzso in one or more of the four zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso domain, present in the first loop, was completely zzso for zzso zzso In contrast, the two zzso zzso regions present in the second and third zzso were essential for zzso deletion of either domain resulted in loss of zzso zzso zzso of the fourth loop resulted in a severe decrease in zzso expression at the cell surface and could therefore not be tested for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing combinations of zzso regions derived from different zzso binding zzso zzso lost most of their zzso binding zzso Some zzso zzso gained zzso binding zzso Together, our results indicate that full recognition of zzso receptors by zzso proteins requires a highly coordinate interplay between both zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso regions may result in novel zzso zzso binding zzso
