Three G zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso have been described by molecular zzso Using a similar sequence that we found in the expressed sequence tag data base, we cloned and characterized of a fourth, high zzso rat brain zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso cells were zzso with zzso and G protein zzso prepared zzso showed zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso binding with an zzso of 90 zzso In a rat zzso zzso cell line that exhibits modest zzso responses to zzso zzso this zzso zzso inhibited zzso rises in zzso by greater than zzso when the cells were zzso with zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso This response is blocked fully by prior treatment of cultures with zzso zzso thus implicating signaling through zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso exhibit a calcium response to zzso zzso after injection of zzso zzso but only when zzso are zzso with zzso zzso protein zzso zzso from zzso and zzso cell cultures expressing zzso exhibited high affinity zzso zzso 2 zzso binding for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso and throughout adult rat brain where in zzso zzso revealed it to be associated with white zzso Together our data demonstrate that zzso is a high affinity zzso zzso zzso that couples to zzso proteins and is expressed predominantly by zzso and/or zzso zzso in the rat zzso
