zzso of zzso proteins is widespread and vital to zzso The zzso unit zzso lies at the zzso core of all zzso attached to zzso side chains during this zzso Although its absolute conservation implies an indispensable role, associated perhaps with its structure, its unbiased zzso and the potential modulating role of zzso are zzso both have now been explored through a combination of zzso laser zzso and zzso The zzso zzso unit acts as a rigid rod, while the central, and unusual, zzso linkage is more flexible and is modulated by the zzso zzso and zzso branching zzso zzso zzso the zzso but leaves the zzso zzso flexible, through a zzso zzso ensuring anchored projection from the protein shell while allowing flexible interaction of the zzso portion of zzso with bulk water and zzso zzso
