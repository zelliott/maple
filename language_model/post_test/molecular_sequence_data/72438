We have established by differential display zzso chain reaction of zzso that zzso zzso is expressed by zzso zzso zzso The zzso cell populations used for comparison differed in their ability to promote zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso for zzso was found to be expressed in greater abundance in lines that were unable to support zzso formation than in supportive zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso formation in zzso of zzso and zzso cells of zzso or bone zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso formation in the presence of zzso agents including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone, zzso and zzso The zzso effect of zzso was limited to the early phase of the zzso which zzso with proliferation of zzso zzso zzso has been reported to induce zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso production in T cells, and both agents also inhibit zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso to zzso were able to rescue zzso zzso of zzso formation, whereas zzso zzso to zzso did zzso In zzso with zzso and zzso cells from zzso zzso type zzso mice, zzso was found to inhibit zzso formation, indicating that zzso acted independently of zzso production: zzso had no effect in these zzso Additionally, in zzso in which zzso cells were derived from zzso mice and zzso were from zzso mice and vice versa, we identified that the target cells for zzso zzso of zzso formation were the zzso zzso The work provides evidence that zzso is expressed by zzso and zzso zzso formation via zzso production and not via zzso zzso
