Thirty-five zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso of these zzso were assigned to the zzso group, while the remaining two were grouped under the zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not allow efficient zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that these strains exhibit a zzso that changes the DNA specificity of a zzso zzso The zzso group zzso did not zzso the small zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that there are at least three different types of zzso receptors in zzso zzso two that are specific for small zzso zzso and one that is specific for zzso zzso zzso Five zzso zzso zzso which could overcome the zzso block zzso zzso were selected and investigated by sequencing the genes zzso and zzso which zzso minor and major tail zzso zzso Each of the zzso zzso carried a zzso change at the 3' end of gene zzso No zzso were observed in gene zzso zzso of the gene product of zzso of zzso zzso with its zzso in zzso zzso showed that these proteins had very similar zzso zzso No similarities were found at the zzso part of the zzso We conclude that the zzso portion of the protein zzso by zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso in zzso zzso determines the zzso zzso of these zzso on zzso zzso
