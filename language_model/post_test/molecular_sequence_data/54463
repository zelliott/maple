An increasing number of peptides with specific binding affinity to various protein and even zzso targets are being discovered from zzso display zzso The power of this method lies in its ability to efficiently and rapidly identify zzso with a desired target property from a large population of zzso clones displaying diverse surface zzso However, the search for the needle in the haystack does not always end zzso False positive results may zzso Thus instead of specific zzso zzso with no actual affinity toward the target are recovered due to their propagation advantages or binding to other components of the screening system, such as the solid phase, capturing zzso zzso in the target sample or blocking agents, rather than the zzso zzso experiments on different targets performed in our laboratory revealed some previously identified and many new zzso zzso zzso which have already been frequently described and published, but not yet recognized as zzso zzso true zzso from false zzso is an important step toward zzso display selections of greater zzso This article thoroughly reviews and discusses already identified and new zzso peptides and suggests strategies to avoid their zzso
