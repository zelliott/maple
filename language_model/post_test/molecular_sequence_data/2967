zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso generated in zzso hosts by zzso zzso Because the naturally occurring bone and prostate zzso of pet dogs provide unique model systems to study factors that regulate cancer progression and tumor zzso we investigated the capacity of these tumors to generate zzso We determined that zzso fragments are present in urine of dogs with bone zzso The identity of these fragments was confirmed by comparison of the zzso determined protein sequence to that of a clone of canine zzso zzso these fragments were absent in urine collected from the same dogs after complete surgical removal of the primary zzso We also demonstrate that canine prostate cancer cells are capable of processing zzso to zzso in zzso These findings provide rationale for using spontaneous canine tumor models to isolate zzso zzso zzso and to investigate their therapeutic use against zzso
