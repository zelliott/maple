zzso muscle zzso is a zzso zzso molecular zzso zzso to various zzso affect the zzso properties of the zzso and they are associated with skeletal and cardiac zzso The zzso zzso domain is located near the zzso zzso Here, we helped define the role of the zzso by using an zzso approach to study how zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso affect zzso function and skeletal and cardiac muscle structure and zzso We found zzso zzso zzso has depressed zzso activity and in zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso has these properties zzso zzso zzso zzso activity protects against zzso dysfunction in metabolically demanding skeletal zzso In contrast, enhanced zzso zzso function allows normal skeletal zzso zzso but it zzso degradation of the zzso apparatus, probably as a result of zzso zzso Analysis of beating hearts demonstrates depressed motor function evokes a zzso response, similar to that seen with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and it zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performance generates a zzso apparently analogous to that of human restrictive zzso possibly indicating zzso origins for the zzso The zzso and zzso zzso illustrate the zzso role in influencing the zzso properties of zzso and produce unique zzso in distinct zzso Our data suggest zzso is a valuable system for identifying and modeling zzso analogous to those associated with specific human muscle zzso
