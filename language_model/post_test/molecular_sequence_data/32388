zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso that was isolated from zzso of the marine zzso zzso zzso marina and shown to contain a single zzso bond between zzso and zzso forming an zzso ring zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 2004, zzso zzso To determine the role of this zzso bond, we zzso zzso zzso and its linear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is somewhat less active against bacterial cells than zzso Both peptides were very zzso and displayed zzso against human red blood zzso Analysis of the zzso structures of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso disclosed that zzso has zzso zzso zzso structures with zzso while zzso displays a random zzso structure in zzso Our biological data for zzso and zzso indicate that the zzso balance, zzso bridge, and the zzso zzso structure of the peptides play important roles in their biological zzso zzso of the structure of zzso and its zzso should facilitate the design of novel zzso zzso antibiotics with potent zzso zzso
