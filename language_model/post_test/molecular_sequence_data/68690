zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso calcium channels zzso was characterized using rat zzso zzso zzso bound rapidly and with high zzso these parameters were similar to binding using zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso however, zzso readily zzso from its binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso Since zzso appears to bind to the same site as zzso in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso binding makes this zzso preferable for equilibrium binding zzso
