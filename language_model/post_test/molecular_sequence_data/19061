zzso engineered reporters have revolutionized the understanding of many biological zzso zzso reporter genes can dramatically improve our ability to monitor dynamic gene expression and allow zzso of zzso genetic information with high-resolution anatomical zzso We have developed a zzso zzso reporter gene based on a human zzso the human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generates high zzso contrast based on the chemical exchange zzso transfer zzso contrast zzso The 51 zzso zzso zzso protein was fully zzso using zzso technology, and the zzso characteristics of this protein were compared to other zzso contrast zzso Both bacterial and human cells were engineered to express an zzso zzso gene and showed higher zzso contrast compared to zzso Live cells expressing the zzso reporter zzso and embedded in three-dimensional culture, also generated higher zzso contrast compared to zzso live zzso
