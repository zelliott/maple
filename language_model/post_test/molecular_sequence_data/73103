Using a tobacco zzso clone as a probe, a zzso clone coding for a tobacco zzso extension protein was zzso zzso sequence determination of the clone identified an open reading frame for an zzso unit of 76 zzso acids and an extension tail of 80 zzso zzso To the zzso upstream of the open reading frame, a sequence of 1,110 zzso was determined and a putative zzso box and zzso box were zzso An zzso sequence was not apparent as the open reading frame for the zzso protein was continuous for zzso zzso In the 3' downstream region of the zzso a putative zzso signal and zzso rich region were zzso Northern zzso analysis of tobacco transcripts with the tail part of the gene as a probe specifically identified the zzso zzso zzso The Northern signal at zzso zzso indicated that the expression of the zzso protein gene in tobacco is zzso upon zzso
