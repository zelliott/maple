zzso acid zzso is a very important zzso neurotransmitter in both zzso and zzso nervous zzso zzso receptors zzso are known to be the molecular targets of a class of zzso Members of the zzso gene family of the zzso zzso zzso a model insect of zzso have been identified and characterized in this zzso All putative zzso zzso zzso were cloned using the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso zzso appears to have the largest insect zzso gene family known to date, including three zzso one zzso and one zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene has zzso sites, and the zzso and zzso genes possess alternative zzso These zzso modifications enhance the diversity of the zzso zzso gene zzso In addition, truncated transcripts were found for the zzso and zzso zzso In particular, the three zzso zzso may have arisen from two zzso zzso
