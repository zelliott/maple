A novel human zzso zzso repetitive sequence was identified and characterized using arbitrary zzso The repeat zzso consensus sequence is 100 zzso long, and there are a minimum of 140 to 160 copies of the repetitive sequence per zzso human zzso The repetitive sequence is highly clustered on zzso within a zzso to zzso zzso The highly zzso repeat array is inherited in a stable zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso conservation of the repeated element only among zzso and Old World zzso where repeat arrangements are also zzso
