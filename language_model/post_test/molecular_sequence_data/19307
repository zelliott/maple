zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso are the major functional natural killer zzso cell receptors in zzso The presence of zzso genes has only recently been demonstrated in other zzso species, and their zzso zzso arrangement, and function in these species have yet to be zzso In this study, we describe the zzso gene family in zzso zzso sequences were amplified from zzso derived from four zzso zzso new sequences were identified in zzso Some are zzso of two previously described zzso and the remainder are representative of at least four additional zzso These zzso data, together with analysis of the cattle zzso zzso confirm that, as in humans, cattle have multiple zzso and zzso zzso zzso with variable zzso zzso and putative framework zzso In contrast to human, the majority of the cattle zzso genes zzso three zzso zzso most of the zzso genes zzso only one zzso zzso zzso motif zzso and the zzso genes zzso molecules with zzso rather than the more usual zzso in the zzso zzso A divergent zzso zzso encodes a two zzso zzso with an unusual zzso structure, and a distinct signaling domain with two zzso zzso to pig and human two zzso zzso zzso suggest these may be more related to an ancestral gene than the other cattle zzso zzso Cattle have multiple zzso genes and at least one zzso zzso thus, the data presented here suggest that they have the potential to express more major zzso zzso zzso receptors than other zzso
