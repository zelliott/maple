Emerging pathogens potentially undergo rapid evolution while expanding in population size and geographic range during the course of invasion, yet it is generally difficult to demonstrate how these processes zzso Our analysis of a zzso data set covering a large-scale rabies virus outbreak among North American zzso reveals the long lasting effect of the initial infection wave in determining how viral populations are genetically structured in zzso We further find that zzso estimates derived from the genetic data yielded an amazingly accurate reconstruction of the known spatial and demographic dynamics of the virus over zzso Our study demonstrates the combined evolutionary and population dynamic processes characterizing the spread of pathogen after its introduction into a fully susceptible host zzso Furthermore, the results provide important insights regarding the spatial scale of rabies persistence and validate the use of zzso approaches for uncovering even relatively complex population zzso Such approaches will be of increasing relevance for understanding the epidemiology of emerging zzso diseases in a landscape zzso
