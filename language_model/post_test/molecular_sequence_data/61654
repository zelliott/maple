This study was undertaken to characterize the programmed cell death zzso processes that occur during detached and natural zzso zzso and correlate them with the expression of putative regulatory genes that may be involved in the zzso DNA fragmentation and zzso analysis of broccoli zzso showed that DNA was processed into fragments of approximately 180 zzso after 48 h of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso patterns were also visible in zzso leaves undergoing natural zzso zzso and during detached zzso Several recently isolated plant proteins have been assigned a zzso role, for example, the zinc finger containing zzso zzso zzso simulating zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso zzso an zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso each of these proteins were isolated from broccoli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso increased during zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also characterized during detached leaf zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso expressed during detached zzso zzso expression remained zzso low, and zzso expression increased during detached zzso
