In order to identify genetic causes of zzso association zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso C cardiac zzso T zzso zzso E zzso zzso R zzso anomalies, L limb zzso we have collected DNA samples from 20 patients diagnosed with zzso or with a zzso zzso as well as samples from 19 aborted fetal cases with zzso To investigate the importance of gene dose zzso in the genetic zzso of zzso association we have performed a systematic analysis of this cohort using a zzso array comparative zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, to further clarify the significance of zzso zzso and zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso screening has been zzso We identified zzso gene dose imbalances in two fetal zzso a zzso deletion of the zzso gene and a zzso unbalanced zzso In addition, one zzso zzso in zzso was zzso while no apparent zzso zzso were found in zzso or zzso Our study shows that although large gene dose zzso do not seem to be a common cause in zzso association, zzso is still important in clinical zzso to identify disease cause in individual zzso
