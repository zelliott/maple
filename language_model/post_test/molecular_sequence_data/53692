In zzso zzso the zzso zzso is localized to the zzso of the zzso and is required for zzso axis zzso Here, we report that a zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso show a novel polarity zzso in which zzso zzso accumulates normally at the zzso but zzso zzso is redirected to the center of the zzso resulting in embryonic patterning zzso These zzso arise from a disorganization of the zzso zzso zzso consistent with reports that zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso may zzso the zzso zzso network to define the zzso as the site for zzso zzso These results identify a molecular parallel between zzso polarization in zzso and zzso zzso
