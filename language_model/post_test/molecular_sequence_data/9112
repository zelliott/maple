zzso zzso are protein interaction zzso that specifically recognize zzso zzso zzso a key event in the reading process of zzso zzso The 61 zzso in the human zzso cluster into eight families based on zzso zzso Here, we present 29 high-resolution crystal structures, covering all zzso zzso Comprehensive zzso structural analysis identifies zzso and zzso structural features that are necessary for specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than 30 representative zzso against systematic zzso zzso identifies new zzso zzso and reveals a strong influence of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso recognize combinations of marks rather than zzso zzso zzso We further uncovered a structural mechanism for the simultaneous binding and recognition of diverse zzso peptides by zzso These data provide a foundation for zzso drug design of specific zzso for this emerging target zzso
