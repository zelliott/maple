To identify the mechanisms that cause zzso zzso in zzso zzso we studied the impact of zzso injury on the surface expression and function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with the release of zzso fragments into cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso cardiac zzso that contained these zzso fragments selectively reduced expression of zzso an effect suppressed by specific zzso of the zzso Treating zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments zzso likewise decreased zzso zzso and did so by inducing a zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso We zzso that changes in zzso zzso which were induced by interactions with zzso zzso fragments, may alter zzso migration into tissue zzso a prominent component of the cardiac zzso zzso Support for this hypothesis came from experiments showing that zzso treatment significantly reduced both spontaneous and zzso zzso migration on an zzso collagen zzso In zzso it is likely that contact with zzso zzso fragments also zzso zzso adhesive zzso and this causes zzso to accumulate at sites where the zzso concentration is sufficient to ensure zzso degradation of zzso
