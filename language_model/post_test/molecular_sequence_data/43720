Group I zzso are proposed to have become mobile following the acquisition of open reading frames zzso that zzso highly specific DNA zzso This proposal implies that zzso zzso could behave as autonomously mobile zzso This was supported by abundant circumstantial evidence but no experiment of zzso transfer from an zzso zzso to its zzso counterpart has been zzso In this paper we present such experiments, which demonstrate the efficient mobility of the zzso zzso between two zzso zzso The zzso of this mobile zzso was accompanied by a zzso zzso that did not systematically involve the whole zzso zzso zzso acquisition would be the most recent step in the evolution of the zzso zzso which has resulted in many strains of zzso having an zzso with two zzso zzso and four zzso zzso We show that two of the zzso events that operate in this zzso zzso as evidenced by zzso experiments, are generated by a zzso zzso site, which is most probably a remnant of the zzso ancestral form of the zzso We propose a sequential evolution model that is consistent with the four organizations of the corresponding zzso locus that we found among various species of the zzso family; these organizations consist of no zzso an zzso alone, a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso
