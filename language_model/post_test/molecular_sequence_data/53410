In zzso zzso execute a central task in the assembly of cellular zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso their own set of zzso zzso and they initiate the generation of zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we identify the zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso as a new member of the zzso cluster zzso zzso zzso belongs to a family of zzso proteins present in zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene results in the loss of zzso DNA zzso the use of the zzso strain for functional zzso zzso in which zzso was depleted by regulated gene expression maintained the zzso DNA, yet the cells displayed retarded growth on zzso carbon zzso This finding indicates the importance of zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused a zzso in zzso zzso protein zzso Moreover, zzso was required for maturation of zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso in a zzso sequence motif characterizing the zzso protein family were found to be essential for zzso function in the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest a function for zzso in the binding of iron or an intermediate of zzso cluster zzso
