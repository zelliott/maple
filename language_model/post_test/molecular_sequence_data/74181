zzso interference zzso is a unique gene regulation mechanism in zzso zzso It is typically zzso by short interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso and recently discovered zzso zzso zzso In plants, zzso is also called zzso gene zzso zzso in which diverse small zzso are zzso to defend against viral or bacterial infection, and to zzso zzso gene expression and zzso zzso Many zzso genes have been identified by genetic screens in plants, including zzso of gene zzso 2 zzso also called zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso 1 zzso For most of these zzso their potential functions have been uncovered through sequence similarity searches and protein domain zzso For instance, zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso for producing zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Their retrieved zzso in other organisms including zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso have also been shown to be crucial in zzso zzso indicating an evolutionary conservation for zzso zzso However, one exception is the zzso zzso whose specific function remains unclear so zzso
