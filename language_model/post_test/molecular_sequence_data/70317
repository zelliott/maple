The ultimate goal of the human zzso project is to decode all the genetic information carried in the zzso zzso this goal, the physical structure of the zzso as well as the functional aspects of the zzso must be zzso We initiated a zzso project to collect the zzso zzso of all human zzso a database with which to describe which genes are zzso and to what extent, in any given human cell at a particular zzso zzso sequencing of randomly selected members from a zzso zzso library is most appropriate for this purpose: the sequence data serve as a zzso zzso to identify the expressing zzso and the frequency of appearance of the gene signature reflects the activity of the zzso The compiled data, which usually cover some 1000 sequencing results per sample, are referred to as an zzso zzso We applied this analysis to zzso (a cell line derived from a zzso zzso liver cells and lung zzso The expression profiles shed some light upon the unique features of gene expression in the cell or tissue zzso A comparison of the expression profiles among different cells has allowed active genes to be classified as zzso or those with zzso zzso A significant fraction of the abundantly expressed genes include those that are unique to the zzso In addition, the resulting collection of thousands of gene signatures is a useful source of zzso for mapping and for zzso full-size zzso
