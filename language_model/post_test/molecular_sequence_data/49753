zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli suggesting sensitive mechanisms for coordinate control of NO defense genes in response to NO zzso Exposure of zzso coli to zzso NO levels under zzso conditions rapidly induced zzso of the NO zzso zzso structural zzso zzso and zzso as monitored by zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso impaired the zzso induction of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas disruption of the upstream regulatory zzso zzso completely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was restored to zzso zzso zzso by expressing zzso in zzso Furthermore, an internal deletion of the zzso domain of zzso activated zzso expression independent of NO zzso Neither zzso nor zzso was essential for zzso induction of the NO zzso zzso zzso by zzso However, elevated zzso activity inhibited NO zzso zzso and, in the presence of zzso NO zzso inhibited zzso induction by zzso The results demonstrate the role of zzso as a zzso regulator of zzso zzso A role for the zzso zzso domain as a zzso or sensor for NO is zzso
