We have previously reported that human T cell receptors zzso selected in the class zzso zzso response to a zzso toxin zzso zzso frequently used the V beta 2 zzso segment which paired with several V alpha segments and that the putative zzso of both alpha and beta chains showed remarkable zzso To analyze the structural basis for recognition of the zzso complex, five of these zzso were zzso into a zzso T cell zzso 58 zzso zzso by expressing the human alpha and beta variable regions joined to the mouse alpha and beta constant regions, zzso The zzso zzso expressing the same V beta zzso segment zzso beta zzso two expressing V alpha zzso two V alpha zzso and one V alpha zzso were shown to have the expected zzso specificity and DR zzso Two lines of evidence suggested that the putative zzso although not zzso in these zzso played a key role in zzso First, two zzso with identical V zzso segments but distinct zzso showed large difference in their capacity to react with the zzso Second, zzso the alpha and beta chains from zzso zzso which differed in their zzso sequences invariably led to loss of zzso We also asked whether zzso V alpha zzso could functionally replace V alpha zzso as they appear to be related in their primary zzso However, as in the case of zzso exchanges, V alpha replacement zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data underline the fine zzso of the structural components of the zzso binding site in defining a given zzso Four of the zzso studied displaying zzso recognition were also tested against different DR zzso and zzso zzso The results of these experiments suggested that, in spite of their structural zzso zzso zzso may have a similar orientation with respect to the zzso zzso The zzso system described zzso should represent a valuable tool for detailed studies of human zzso zzso
