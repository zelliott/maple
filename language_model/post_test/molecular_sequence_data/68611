zzso is a 57 zzso type III zzso protein that is thought to play a role in zzso both during development and following nerve injury zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Troy et zzso zzso We have used transgenic mouse technology to define zzso gene sequences that are necessary for cell zzso expression and for the increase in zzso that occurs in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and nervous zzso expression resulted when zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso sequence were linked to a reporter zzso but precise cell zzso expression was achieved only when zzso sequences were zzso When zzso sequences were present, zzso zzso were expressed in zzso root zzso zzso and spinal zzso motor zzso and were zzso in these cells following nerve zzso
