Basic zzso zzso zzso factors play key roles in the development of the central nervous zzso Here we report the isolation of a zzso gene that encodes a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso In zzso zzso zzso like its zzso zzso is strongly expressed in the zzso and the zzso with the latter expression located in zzso cells of the zzso However, in addition to this zzso brain zzso we also detect expression in the floor plate of the spinal zzso By the location of this expression relative to other genes expressed in the floor plate and by zzso expression in a selection of zzso zzso we reveal that zzso is expressed within the lateral floor plate as opposed to the zzso floor plate, and also in more zzso cells which are distinct from zzso and depend on either sonic zzso zzso or a signal coming from the lateral floor zzso This is to our knowledge the first report of a gene expressed specifically in lateral cells of the floor plate in the spinal zzso
