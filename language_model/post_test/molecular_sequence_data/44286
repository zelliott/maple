Previously we demonstrated that zzso zzso exhibit a high affinity interaction with zzso consistent with an zzso function in the zzso of G zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Penn, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso In this report we show that a short sequence of highly zzso zzso within the zzso zzso terminal domain is responsible for zzso zzso Limited zzso of zzso cages results in the release of terminal zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not visual zzso bind specifically to a zzso zzso terminal domain fusion zzso zzso analysis and zzso scanning zzso zzso the binding site to zzso zzso of the zzso heavy chain and indicate that zzso zzso can function as an independent zzso binding zzso zzso zzso identifies an zzso zzso zzso and two highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso which have been implicated in zzso binding zzso zzso zzso Goodman, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite exhibiting high affinity zzso zzso zzso do not induce coat zzso The terminal domain is oriented toward the plasma membrane in coated pits, and its binding of both zzso and zzso suggests that this domain is the anchor responsible for zzso recruitment to the coated zzso
