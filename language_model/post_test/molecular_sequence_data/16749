Here we report the complete zzso sequence of Singapore grouper zzso zzso zzso of the random shotgun and restriction zzso zzso libraries showed that the entire zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso One hundred zzso open reading frames zzso from the sense and zzso DNA zzso coding for lengths varying from 41 to zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso analyses of the deduced zzso acid sequences revealed that 77 of the zzso exhibited zzso to known virus zzso 23 of which matched functional zzso zzso zzso putative zzso zzso or signatures were detected in the National Center for Biotechnology Information zzso database and zzso zzso An assortment of zzso activities involved in DNA zzso transcription, zzso zzso cell zzso zzso were zzso zzso were cultured on a cell line derived from the zzso egg of the grouper zzso zzso isolated, and zzso by zzso zzso zzso The protein extract from the zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso gel zzso followed by zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso and database searching led to identification of 26 zzso Twenty of these represented novel or previously unidentified zzso which were further confirmed by reverse zzso zzso and DNA sequencing of their respective zzso zzso
