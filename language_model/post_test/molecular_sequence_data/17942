The zzso analysis of zzso peptides in biological samples can be achieved by zzso liquid zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the presence of cyanide zzso However, in order to take full advantage of the high sensitivity possible with detectors based on zzso zzso or zzso each component of the zzso method must be carefully zzso In this study, strategies are presented for the prediction of retention time and the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso peptides in zzso zzso zzso
