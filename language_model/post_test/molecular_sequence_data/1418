The zzso zzso zzso is the only known zzso class zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the function of the beta zzso which is believed to bind zzso A zzso zzso system was constructed on the basis of the interaction of the beta zzso with its zzso zzso Then, seven zzso beta zzso exhibiting impaired zzso binding capacities were selected out from a randomly zzso zzso Two zzso were identified in the class zzso which might interact with the zzso of the zzso analogous to other class zzso zzso zzso The five other zzso were found in the zzso zzso domain of which the folding is still zzso zzso affinity zzso and kinetic analyses performed on the isolated beta zzso and on the zzso zzso showed for all the zzso an effect in zzso affinity in the ground zzso In addition, an effect on the transition state of the zzso reaction was observed for a zzso deletion zzso of the zzso zzso These results show that the genetic approach of the three hybrid system is widely zzso and is a powerful tool for the investigation of zzso zzso
