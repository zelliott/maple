zzso zzso a zzso zzso agent, is responsible for human zzso zzso zzso In this study, we genetically mapped 10 zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso outer membrane protein zzso zzso locus spanning 6 of the 22 zzso arranged genes identified three distinct genetic groups with shared zzso among zzso within each zzso zzso in Groups I and III contained six genes each, while Group II zzso had a gene zzso There were two regions on the locus where novel gene deletion or zzso zzso occurred, resulting in the net loss of one gene in Group II zzso Numerous zzso differences among genes in zzso of each group also were zzso The shared zzso among zzso in each group for the zzso zzso locus suggests the derivation of zzso zzso zzso and translation analysis of the locus revealed differences in the expressed genes of different group zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso target gene showed size variations resulting from loss or gain of long, direct repeats within the protein coding zzso To our knowledge this is the first study that looked at several regions of the zzso zzso and we provide the first evidence of zzso resulting from gene deletion and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Diversity in different zzso regions could be the result of a selection process or of independently evolved zzso
