zzso modifications of the zzso zzso zzso channel complex are vital for regulation of the cardiac zzso current and action potential zzso Here, we show the zzso regulatory zzso is zzso with zzso zzso in zzso As zzso zzso sites are not recognizable by sequence zzso we designed a novel set of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso their zzso content using zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is exclusively zzso at zzso which is also required for zzso at zzso For wild type zzso the overlapping zzso and zzso sites are innocuous for zzso zzso however, zzso of zzso to a zzso zzso yielded mostly zzso protein and a small fraction of zzso zzso The compounded zzso was equally deleterious for zzso cell surface zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso is a zzso modification that is integral for the proper zzso and zzso trafficking of the cardiac zzso zzso The zzso zzso and panel of zzso zzso used here will be valuable for identifying the different zzso zzso in native cells and determining the roles zzso and zzso play in zzso function and zzso in zzso
