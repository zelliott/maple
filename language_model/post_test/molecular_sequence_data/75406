We determined the DNA sequence of zzso zzso elements and zzso regions in order to investigate the extent of the association between the zzso repetitive element, zzso and zzso zzso Fifteen of zzso zzso elements analyzed begin at position zzso to zzso with respect to the zzso end of a zzso zzso This region is close to the initiation point of zzso gene zzso and contains a sequence which is modestly zzso for a number of zzso zzso Two pairs of identical zzso elements occur as the long terminal repeats of a sequence which, together with zzso zzso zzso has the structural properties of a zzso this element has been named zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso DNA separated by zzso field zzso gel zzso zzso showed that zzso and isolated zzso elements are distributed over many zzso in the zzso zzso
