A key step in heart development is the coordinated development of the zzso canal zzso the zzso between the zzso and zzso that zzso and physically separates the chambers, and the development of the zzso valves that ensure zzso blood zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso mouse models, we provide evidence that the zzso important zzso factors zzso and zzso in a functionally redundant manner, maintain the zzso zzso zzso during the process of chamber zzso zzso profiling and zzso analysis of zzso revealed that it directly interacts with and zzso chamber zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso by zzso relevant zzso Moreover, zzso mice lacking 3 or 4 functional zzso of zzso and zzso failed to form zzso zzso precursors of the valves and zzso zzso and zzso trigger development of the cushions through a regulatory zzso loop with zzso thus providing a mechanism for the zzso and coordination of these important processes in heart zzso
