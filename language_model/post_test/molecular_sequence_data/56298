A method for the isolation of zzso zzso zzso was zzso The method takes advantage of zzso zzso of an entire set of proteins zzso by zzso zzso followed by generation of zzso against the zzso protein pool and zzso screening of bacterial expression libraries with these zzso By applying this methodology to the study of the zzso events triggered by zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso we have isolated several zzso zzso novel putative zzso zzso zzso One of these zzso encodes zzso a protein belonging to the band zzso family of proteins and highly related to zzso and zzso We demonstrated that, despite a high degree of zzso these three proteins exhibit a distinct zzso pattern of zzso raising the possibility that they might mediate zzso cellular zzso In addition the generation of zzso specific for either zzso zzso or zzso allowed us to show that a previously described tumor transplantation zzso is indeed zzso thus implicating this protein in the determination of the biological zzso of certain zzso
