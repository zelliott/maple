With the aim of identifying genes involved in development and zzso adaptation in zzso four coding sequences were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso stage zzso Genes showed significant similarity to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso a large family that includes stage and zzso genes from diverse organisms, many associated with crucial biological zzso The full-length zzso zzso encodes a predicted protein of 202 zzso in zzso containing 10 zzso and a putative signal zzso The expression level of zzso was estimated by zzso zzso relative to zzso showing an increase of zzso in segmented worms compared to zzso By in zzso zzso zzso expression was localized mainly at the larvae zzso region of zzso and in the zzso of segmented zzso Taken together our results suggest a possible role for zzso zzso zzso proteins as zzso products, potentially involved in differentiation processes as proposed for zzso in other zzso
