zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex have evolved remarkable ability to survive in diverse ecological niches during transmission cycles between ticks and zzso hosts by variable gene zzso To understand the events during zzso transmission from feeding ticks to zzso zzso levels of selected zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by quantitative real-time zzso Green zzso zzso zzso infected zzso zzso zzso fed on laboratory zzso mice for 0, 24, 48, and 72 zzso The zzso levels of the constantly expressed zzso gene were used for the relative zzso of selected zzso zzso in gene expression profiles were observed in zzso ticks and during tick zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso showed distinctive decreasing patterns during the first 24 hours zzso while zzso and zzso zzso levels increased significantly during the feeding zzso In contrast, zzso levels decreased for the 48 hours of tick feeding and slightly increased by 72 zzso More detailed and comprehensive studies on regulation of gene expression in different zzso zzso on the zzso interface would aid to develop effective strategies in preventing pathogen zzso
