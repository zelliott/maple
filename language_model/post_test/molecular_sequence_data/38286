The zzso gene in zzso zzso encodes an zzso required for two steps in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso This zzso zzso an early Q zzso zzso acid, as well as the final intermediate in the pathway, converting zzso to zzso This zzso is also capable of zzso the distinct zzso early intermediate zzso zzso A full-length zzso zzso the human zzso of zzso was isolated from a human heart zzso library by sequence zzso to rat zzso The clone contained a zzso pair open reading frame that zzso a zzso with a great deal of sequence identity to a variety of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the region between zzso acids 89 and 255 in the human zzso the rat and human zzso are zzso zzso whereas human and zzso are zzso zzso When expressed in zzso the human construct rescued the growth of a zzso zzso zzso zzso on a zzso carbon source and restored zzso Q zzso although at lower levels than that of wild type zzso In zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso Q zzso zzso as zzso showed that the human zzso is active with all three zzso zzso
