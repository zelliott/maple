Point zzso and deletions of zzso gene have been described in several cases of zzso zzso zzso To date, most of these zzso affect the zzso domain of zzso which plays a central role in DNA binding activity of zzso We report on a zzso zzso zzso newborn girl zzso female external zzso The direct sequencing of zzso showed a new nonsense zzso in a zzso of zzso gene zzso the 3' end of the zzso zzso a zzso is replaced by a zzso at position zzso in zzso zzso resulting in the replacement of the zzso acid zzso zzso by a stop zzso zzso The new zzso of this patient provides further evidence to support the functional importance of the putative DNA binding activity of the zzso zzso
