The mechanisms by which zzso C virus zzso zzso chronic infection in the vast majority of infected individuals are zzso zzso within the zzso E1 and zzso envelope genes were analyzed during the acute phase of zzso C in 12 patients with different clinical zzso Acute resolving zzso was associated with relative evolutionary stasis of the zzso viral population zzso whereas progressing zzso correlated with genetic evolution of zzso zzso with the hypothesis of selective pressure by the host immune system, the sequence changes occurred almost exclusively within the zzso region 1 of the zzso gene and were temporally correlated with zzso zzso These data indicate that the evolutionary dynamics of the zzso zzso during the acute phase of zzso C predict whether the infection will resolve or become zzso
