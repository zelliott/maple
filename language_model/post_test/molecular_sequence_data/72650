The sequences of the heavy chain variable zzso segment and zzso zzso zzso of 14 zzso zzso factors zzso derived from 11 different zzso gene segments from five healthy zzso donors zzso are zzso We extend a previous analysis of two clones from one donor using only the zzso segment zzso In the present study, the zzso patterns of these new zzso and the two earlier reported zzso zzso clones are analyzed in relation to zzso family, zzso origin, and zzso The panel of zzso zzso is further compared with 33 previously described zzso zzso from patients with zzso arthritis zzso There is a high rate of zzso in the panel of zzso zzso zzso of ten zzso zzso originating in zzso patients have a comparable zzso rate zzso of 11 zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso zzso is not disease zzso The zzso zzso have, however, a significantly lower affinity for zzso than the zzso zzso We found that the structural basis of the differences between zzso and zzso zzso is related to zzso family zzso zzso of the zzso family use very similar zzso genes in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family have, however, a low ratio of zzso zzso zzso of only zzso in the heavy chain zzso region zzso and zzso This is statistically significantly lower than the corresponding ratio of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso family from zzso and zzso patients have very similar zzso ratios of zzso and zzso in zzso and 2, zzso The zzso zzso zzso are, however, predominantly zzso by genes not zzso any zzso zzso Thus, both repertoire differences and zzso resulting in significantly lower zzso ratios can be observed in zzso from zzso compared with zzso zzso
