zzso analyses of zzso protein sorting in zzso zzso have uncovered a large number of zzso zzso that zzso and zzso soluble zzso zzso Here we report the characterization of the gene product affected in one of these zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against a zzso fusion protein specifically detects a zzso protein in labeled zzso cell zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso is distributed between a low speed membrane zzso fraction and a high speed membrane zzso zzso The lack of a zzso domain in zzso suggests that zzso peripherally associates with a zzso This association was found to depend on the function of zzso a member of the zzso family of small zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso is found in the zzso In addition, zzso of zzso partially suppresses a zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso functionally zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso region that zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso finger zzso binding zzso zzso of this zzso region partially compromises zzso zzso While zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso soluble zzso zzso the integral zzso membrane zzso alkaline zzso zzso is sorted to the zzso and matured zzso In addition, when zzso zzso are combined with zzso or late zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso respectively), zzso is still delivered to the zzso These observations indicate that zzso is sorted to the zzso in a zzso manner, possibly via an alternative zzso zzso
