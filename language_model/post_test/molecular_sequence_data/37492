We describe the selection of a zzso with a very fast zzso (over zzso zzso 63 times higher than the already very efficient zzso zzso The zzso was selected from a library of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes using a novel strategy based on linking zzso and zzso by in zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso First, zzso each displaying a single gene and multiple copies of the zzso zzso are formed by zzso in zzso zzso These zzso can then be selected for zzso or zzso To select for zzso the zzso are zzso in a reaction buffer of choice with a soluble zzso The product and any zzso zzso are coupled to the beads when the reaction is zzso zzso zzso displaying active zzso and the genes that zzso them, are detected with zzso zzso and selected using flow zzso This completely in zzso process selects for all zzso features simultaneously zzso recognition, product formation, rate acceleration and zzso and single zzso molecules can be zzso
