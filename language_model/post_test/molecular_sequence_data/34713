The zzso zzso zzso and zzso play a crucial role in zzso zzso by zzso multiple zzso of receptors and promoting their sorting for zzso zzso Their function is modulated through interactions with regulatory proteins including zzso and zzso which recognize a zzso motif in zzso and thus promote or inhibit zzso zzso We report the structures of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in complex with a zzso zzso from zzso Both structures reveal a zzso complex containing two zzso zzso held together by a single zzso zzso also occurs in solution and is facilitated by the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso complexes of zzso and zzso are formed in zzso and are important for the ability of zzso to promote zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso These results provide molecular explanations for a novel mechanism by which zzso controls zzso zzso
