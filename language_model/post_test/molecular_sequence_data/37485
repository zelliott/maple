The completion of the first total synthesis of the complex zzso zzso zzso I zzso is outlined using the building blocks described in the preceding zzso Key steps involve the zzso zzso of zzso 2 with zzso 3 which leads to the selective formation of zzso 5 rather than to the expected zzso zzso 5, on treatment with zzso amounts of the zzso zzso complex 6 or the zzso zzso complex 7, zzso a high yielding ring closing zzso zzso reaction zzso to afford zzso zzso Exposure of the latter to the zzso donor 4 in the presence of zzso under zzso zzso conditions delivers compound 9 by a process involving zzso of the zzso hindered zzso group and zzso zzso of the adjacent zzso into the desired zzso This transformation constitutes one of the most advanced applications of the zzso zzso method reported to zzso zzso of the zzso followed by exhaustive zzso completes the total synthesis of the targeted zzso zzso
