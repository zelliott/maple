Two zzso toxins named toxins A and B play a role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The interaction of the toxins with host cell factors proceeds to downstream stages of zzso effects in cells, in which involvement of other zzso zzso factors remains zzso We zzso culture zzso of zzso zzso with a low dilution to characterize the influence of putative minor proteins on the organization of the zzso zzso in cultured zzso cells and found a previously zzso zzso zzso structure, termed zzso zzso at the zzso zzso We reasoned that formation of zzso zzso was due to an additional zzso in the culture zzso rather than the zzso zzso because treatment of zzso toxins rarely caused zzso zzso in zzso We focused on a previously zzso hypothetical protein harboring a zzso sequence as a zzso The product of the candidate gene was detected in culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and was renamed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered formation of zzso zzso in the cells in the presence of either toxin A or B and enhanced zzso of each of the two zzso including decreases in both cell viability and zzso resistance of cultured zzso zzso although the zzso zzso alone did not show zzso zzso zzso culture zzso partially inhibited zzso changes of the cells in parallel with decreased zzso zzso formation in the zzso Thus, zzso might contribute to the zzso of toxin sensitivity of zzso zzso cells by enhancing zzso of zzso zzso zzso
