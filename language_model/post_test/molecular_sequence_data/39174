Fourteen potential zzso genes have been identified in the zzso mouse strain, and zzso containing a complete coding region have been isolated for 10 members of this gene zzso zzso proteins are primarily expressed in natural killer zzso zzso Although the sequence of the zzso promoter region has been published, no study of the zzso activity of the promoter has been zzso A zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was isolated and characterized by DNA zzso zzso 5 zzso of DNA sequence upstream of the first zzso zzso was determined and this region was used to perform promoter analysis using zzso reporter zzso zzso A core promoter was identified that was zzso transcribed in a zzso cell line, zzso zzso mobility shift zzso using zzso zzso from the core zzso promoter and comparable regions from the zzso promoter demonstrated the importance of zzso elements in generating zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
