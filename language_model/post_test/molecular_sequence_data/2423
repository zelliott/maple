zzso peptides are presented to T zzso by major zzso complex zzso zzso The binding of peptides to zzso class II molecules has been demonstrated directly, and is found to correlate with the ability of specific class II zzso to restrict the zzso response to specific zzso By comparison, a direct demonstration of a physical association between zzso peptides and zzso class I molecules has proved zzso A recent report shows that it is possible, however, and the three-dimensional structure of a class I zzso zzso illustrates the site where such binding must zzso Here we describe a simple zzso which measures the binding of zzso zzso class I molecules to peptides bound to a solid phase zzso We find that class I molecules bind specifically to peptides known to be zzso for class zzso zzso T zzso zzso which are recognized by zzso T zzso bind not only to the restricting zzso class I zzso but also to other class I zzso Our results suggest that quantitative differences in the zzso class I interaction may influence zzso of zzso restriction observed in zzso
