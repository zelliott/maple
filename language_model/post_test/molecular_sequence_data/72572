zzso class zzso zzso characterized by a distinct and highly zzso zzso have been identified in a wide variety of zzso from zzso to zzso Although there is evidence that they participate in zzso tissue interactions that zzso zzso zzso including those that pattern the neural zzso there is little information about their function in simple zzso Both to learn more about the ancient function of zzso zzso and to shed light on the evolution of zzso mechanisms within the lineage that gave rise to zzso we have isolated and characterized zzso genes from zzso and zzso Here we describe the sequence and expression of a sea zzso zzso zzso zzso gene whose zzso is very similar to that of zzso zzso This zzso designated zzso is first expressed in zzso stage zzso apparently in a zzso zzso zzso during the early zzso of zzso zzso transcripts are expressed intensely in the zzso zzso and secondary zzso and at reduced levels in the zzso In the latter part of zzso zzso transcripts are concentrated in the oral zzso and gut, and continue to be expressed at those sites through the remainder of embryonic zzso That zzso zzso genes are regulated by zzso tissue interactions and growth factors suggested to us that the restriction of zzso gene expression to the oral zzso and derivatives of the vegetal plate might similarly be regulated by the series of signaling events that pattern these embryonic zzso As a first test of this hypothesis, we examined the influence of zzso and zzso on zzso gene zzso In zzso zzso zzso transcripts were distributed normally in the oral zzso zzso gut, and secondary zzso However, when zzso were zzso into their component cells, zzso transcripts failed to zzso These data show that the zzso of zzso transcripts in zzso does not depend on interactions between germ zzso yet the zzso and maintenance of zzso expression does require zzso or zzso zzso
