Several zzso were studied as potential zzso for the zzso synthesis of zzso containing the zzso zzso acid zzso the overall objective being the synthesis of a zzso zzso that could be chemically zzso into a potentially zzso or zzso zzso zzso available zzso were screened for zzso activity toward the zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso to identify potential zzso for zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso E and zzso zzso zzso the protected zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso However, the same zzso were not able to catalyze the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, although these zzso could use zzso as the zzso donor they could not employ it as the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was able to use zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso in the synthesis of zzso but was not able to zzso zzso The two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso served as zzso for the zzso synthesis of the zzso zzso
