zzso zzso receptors activate a G protein signal zzso that leads to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso also zzso the production of zzso a protein that zzso regulates zzso zzso signaling and is required to form pointed projections of new growth that become the site of cell fusion during zzso zzso lacks strong similarity to any zzso proteins to help predict how it zzso zzso we investigated the relationship between the different functions of zzso by zzso and characterizing seven zzso that were defective in regulating zzso zzso The zzso zzso were also defective when expressed as zzso to zzso the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso proteins are defective in function and not in zzso with zzso The zzso genes contained four distinct point zzso that all occurred between zzso 254 and zzso identifying a region that is critical for zzso zzso zzso with this, we found that the corresponding region is very highly zzso in the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, there were no zzso effects on zzso signaling caused by deletion or zzso of zzso an open reading frame with overall sequence similarity to zzso that lacks this essential zzso Interestingly, all of the zzso zzso showed a zzso in their ability to form mating projections that was zzso to their zzso in regulating zzso zzso This suggests that both functions may be due to the same action of zzso Thus, these studies identify a specific region of zzso that is critical for its function in both signaling and zzso
