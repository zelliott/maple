The assembly of the zzso backbone of zzso B on the type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is terminated by the product of the zzso zzso an zzso zzso that releases the completed zzso as its zzso zzso zzso of zzso gives a zzso B zzso zzso that still accumulates a series of linear zzso ranging from the zzso to a zzso also detected in the wild type, demonstrating that the zzso operates in a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso module 8 and zzso module 9 and module 10 genes also result in zzso of such linear zzso as a consequence of premature termination of zzso zzso Whereas the zzso carries an unmodified aromatic zzso the zzso through zzso have undergone zzso zzso to the zzso suggesting that this modification occurs zzso not after, zzso zzso The structure of one of the accumulated compounds together with zzso experiments suggests that this zzso zzso produces an zzso zzso structure that, after the stage of zzso X, is zzso to an zzso
