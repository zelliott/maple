Although it is assumed that zzso C virus zzso core protein binds with viral zzso to form a zzso little is known about the resulting molecular zzso We zzso surface zzso resonance technology to study the structural basis of the affinity and the preference of the interaction between zzso core protein and zzso derived from the viral zzso Among the 10 zzso corresponding to the zzso untranslated region zzso of the tested zzso zzso the real-time analysis of zzso indicated that the core protein binds most efficiently and zzso to the zzso sequence of the loop zzso domain, whose secondary structure is highly zzso not only among different zzso zzso but also among zzso There also could be some interactions of the core protein with the loop I domain and the region of zzso zzso The kinetic profiles, together with those obtained in experiments using zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggest a zzso of the core protein in zzso These newly characterized properties could provide a basis for understanding the zzso of the viral zzso zzso
