To study the structure and function of a novel zzso zzso gene associated with human zzso cancer zzso 

The zzso sequence was determined by both manual and automatic sequencing zzso The full length zzso sequence was obtained by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso technique and zzso zzso Open reading frame analysis and protein function prediction were also zzso Northern zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso in various human normal zzso and tumor cell zzso Fluorescent in zzso zzso combined with fluorescent zzso technique was employed to map the zzso gene on human zzso 

Full length zzso zzso size zzso zzso encodes a protein highly zzso to a mouse zzso zzso zzso In normal human zzso high zzso expression levels were observed in the zzso zzso zzso small zzso and zzso moderate zzso expression levels were observed in the zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso and peripheral blood zzso and extremely low expression levels were observed in the heart, brain, skeletal muscle and zzso In tumor cell lines, zzso cancer cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cell zzso and gastric cancer cells zzso and zzso showed high levels of zzso zzso cervical cancer cell zzso lung cancer zzso oral zzso cancer cell zzso and zzso cell zzso showed moderate levels of zzso zzso and tongue zzso cancer cell zzso leukemia cells zzso zzso zzso lung cancer cell zzso and melanoma cell zzso showed very low levels of zzso zzso zzso was mapped to human zzso zzso 

zzso encodes a novel human zzso zzso with 855 zzso acid zzso As a novel zzso zzso associated with human zzso cancer, the expression of zzso in various zzso and cell lines may have very important impact on their zzso and biological zzso
