zzso regulated mechanisms involving alternative zzso zzso and/or zzso as well as zzso zzso are implicated in controlling the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso and delta zzso zzso heavy chain zzso during B cell differentiation zzso gene encodes the zzso heavy zzso Using expression zzso constructed with zzso DNA segments composed of the zzso m zzso signal region, we analyzed zzso site zzso and termination of zzso in zzso zzso myeloma cells and in zzso zzso L zzso We found that the gene segment containing the zzso m zzso signals, along with 536 zzso of downstream zzso zzso acted as a zzso zzso in both myeloma cells and L cell zzso Neither a zzso DNA zzso (which directed efficient zzso at the zzso m zzso nor the zzso zzso zzso sequence alone, were sufficient to obtain a similar zzso This shows that the zzso m zzso region plays a central role in controlling zzso regulated zzso termination by blocking downstream delta gene zzso Because this gene segment exhibited the same zzso processing and termination activities in zzso it appears that these processes are not zzso
