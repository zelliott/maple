The functional relevance of putative zzso binding motifs previously identified with zzso overlay binding analysis within the skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined using zzso zzso zzso hands between zzso acid positions zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were scrambled zzso or in combination within the full-length rabbit zzso zzso These zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso and channel function assessed using zzso techniques, zzso binding zzso and single channel zzso In intact zzso these zzso did not affect functional responses to either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso However, in zzso binding zzso both zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso was significantly altered compared with zzso No high affinity zzso binding was observed in zzso expressing the zzso zzso although in single channel zzso the zzso channel could be activated by zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso levels of zzso placed these channels into the classical zzso state, thus indicating that occupancy of high affinity zzso binding sites is not required for zzso zzso states in zzso zzso of three additional putative zzso calcium binding motifs located between zzso acid positions zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso either zzso or in combination zzso did not affect functional responses in zzso zzso except that the zzso for caffeine zzso for the zzso construct was significantly increased compared with zzso However, in zzso binding experiments, the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso was unaffected when compared with zzso
