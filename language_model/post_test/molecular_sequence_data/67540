We developed a simple T4 DNA zzso zzso strategy for zzso zzso of two or more cohesive genes generated by zzso zzso and zzso cloning the spliced product bearing sticky zzso in to a zzso cut zzso For this, two pairs of zzso are used in two different parallel zzso for generation of each cohesive gene zzso We exemplified this strategy by zzso two major zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and toxic shock syndrome toxin zzso followed by its directional cloning into zzso zzso A zzso The fusion gene zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso host zzso The zzso zzso protein retained the zzso of both toxins as observed by the strong zzso with commercial zzso against both SEA and zzso toxin components by Western zzso zzso We observed that the present method for gene zzso with cohesive ends is simple since it does not require elaborate zzso and a single fusion product is obtained consistently during zzso zzso with forward primer of first gene and reverse primer of second zzso For comparison, we fused the same genes using zzso by overlap extension zzso zzso and consistently obtained DNA zzso and multiple zzso bands even after several rounds of zzso from gel excised zzso Moreover, the newly described method requires only two to six complimentary sticky ends between the genes to be zzso in contrast to long stretch of overlapping zzso in case of zzso
