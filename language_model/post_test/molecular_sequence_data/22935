Here we describe the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso by the zzso gene zzso which is the putative zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso have the following properties in zzso zzso both molecules are integral membrane proteins of the inner nuclear membrane zzso and share the same structural organization zzso an zzso located zzso zzso two zzso zzso in the middle of the zzso and a zzso zzso recognition motif in the zzso zzso zzso zzso has similar targeting zzso as it has been reported for the human zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso revealed that this zzso zzso protein is contained in protein complexes together with zzso zzso and zzso It has been previously shown that human zzso binds to A- and zzso zzso in zzso During zzso and early zzso development zzso proteins zzso and zzso show the same expression pattern and are much more abundant in eggs and the first zzso zzso than in later zzso stages and young zzso whereas the zzso protein zzso is zzso expressed in all zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the nuclear envelope of embryonic cells including the pole zzso In zzso cells of zzso at zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso were predominantly localized in the region of the two zzso poles whereas the zzso B zzso and zzso zzso were more zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference zzso in zzso cultured zzso cells has no obvious effect on nuclear architecture, viability of zzso cells and the zzso distribution of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso is supported by zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso protein is not a limiting component of the nuclear architecture in zzso cultured zzso
