The three-dimensional solution structure is reported for zzso zzso which is a potent inhibitor of zzso calcium channels in zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated by a hybrid distance geometry and restrained molecular dynamics approach using zzso distance, zzso angle, and zzso constraints derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with low constraint violations zzso to a common zzso zzso The secondary structure in the zzso is an zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso and three tight zzso The zzso data are consistent with the region of the zzso from zzso zzso to zzso being more dynamic than the rest of the zzso The zzso has an zzso structure with a positively charged zzso side and an opposite side that contains a small zzso zzso zzso that are thought to be important in binding and function are located on the zzso face of the zzso
