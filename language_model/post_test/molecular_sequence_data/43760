zzso immune responses constitute a major defense against the spread of human zzso virus type 1 zzso However, multiple zzso within a particular zzso may accumulate during disease zzso allowing the virus to escape zzso T zzso zzso zzso the best candidate for a zzso vaccine that would prevent the onset of the disease might be a chain section containing zzso for the generation of zzso in regions of zzso sequences among different zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso mice with synthetic peptides consisting of zzso acids zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in a highly zzso region derived from the major core protein zzso of zzso generates specific zzso as well as zzso Here, we identified one zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso all of which consisted of 10 zzso acids within the zzso In addition, helper T cells primed by the zzso zzso were proliferated by in zzso stimulation with a zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso generated an zzso zzso to zzso but not zzso whereas that with zzso generated an zzso zzso to zzso but not zzso zzso were not generated by zzso with these zzso indicating that the entire sequence of zzso is the helper zzso for zzso Thus, the zzso is a chain section containing zzso for zzso zzso B and helper zzso within a highly zzso region of zzso zzso zzso
