zzso zzso zzso zzso play critical roles in the zzso signal zzso pathways that regulate cell zzso growth, and zzso The structures of several different zzso have revealed a zzso active site architecture in which a zzso loop, together with an zzso zzso cradle the zzso of a zzso zzso and poise it for zzso attack by an zzso zzso zzso We previously reported that binding of zzso to the zzso zzso from zzso induced a loop zzso change that moved zzso acid zzso into the active site, where it can function as a general zzso This is consistent with the zzso acid zzso a zzso to the zzso leaving group during the initial zzso zzso In this report, using a similar structure of the inactive zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso we detail the structural and functional details of this zzso zzso In response to zzso zzso small zzso occur in active site zzso especially zzso zzso and trigger the loop to zzso Interestingly, the zzso bond following zzso zzso has flipped to zzso a zzso active site water zzso that also hydrogen bonds to the bound zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso closure also significantly decreases the zzso accessibility of the bound zzso and could effectively shield zzso zzso from zzso zzso other than zzso We speculate that the intrinsic loop flexibility of different zzso may be related to their zzso rate and may play a role in the wide range of activities observed within this zzso zzso
