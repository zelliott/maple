zzso II zzso zzso is a large zzso zzso zzso with an active site of the zzso Compared with other zzso zzso II has a 200 zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and is active as an zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the insert is important for the formation of the active zzso mass zzso A zzso human zzso II and a zzso zzso II were found to display different zzso characteristics when zzso in human zzso the human zzso was mainly in a zzso inactive state whereas the zzso zzso formed active zzso This was surprising because native human zzso II is zzso from zzso as an active zzso complex, and the zzso sequences of the human and zzso zzso were zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso and a single point zzso the zzso acid responsible for this difference was identified as zzso in the zzso human zzso which zzso to a zzso in the zzso zzso As zzso is zzso in all zzso zzso of zzso II, the zzso zzso with zzso is zzso Nevertheless, as zzso evidently interferes with complex formation, and this zzso is close to the zzso zzso it may also explain why zzso influences zzso zzso The exact mechanism for how the zzso substitution interferes with complex formation remains to be determined, but will be of importance for the understanding of the unique properties of zzso zzso
