zzso zzso genes were initially characterized as floral zzso identity genes and play a key role in flower development among diverse zzso The zzso organization of zzso differs from typical zzso such as zzso and zzso as clear zzso are zzso and instead, a zzso a zzso zzso is zzso To understand the mechanism of reproduction of zzso at the molecular level, zzso a zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso which is one of the original species of zzso The zzso gene consists of a zzso open reading frame and encodes a putative protein of 412 zzso zzso which is zzso identical to zzso and zzso to zzso The expression patterns of zzso during the flower development were zzso and zzso results showed that zzso was strongly expressed in the flower zzso In zzso zzso experiments showed that it is strongly expressed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso primordial zzso throughout the zzso zzso Its expression signals were also detected in zzso leaf primordial zzso and developing zzso zzso
