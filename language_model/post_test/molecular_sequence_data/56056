zzso of the constant regions of zzso zzso zzso delta and two types of gamma T cell zzso zzso chains were obtained by reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso of a zzso peripheral T cell zzso library with these zzso fragments led to the isolation of zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma and delta chain zzso zzso analysis of these clones and the respective zzso fragments demonstrated the existence of one zzso one zzso three gamma and one delta chain zzso Comparisons of the deduced zzso acid sequences of the constant region with other species revealed a significant zzso For two of the three identified zzso gamma chain insertions of 38 and 40 zzso acids were found within the hinge zzso In addition, our sequence data demonstrate a high zzso in the zzso C gamma domain among the three zzso zzso gamma zzso as well as between species, which might be of structural and/or functional zzso zzso with zzso data indicate the existence of four zzso zzso gamma zzso
