zzso analysis of the zzso isolated from zzso cells of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, was zzso Treatment of this zzso zzso zzso with 10 zzso zzso at 100 degrees C for 60 zzso gave a mixture of zzso zzso from zzso to zzso plus zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was then zzso by means of an zzso zzso zzso zzso mixture of zzso zzso and zzso at 40 degrees C for 36 h in order to avoid zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso mixture was zzso on a column of zzso zzso to yield insufficiently resolved zzso zzso higher than zzso and lower zzso ranging from zzso to zzso plus zzso The higher zzso fraction was then zzso with the zzso zzso zzso in order to cleave the zzso zzso and zzso zzso leaving zzso containing the zzso linkage at their zzso terminal sites, zzso beta zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso However, the result of zzso of zzso zzso by means of a zzso zzso mixture of zzso zzso and zzso at 40 degrees C for 13 h was significantly different from that obtained by the mild zzso zzso zzso the amount of zzso was apparently larger than that formed by the mild zzso zzso In zzso a chemical structure for zzso J as a highly zzso zzso containing 14 different branching zzso was zzso
