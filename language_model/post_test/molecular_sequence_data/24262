The zzso finger protein zzso was identified initially as an zzso product and belongs to a family of proteins that contain a zzso motif consisting of a zzso finger, a B box, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by interacting with zzso of zzso and is localized to the zzso or nucleus depending on the cell zzso Here, we have identified the nuclear export signal zzso located in the zzso region of zzso zzso of this zzso or treatment with zzso B zzso the nuclear export of zzso in zzso zzso In addition, fusion of this zzso to other nuclear zzso such as zzso zzso factor zzso resulted in their release into the zzso of zzso zzso Although the zzso function of zzso in zzso cells is masked by another domain in zzso or by another zzso zzso treatment or zzso of zzso active protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso blocked the function of zzso resulting in nuclear zzso of zzso Thus, the nuclear export of zzso is regulated positively by zzso zzso However, zzso was not a direct zzso of zzso and additional signaling pathways may be involved in the regulation of nuclear export of zzso
