zzso is a recently identified zzso that supports the zzso growth of embryonic stem cells, it is zzso active in the absence of zzso zzso zzso is expressed only in zzso phase cells, but not in zzso cells because of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to clarify the zzso expression and its zzso regulation in gastric cancer of zzso zzso Fifteen gastric cancer cell lines were zzso zzso zzso expression and its zzso regulation were examined by reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso sequencing zzso To identify a subset of cancer stem cells, termed zzso zzso zzso cells, flow zzso analysis was zzso zzso is expressed in 8 of the 15 gastric cancer cell lines, but is silenced in the remaining 7 cancer cell lines and normal cell zzso Six of 7 cancer cell lines without zzso expression had promoter zzso which correlated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso following treatment with the DNA zzso inhibitor zzso The percentage of SP fraction of zzso gastric cancer cells was significantly zzso higher zzso in comparison to that of zzso cells zzso These findings suggested that the zzso zzso zzso might be associated with zzso growth of zzso cells, and might be a putative zzso responsible for cancer stem zzso characteristics in gastric zzso Loss of zzso in the promoter of zzso might be one of mechanisms responsible for the zzso of an embryonic zzso in gastric zzso
