zzso combat zzso pathogens by killing infected zzso The molecular targets of their attack are foreign peptides bound to self zzso zzso class I zzso zzso of mice with peptides containing zzso zzso was shown to elicit zzso zzso Here, we have achieved in zzso zzso zzso with naturally processed 8-10 zzso acid long class zzso peptides zzso in an zzso A zzso zzso and zzso relevant response was obtained using peptides from an zzso zzso and five viruses (including zzso in two zzso zzso zzso This method is suitable for multiple zzso since a zzso of peptides derived from three pathogens zzso zzso zzso against each zzso Most importantly, zzso zzso zzso were zzso These results have implications for zzso induction in situations where zzso T cells are depleted or compromised, as is the case in zzso zzso
