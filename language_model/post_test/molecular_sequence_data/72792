The evolutionary dynamics of 22 zzso of cucumber mosaic virus satellite zzso zzso zzso isolated in Italy during virus zzso from 1988 to 1993 were investigated on the basis of their primary structure and biological zzso Most of the zzso were amplified from total zzso acid preparations extracted from zzso plants, thus representing wild zzso of zzso zzso Eleven zzso were associated with zzso II zzso zzso 10 with zzso I and 1 with a mixed infection by both zzso When zzso onto tomato zzso the zzso induced the zzso zzso or zzso predicted by their zzso zzso zzso relationships between the zzso zzso were determined using the stationary zzso model, a zzso model for zzso For each zzso the zzso analysis gave a good correlation between position in the zzso tree and biological zzso The zzso with zzso and zzso zzso in tomato followed two different evolutionary dynamics in zzso zzso a zzso zzso followed a third type of evolutionary dynamic far apart from that of the shorter zzso molecules zzso those in the zzso to zzso zzso Average values of the mean constant rate of zzso zzso zzso indicated that in nature the zzso tend to keep their zzso unchanged from one epidemic episode to the other, even if the outbreaks occur in places very far from each zzso This seems to be in agreement with the proposed maintenance of a functional molecular structure as a constraint to zzso zzso zzso
