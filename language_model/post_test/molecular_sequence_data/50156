The production of zzso the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso species, is controlled by many regulatory zzso We focused on the major regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso characterized mainly in zzso zzso and tested for their presence and function in the control of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso production in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not of zzso and zzso were detected by Southern zzso analyses in zzso zzso zzso zzso In fact, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso had high zzso acid identities to those of zzso zzso including a complete match of the hypothetical zzso zzso zzso However, in Western zzso analyses using zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein was present in both zzso species, although zzso production in zzso zzso zzso zzso was not further zzso by adding plant extract into the medium containing PGA zzso zzso in which zzso by zzso has been reported in zzso zzso zzso When plasmids that contained each of these regulatory genes from zzso zzso were introduced into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production was controlled as predicted from their roles in zzso zzso except for zzso zzso exerted a positive control in zzso zzso zzso zzso in contrast to a negative control in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso could bind to the promoter regions of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso may regulate zzso and zzso production as in zzso zzso However, the presence of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was not identified in this study, though these proteins of zzso zzso were functional on the promoter regions of the zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso
