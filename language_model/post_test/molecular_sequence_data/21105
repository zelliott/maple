zzso zzso is thought to resemble that of zzso a zzso essential for zzso metabolism in all zzso zzso arises from an initial zzso of two molecules of zzso zzso zzso to form zzso zzso zzso which then zzso a reductive zzso to form zzso In principle, zzso could arise from an alternative zzso of the zzso zzso Because of these proposed similarities, we predicted that a zzso zzso would resemble zzso zzso and hence isolated zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso race zzso While zzso zzso does harbor at least one typical zzso zzso none of the other three zzso zzso zzso genes encodes for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso while zzso does not appear able to directly zzso zzso as a zzso However, when combinations of the zzso zzso were mixed together, in zzso and in zzso robust zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was zzso These findings were unexpected because zzso zzso an ancient and likely zzso to the other zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso reaction within a single zzso unit without intermediate release, yet in zzso zzso these activities appear to have separated and evolved zzso for specialized zzso oil production greater than zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso genes in different zzso as independent zzso as gene zzso or targeted to zzso zzso also demonstrate the potential for engineering even greater efficiencies of zzso zzso
