We describe here a simple and easily zzso zzso zzso genetic system that permits us to identify bacterial gene products that zzso the sensitivity of bacteria to zzso agents, such as zzso zzso a zzso zzso To the extent that the action of these agents is zzso these studies may expand our understanding agents is zzso these studies may expand our understanding of how the agents work in zzso zzso The approach briefly is to use a library of zzso coli genes that are zzso in a high copy number zzso to select bacterial clones that are resistant to the zzso effects of zzso zzso bacterial zzso is used to maximize zzso of cells to zzso organic zzso By using zzso 840 to model the system, we have identified two zzso designated zzso and zzso that impart resistance to zzso 840 when they are expressed at elevated zzso zzso maps to zzso coli map coordinate 66, is located between the zzso and zzso zzso and encodes a protein of 22 zzso zzso maps to zzso coli map coordinate 18, is located adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso and encodes a protein of 24 zzso zzso and zzso overproduction of both of these proteins zzso with zzso 840 zzso zzso of the zzso protein also zzso resistance to two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, overproduction of the zzso protein produces resistance only to zzso Based on its zzso properties and its location between genes that zzso the two zzso of the bacterial zzso IV, we suggest that zzso acts by modulating zzso IV zzso The location of the zzso gene adjacent to zzso suggests it acts by a drug zzso zzso
