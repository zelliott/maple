Growth factors zzso regulate a variety of genes associated with pathological states including tumor invasion and zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso on tumor cell surfaces is associated with enhanced cell attachment and migration into zzso zzso which promotes tumor zzso We have demonstrated that zzso growth factor zzso zzso the cell surface zzso zzso zzso at both the zzso and protein levels on mouse zzso expressing full-length zzso zzso zzso but not on zzso cells zzso This increases cell attachment to zzso zzso In this investigation, zzso regulation of zzso by zzso was confirmed by defining an zzso zzso By employing human zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells, zzso zzso was observed within a zzso pair zzso DNA zzso located 450 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso zzso zzso zzso was found among different cell lines zzso indicating a zzso and zzso enhancement in zzso cells carrying zzso zzso zzso and in zzso cells, respectively, while minimal zzso induction was found in cervical cancer zzso zzso zzso gel shift zzso a zzso increase of zzso complex formation was found upon zzso stimulation in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso Based upon these zzso a novel zzso zzso regulatory element zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso gene zzso This zzso zzso zzso binding ability in zzso as well as the full functional recovery of zzso zzso of zzso activity when linked to a zzso zzso promoter or a zzso promoter driving a zzso reporter zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso completely eliminated its binding activity as well as its zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our studies indicate that zzso zzso zzso gene expression through an interaction between a specific zzso and putative novel zzso factor so as to regulate cell attachment to zzso zzso
