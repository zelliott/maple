The zzso gene zzso the major surface zzso of zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso In spite of the overall sequence zzso with the zzso genes from other zzso species, particularly with the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso ends of these genes are clearly divergent zzso zzso To study the prevalence of zzso zzso in the zzso from dogs with visceral zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was expressed in zzso zzso It was found that zzso of the zzso from these dogs recognized the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it must function as a potent B cell zzso during natural canine visceral zzso However, zzso in the level of response was zzso Fine mapping of the zzso zzso was performed by means of 6 overlapping zzso of the zzso protein and by the use of a library of synthetic zzso The data showed that there is some degree of zzso restriction in the recognition of the protein since zzso was observed zzso against the most divergent zzso The zzso mapping of this region showed 2 zzso peptides the response to which seems to be zzso of the zzso zzso
