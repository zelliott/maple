zzso 10 genes from a short zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso a new G zzso strain were cloned and their sequences compared to the zzso segment 11 sequences of zzso zzso and UK zzso The determined zzso sequences were 817 zzso and zzso zzso bases in length and showed extensively zzso zzso zzso and protein coding zzso The major open reading frame codes for a protein of 200 zzso or 198 zzso zzso zzso and the newly proposed second open reading frame can code for a protein of 92 zzso zzso Compared to long strain gene zzso the base sequences of the short and zzso strains were found to contain extended, zzso 3' zzso regions which were not significantly zzso to each other, to other parts of the zzso zzso or to other zzso genes that have been zzso The zzso of these 3' regions is not zzso
