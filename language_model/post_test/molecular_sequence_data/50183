zzso zzso zzso zzso highly zzso regions of zzso proteins were used with the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences partially zzso seven additional members of the zzso gene family were isolated using this zzso These zzso have been given the designation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso based on their zzso acid identity with previously described zzso With regard to the timing of expression of these zzso during embryonic development, zzso the least abundant transcript, was first detected during the zzso stage, while zzso transcripts were first detected at the zzso stage, and decreased by the zzso zzso Multiple transcripts of zzso were detected at varied times during development beginning at the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were not detected until the zzso zzso With regard to expression in adult zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all expressed abundantly in the brain, and to a lesser extent in a variety of other zzso zzso in zzso zzso was then employed to monitor the spatial expression of selected zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were detected in distinct areas of the developing brain of zzso zzso The zzso and spatial differences in expression suggest different roles for these new zzso family members in zzso zzso
