We have determined the zzso sequence of the zzso half of the zzso zzso of Murray Valley encephalitis virus zzso using seven overlapping zzso zzso an estimated zzso zzso at the extreme zzso remain to be zzso In conjunction with previous sequence data for the zzso half zzso we can conclude that the zzso zzso contains a long open reading frame of zzso zzso that encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso deduced zzso acid sequence with that of other zzso shows that zzso is most closely related to Japanese encephalitis virus, consistent with zzso zzso Using zzso zzso acid sequence analysis, three zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso have been identified and mapped on the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains sequence motifs suggesting that its zzso zzso may function as a zzso zzso The central region of zzso (in the linear zzso acid zzso has motifs that are found in zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso sequence that is thought to be essential for zzso zzso zzso
