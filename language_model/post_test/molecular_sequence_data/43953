zzso zzso protein zzso is a member of the zzso gene family and is zzso expressed in zzso and zzso zzso in a highly coordinated pattern during zzso In the present study, we describe the isolation and characterization of the zzso zzso A zzso DASH II zzso rat zzso library was screened with a labeled zzso complementary DNA, resulting in the isolation of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso alone was found to contain the full-length zzso gene and was used for subsequent zzso The zzso gene possesses a zzso zzso zzso Relative to other highly zzso members of the zzso gene family, zzso contains a single small additional zzso zzso 3) situated between zzso 2 and 3 of the zzso zzso zzso The region corresponding to zzso 3 of zzso encodes for a unique zzso acid region found in a subset of zzso family zzso A reverse zzso zzso tissue survey for zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso expression was restricted to zzso and zzso zzso A single zzso start site 65 zzso upstream of the initiation zzso was identified in zzso zzso whereas multiple zzso start sites ranging from zzso zzso upstream of the initiation zzso were detected in zzso zzso Various tissue culture systems zzso cultures and cell zzso were evaluated for zzso expression and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso and zzso giant cell populations expressed zzso and were capable of zzso the zzso zzso zzso whereas other cell types were zzso Limited zzso promoter zzso was noted in zzso zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso possesses a unique zzso zzso gene structure and exhibits zzso expression that is regulated at least in part by a zzso zzso zzso
