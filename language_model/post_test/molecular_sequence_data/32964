Fusion and affinity tags are popular tools for the expression of zzso proteins in zzso To facilitate the selection of expression approaches, a systematic comparison was zzso We zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli zzso and zzso fusion proteins with zzso or zzso The tagging of zzso with zzso or zzso was necessary to express properly folded and biologically active zzso Similar enhancement of zzso activity was obtained by fusion to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tags did not appreciably interfere with zzso zzso Fusion proteins were specifically zzso without altering the zzso of zzso After zzso zzso remained soluble and active with a specific activity comparable to that of the fused zzso Similar activity was observed with zzso and zzso of zzso Higher purity but significantly lower yields of zzso were obtained using zzso zzso we demonstrated zzso and zzso fusion proteins similarly enhanced the proper folding of zzso expressed in zzso zzso In comparison to previous expressions of zzso as a zzso fusion, zzso and zzso zzso provided higher yields and easier zzso and zzso
