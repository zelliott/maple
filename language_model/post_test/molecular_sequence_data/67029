We present a study of the zzso of complementary DNA hairpin zzso with particular reference to their use as fuel for autonomous DNA zzso The rate of spontaneous zzso between complementary zzso can be reduced by increasing the neck length or decreasing the loop zzso zzso with larger zzso rapidly form zzso kissed zzso zzso zzso may be opened by strand displacement using an opening strand that contains the same sequence as half of the neck and a zzso complementary to a zzso domain adjacent to the zzso We find loop opening via an external toehold to be zzso times faster than via an internal zzso We measure rates of loop opening by opening strands that are at least 1000 times faster than the spontaneous interaction between zzso We discuss suitable choices for loop, neck, and toehold length for hairpin zzso to be used as fuel for autonomous DNA zzso
