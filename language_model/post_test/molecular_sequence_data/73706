We have previously identified the zzso zzso as a common zzso for latex allergic zzso zzso The B cell zzso in the zzso protein that are recognized by zzso of zzso individuals have not been zzso In this study, we examined the zzso zzso using zzso zzso Overlapping synthetic peptides of 10 zzso acids zzso zzso zzso were zzso on a zzso cellulose membrane using zzso zzso The zzso spots were zzso with pooled zzso from 10 zzso patients, and the zzso peptides identified with zzso zzso We identified six B cell zzso within the full length zzso zzso which bound zzso from zzso zzso Two were located in the zzso zzso zzso domain and four were observed in the zzso zzso A broad zzso was located between the zzso zzso acids zzso This zzso had nearly complete zzso to wheat germ zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was confirmed by Western zzso analysis with zzso zzso and this zzso could be inhibited by latex proteins or zzso Of the five remaining zzso four had zzso to other proteins in the zzso family of plant proteins zzso The data demonstrate that zzso has multiple zzso zzso The significant zzso of these zzso to a broad family of plant zzso proteins further explains the increased prevalence of food zzso in zzso zzso
