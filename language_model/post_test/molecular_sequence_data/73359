The binding of zzso growth factor zzso to its zzso leads to zzso zzso which activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso models of the inactive and active forms of the zzso zzso zzso have been zzso and these models suggest that the active form can be stabilized by the interaction of zzso C and the surrounding area in one zzso zzso with one of two possible complementary surfaces on a second zzso zzso Both zzso interaction sites are strongly zzso within the zzso family but not in other zzso zzso Two of the three predicted zzso zzso are zzso the other is zzso and is predicted to contain only one active zzso One of the zzso models and the zzso model would account for the effects of two zzso in zzso C zzso and zzso on zzso zzso They also provide an explanation for previously reported dominant negative zzso of the zzso zzso and have interesting implications for the signaling through zzso and zzso of the family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
