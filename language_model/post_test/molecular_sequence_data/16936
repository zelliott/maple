A family of zzso zzso Aurora constitutes a key regulator in the orchestration of zzso zzso The human Aurora zzso zzso zzso and zzso have a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso studies on the role of zzso and zzso have revealed distinct zzso and functions in regulating zzso zzso whereas little is known about zzso The present study shows that human zzso is a zzso passenger protein that forms complexes with zzso and inner zzso protein zzso which are known passenger zzso We show that zzso binds and activates zzso in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso elicits the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, even though this zzso is not sufficient to establish zzso zzso in zzso zzso We therefore suggest that zzso is a novel zzso passenger protein that zzso with zzso to regulate zzso zzso dynamics in zzso zzso
