To test the hypothesis that many viruses remain to be discovered in plants, a procedure was developed to sequence zzso acids cloned randomly from zzso particle zzso of plant zzso As a test of the efficiency of the procedure we targeted zzso zzso western zzso plants growing at the zzso Prairie zzso of northeastern zzso zzso zzso acid was found in the zzso from six of twelve specimens and sequences were characterized from four of zzso Evidence was obtained for the presence of viruses belonging to two families zzso zzso Multiple viral species were found in two of the four specimens and their level within the isolated zzso acid population varied from less than zzso None of the sequences were derived from reported sequences of known zzso Thus, the analysis of zzso acid from zzso particles is a useful tool to expand our knowledge of the universe of viruses to zzso zzso
