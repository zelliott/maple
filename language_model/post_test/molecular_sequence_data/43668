We have mapped the origin of DNA replication zzso downstream of the 23 S zzso gene in each copy of the zzso repeat zzso of tobacco zzso DNA between positions zzso and zzso zzso by a combination of zzso In zzso zzso DNA replication zzso were examined by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso arc patterns suggestive of replication zzso containing extended zzso regions were observed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and an overlapping zzso zzso from one end of the zzso zzso while only simple Y patterns were observed with a zzso zzso zzso zzso internal to the zzso zzso Other restriction fragments of tobacco zzso DNA besides those at the zzso region also generated only simple Y patterns in two-dimensional zzso zzso Several zzso DNA clones from this region were tested for their ability to support in zzso DNA replication using a partially zzso zzso protein zzso zzso with a deletion of 154 zzso from the zzso to the zzso sites near the end of the zzso repeat resulted in a considerable loss of in zzso DNA replication zzso These results support the presence of a replication origin at the end of the zzso zzso The zzso end of nascent DNA from the replication displacement loop was identified at position zzso for zzso zzso for zzso by primer zzso A single major product insensitive to zzso and zzso treatment was observed and mapped to the base of a zzso structure which contains one of two neighboring zzso sites near the end of each zzso zzso This provides the first precise determination of the start site of DNA synthesis from zzso zzso DNA fragments containing the zzso structure and the zzso region exhibit zzso gel mobility shift activity when incubated with the replication protein zzso suggesting the presence of multiple binding zzso
