A zzso zzso zzso was identified within a zzso element that allows zzso zzso to use nitrate as an electron zzso Three of them zzso zzso to components of bacterial respiratory zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The fourth zzso zzso encodes a membrane protein with no zzso in the protein data zzso zzso reduction with zzso was zzso by membrane zzso of the wild type strain, but was severely impaired in zzso zzso zzso A fusion to a zzso reporter gene was used for the first time in zzso zzso to show that expression of zzso required the presence of nitrate and zzso zzso zzso a role for the zzso products as a new type of membrane zzso specific for nitrate zzso was zzso zzso with this, zzso zzso grew more slowly than the wild type strain under zzso conditions, but not in the presence of zzso The zzso structure of this zzso was deduced from the analysis of zzso zzso and a zzso bacterial zzso zzso to the membrane of zzso zzso and zzso was dependent on zzso whose zzso C zzso interacts with the three zzso zzso were also detected between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso produced zzso of zzso but not of zzso These data lead us to conclude that the zzso proteins form a distinct third type of bacterial respiratory zzso
