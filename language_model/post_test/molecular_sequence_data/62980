During zzso development of higher plants, the shoot zzso zzso produces lateral zzso in a regular spacing zzso and a regular timing zzso zzso analysis of zzso associated with zzso and zzso would greatly increase understanding of the zzso mechanism of plant architecture because zzso and zzso are fundamental regulators of plant zzso zzso of rice is not only a zzso zzso showing rapid leaf initiation without affecting zzso but also a zzso zzso showing zzso shoot formation in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso provides a tool for analyzing the molecular basis of zzso regulation in leaf zzso In this work, we isolated the zzso gene by zzso zzso The identified zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso which potentially zzso substances controlling plant zzso zzso is expressed in developing leaf zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso but not in the shoot zzso zzso The expression pattern and zzso zzso suggest that the zzso gene acting in developing leaf zzso affects the timing of successive leaf initiation and the termination of zzso zzso
