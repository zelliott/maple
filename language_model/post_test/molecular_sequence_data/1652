zzso coli zzso a zzso strain isolated from a urine zzso in Japan, produced an zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso contained a number of zzso and a zzso deletion zzso compared with the sequence of native zzso of zzso zzso When the deletion was reverted by a zzso zzso at the relevant site of zzso in the zzso the typical zzso zzso of zzso was zzso while at the same time the levels of resistance to zzso zzso and zzso were reduced zzso or zzso zzso modeling studies indicated that a structural change took place in the zzso zzso as a result of the zzso and this change caused an zzso of the zzso binding site, leading to a unique zzso analogous to that of zzso class A zzso zzso The degree of zzso was greater with zzso and zzso than with zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report to have characterized an zzso coli zzso that encodes zzso zzso zzso sensitive to the available zzso zzso
