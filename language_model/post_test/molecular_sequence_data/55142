zzso cell death zzso plays an important role in insect zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso is triggered by the steroid hormone zzso zzso and it is zzso by a series of zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso triggers zzso zzso is still zzso Here, we report a protein zzso 6 zzso from zzso zzso playing roles in zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso during zzso growth and it is significantly increased during zzso The increase was proven to be regulated by zzso The juvenile hormone analog zzso has no effect on zzso zzso zzso interference analysis suggests that zzso zzso the zzso transcript levels through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso feeding or zzso zzso injection resulted in the repression of the zzso zzso during the zzso zzso The mechanism was demonstrated to be through the suppression of genes such as Broad zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are involved in zzso signaling zzso or zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso is involved in the zzso signal zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso in zzso
