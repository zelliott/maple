Small zzso zzso zzso are involved in precursor zzso zzso zzso processing and zzso base modification zzso zzso and zzso In all zzso certain zzso zzso zzso are transcribed from classical zzso In zzso the majority are zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and are released by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene clusters are transcribed as zzso zzso transcripts from which individual zzso are zzso In this article, 43 clusters of zzso zzso an zzso zzso and 10 single genes have been identified by cloning and by computer searches, giving a total of 136 zzso gene copies of 71 different zzso zzso Of these, 31 represent zzso genes novel to zzso A cluster of four zzso zzso genes and two clusters containing five different zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso have been isolated and zzso Of these zzso zzso is a novel box zzso zzso that has the potential to base pair with the 3' end of zzso zzso and zzso is a box zzso zzso zzso In addition, 42 putative sites of zzso zzso in plant zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been mapped by primer extension analysis, including eight sites novel to plant zzso The results clearly show that, in plants, the most common gene organization is zzso and that over a third of predicted and mapped zzso sites are novel to plant zzso The variation in this organization among gene clusters highlights mechanisms of zzso zzso
