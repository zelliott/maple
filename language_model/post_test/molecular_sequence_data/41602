Culture of bacteria from zzso zzso in respiratory patients has low sensitivity and does not allow for complete assessment of microbial diversity across different zzso zzso In addition, a significant number of clinical studies are based on zzso samples, and it is not known to what extent they describe the real diversity of the zzso In order to identify previously zzso lower airway bacteria and to investigate the complexity and distribution of zzso in patients with chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso we performed zzso amplification and zzso of the zzso zzso gene in patients not showing signs or symptoms of zzso Four types of respiratory samples zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were taken from each individual, obtaining on average zzso zzso zzso sequences per zzso The total number of zzso per patient was zzso showing a high diversity, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso being the most commonly zzso zzso samples showed significantly lower diversity than the other three sample zzso zzso samples, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a very similar bacterial compositions in contrast to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso zzso samples are upper zzso tree samples that are not representative of the lower zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso samples showed the results closest to those for the zzso zzso Our data confirm that the zzso tree is not sterile in COPD patients and support the existence a different zzso in the upper and lower zzso
