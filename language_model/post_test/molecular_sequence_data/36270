Several studies have indicated that the capture of zzso by the zzso fungus zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso on the zzso zzso One of the major surface proteins of this fungus showed zzso activity and was isolated by affinity zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the protein was a zzso zzso with a molecular mass of 36 zzso and an zzso point of pH zzso and contained no zzso zzso zzso The protein was zzso zzso four internal peptides were zzso and showed no significant similarity to sequences in the zzso or zzso zzso The zzso activity of the isolated protein was not inhibited by any of the zzso or zzso tested, but it was inhibited by the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso activity changed after zzso the protein in buffers of different zzso with zzso activity at pH zzso and no activity at pH zzso The zzso was tested for different zzso activities but none were zzso Analysis of the zzso activity in various cell zzso indicated that the protein was associated with zzso zzso layers and with the cell wall of the zzso About the same amount of the zzso protein was recovered from samples of zzso zzso and of zzso containing zzso zzso
