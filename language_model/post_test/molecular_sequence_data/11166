zzso zzso mapping the zzso zzso 15 zzso protein performed in this study in three zzso strains of mice with B10 genetic background revealed at least three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso located in the highly zzso putative zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells derived from mice zzso with the zzso protein or with synthetic zzso peptides showed that zzso zzso zzso only in the zzso zzso zzso zzso could be presented by both zzso and zzso zzso while the zzso region covered by three overlapping peptides could be efficiently recognized in context of all three zzso class II zzso zzso zzso experiments with blocking zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was presented by zzso and zzso zzso was presented by both zzso and zzso In addition, evidence was obtained that zzso zzso was presented in context of zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso was presented in context of zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the Norwegian outer membrane zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso could recall responses in mice zzso with synthetic peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso Altogether, these results suggest that zzso zzso identified on the zzso 15 zzso zzso particularly those presented by several zzso class II molecules zzso zzso could have important implications for the development of zzso zzso
