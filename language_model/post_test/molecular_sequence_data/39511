The human beta zzso locus contains two adjacent zzso each capable of initiating DNA replication when transferred from its native locus to zzso zzso Here, we report a detailed analysis of the sequence requirements for replication initiation from these zzso In both zzso initiation required a combination of an zzso zzso sequence and several zzso zzso zzso from the two zzso could combine to initiate zzso zzso sequences were essential for zzso activity: a low frequency of initiation was observed in DNA fragments that included a short stretch of zzso zzso whereas inclusion of additional zzso stretches increased initiation zzso By contrast, replication initiated at a low level without the zzso zzso zzso but they were required in zzso to achieve efficient zzso These data support a zzso model for zzso activity and suggest that the initiation of DNA replication requires interaction between at least two distinct sequence zzso
