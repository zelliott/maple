zzso a zzso zzso protein from zzso coli outer zzso was zzso from inclusion bodies and zzso in two different zzso The zzso channel is a zzso zzso with short zzso turns and seven zzso zzso zzso grown at neutral pH show the channel in the open state at zzso A zzso In the zzso A structure of zzso grown at pH zzso the pore is blocked by loop 6, which folds across the zzso The zzso of loop 6 appears to be triggered by a pair of zzso zzso which repel one another at zzso zzso resulting in the breakage of zzso zzso and a lengthening of loop 6 from 10 to 17 zzso A total of 151 ordered zzso zzso molecules were found in the zzso A structure, mostly on the zzso outer surface of zzso mimicking the outer membrane zzso zzso with three zzso molecules in the open zzso In the zzso A structure, zzso binds one zzso and one zzso zzso as sugar zzso in the closed zzso
