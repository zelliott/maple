zzso zzso function has been zzso as a primary zzso event in zzso zzso lineage zzso factor 2 zzso encodes a zzso factor central to zzso zzso Analysis of zzso in a zzso sample zzso zzso approximately zzso in the zzso revealed several zzso to be associated with schizophrenia zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso To obtain independent support for this association, we sought evidence for genetic interaction between zzso and three genes of relevance to zzso function for which we have reported evidence for association with zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found interaction effects on disease risk between zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso corrected P zzso zzso for interaction with zzso zzso P zzso zzso corrected P zzso zzso but no evidence for interaction with zzso To investigate the biological zzso of the zzso we sought correlations between the expression of the zzso The results were similar to those of the genetic interaction zzso zzso expression significantly correlated in cerebral zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected P zzso zzso but not zzso In mouse zzso zzso and zzso expression also was zzso and linkage analysis for zzso on gene expression suggests that each locus regulates the other's zzso Our data provide strong zzso evidence that variation in zzso zzso zzso to schizophrenia alone and as part of a network of genes implicated in zzso zzso
