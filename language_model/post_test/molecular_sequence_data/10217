zzso protein zzso a ubiquitous zzso binding protein composed of an alpha and a beta zzso is important for zzso assembly and cell zzso Lower organisms have one gene and one zzso of each zzso zzso have two very similar zzso zzso To determine if zzso in general contain multiple alpha zzso and if those alpha zzso have zzso zzso we isolated and analyzed alpha zzso zzso in mice and zzso Both mice and humans also have two alpha zzso zzso analysis of the alpha zzso sequences reveals that zzso have two highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are very similar to each other but can be defined and distinguished from each other by a small number of key zzso acid zzso In addition, 3' untranslated zzso sequences are zzso within the zzso zzso To investigate the function of the alpha zzso we examined their expression in mouse cells and zzso zzso cells contain only the zzso zzso and zzso contain almost exclusively the zzso zzso Most zzso have both zzso and zzso zzso but the ratio of zzso varies zzso Together, these findings support the hypothesis that the zzso alpha zzso have zzso unique and essential roles in zzso
