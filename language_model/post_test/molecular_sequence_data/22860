zzso is the most common genetic form of zzso inherited as an zzso dominant zzso zzso affected with zzso have impaired ability to form bone from cartilage zzso bone zzso zzso zzso is a zzso lethal zzso The vast majority of patients with zzso have a zzso transition at position zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso resulting in the zzso substitution at position 380 of the zzso zzso This zzso has been diagnosed by zzso zzso of amplified zzso zzso However, it has also been demonstrated that the zzso zzso protocol does not consistently distinguish between DNA samples zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso This study was designed to improve the molecular diagnosis based on the zzso chain reaction zzso and restriction zzso length zzso zzso techniques for the zzso zzso zzso The newly designed forward primer contains one mismatch zzso at position zzso from the zzso zzso sequence (A at position zzso thereby creating a zzso site zzso at positions zzso to zzso in the amplified DNA from zzso containing the zzso zzso The zzso technique based on the zzso zzso of amplified zzso DNA with a novel forward primer shows zzso accuracy in diagnosis of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
