One of the main factors affecting the performance of rotating biological zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso a deep understanding of the microbial population dynamics and structure of the zzso is mandatory if zzso of organic matter and nutrients removal is zzso This study focused on the effects of organic shock loads of zzso zzso on the microbial diversity present in an zzso zzso The zzso was seeded with activated sludge from a conventional wastewater treatment plant and was operated during zzso During the first zzso the zzso was subjected to intermittent zzso shocks of zzso and no degradation zzso zzso the reactor was subsequently zzso with a zzso strain zzso zzso the zzso had a stable performance when subjected to zzso shocks up to zzso and to a zzso period, as indicated by removal of the zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso revealed large shifts in microbial communities present in the first and fifth zzso although no clear relation between the sample collection time and spatial factor was zzso zzso affiliation of some zzso members was assessed by direct sequencing of correspondent zzso zzso Affiliations to zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Several bacterial strains isolated from the reactor showed capacity for zzso zzso zzso zzso was successfully recovered from the zzso by zzso and by zzso reinforcing that zzso was successfully zzso
