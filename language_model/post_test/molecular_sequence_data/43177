The zzso of transport zzso with their target membrane is thought to be zzso by zzso We show here that zzso a zzso zzso zzso interacts specifically with zzso and so could provide a membrane zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso binds to zzso whereas the zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or a zzso derived from the zzso prevented binding to zzso The zzso also inhibited the zzso but not the zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso fragments, unless it was zzso zzso Together, these data provide a molecular explanation for the zzso fragmentation of the zzso apparatus at the onset of zzso
