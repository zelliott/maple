The fate of the type I zzso protein zzso zzso when initially targeted to the zzso zzso zzso in tobacco zzso has been zzso We find that zzso expression causes a marked decrease in protein zzso indicating that a fraction of the toxin reaches the zzso and zzso tobacco zzso We determined that zzso is largely zzso but some is retained zzso most likely in a zzso zzso thus behaving very differently from the zzso zzso zzso A zzso We also find that the signal zzso can interfere with the zzso activity of zzso when the protein fails to be targeted to the zzso zzso and that zzso toxicity zzso signal zzso regulation when the host cell is subjected to zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso signal zzso with that of the zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso toxicity and makes it independent of cell zzso We propose that this zzso toxicity may have a role in pathogen zzso
