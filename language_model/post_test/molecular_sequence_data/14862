The zzso zzso zzso represents the major route to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso in higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso function as zzso zzso converting zzso to zzso thus catalyzing the first committed step in the zzso of zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso described in higher plants is zzso in green zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes all the zzso required for vitamin C zzso via the zzso zzso We have characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso as an active zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso stress show increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso components of the zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also zzso in response to increased zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso like its plant zzso is a highly regulated zzso in zzso zzso in green algae and that, together with the zzso recycling system, the zzso zzso represents the major route for providing protective levels of zzso in zzso stressed zzso zzso
