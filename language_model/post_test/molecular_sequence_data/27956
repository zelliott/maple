zzso acid sequence stretches similar to the four most zzso segments of positive strand zzso viral zzso zzso zzso have been identified in proteins of four zzso viruses belonging to three families, zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso 2 product of infectious zzso disease virus zzso zzso 3 protein of zzso and zzso of zzso virus zzso High statistical significance of the observed similarity was demonstrated, allowing identification of these proteins as likely candidates for zzso zzso zzso Based on these zzso and on the previously reported sequence similarity between the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso virus and those of positive strand zzso zzso a possible evolutionary relationship between the two virus classes is zzso
