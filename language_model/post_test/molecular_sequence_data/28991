zzso of zzso zzso uses two DNA zzso sites and six zzso recognition sites, with each recognition site divided into two zzso The recognition sites can activate zzso of zzso DNA sequences if a complete set of zzso sequences is not zzso We have analyzed 18 sequences from a zzso DNA zzso selected in a functional zzso for the ability to be zzso by zzso zzso These sequences are remarkably zzso Nonetheless, when viewed as a group they resemble a zzso DNA end, with a zzso site and a single recognition zzso Analysis of these zzso zzso indicates that most positions in the zzso and recognition sites contribute zzso information that helps drive zzso though only the strongest contributors are apparent from zzso zzso The sequence analysis also suggests zzso in the alignment of recognition zzso zzso zzso of specifically designed DNA zzso support the conclusion that the zzso machinery is flexible enough to permit zzso in zzso spacing and also perhaps zzso in the placement of the recognition site with respect to the zzso zzso This zzso causes only local zzso in the zzso complex, as indicated by experiments in which altered and zzso DNA zzso are zzso
