zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso which was described as a zzso zzso was zzso to clarify its zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence comparisons demonstrated that this strain clusters zzso with species of the zzso zzso and represents a new zzso The results of investigations of the fatty acid patterns, polar zzso profiles, and zzso system supported this zzso The zzso zzso profile and zzso characteristics displayed no obvious similarity to the characteristics of any previously described species of the zzso zzso The new name zzso zzso is proposed on the basis of these results and previously published data for the G + C content of the zzso DNA and the zzso zzso
