zzso of zzso zzso during sea zzso zzso zzso development, is zzso and temporally zzso In order to characterize this zzso we isolated the relevant zzso sequences and scanned the isolated zzso region in searching for zzso elements required for proper zzso zzso mobility shift and zzso zzso as well as reporter gene zzso and zzso expression zzso were used to address zzso elements involved in zzso Here we report that an upstream zzso zzso of zzso gene drives zzso expression of reporter genes zzso with that of zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains zzso able to bind nuclear proteins from the zzso stage (at which the zzso gene is zzso whose sequences could be consistent with the consensus sequences for zzso factors present in data zzso
