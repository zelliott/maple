A key feature in Huntington disease zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which may be regulated by zzso zzso Here, we define the primary sites of zzso in the zzso domain of zzso show modification downstream of this domain, and demonstrate that zzso is modified by the zzso zzso A systematic study of zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso is zzso zzso zzso for both zzso zzso and zzso modification and that reduction of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso model is zzso zzso modification regulates zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells in a manner that mimics zzso zzso and can be modulated by zzso and acute zzso of zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso proteins in the zzso fraction of HD zzso zzso implicates zzso modification in the age-related zzso zzso of zzso zzso and other cellular proteins that occurs during HD zzso
