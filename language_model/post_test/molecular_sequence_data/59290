The inner zzso of zzso contain a family of transport proteins of related sequence and zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso of zzso zzso encodes at least 35 members of this zzso Three of them can be zzso as known zzso of the zzso zzso and two others as the zzso and zzso zzso The transport functions of the remainder cannot be identified with zzso One of them, zzso on zzso zzso zzso shows a fairly close sequence relationship to the known sequence of the bovine zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein has been obtained by zzso in zzso coli, zzso into zzso zzso and shown to have transport properties characteristic of the zzso carrier for zzso zzso such as zzso and also zzso previously zzso zzso but not zzso from both zzso and zzso zzso This is the first example of the zzso identification of an unknown membrane protein zzso in the zzso zzso since the completion of the zzso zzso
