zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein that mediates zzso interactions in cell cycle control and protein zzso It has been reported to form complexes with zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the 19 S regulator of the 26 S zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso It is the first protein described to bind both to the 26 S zzso and to proteins in other complexes containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities, thus providing a mechanism for delivering cell cycle regulating machinery and zzso zzso to the zzso for zzso zzso contains a zzso motif known as the zzso repeat that occurs five and a half to six times in the zzso As a step toward understanding zzso interactions with its protein partners we have determined its three-dimensional crystal structure to zzso zzso It reveals that the entire zzso zzso zzso folds into seven zzso repeat zzso The zzso repeats, consisting of an zzso zzso followed by a zzso oriented zzso pack zzso creating an extended curved structure with a groove running across the long zzso zzso zzso with the structures of other zzso repeat proteins suggests that interactions with partner proteins are zzso by zzso situated on this zzso zzso
