The plasmids zzso and zzso are zzso derivatives that replicate at a copy number several fold higher than the parent during growth of zzso coli at 37 degrees zzso We show here that the high copy number of zzso plasmids results from a single point zzso in the replication zzso zzso II, and that the zzso effects of this zzso can be suppressed by the zzso zzso one zzso protein or by lowering the growth temperature to 30 degrees zzso The zzso effects are enhanced by cell growth at 42 degrees C, at which copy number is further zzso During normal cell growth, the zzso zzso does not affect the length or function of zzso I, the zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso but may, as computer analysis suggests, alter the secondary structure of zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso zzso interactions between the zzso and the primer by producing a zzso zzso of the zzso II zzso The zzso protein may either promote normal folding of the zzso zzso II or, zzso may enable the interaction of zzso folded zzso II with the zzso
