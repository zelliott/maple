zzso zzso have emerged as key components in the zzso gene regulatory zzso We and others have previously identified many zzso in a zzso green zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether zzso gene regulation is a general mechanism in green algae and how zzso have been evolved in the green zzso zzso we examined small zzso in zzso zzso a zzso species in the same family with zzso zzso We identified 174 zzso in zzso with many of them being highly enriched in zzso or zzso zzso The targets of the zzso were predicted and many of them were subjected to zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that zzso play regulatory roles in the biology of green zzso Our catalog of zzso and their targets provides a resource for further studies on the evolution, biological functions, and zzso properties of zzso in green zzso
