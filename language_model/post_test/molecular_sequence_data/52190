The existence of zzso zzso zzso by zzso gene zzso in healthy humans was examined using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso G, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of urine from a healthy human was carried zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso exhibiting zzso activity and each digest at an early stage was analyzed by zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratios of zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso with basic zzso were larger than those in the zzso of human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso Considering that the value for the zzso gene product with zzso zzso is zzso a value of more than zzso implies that zzso zzso The amount of zzso was determined after removal of zzso on an zzso zzso zzso zzso bound zzso The zzso values for six urine samples free from zzso were zzso Assuming that the zzso value for zzso is the same as that for zzso the ratios of zzso and zzso were estimated to be zzso The results obtained showed that the zzso gene is usually expressed as zzso in healthy zzso
