The zzso form one of several lineages within the zzso that independently evolved a zzso lifestyle and consequently are thought to have developed alternative mechanisms of zzso The zzso zzso zzso causes late zzso a zzso disease of potato and zzso Little is known about processes associated with zzso zzso zzso particularly the suppression of host defense zzso We describe and functionally characterize an zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso with significant similarity to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso Database searches suggested that zzso proteins are mainly restricted to animals and zzso zzso but appear to be widespread and diverse in the zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited zzso A among major zzso zzso and inhibited and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of tomato in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes were zzso expressed and zzso during infection of tomato by zzso zzso zzso of tomato zzso by zzso could form a novel type of zzso mechanism between plants and microbial zzso In addition, this study points to a common zzso strategy between the zzso plant pathogen zzso zzso and several zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso
