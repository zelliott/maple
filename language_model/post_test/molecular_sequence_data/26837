zzso zzso exhibits an extraordinary resistance to the effects of exposure to zzso radiation zzso zzso is one of five proteins induced to high levels in zzso following extreme zzso exposure and that play a zzso role in zzso zzso Although zzso is zzso zzso is a bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso features a stable core with a putative zzso and a zzso segment with properties consistent with other bacterial zzso In solution, the protein functions as a zzso The protein binds zzso DNA but not duplex zzso zzso zzso and zzso with two zzso proteins provide further structural and functional identification with bacterial zzso Overall, the results establish zzso as the zzso of a new bacterial zzso zzso Given the role of zzso as a zzso scaffold for many processes in DNA zzso the induction of an alternative and quite novel zzso following zzso has potentially broad significance for the organization of zzso zzso zzso
