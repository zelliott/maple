The human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso enhances viral particle release and, its interaction with the zzso zzso zzso triggers the zzso zzso zzso degradation by the zzso The interaction between zzso protein and zzso containing the zzso zzso motif plays a key role for the development of severe disease states, such as zzso or zzso This study examines the binding and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso protein zzso to zzso with the objective of defining the minimum length of zzso needed for effective zzso The screening step can be analyzed by zzso zzso in particular, zzso transfer zzso methods clearly identify the zzso in the zzso that make direct contact with zzso protein when zzso An analysis of zzso transfer difference zzso zzso provided clear evidence that the two peptides efficiently bound zzso zzso zzso To better characterize the zzso interaction, the bound zzso of the zzso peptides was determined using transferred zzso methods, which gave rise to a zzso zzso zzso and zzso can fold in a bend arrangement for the zzso zzso showing the zzso identified by zzso as exposed in close proximity at the zzso zzso zzso zzso allows zzso interaction and hydrogen bond with the zzso acids of the zzso binding zzso The upstream zzso zzso region was also essential in binding to a zzso pocket of the zzso zzso zzso These findings are in good agreement with a recently published X-ray structure of a shorter zzso zzso with the zzso zzso
