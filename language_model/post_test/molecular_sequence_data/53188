The zzso zzso of group B zzso rapidly zzso zzso by an elimination mechanism to yield the zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, it has been shown that the zzso has limited specificity for zzso zzso and zzso the chain at zzso sites zzso Morrison, zzso and zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso In the present extension of that study it was found that zzso regions of zzso zzso are also susceptible to zzso by this zzso zzso Of the four 6- and/or zzso zzso which can be isolated from zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso only those two zzso with zzso zzso at the reducing end were zzso From zzso other data, a model is proposed for the zzso specificity of zzso zzso on a zzso zzso Evidence is presented in support of an action pattern for zzso zzso which involves zzso random zzso zzso followed by rapid zzso and zzso release of zzso zzso Since the on zzso which tend to accumulate in near-complete zzso of zzso are zzso it is argued that the zzso zzso occurs from the zzso to the reducing end of a zzso zzso This detailed knowledge of zzso specificity contributes to our understanding of the zzso role in Group B zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso may find application in sequence studies of zzso zzso
