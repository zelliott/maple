An zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from soil contaminated with zzso aromatic zzso and zzso zzso collected from Johnston zzso in the North Pacific zzso The strain formed zzso colonies on zzso zzso The cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso The strain reduced zzso to nitrous oxide, the DNA zzso content was 64 zzso and the dominant fatty acids were 15 : 0 zzso 17 : 1 iso zzso and 11 : 0 iso zzso DNA sequencing of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene established that zzso belongs in the zzso zzso within the zzso branch of the zzso zzso zzso can be differentiated from other zzso species in the zzso on the basis of its zzso and zzso characteristics and distinctive fatty acid zzso Thus strain zzso zzso zzso zzso is the type strain of a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
