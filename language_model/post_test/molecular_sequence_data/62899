zzso factor zzso proteins are zzso zzso zzso factors and form the second largest zzso factor family in zzso Biological functions of many of these zzso proteins are still zzso Here, we report the zzso of a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso from zzso and its role in zzso acid zzso gene zzso The expression of zzso was zzso in barley leaves and roots under drought, salt or zzso treatment, and in zzso during seed zzso Three forms of zzso transcripts were produced through alternative zzso two of which zzso zzso zzso This alternative zzso pattern was also observed in a wheat zzso zzso zzso Both of zzso zzso proteins acted as zzso zzso capable of zzso the promoter activity of an zzso zzso in zzso In zzso zzso analysis using synthetic zzso revealed that zzso zzso protein bound preferably to a zzso element zzso zzso activity on the zzso of zzso expression in barley leaves was markedly enhanced by zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso or drought zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso with other zzso factors in the zzso of stress gene expression through an zzso zzso
