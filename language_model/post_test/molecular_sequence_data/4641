The zzso export pump in the zzso zzso membrane is, together with the zzso zzso salt export zzso one of the two major pumps determining zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The so-called zzso zzso zzso flow is largely driven by the zzso zzso zzso export zzso as indicated by the markedly reduced zzso flow in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso rats zzso The importance of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for transfer of zzso and zzso substances from blood into zzso has long been zzso The molecular identification zzso 26, zzso and cloning zzso 10, 30) of the zzso export pump for these zzso in the zzso membrane was, at least in part, a consequence of the zzso of the zzso specificity of the zzso resistance protein zzso which is very similar to that of its zzso zzso zzso zzso The broad zzso specificity of the zzso export pump enables the terminal zzso of a multitude of zzso and zzso zzso which are formed by a large number of relatively specific zzso and zzso in phase I and phase II metabolism of zzso and zzso substances in the zzso The zzso expression of the zzso export pump zzso by the zzso gene in the zzso membrane does not exclude zzso of this zzso in other cells and zzso when exposed to drugs and toxins that can be zzso by this zzso The zzso zzso export pump zzso may thus zzso zzso resistance to tumor cells in a similar manner as zzso zzso The observation that zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso and its rabbit zzso (35) is not only detected in zzso but also in small zzso and the zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso export pump may function in the zzso membrane domain of various zzso zzso
