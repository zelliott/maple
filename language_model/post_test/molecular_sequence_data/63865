In this study, the crystal structure of a class C zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso has been refined to zzso A zzso It is one of the few solved crystal structures of zzso zzso The structure was compared with those of zzso zzso zzso and of another, zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso structure of this zzso provides additional insights into the features involved in cold zzso zzso comparison of the zzso and zzso zzso shows that zzso seems to play a major role in zzso adaptation, with a lower total number of zzso interactions for cold zzso The zzso zzso are also characterized by a decreased number of hydrogen bonds, a lower content of zzso and a lower percentage of zzso in comparison with zzso All these features make the structure more flexible so that the zzso can behave as an efficient catalyst at low zzso
