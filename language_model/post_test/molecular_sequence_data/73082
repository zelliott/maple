To study the presence of zzso group O infection among zzso people in Cameroon and to further characterize the zzso group O zzso 

During a zzso survey zzso all samples tested positive in screening methods in the National zzso and Public Health Laboratory, Centre zzso zzso Cameroon were identified as zzso group M, zzso group O or zzso by using a zzso zzso zzso group M and zzso group O were distinguished on the basis of competitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso group M zzso zzso zzso group O infections were confirmed by using group zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso group O strains were isolated by zzso zzso zzso DNA was amplified with specific zzso and sequencing was performed on the zzso and gag zzso 

Of the zzso screened samples, zzso were zzso zzso zzso of which were considered to belong to group zzso The 817 zzso that had reacted poorly or not at all against group M zzso were further zzso 10 were confirmed as zzso and 82 as zzso group O, the others being indeterminate zzso zzso zzso or negative zzso zzso zzso The frequency of group O relative to group M ranged from zzso in Far North province to zzso in the zzso There was no difference in sex, age or frequency of clinical manifestations between group M and group O zzso Group O infection was confirmed in a subset of cases by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso with perfect zzso zzso and zzso analyses confirmed the high zzso inside group zzso 

Group O and group M zzso patterns are known to be similar so the reason for the lower prevalence of group O remains to be zzso The wide distribution of group O infection in all zzso provinces zzso the importance of further characterizing the epidemic spread and diffusion of this zzso
