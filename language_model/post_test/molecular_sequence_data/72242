Five zzso zzso representing different zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library, and the DNA as well as the putative zzso acid sequences were zzso The corresponding zzso and zzso genes code for peptides 376 zzso acids long, with molecular weights zzso and zzso zzso respectively, while the deduced zzso protein is 377 zzso acids long and weighs zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso lack zzso corresponding to three to six zzso acids at the zzso Two of the five zzso contain the conventional zzso as the putative zzso zzso one has the common zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso is found 15 and 18 zzso respectively, upstream of the zzso site in two of the zzso zzso studies including 102 zzso protein sequences revealed that there are at least four different types of zzso zzso In this study three of these types were found to be expressed in the adult zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso groupings differ from each other to an extent seen only among the zzso zzso between the zzso muscle and zzso zzso In the zzso trees constructed, zzso zzso were seen to map to two different regions, one on the border of the zzso zzso and the other within this zzso It is, however, difficult to say whether the zzso zzso zzso off early in the zzso evolution or if this position in the zzso tree only reflects upon differences in evolutionary zzso
