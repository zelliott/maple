Increased recognition of the prevalence of human zzso in the United States, together with rising concern about the potential for transmission of this infection by blood zzso has provided motivation to develop definitive zzso and molecular tests for the zzso agent, zzso zzso To develop more sensitive and specific zzso for zzso zzso we screened a zzso expression library with patient serum zzso This screening resulted in the identification of three classes of novel genes and an additional two novel, unrelated zzso which together zzso a total of 17 unique zzso zzso zzso The first class zzso zzso of genes encodes seven closely related zzso with a zzso zzso repeat that shows limited zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso surface zzso A second class zzso zzso of genes encodes six related zzso and the third class zzso zzso of genes encodes two related zzso The two remaining genes code for novel and unrelated zzso Among the three classes of zzso and remaining novel zzso five were chosen to code for the most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso Western zzso analysis with the resulting zzso proteins indicated that these zzso were targets of zzso immune responses during zzso zzso infection in zzso
