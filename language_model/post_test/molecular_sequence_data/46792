A reliable recognition of zzso factor binding sites is essential for analysis of regulatory zzso zzso The experimental data make evident an important role of DNA zzso features for site zzso However, zzso tools for revealing zzso and zzso DNA features significant for the site functioning and subsequent use of these features for site recognition have not been developed up to zzso 

We suggest an approach for revealing significant zzso and zzso properties of functional sites implemented in the database zzso This database is designed to study the sets of various zzso factor binding sites, providing evidence that zzso factor binding sites are characterized by specific sets of significant zzso and zzso DNA zzso For a fixed site, by using the zzso features selected for this site recognition, the zzso recognizing this site may be generated, control tested and stored in the database zzso Each zzso entry links to the zzso recognizing the site, whose significant zzso features are stored in this entry as the zzso recognition zzso The zzso linked zzso pairs are compiled within the zzso system, which is simultaneously the database and the program tools package zzso immediately for recognizing the sites stored in the zzso Indeed, this is the zzso zzso zzso is the Web resource of both zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso type, that is why it was called an zzso zzso 

zzso is available at zzso and the mirror site at zzso zzso
