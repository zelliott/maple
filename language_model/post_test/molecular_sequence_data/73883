An iron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a consequence of free zzso damage, that ultimately leads to a zzso change of the zzso zzso and a high zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso The differential display technique was used to search for zzso genes in the kidney of male zzso rats treated with zzso and in the induced zzso Six fragments were selected that showed specific quantitative changes in zzso Two of them exhibited similar patterns in northern blots as zzso One zzso showed a high zzso zzso to zzso zzso protein zzso zzso We thus cloned rat zzso zzso including the entire coding region for use in further zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso deletion that was also observed in human, but not in zzso Northern blots revealed that zzso was consistently zzso in zzso parts of the kidney zzso increase, zzso zzso 9, P zzso zzso as compared with matched controls 1 to 2 years after zzso zzso zzso zzso of more than zzso was found in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and was limited to cases of a high zzso grade and lung zzso zzso zzso expression was higher in the zzso part of the kidney after zzso treatment zzso than in zzso zzso in each case zzso zzso 4, P zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso after zzso treatment and zzso cells was observed by in zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso may be associated with zzso zzso cortical zzso damage and zzso that lead to a zzso state, and with tumor progression and zzso of the induced zzso
