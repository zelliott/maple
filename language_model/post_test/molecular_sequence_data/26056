The human zzso zzso cluster zzso contains two zzso zzso One zzso is in the first zzso of the zzso zzso and the second zzso is at the zzso of the gene zzso The zzso zzso cluster zzso contains an zzso third copy zzso in the zzso region between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are essentially full size and have the general structure, zzso while zzso lacks about one-third of its zzso Although none of the elements has retained long open reading zzso we could detect stretches having zzso acids identical to various parts of zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso elements were derived from a virus very similar in structure to zzso The DNA sequences surrounding the zzso points of the three zzso elements are not alike and allow the zzso that they integrated into the zzso gene cluster independently at some time after the initial formation of the zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of the three elements leads to the hypothesis that foreign DNA introduced into the zzso can initially accumulate zzso more rapidly than the zzso sequences surrounding zzso
