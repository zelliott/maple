zzso zzso is a major drug threat in the United States and zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy for treating zzso abuse is showing exciting promise and the understanding of how zzso structure relates to function will be essential for future development of these important zzso We have determined crystal structures of a high affinity zzso therapeutic single chain zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso derived from one of our candidate zzso in complex with zzso and the zzso zzso of another abused drug, zzso zzso known by the street name zzso The crystal structures revealed that zzso binds to zzso and zzso in a deep pocket that almost completely zzso the drugs mostly through aromatic zzso In addition, the zzso nitrogen of zzso and zzso forms a salt bridge with the zzso group of a zzso acid zzso and a hydrogen bond with a zzso side zzso Interestingly, there are two water molecules in the binding pocket and one of them is positioned for a zzso interaction with the aromatic ring of zzso These first crystal structures of a high affinity therapeutic zzso zzso against zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso A, zzso provide a structural basis for designing the next generation of higher affinity zzso and also for carrying out rational zzso
