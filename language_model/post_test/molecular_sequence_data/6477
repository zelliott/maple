The zzso zzso of the human zzso gene is due to the periodic occupation of a zzso element zzso zzso zzso zzso located in the region of the zzso zzso zzso binding to the major groove of the zzso in zzso and zzso results in a zzso repression of activated zzso We now show that zzso repression is also the major principle underlying the periodic zzso of the human zzso A and zzso zzso A single point zzso within the zzso results in a zzso to zzso deregulation in zzso and an almost complete loss of cell cycle regulation of all three zzso In addition, the zzso zzso A and zzso genes share an identical 5 zzso region zzso cycle genes zzso zzso zzso starting at an identical position, six zzso 3' to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region in each of the three promoters produces the same zzso as the zzso of the zzso zzso a dramatic deregulation in zzso In agreement with these results, in zzso zzso zzso showed the periodic occupation of the zzso A zzso in the major groove, and of the zzso in the minor zzso Finally, all three genes bear conspicuous similarities in their upstream zzso sequences zzso This applies in particular to the presence of zzso and zzso binding sites which, in the zzso zzso have been shown to be the targets of repression through the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
