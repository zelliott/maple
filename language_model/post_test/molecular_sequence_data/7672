The follow up of minimal residual disease zzso in childhood zzso ALL by zzso chain reaction zzso may be of help for further zzso of treatment zzso to improve zzso However, the clinical relevance of this approach has yet to be zzso We report the retrospective follow-up of zzso in bone zzso zzso samples from 50 childhood zzso ALL patients by zzso delta zzso Twenty-two patients remained in continuous complete zzso zzso follow-up 61 zzso and 28 experienced zzso zzso follow-up 75 zzso zzso zzso of zzso on therapy correlated with zzso At the end of induction therapy zzso zzso patients from the zzso group were zzso positive vs zzso zzso from the zzso group zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso predicted zzso survival independent of standard clinical and zzso zzso Also subsequent to first zzso zzso a correlation between zzso zzso and outcome was zzso Six of eight patients who became zzso negative in the time period between zzso and bone zzso transplantation are in CCR, whereas 7/7 patients who remained zzso positive in this time period died zzso zzso zzso In approximately zzso of zzso patients, clinical zzso was preceded by recurrence of zzso zzso at time intervals of zzso months earlier and the recurrence of zzso zzso after a period of zzso was always followed by overt zzso At zzso the combined use of zzso and zzso delta zzso reduced false zzso caused by zzso evolution to approximately zzso This study shows that the evolution of zzso zzso zzso is an independent predictor of zzso
