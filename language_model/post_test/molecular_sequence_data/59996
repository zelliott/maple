zzso peptides appear to be ubiquitous and zzso components of the innate immune defense arsenal used by both zzso and zzso zzso During the past 15 years a multitude of these peptides have been isolated largely from zzso In spite of great differences in size, zzso acid composition and structure, most of the zzso peptides from insects can be grouped into one of three zzso The largest category in number contains peptides with zzso zzso bonds forming zzso zzso or zzso mixed zzso The second most important group is composed of peptides forming zzso zzso The third group comprises peptides with an overrepresentation in zzso and/or zzso zzso In general, the insect zzso peptides have a broad range of activity and are not zzso Despite a wealth of information on structural requirements for their zzso activity, the mode of action of these peptides is not yet fully zzso However, some data suggest the existence of two types of mode of zzso zzso through zzso interaction or zzso through zzso recognition zzso This review presents the main results obtained during the last four years in the field of zzso peptides from insects with a special focus on the zzso and zzso zzso
