We previously mapped the locations of breaks introduced by zzso zzso I zzso I) in replicating zzso virus 40 zzso DNA and observed an approximate zzso bias in the distribution of the break sites for the template strand for zzso DNA zzso In the present study, this bias has been confirmed by the mapping of additional sites utilizing a standard primer extension zzso and a sensitive repetitive primer extension zzso zzso No new sites could be detected on either strand of zzso by the zzso method, despite the 10 to 20 fold greater sensitivity of the zzso To investigate the nature of the bias, a detailed analysis of the zzso DNA sequence was zzso A set of 17 zzso sequences derived from those sites observed to be broken in the viral DNA extracted from zzso cells define an in zzso consensus zzso We show that the observed strand bias is likely due to the intrinsic zzso distribution of these consensus sequences on the two strands of zzso zzso To confirm these zzso zzso zzso containing previously identified in zzso zzso I break sites were introduced in both zzso into zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso experiments utilizing these zzso revealed that the inserted zzso I break sites were broken in zzso regardless of their orientation, confirming that the zzso sequence is the major, if not the sole zzso of the observed strand zzso The possible origins of the strand bias are discussed in relation to the evolution of the zzso
