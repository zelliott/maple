zzso of the zzso virus zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso E6 cells was observed in a competitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and truncated zzso of zzso Seoul, and zzso viruses lacking the zzso 49 zzso acids were also detected as zzso Although truncated zzso of zzso virus lacking the zzso 154 zzso acids existed as a zzso those of Seoul and zzso formed zzso The zzso truncated zzso zzso of Seoul and zzso viruses could detect zzso zzso whereas the zzso truncated zzso zzso of zzso virus lacking the zzso 154 zzso acids could not, suggesting that a zzso zzso zzso on the zzso results in zzso The zzso interaction was also detected by using a zzso zzso zzso Two regions, zzso acids 100 to 125 zzso 1) and zzso acids zzso to zzso zzso zzso were essential for the zzso interaction in zzso The zzso of Seoul virus in which the zzso at zzso acid number 119 was replaced by zzso zzso zzso did not zzso in the zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso 119 in region 1 is important for the zzso interaction in zzso However, zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells were detected as the zzso by using competitive zzso Similarly, the truncated zzso of Seoul virus expressing zzso acids 155 to zzso showed a zzso interaction in a competitive zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso region is important for the zzso detected by competitive zzso zzso the results indicate that several steps and regions are involved in zzso of zzso zzso
