zzso little is known of the zzso acid zzso participating in zzso B2 zzso signal zzso zzso In this report we investigate the potential role of the two existing zzso zzso zzso in the zzso regions and the zzso zzso in the regulatory function of this zzso zzso cells, which do not contain zzso zzso B2 zzso were zzso with wild type and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were each zzso to corresponding zzso zzso and zzso zzso The last 34 zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso forms of the zzso zzso including the truncated zzso zzso all bound zzso with essentially the same zzso of approximately zzso zzso as cells zzso with the wild type zzso B2 zzso However, mutating zzso resulted in important changes in zzso zzso turnover and zzso zzso For example, exchanging zzso for zzso led to an zzso decreased zzso release zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso at 15 zzso remaining essentially zzso zzso the same zzso to zzso resulted in unchanged zzso zzso zzso only a slightly lowered zzso release, and unchanged zzso zzso at 15 zzso zzso zzso to zzso resulted in a very different zzso There was a small but significant reduction in zzso release zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a large, zzso increase in zzso zzso at 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a portion of the zzso tail also proved zzso with a zzso decrease in zzso release and an zzso decrease in zzso zzso The zzso also resulted in a large, zzso decrease in zzso zzso at 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results point to zzso as an important element in determining zzso zzso release and zzso zzso zzso zzso at this site apparently does not play a major zzso zzso zzso and the zzso tail appear to be important in determining zzso zzso
