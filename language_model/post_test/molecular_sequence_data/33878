zzso zzso by organisms usually represent improbable events that constitute a major challenge for zzso By zzso molecular zzso historical zzso and zzso we test a bold hypothesis proposed by Vladimir zzso regarding the origin of zzso zzso blue zzso and show that zzso has served as a biological corridor for the zzso of these insects from Asia into the New zzso We present a novel method to estimate ancestral temperature zzso using distribution range limits of extant organisms, and find that zzso conditions in zzso acted as a decisive filter in determining which zzso crossed into the New World during five separate zzso over the past 11 zzso Our results reveal a marked effect of the zzso global zzso and demonstrate that zzso conditions left a strong signal on the ecology of zzso zzso in the New zzso The zzso conservatism in zzso zzso that we have identified may permit the reconstruction of the zzso of ancestral organisms, especially mobile zzso that can easily escape from hostile environments rather than adapt to zzso
