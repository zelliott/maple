We have zzso the significance of three key zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso that act remotely from its zzso site for its functional zzso as well as for its zzso zzso These results provide useful fundamental information for engineering zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso by zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli and then zzso Three zzso acid zzso were found to be related to zzso zzso zzso zzso to either A, zzso zzso zzso D, or E produced only the zzso zzso Although mutating zzso and zzso into A or K and A or zzso respectively, partly influenced zzso zzso the specific activity of each of the four zzso decreased to zzso 4, zzso and zzso respectively, compared with a specific activity of zzso for the zzso zzso Thus, zzso triggers zzso zzso and completes the modification of the active site with assistance by zzso and zzso These results will help to engineer zzso for improved industrial zzso
