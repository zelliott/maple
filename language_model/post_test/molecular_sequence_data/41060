Many zzso organisms acquire immunity against foreign genetic material by incorporating a short segment of foreign DNA called zzso into zzso zzso termed clustered regularly zzso short zzso repeats zzso The zzso zzso are processed into small fragments that guide the zzso of the invading genetic zzso The zzso zzso proteins are the main executioners of these zzso zzso we report the crystal structure of zzso of zzso zzso a zzso protein involved in the acquisition of new zzso By zzso zzso forms a central channel which is decorated with basic zzso acids and binds linear zzso DNA zzso but not circular zzso Despite zzso low sequence zzso two zzso zzso of zzso are similar to the entire structure of an zzso zzso zzso zzso which also forms a zzso and binds zzso Thus, this work identifies a previously unknown group of zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso which are larger than the known zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso by containing an extra zzso zzso The commonly present central channel in the two zzso appears as a design to selectively interact with linear zzso
