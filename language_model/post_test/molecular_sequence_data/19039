A group of four strains isolated from clams zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso were subjected to a zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso the analysis of zzso features, the sequencing of the zzso zzso and five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso The analysis of the zzso and zzso characteristics and the results of a zzso study, based on the zzso zzso gene sequence analysis and zzso sequence analysis, clearly indicated that these strains belong to the zzso zzso and were allocated between the zzso and zzso zzso showing a close relationship with the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results confirmed that these zzso constitute a new zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed with C zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
