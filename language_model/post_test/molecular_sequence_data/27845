A secondary structure model for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been derived by comparing computer-generated folding patterns of equivalent sequences from a number of related zzso and zzso and identifying zzso zzso that suggest conservation of a common secondary zzso Although certain elements are similar, the new model differs considerably from a previously published minimal energy structure and is consistent with the observed sensitivity of in zzso zzso transcripts of infectious zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso The sequence of a zzso zzso of an attenuated zzso provides additional evidence for an interaction between a region known to be important for zzso sequence zzso and zzso zzso to zzso
