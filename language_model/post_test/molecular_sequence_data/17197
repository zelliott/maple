zzso gene interactions are believed to be a major factor in the genetic architecture of evolutionary zzso In zzso zzso the zzso and zzso genes mechanistically interact to control flowering time, and here we show that this zzso interaction also contributes to a zzso zzso in this life history trait within the zzso Two major zzso zzso zzso and zzso are associated with flowering time variation in zzso zzso in field conditions, but only in the presence of zzso functional zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso distribution of zzso zzso in zzso and North Africa also depend on the zzso zzso There is significant linkage zzso between zzso and zzso despite their location on separate zzso Although no zzso zzso differentiate zzso and zzso zzso zzso the expression of an alternatively spliced zzso transcript that encodes a zzso protein with a radical zzso acid replacement associated with the two zzso zzso Numerous zzso zzso the zzso zzso also occur in zzso regions implicated in the regulation of zzso zzso The features of the regulatory gene interaction between zzso and zzso in contributing to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso flowering time are consistent with the maintenance of this interaction by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso genetic pathways and networks provide the molecular basis for zzso contributing to ecologically important zzso variation in natural populations and to the process of evolutionary zzso
