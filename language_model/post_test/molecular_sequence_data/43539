A novel human zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), has been isolated by suppression of the zzso checkpoint zzso in zzso zzso zzso suppresses a number of DNA zzso checkpoint zzso in zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suppression of sensitivity to DNA damage is specific for zzso zzso in contrast to DNA zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not a control zzso resulted in zzso delay after zzso zzso in zzso zzso with zzso nuclear zzso and zzso resistance similar to those of a zzso zzso zzso can also suppress the zzso zzso sensitivity, and zzso checkpoint zzso of a zzso zzso zzso In contrast to this activity, zzso had no measurable effect on the replication checkpoint as zzso by zzso sensitivity of a zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso is a novel member of the fork zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso requires a zzso domain in the zzso zzso of the protein which is distinct from the DNA binding zzso Analysis of zzso activity is most consistent with zzso of an alternative zzso checkpoint zzso in budding zzso
