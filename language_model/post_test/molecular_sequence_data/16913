zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is zzso and indispensable for zzso transfer of the symbiotic zzso zzso Most zzso zzso also inherit zzso zzso zzso that lack zzso always contain zzso zzso which we designated zzso zzso do not contain some zzso segments and instead have zzso zzso including the replication and transfer zzso These novel zzso plasmids are compatible with zzso zzso incompatible with zzso and zzso The symbiotic features of derivatives simultaneously containing a zzso zzso and an zzso were zzso zzso analysis of 10 zzso showed that 7 shared one of the two zzso zzso zzso of this common junction revealed a zzso region that was zzso identical in zzso and zzso including a zzso central region flanked by zzso to zzso zzso repeats reminiscent of bacterial and zzso attachment zzso A gene zzso an zzso protein zzso was localized downstream of the attachment site on zzso zzso or the absence of zzso abolished zzso transfer from a zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso gene restored transfer of zzso We propose that zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso may be achieved either through zzso zzso among large reiterated sequences or through zzso zzso zzso between the attachment zzso zzso formed through the zzso system but resolved through zzso zzso or vice versa generate zzso A zzso zzso system for zzso zzso is a novel feature of these large plasmids and implies that there is unique regulation which affects the distribution of zzso in nature due to the role of the zzso in zzso zzso
