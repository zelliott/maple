The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a zzso of floral zzso gene expression in zzso zzso is also required for zzso maintenance and regulates flowering under a zzso zzso zzso zzso are structurally and functionally zzso from zzso to zzso In addition to the zzso protein features, zzso has a large unique zzso zzso We show here that zzso is present as two forms in the nucleus, full-length and zzso with the latter apparently lacking the zzso zzso The ratio of the two forms of zzso zzso differs in juvenile and in adult zzso Furthermore, an zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso region of zzso is sufficient for biological zzso Plants expressing zzso show molecular and zzso zzso opposite to those of the zzso zzso suggesting that the construct results in increased zzso This increased activity is at least in part due to elevated zzso protein levels in these zzso We propose that the zzso domain may control zzso zzso and/or specific activity in the context of the full-length zzso The presence of the zzso domain in rice zzso suggests that its role is probably zzso in the two classes of flowering zzso
