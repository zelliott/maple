We have previously shown zzso of zzso zzso to have zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the present study we further investigated the nature of the zzso zzso by employing three synthetic zzso each possessing features of the original zzso to examine effects on zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso production and surface zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, which lacked PC but contained zzso had no effect on either zzso or zzso zzso however, zzso 1, which contained PC and hence arguably most resembled the native material, had, with the exception of a small increase in surface zzso zzso no zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, which contained PC but was otherwise least like the native zzso demonstrated a number of effects on both zzso and zzso including induction of zzso zzso zzso of such zzso induced by zzso and increased expression of zzso zzso Taken together these results zzso zzso that although PC is an zzso component of the native zzso other structural feature are necessary to allow it to zzso zzso that zzso rather than zzso is likely to represent a zzso zzso zzso and zzso that synthetic zzso molecules have the potential to act as zzso zzso
