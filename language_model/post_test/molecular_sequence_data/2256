We have demonstrated that a synthetic zzso corresponding to the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso transit zzso zzso zzso the binding of zzso to isolated zzso zzso peptides derived from zzso transit zzso zzso which have a similar net charge, did not inhibit zzso In addition, this zzso zzso zzso import of zzso zzso another zzso zzso zzso thus suggesting that common import pathways exist for both zzso and zzso zzso A smaller synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of the zzso transit zzso zzso also zzso zzso However, several zzso for zzso in the smaller zzso relieve import zzso thus providing evidence that this neutral zzso plays a crucial role in transit zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso processing of zzso by a zzso zzso fraction to both the mature and intermediate forms of zzso was also inhibited by zzso The ability of synthetic peptides to inhibit distinct steps in the import of zzso precursor proteins zzso precisely to their ability to interact with the same components used by transit peptides on intact zzso Furthermore, zzso at multiple points along the import zzso reflects the functions of several independent structures contained within transit zzso
