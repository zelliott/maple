We describe the use of the quantitative zzso zzso system zzso zzso and competitive zzso in a simple and zzso zzso format for use in establishing a screen for the discovery of compounds that affect gene zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso was chosen as an initial target to test the sensitivity and zzso of the zzso System zzso in the zzso of zzso products generated in competitive zzso zzso We found that with the use of zzso zzso the zzso zzso could be used easily to distinguish between internal standard zzso and zzso products in zzso zzso We were able to detect as little as twofold changes in zzso amounts by using zzso of total rat liver zzso as a source of IGF-1 zzso The zzso system zzso could be used to analyze 24 competitive zzso reactions zzso zzso single zzso in approximately 1 zzso The flexibility, automation, and sensitivity of the zzso System zzso makes it a useful tool to measure the zzso regulation of various zzso
