We report a highly compact system for accelerating direct zzso zzso Unlike previous walking techniques, our strategy does not rely on restriction zzso or zzso and is therefore unaffected by the availability of useful restriction sites in the zzso zzso A complete zzso of molecular cloning steps qualifies this method for sequencing zzso segments that are regarded zzso and thus zzso by the traditional zzso A premium was placed on economy of zzso the system comprises just four direct zzso additions, in zzso volumes, over the course of a zzso zzso The walk range in this method is directly related to the capabilities of the associated zzso zzso indicating that it can achieve in excess of 35 zzso per zzso It also produces a DNA fingerprint that is distinctive to the zzso zzso Despite the complexity of zzso patterns in these zzso we observed that the reaction products were directly zzso In view of its speed, reliability and zzso we term the described method Universal Fast zzso
