We have used the zzso cell long-term zzso model system to study the regulation of cell cycle progression at the molecular zzso By modulating the length of time that zzso cells are density arrested, it is possible to zzso alter the length of the zzso or zzso phase which the cell zzso after growth factor stimulation in preparation for entry into DNA zzso zzso of long- and short-term density arrested zzso cells with different growth factors or higher zzso of individual growth factors does not alter the time required by long-term cells to enter S after zzso However, the time during the zzso period for which these growth factors are needed is zzso zzso zzso zzso cells require zzso to traverse the zzso border but do not need and apparently cannot respond to IGF-1 during the first 10 h after zzso zzso the length of the zzso of the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso stimulation of long-term zzso zzso cells zzso a series of molecular events which make these cells zzso to respond to the zzso growth factor, zzso In light of the well-established role of protein zzso zzso in signal zzso we set out to zzso zzso and analyze the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso which potentially could play a role during the zzso of the zzso phase in making the long-term zzso zzso cells competent to respond to zzso We obtained 49 clones representing 11 different zzso and zzso type protein zzso zzso Analysis of expression of these clones revealed a variety of different patterns of zzso However, the most striking pattern was exhibited by IGF-1 zzso Our results suggest that induction of IGF-1 zzso zzso by zzso may be an important event in the establishment of competence by zzso in long-term density arrested zzso zzso
