zzso feeding reduces the zzso zzso multiple zzso in the cholesterol zzso zzso and the low density zzso zzso in zzso of zzso Here we show that cholesterol feeding also reduces the levels of the nuclear zzso zzso of zzso regulatory element binding proteins zzso which activate zzso of zzso zzso We show that zzso of zzso like those of mice and humans, predominantly produce zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso Both are produced as zzso precursors that must be zzso to release the zzso active zzso zzso zzso containing zzso to zzso cholesterol decreased the amount of nuclear zzso without affecting the amount of the membrane precursor or its zzso suggesting that cholesterol zzso the zzso processing of zzso in liver as it does in cultured zzso zzso also appeared to reduce the zzso processing of zzso In addition, at high levels of dietary cholesterol the zzso zzso zzso declined and the amount of the precursor also fell, suggesting that cholesterol zzso also may inhibit zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso diets reduced the amount of low density zzso zzso zzso by zzso and produced a more profound zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Treatment with zzso and zzso which increases zzso demands for cholesterol, increased the amount of zzso zzso as well as the precursor and nuclear forms of the zzso This treatment caused a zzso decline in zzso zzso and zzso zzso together, these data suggest that zzso play important roles in controlling zzso of zzso genes in liver, as they do in cultured zzso
