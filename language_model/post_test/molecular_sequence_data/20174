zzso zzso zzso is a zzso key regulator of zzso zzso In recent years, substantial efforts were undertaken to characterize the complex formed between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, I zzso and illustrate the current structural and zzso studies on the zzso zzso Based on these and on functional information I formulate an updated molecular mechanism on how zzso by zzso regulates zzso zzso
