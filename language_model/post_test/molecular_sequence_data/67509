Evidence suggests that variation in the length of the zzso repeat in the 3' untranslated region zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso may contribute to zzso variation in zzso zzso However, methodology in previous studies limited the assessment of the effect of sequence variation in the context of zzso repeat zzso The objectives of this study were to design a novel zzso method to fully characterize sequence variation in the zzso zzso zzso repeat in asthma patients treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso combination therapy, and to analyze the effect of the zzso repeat zzso on clinical zzso 

In zzso asthma patients zzso to treatment with zzso or zzso in a six-month study zzso study zzso zzso sequence diversity in the zzso zzso repeat region was determined using a novel zzso zzso zzso The relationship between the zzso repeat zzso and the zzso of severe asthma zzso and changes in pulmonary function and asthma symptoms from baseline to the average during the treatment period, were zzso 

zzso repeat zzso were assigned in zzso zzso of zzso Of the 13 different zzso repeat zzso identified, six zzso occurred at a frequency of zzso in one or more population in this zzso The repeat length of these six common zzso ranged from 10 to 14 zzso Twelve zzso repeat zzso were observed at a frequency of zzso No evidence of an association between zzso repeat zzso and the zzso of severe asthma zzso was zzso zzso pulmonary function zzso improved and asthma symptoms declined when treated with zzso combination therapy regardless of zzso repeat zzso 

The extensive sequence diversity present in the zzso repeat region of the zzso zzso did not predict therapeutic response to zzso zzso
