The aim of this study was to detect and determine the genetic variation of zzso in Greece and to analyze the zzso relationships and transmission dynamics of identified zzso Eighty-six blood samples from zzso zzso patients of different risk groups were collected from the AIDS clinic, zzso Hospital, zzso zzso zzso DNA was extracted from zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region were amplified from each study subject, and they were genetically zzso by zzso mobility zzso and DNA zzso zzso distances and zzso relationships of DNA sequences were estimated using zzso zzso Our results revealed that 82 out of 86 zzso subjects carried zzso B zzso while four zzso carried zzso A zzso zzso A in Greek individuals not having traveled abroad was zzso An average of zzso B genetic divergence of zzso was zzso Our findings demonstrate the presence of at least two genetic zzso of zzso in northern zzso B and zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso B, which was transmitted into Greece by multiple zzso Our observations lend support to the argument that the distribution of zzso zzso is determined by founder effects or other processes rather than any zzso for particular cell types or mode of zzso
