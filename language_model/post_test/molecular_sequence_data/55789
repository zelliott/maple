We have used two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso to study the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso This is one of a series of zzso DNA zzso with a consensus zzso sequence that was recently isolated and shown to inhibit zzso zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso zzso Griffin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1992) Nature zzso zzso zzso The zzso forms a zzso DNA zzso consisting of two zzso connected by two zzso zzso and one zzso zzso A potential zzso zzso is formed between the two zzso zzso across the diagonal of the top zzso Thus, all of the zzso bases in the consensus sequence are zzso This zzso structure was determined by zzso and illustrates that this zzso forms a specific folded zzso zzso of this structure may be used in the further development of zzso zzso zzso
