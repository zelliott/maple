zzso finger zzso proteins play a critical role in cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso In this paper, we cloned and characterized a novel human zzso zinc finger zzso zzso which encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso is strongly expressed in the three month old human zzso and then is almost zzso in six month old zzso and in adult zzso An zzso fusion protein can be found in both the nucleus and the zzso zzso appears to act as a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso domain is the main region responsible for the zzso Our results suggest that the zzso gene is a new zzso inhibitor that functions in the zzso signaling zzso
