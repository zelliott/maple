Secondary zzso zzso formed by zzso bacteria, are suggested to play a significant role in zzso of the gastrointestinal tract in zzso zzso acid zzso is carried out by a few species of zzso zzso which harbor a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Several genes zzso zzso in this zzso have been cloned and zzso However, no gene zzso has yet been assigned to the production of zzso acid zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso or zzso acid zzso We previously reported that the zzso gene encodes an zzso zzso zzso however, the role of this protein in zzso acid zzso is zzso zzso searches and secondary structural alignments suggest this protein to be similar to zzso which reduce zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene product was expressed in zzso coli, zzso and discovered to be a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Additionally, high sequence similarity between the zzso and zzso gene products suggests the zzso gene may zzso a zzso acid zzso specific for zzso and zzso We tested this hypothesis using cell extracts prepared from zzso coli zzso the zzso gene and discovered that it encodes a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso
