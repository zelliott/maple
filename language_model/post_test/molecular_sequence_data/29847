The zzso functions of the zzso and zzso halves of the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli have been identified using zzso zzso zzso zzso at positions zzso 180, and zzso within the putative zzso site were replaced with zzso zzso Each of these zzso resulted in at least a 1 order of magnitude reduction in the zzso for zzso zzso zzso The zzso on the zzso half, zzso and zzso caused slight reduction in the rate of synthesis of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso (the partial zzso synthesis zzso but the zzso zzso reaction zzso was reduced to less than zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is on the zzso half, caused the partial zzso synthesis reaction to be reduced by 1 order of magnitude but the zzso zzso reaction was reduced only zzso All three zzso are within regions which show zzso to the putative zzso zzso of many zzso zzso These results have been interpreted to suggest that the two zzso halves of the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso each contain a binding site for zzso The zzso domain contains the portion of the large zzso that is primarily involved with the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso while the zzso domain contains the region of the zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso
