The structure of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 was studied after mild acid and strong alkaline zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Three types of zzso molecules were found, including those with an zzso zzso 1 core zzso or an zzso zzso 2 core zzso with one zzso repeating unit zzso or with a zzso zzso zzso of two core zzso only zzso 2 accepts the zzso In the structures A and B, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represent zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all zzso are in the zzso form and have the d zzso unless otherwise zzso One or more zzso sites may be occupied by zzso zzso In a minority of the zzso zzso an zzso group is present in the outer core region at unknown zzso The site and the zzso of the linkage between the zzso and the core and the structure of the zzso repeating unit were defined in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso linked to the zzso zzso of the core was found to have the beta zzso whereas in the interior repeating units of the zzso this zzso is in the zzso The data obtained are in accordance with the initiation of zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is closely related to zzso 1, by transfer of zzso to zzso zzso followed by synthesis of the repeating zzso zzso
