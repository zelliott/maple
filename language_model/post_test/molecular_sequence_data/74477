zzso zzso zzso sequences is important to increase the knowledge about the fundamental biology of zzso to understand evolutionary and ecological processes in the evolution of plants, to develop zzso applications zzso zzso zzso and to improve the efficiency of breeding zzso zzso of pure zzso DNA is required for efficient sequencing of zzso zzso Unfortunately, most protocols for zzso zzso DNA were developed for zzso and do not produce sufficiently pure yields for a shotgun sequencing approach of whole zzso zzso from the zzso zzso 

We have developed a simple and inexpensive method to obtain zzso DNA from grass species by zzso and extending protocols zzso for the use in zzso Many protocols for zzso zzso DNA require an zzso step to efficiently separate zzso DNA from nuclear zzso The developed method uses two more zzso steps than previously reported protocols and does not require an zzso 

The described method delivered zzso DNA of very high quality from two grass species belonging to highly different zzso zzso within the grass family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA from zzso zzso was used for whole zzso zzso sequencing and detection of zzso The sequence is publicly available on zzso
