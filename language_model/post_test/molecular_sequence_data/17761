The zzso of water bridged base pairs of zzso acids have been simulated via the zzso Carlo zzso The simulation have shown that water molecules forming zzso with both bases preserve this zzso with large probability in the water zzso This fact supports the supposition about the important role of water molecules in wrong base pair formation and about the role of these base pairs in the structure and functioning of zzso zzso
