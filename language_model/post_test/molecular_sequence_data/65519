zzso zzso tags zzso containing a single zzso zzso can be attached to proteins via a zzso bond, presenting a flexible means of tagging proteins zzso with a zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso placed in different positions of the zzso can be used to expose the protein to different zzso of the magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to generate different molecular alignments in a magnetic zzso Delta zzso zzso determined by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso for zzso complexes with zzso zzso and zzso suggest a rational way of producing alignment zzso with different zzso In addition, knowledge of the delta zzso zzso of zzso allows modeling of the zzso zzso Despite evidence for residual mobility of the zzso with respect to the zzso the zzso shifts and residual zzso zzso displayed by proteins zzso to zzso are greater than those achievable with most other zzso binding zzso
