The zzso Class III zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis is a zzso zzso with two zzso centers at the zzso zzso and shows sequence similarity with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso either independently or together, to those present in zzso zzso not only failed to zzso zzso zzso activity to the zzso but also severely zzso the zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso in the behavior of the zzso on zzso zzso indicating differences in the zzso charge upon zzso of zzso zzso The zzso proteins showed zzso in zzso status as compared to the zzso zzso and differing abilities to zzso with the zzso zzso The crystal structure of a zzso has been solved to a resolution of zzso On the basis of the structure, and additional zzso studies, we provide possible reasons for the altered properties of the zzso zzso as well as highlight unique structural features of the zzso zzso zzso
