It is shown by protein sequence comparisons that a 148 zzso acid open reading frame zzso zzso located at zzso of the zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein with strong similarity to known zzso This protein contains five characteristic zzso acid sequence motifs that are common to the zzso gene zzso A similarity in size and high degree of sequence identity strongly suggest that the protein zzso by the zzso 148 of zzso zzso is zzso
