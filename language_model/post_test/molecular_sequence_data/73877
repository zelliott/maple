zzso gene D zzso resided on indigenous plasmids in races 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but the zzso in race 1 appeared to be zzso These were all zzso zzso genes because they neither induced the zzso zzso on zzso soybean zzso nor directed the production of zzso zzso when expressed in zzso coli zzso The predicted proteins zzso by the seven zzso zzso genes were very similar to that of a functional class II zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso race 2, but contained zzso collectively affecting only nine zzso acid zzso Despite these relatively small zzso acid differences and the location of zzso from each isolate on a zzso zzso restriction fragment, the zzso regions varied considerably among the zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso with few zzso but different zzso contexts in all tested zzso races argues that they provide an important selected function in the bacteria but have been modified to escape defense surveillance in zzso soybean zzso
