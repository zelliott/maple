zzso is a member of the zzso zzso pathway, where it acts as zzso by binding to zzso of zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso target gene zzso The zzso and its members are highly zzso in zzso from worms to zzso However, a zzso zzso from another species has not yet been zzso The identification of zzso in largely zzso species by zzso has failed so far probably due to a low degree of zzso zzso we turned to zzso zzso where a zzso zzso has been described zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is reasonably well zzso with regard to gene structure and zzso The prospective zzso protein zzso share several highly zzso regions which are separated by quite zzso zzso As to be expected, the largest region of high conservation zzso to the zzso binding zzso This region is also functionally zzso since this zzso zzso protein domain binds very strongly to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The other zzso regions support our earlier zzso analysis since they nicely zzso to previously zzso functionally important protein zzso Most notably, the very zzso domain which is very sensitive to structural zzso is nearly identical between the two zzso In zzso this evolutionary study improves the knowledge on functionally significant zzso of the zzso zzso and may be helpful for the future identification of zzso in other animals, especially in zzso
