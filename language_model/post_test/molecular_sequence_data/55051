zzso donor zzso selectivity zzso and double zzso are two concepts that have been used to explain how a zzso zzso and donor may be zzso or zzso in zzso zzso We describe here how the zzso and zzso of a zzso displaying two equatorial OH groups at zzso of zzso zzso units led to different zzso or different zzso zzso These results may be explained under the zzso donor zzso selectivity or double zzso zzso We also suggest a third explanation to these zzso the presence of a zzso at the zzso end zzso led to rigidity at this zzso which resulted into a mismatched pair during zzso but allowed zzso
