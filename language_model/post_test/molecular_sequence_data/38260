We report here on the molecular nature of an zzso zzso zzso a leaky zzso zzso of the zzso zzso seed locus that encodes a zzso cell wall zzso zzso The zzso locus specifies normal levels of the zzso transcript but extremely low levels (about zzso of zzso of the protein and zzso activity are zzso zzso analysis of zzso clones derived from the parental zzso and the zzso zzso shows a C to T transition in the zzso zzso leading to a single zzso acid zzso zzso to zzso near the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Although this change is not in the zzso domain, putative zzso sites, or the zzso zzso it does lie in a motif that is well zzso among all plant zzso and related zzso On the basis of these genetic in zzso data, we believe we have identified a zzso zzso in a zzso unknown zzso motif as critical for the stability of such zzso The single base change zzso to zzso also leads to the elimination of a zzso restriction site in the zzso zzso Indeed, zzso restriction zzso of zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso show one and two fragments, zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso clones from zzso (the reference zzso seeds predict five zzso acid zzso relative to zzso Whether or not these sequences are zzso by the zzso locus or another zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso remains to be zzso
