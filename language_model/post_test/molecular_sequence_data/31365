We identified and zzso a zzso clone zzso a zzso protein from zzso The predicted product of this zzso has a zzso domain that is substantially similar to the motor domain of zzso heavy zzso The zzso domain is unlike that found in previously identified zzso or zzso zzso zzso of this new sequence suggest that the zzso motor unit in the zzso zzso may be as little as 350 zzso zzso and that the existence of both zzso and zzso molecules must be an zzso ancient feature of zzso We also tested some of the zzso properties of the protein zzso by this zzso and found them to be similar to those of zzso Finally, the clone we isolated appears to zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso which when zzso causes defects in zzso and early embryonic zzso zzso zzso and whose recently determined sequence predicts a zzso zzso
