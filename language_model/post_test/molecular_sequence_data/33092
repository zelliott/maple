In zzso replication licensing, zzso plays a key role by recruiting the zzso complex onto the origin of zzso The zzso domain of mouse zzso zzso the most zzso region in zzso is essential for licensing and directly interacts with the zzso zzso We have determined the structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso using X-ray zzso and solution zzso zzso zzso While the zzso 31 zzso of zzso form a flexible loop with a short zzso near the middle, the rest of zzso folds into a winged zzso zzso Together with the middle domain of mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso this study reveals that zzso is formed with a tandem repeat of the winged zzso zzso The winged zzso fold is also zzso in other licensing factors including zzso zzso and zzso which supports an idea that these replication initiators may have evolved from a common zzso Based on the structure of zzso in conjunction with the zzso analysis, we propose a binding site for the zzso complex within the zzso
