The human zzso factor zzso is comprised of zzso protein zzso in complex with one zzso factor zzso of 170 zzso We report the isolation of the zzso for zzso By zzso and zzso experiments, we show that the protein zzso by the zzso encodes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso zzso of its primary structure reveals a striking zzso with genes of other organisms, zzso zzso and zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso zzso Both zzso were isolated in genetic screens as global regulators of pol II zzso This supports our zzso of zzso as a pol II zzso factor and suggests that specific zzso complexes perform distinct functions during zzso
