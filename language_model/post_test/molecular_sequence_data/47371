The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains genes needed for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Here the completed DNA sequence of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso of previously unpublished zzso DNA sequence substantiated previous studies indicating that the zzso zzso was acquired by horizontal gene transfer and allowed the identification of 16 hypothetical zzso This brings the total number of genes in the zzso zzso to 21 and the total number of genes at the zzso locus to zzso Of these, six zzso proteins of unknown function and are not closely related to sequences of known function found in zzso Two zzso proteins involved in transport and zzso Six probably zzso zzso needed for the zzso of zzso zzso Two zzso proteins related to those used for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Five zzso proteins related to those involved in the formation of zzso zzso known as zzso and two zzso proteins that appear zzso related to those involved in zzso zzso In addition, it is shown that zzso zzso forms zzso bodies that are involved in the degradation of zzso zzso are formed during either zzso or zzso growth on zzso but not during growth on other carbon zzso zzso tests demonstrate that genes of the zzso zzso are required for zzso body formation, and zzso zzso shows that zzso zzso zzso is associated with these zzso This is the first evidence for a zzso zzso associated with a zzso zzso It is proposed that the zzso consist of zzso zzso zzso (and perhaps other zzso encased within a protein shell that is related to the shell of zzso The specific function of these unusual zzso bodies was not determined, but some possibilities are zzso
