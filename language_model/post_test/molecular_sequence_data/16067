From an analysis of the zzso of known structure we derive a list of 40 sites crucial for the zzso structure of the variable zzso We show that, with marginal exceptions, the sequences of the zzso alpha beta receptors contain, at sites zzso to these 40, the same or very similar zzso Thus the V zzso beta zzso has a framework structure very close to that of the zzso Further comparisons show that parts of the surface of the V zzso beta framework are zzso They also show that the zzso that form the zzso site are similar in size to those commonly found in the zzso but have different zzso Only limited sequence variations occur in the first loop of the zzso site in both V alpha and V zzso This, and their geometrical arrangement, suggest that they mainly interact with the zzso zzso
