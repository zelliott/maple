zzso protein zzso of influenza virus zzso its own zzso this suggested that a zzso segment of zzso with zzso properties could serve as an zzso zzso A zzso zzso to the zzso finger region of the zzso sequence of influenza virus strain zzso centered around zzso acids zzso 148 to 166 was shown earlier to be zzso more effective as a zzso inhibitor than zzso This zzso designated zzso 6, represents a zzso finger which includes a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in addition to the 4 zzso on either side of the loop involved in coordination of zzso We have now demonstrated zzso activity for this zzso in zzso measuring zzso of the viral zzso zzso When the zzso was introduced into tissue culture 5 zzso after viral challenge with zzso zzso activity was seen at levels as low as zzso zzso on a zzso basis, the zzso was shown to be zzso to zzso more effective than zzso or zzso zzso activity was seen with addition of the zzso up to 1 h after viral zzso however, little or no activity was seen at later times, suggesting that viral replication is inhibited at an early stage, possibly at the level of zzso Reduction in the finger loop or tail length reduced zzso zzso reduction in the number of zzso involved in coordination of zzso abolished zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso 6 was shown to have zzso activity against other type A influenza zzso including those representing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity against type B influenza viruses was also zzso A low level of activity against zzso zzso virus was zzso zzso finger peptides or zzso of zzso finger peptides may provide a new class of zzso agents effective against influenza virus and possibly other zzso
