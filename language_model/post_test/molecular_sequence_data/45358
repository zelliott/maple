A zzso zzso study was carried out to determine the zzso position of a newly isolated zzso zzso designated zzso which had been isolated from sludge from the main zzso treatment tanks of a municipal sewage treatment zzso zzso analysis based on comparative zzso zzso gene sequencing indicated that strain zzso was closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso the sole species in the zzso zzso zzso zzso comprised zzso zzso zzso and slightly curved zzso The zzso respiratory zzso was zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso zzso zzso together with zzso determination showed that strain zzso could be distinguished from zzso zzso Moreover, some zzso properties concerning zzso activity, the zzso zzso as carbon sources and growth conditions distinguish strain zzso from zzso zzso On the basis of the results obtained in this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the type strain of a novel species of zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
