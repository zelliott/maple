zzso hormone resistance zzso is primarily an zzso dominant inherited disease characterized by resistance of zzso and peripheral zzso to the action of zzso zzso We investigated whether the zzso zzso features that occur not only among zzso but also within the same zzso might be due to the expression of differing ratios of zzso and normal receptors in zzso Using an zzso primer extension method, we determined the relative expression of normal and zzso zzso from the zzso of affected and unaffected members of two zzso with zzso zzso and zzso While two affected members of zzso as expected, had nearly equal amounts of normal and zzso zzso beta zzso two other members had zzso zzso levels that accounted for at least zzso of the zzso beta zzso zzso zzso within and between zzso with generalized resistance to zzso hormone zzso may be due to this differential expression of the zzso and wild type zzso Furthermore, when several clinical parameters of zzso were compared in several affected members from two zzso with zzso we found that two cases in one zzso exhibited a high zzso zzso beta ratio and had considerably more bone resistance during their zzso In certain zzso with zzso differing ratios of normal and zzso zzso receptors may be age and growth related and may account for the reported zzso of zzso symptoms with zzso
