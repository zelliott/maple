The partial sequences of zzso I of zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso cattle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and buffalo zzso zzso were zzso Comparisons of these sequences and the deduced zzso acid sequences with the zzso zzso gene and protein sequences in other zzso species including pig zzso zzso human zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso retrieved from the zzso were carried out and finally a zzso tree was constructed using the partial DNA sequences of the zzso genes in all zzso The results showed that the zzso of the partial zzso I sequences of the zzso genes between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso human, zzso and rat were as high as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This was accompanied by highly zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity, zzso There are more zzso less zzso and no zzso or deletion in variable zzso of the zzso genes between the zzso and other zzso The majority of the variable zzso was synonymous and was found most frequently at the third zzso followed by the first and second zzso a finding that was in accordance with the zzso hypothesis for molecular zzso In the zzso tree, the cattle and zzso were clustered together first, followed by the zzso zzso zzso human, zzso and zzso This was in agreement with zzso suggesting that the partial sequences of zzso I of the zzso genes were useful in constructing the zzso tree of zzso zzso Among the four species of zzso genetic differentiation in the zzso genes between zzso and buffalo is equivalent to that between buffalo and cattle and between buffalo and zzso Furthermore, the genetic distances in the zzso genes are much smaller between zzso zzso and zzso than those between each of the three species and the zzso zzso it is reasonable to consider zzso as an independent species of the zzso zzso
