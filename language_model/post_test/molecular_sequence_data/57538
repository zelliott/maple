The zzso zzso gene encodes an essential 282 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is related to the zzso zzso of bovine zzso zzso and to zzso zzso a zzso sorting protein also shown to have zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso most likely acts by zzso zzso zzso activity because zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso and because a zzso zzso double disruption zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest, as does zzso Our results further suggest that zzso zzso whose zzso significance has not been determined, are an important signal in cell cycle zzso In zzso this signal may act in a signal zzso zzso similar to the zzso signal zzso zzso in T zzso
