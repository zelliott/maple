A zzso method has been developed for distinguishing between the sibling species zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Patton, two important zzso zzso of zzso DNA fragments of species diagnostic length are amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso from a small amount of unknown DNA and three different zzso zzso All three zzso zzso are based on zzso DNA zzso zzso A universal zzso primer zzso is derived from a zzso region at the 3' end of the zzso zzso coding zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are derived from sequences in the zzso zzso The zzso sequence is approximately zzso zzso downstream of zzso the zzso sequence is about zzso zzso downstream of zzso When zzso DNA is amplified in the presence of all three zzso a zzso zzso zzso is produced if zzso zzso DNA is used as template, and a zzso zzso zzso is produced if zzso zzso DNA is zzso zzso of DNA from zzso zzso hybrids produces both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Neither diagnostic zzso is produced when DNA from other species in the zzso zzso complex is used as zzso
