zzso zzso have been extensively studied for zzso purposes and to investigate zzso and zzso genetic zzso In recent years, numerous groups have undertaken sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that zzso humans and animals mainly in Asia, including the zzso River zzso We zzso and determined the organization of the complete zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso long, containing 12 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso a small and a large zzso and 22 transfer zzso zzso Like other zzso it does not zzso the zzso zzso All genes are transcribed from the same zzso The zzso initiation zzso is used for 9 zzso zzso and zzso for the remaining 3 zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso has a single long zzso region between zzso and zzso zzso zzso has evolved as being more closely related to zzso than other zzso groups with zzso support in the zzso zzso Our results could provide a resource for the comparative zzso zzso analysis of zzso and may yield genetic markers for molecular zzso investigations into zzso zzso
