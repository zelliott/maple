zzso are typically the first zzso in host defense against invading zzso which they destroy by both zzso and zzso zzso However, despite a longstanding recognition of zzso presence at disease sites in zzso their role in defense against zzso is zzso Here we exploit the genetic zzso and optical transparency of zzso to monitor zzso behavior and its consequences during infection with zzso zzso a natural fish zzso In contrast to zzso zzso do not interact with zzso at initial infection zzso zzso are subsequently recruited to the nascent zzso in response to signals from dying infected zzso within the zzso which they zzso Some zzso then rapidly kill the zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso Our results provide a zzso link to the observed patterns of zzso in human zzso zzso and the zzso of humans with chronic zzso disease to zzso zzso
