zzso zzso studies zzso much effort in determining whether environmental selection or zzso processes related to zzso are more important in shaping community zzso While both types of factors are possibly zzso it is tacitly assumed that zzso or microbial zzso in general, behave zzso as zzso because of their small physical zzso However, direct evidence for this in exactly the same environment and at the same zzso depth is zzso In this study, we compared the structure of both zzso and zzso components of microbial communities forming zzso on mineral zzso in different geographic locations at the level of zzso zzso zzso operational zzso units zzso These microbial communities are subjected to strong environmental selection and contain significant proportions of zzso zzso adapted to zzso and zzso zzso We find that the nature of the zzso as well as zzso variables and geography influences microbial community zzso However, constrained correspondence analyses and zzso zzso showed that, whereas the zzso type was the most significant factor structuring bacterial communities, geographic location was the most influential factor for microbial zzso zzso Biological explanations zzso a higher zzso success for bacteria combined with more mobile lifestyles for predatory zzso may zzso these different zzso versus microbial zzso zzso zzso
