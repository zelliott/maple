zzso play a key role in maintaining the zzso of the zzso They are made of a complex set of proteins that degrade zzso proteins and zzso Studies involving zzso contribution to cellular functions such as zzso class I and II zzso production have used zzso zzso zzso knockout mice that lack one of the zzso or zzso zzso from human zzso Each of these approaches has some zzso in analyzing zzso zzso zzso 

In this study, we have developed a simple methodology to assess zzso zzso zzso By varying the pH in crude zzso from human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso we documented increased zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso Using this new method, we showed that the degradation of zzso peptides in low pH extracts analyzed by mass zzso followed similar zzso and degradation patterns as those performed with zzso zzso 

By using crude zzso in the place of zzso zzso this method will be a quick and useful tool to assess zzso zzso activities in primary cells of limited zzso This quick method will especially be useful to screen zzso zzso to degradation in zzso compartments for zzso processing studies, following which detailed analysis using zzso zzso may be used to study specific zzso
