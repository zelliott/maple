zzso is a zzso zzso cell leukemia line derived from zzso mice and has been used in the study of signaling pathways in B zzso zzso cells were initially found to cause widespread disease upon injections in zzso We have isolated zzso zzso divergent in their capacity to lead to morbidity after zzso One zzso zzso elicits an immune response protecting the animal from tumor zzso Another zzso zzso does not induce an effective immune response and causes zzso We demonstrated that both zzso and zzso T cells are required for the rejection of zzso zzso Interestingly, the immune response generated against zzso cells was found to protect against a challenge with the lethal zzso zzso This indicates that although both lines can be recognized and killed by the immune system, only zzso is capable of inducing a protective zzso Further zzso using zzso isolated from zzso demonstrated that immune recognition of a portion of the cells was sufficient for zzso zzso of zzso and zzso T cells in animals injected previously with zzso cells showed that T cells, and not zzso were required for the maintenance of the protection initiated by zzso We tested the capacity of zzso cells to treat mice challenged with zzso We can delay injections of zzso and still provide protection for the zzso We have a model of zzso rejection which will allow us to dissect the requirements for the initiation of immune responses against an ALL tumor cell zzso
