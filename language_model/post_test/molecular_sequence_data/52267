As part of a zzso drug design program directed against zzso targets in the human zzso virus zzso we have determined the three-dimensional structures of the zzso type 1 zzso zzso with two zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso with the zzso bond being replaced by a zzso zzso The structures were determined using zzso zzso data to zzso A measured at the Cornell High Energy zzso zzso on zzso zzso of each of the zzso The structures have been extensively refined using a zzso space zzso method to conventional zzso R factors of zzso and zzso zzso The protein structure differs from that in the zzso state of the zzso and is most similar to that of the structure of the other reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sawyer, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Schneider, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 29, zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Unlike in that structure, however, the zzso are observed, in the present crystal structures, in two equally abundant zzso that are a consequence of the zzso nature of the zzso coupled with the zzso structures of the zzso Although the differences between the two zzso used in the present study are confined to the zzso site, the van der zzso interactions made by the inhibitor atoms with the zzso acid zzso in the protein differ throughout the structures of the zzso
