In zzso zzso the zzso (the product of the zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso which is present adjacent and 3' of the zzso zzso zzso in seven zzso species, two of which are zzso and zzso These two zzso species also exist as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, both having an extra G in the zzso loop next to and 3' of zzso The zzso form of the zzso efficiently zzso these zzso zzso We have characterized one class of zzso forms of the zzso that does not zzso the zzso zzso and thereby induce extensive zzso resulting in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of strains containing such a zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with the zzso zzso had reduced zzso activity caused by either a zzso zzso in the zzso or a deletion of its structural zzso or by an increased level of zzso in the zzso However, the zzso zzso as well as the zzso counterparts of these two zzso are efficiently zzso by this class of structural altered zzso Two other zzso zzso zzso were found to reduce the zzso of all potential zzso zzso and therefore primarily affect the zzso activity of the zzso We conclude that all zzso except two zzso and zzso do not primarily affect the zzso activity, but rather the zzso specificity of the zzso because, unlike the zzso form of the zzso they recognize and zzso the zzso but not an altered form of a zzso Moreover, we show that the zzso zzso is present in zzso excess in the zzso
