We have zzso the hormone binding regions of the entire putative zzso domain of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso using synthetic zzso A series of 26 overlapping peptides zzso the complete sequence of the zzso domain of zzso was zzso Each zzso (20 zzso acid zzso each) was tested for its ability to interact with zzso as evidenced by zzso of binding of labeled hormone to native, membrane bound zzso zzso Four of the 26 peptides zzso with labeled zzso and inhibited its binding to zzso zzso The most potent of these peptides was zzso which inhibited zzso zzso binding with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The remaining peptides were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 245 zzso An additional zzso zzso showed minimal activity, and the remaining 21 peptides showed no zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also inhibited binding of zzso zzso zzso to zzso membrane zzso suggesting that those regions of the zzso are involved in binding of a common zzso hormone structure such as the zzso In contrast, peptides zzso and zzso did not inhibit human zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these two regions are involved in zzso zzso Of interest is the finding that the latter two peptides are from regions of zzso that are largely zzso to the zzso zzso whereas the former three, with the exception of zzso are from regions that are largely zzso between the two zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso regions of the zzso domain of zzso are involved in the binding of the zzso Furthermore, the binding regions are localized to zzso sequences as well as to regions that are highly zzso to zzso This suggests that zzso regions of the two receptors are likely to perform similar functions in the interaction with their specific hormone, suggesting that those regions may be involved in binding of the zzso hormone common zzso
