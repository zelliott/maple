The Black and Caspian zzso have experienced alternating periods of isolation and zzso over many zzso climate zzso and most recently became separated when the zzso overflow from the Caspian Sea ceased at the end of the last zzso zzso habitat changes have zzso had profound impacts on distribution and demography of aquatic species, yet uncertainties remain about the relative roles of isolation and zzso in the response of species shared between the Black and Caspian Sea zzso We examined these issues using zzso analysis of an zzso zzso fish zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of sequence variation at two nuclear and one zzso genes suggest that the Black and Caspian zzso supported separate populations of zzso zzso during the last zzso zzso estimates from the fitted zzso model showed that their separation was not complete, however, and that the two populations continued to exchange genes in both zzso These analyses also suggested that majority of zzso occurred during the zzso showing that the variation shared between the Black and Caspian zzso is the result of ancient zzso along the temporary natural connections between the zzso rather than of incomplete lineage sorting or recent zzso zzso Gene flow between the zzso populations was therefore an important source of genetic variation, and we suggest that it facilitated the evolutionary response of the populations to changing zzso
