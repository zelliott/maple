In a previously studied family with inherited zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was shown to segregate with a constitutional balanced zzso In addition, we recently showed that in a zzso tumor from this family the constitutional zzso became zzso suggesting a genetic mechanism that may be associated with the primary genetic events of zzso We now report that the zzso tumor cells from this case showed additional zzso zzso possibly related to tumor zzso which include an additional zzso zzso involving band 14 of zzso zzso Because this band contains the zzso zzso zzso we examined the tumor for aberrations in the RB gene using DNA sequence zzso analysis and zzso gel zzso zzso but did not detect zzso in the RB zzso
