zzso nuclear extract was resolved into a depleted fraction incapable of supporting mismatch repair in zzso and repair activity was restored upon the addition of a zzso fraction isolated from zzso cells by in zzso zzso zzso The highly enriched zzso activity zzso with a DNA zzso and the most pure fraction contained DNA zzso delta but was free of zzso DNA zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso delta also fully restored mismatch repair to the depleted zzso indicating DNA zzso delta is required for mismatch repair in human zzso However, due to the presence of DNA zzso alpha and zzso in the depleted zzso potential involvement of one or both of these activities in the reaction cannot be zzso
