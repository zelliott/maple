A zzso soluble zzso zzso from sheep brain was isolated, zzso and compared with similar zzso from other zzso zzso identities of zzso acid sequence and the zzso recognition domain zzso revealed that the isolated zzso shares all the absolutely preserved and critical zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The isolated sheep brain zzso zzso showed more than zzso zzso acid sequence zzso and zzso recognition domain identity zzso with human brain zzso zzso changes were found induced by interaction of the protein with its specific zzso and zzso agent zzso zzso Upon zzso a drastic change in the environment of aromatic zzso and zzso of the zzso was observed with the loss of zzso activity, while no significant change was observed upon addition of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting no significant modification in the secondary as well as zzso structures of sheep brain zzso But the functional integrity of the zzso is found to be affected in the presence of zzso agent, indicating zzso zzso bonds and requirement of complete zzso chain for functional integrity of the zzso recognition zzso
