The bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso include important food safety and zzso zzso By extensive mining of the whole zzso and protein databases of diverse, closely and zzso related bacterial species and zzso we have identified novel zzso regions, which we zzso to develop a rapid detection platform for these zzso The specific zzso targets we have identified to design the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contained either known genes or putative zzso zzso sets were designed from the target regions for use in real-time zzso zzso to detect specific zzso pathogens at species or strain zzso The primer sets were first tested by in zzso zzso against zzso sequences of different species, subspecies, or strains and then by in zzso zzso against zzso DNA preparations from 23 strains representing six zzso agents zzso coli zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and six zzso pathogens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each pathogen was specifically identifiable at the zzso and species zzso zzso zzso performed with zzso DNA showed the lowest detection limit of 128 zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso A preliminary test to detect zzso organisms in a milk zzso also enabled the detection of 6 to 60 zzso These new tools could ultimately be used to develop platforms to simultaneously detect these zzso
