The functional contributions of zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso A protein zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso We generated a series of zzso in which zzso of zzso was changed to Ala, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso By genetic analysis of zzso genes in a zzso zzso zzso background, it was shown that all these zzso caused the zzso These results indicate that the 87th zzso acid of zzso coli zzso must have negative charge in expressing the zzso of zzso zzso These findings also suggest that the zzso group of zzso may interact with zzso zzso
