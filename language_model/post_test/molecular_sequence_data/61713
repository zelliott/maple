zzso is a zzso zzso family member that is normally zzso to zzso V zzso by binding to the zzso light chain 2 zzso Certain damage signals release zzso which then binds zzso zzso proteins and triggers zzso Here, two novel zzso of human zzso zzso and zzso were identified and cloned from zzso derived from zzso zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso and zzso were characterized as two zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain but retaining the zzso binding zzso zzso (here called zzso expression in zzso cells induced zzso and reduced colony formation in contrast to zzso and zzso which had no effect on zzso and instead increased colony zzso While zzso zzso was expressed in many cell types, expression was higher in B zzso cells and zzso and zzso were mainly detected in zzso and normal B zzso zzso zzso was zzso in normal and zzso B cells, while zzso zzso was zzso only in zzso cells by serum zzso We show that zzso is regulated by zzso zzso and alternative zzso and conclude that the relative levels of zzso zzso may have a role in regulating growth and survival in B cells and zzso zzso zzso
