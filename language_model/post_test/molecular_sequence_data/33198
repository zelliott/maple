A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from an zzso soil near an oil zzso located in Kaohsiung County, zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that strain zzso clustered with zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The fatty acid profile of the novel strain was slightly different from those reported for recognized zzso zzso The zzso system contained zzso zzso as the zzso zzso The major polar lipids were zzso an unknown polar zzso an unknown zzso and an unknown zzso The main cell zzso was zzso lesser amounts of zzso and zzso were also zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso tests allowed the zzso and zzso differentiation of strain zzso from recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso is thus considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
