During the zzso growth of zzso zzso electrons are conveyed from the zzso zzso zzso complex to the zzso reaction center by either the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of a recently established zzso of zzso zzso zzso consisting of an zzso zzso domain functioning as a membrane anchor and a zzso zzso domain zzso to zzso c of various zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso have now been found in several bacterial species, including zzso zzso In this work, a zzso zzso and functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso of isolated zzso zzso indicated that its spectral and zzso properties are very similar to those of other zzso zzso in particular to those from bacterial and plant zzso zzso zzso acid sequence determination for zzso zzso zzso revealed that its signal zzso zzso portion is zzso zzso it is anchored to the zzso To demonstrate that the zzso domain of zzso zzso is indeed its membrane anchor, this sequence was fused to the N zzso of zzso zzso The resulting hybrid zzso c zzso remained membrane bound and was able to support zzso growth of zzso zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso can support zzso electron transfer during zzso growth in either a freely zzso or a zzso zzso These findings should now allow for the first time the comparison of electron transfer properties of a given electron carrier when it is anchored to the membrane or is freely zzso in the zzso
