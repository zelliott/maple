zzso DNA zzso clones zzso two G protein zzso proteins zzso alpha 1 and zzso alpha 2) were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso tip cell zzso library using zzso zzso G protein zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso alpha 1 gene indicates that the gene contains an open reading frame zzso that translates into a putative zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso alpha 1 protein exhibits similarity to all known G protein zzso (it has all of the consensus regions for a zzso zzso especially the zzso retinal G zzso zzso The zzso alpha 1 zzso sequence is 50% identical overall to the zzso zzso zzso alpha 1 shares the same zzso size grouping as zzso zzso and, unlike many other G zzso both zzso alpha 1 and zzso seem to possess a zzso toxin zzso and zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso alpha 1 and zzso alpha 2 zzso expression revealed that, unlike zzso alpha 2 which seems to be zzso zzso zzso alpha 1 is expressed only in zzso that are competent in responding to zzso Thus, the zzso alpha 1 product, zzso alpha 1, is a likely candidate for regulating the blue zzso signal zzso zzso system found in zzso
