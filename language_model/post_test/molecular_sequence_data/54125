A novel zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from the zzso of tomato plants grown in zzso zzso The strain produced zzso white aerial zzso zzso acid and a large quantity of double zzso zzso on potato zzso zzso and zzso zzso extract zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso was not sensitive to zzso zzso observations revealed that strain zzso produced zzso chains of zzso zzso zzso data confirmed that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso zzso zzso were not zzso No zzso activity was observed against zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso but zzso activity was observed against zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that strain zzso was related most closely to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso between strain zzso and the type strains of these species were low zzso Furthermore, strain zzso could be differentiated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and other closely related species of the zzso zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of its zzso and molecular properties, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
