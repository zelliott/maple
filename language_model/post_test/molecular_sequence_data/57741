The zzso zzso zzso zzso was reacted with DNA in zzso to form apparent zzso zzso The extent of zzso zzso formation was monitored by a gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso of DNA was observed within 1 zzso with 5 zzso of zzso The zzso zzso were heat zzso with a zzso melting temperature of 70 degrees C (10 zzso exposure to zzso in zzso zzso When zzso zzso were detected as zzso of zzso 12 zzso sites were observed with 8 being prior to zzso zzso one prior to zzso one prior to zzso and 2 at unresolved combinations of these zzso These zzso zzso reveal the same sites of zzso zzso as detected by in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on single strand DNA, where the zzso at zzso and zzso were identified as sites of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso as a probable site of zzso zzso The zzso stability of both types of zzso (10 zzso exposure to zzso ranged from zzso degrees C at individual zzso High levels of zzso were detected with zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso These results suggest zzso formation involving an zzso linkage between the 3 position of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso
