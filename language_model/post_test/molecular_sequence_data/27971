The DNA sequences involved in zzso control by a zzso mechanism have been localized in the zzso gene promoter region by a functional zzso The zzso zzso sequences from the bovine zzso gene were linked to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of this reporter gene was studied in dog zzso in primary culture in the presence, or absence, of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso region is contained within the first 250 zzso of the promoter, and suggests that it could zzso to a sequence zzso between zzso These DNA sequences do not bear significant zzso with zzso elements zzso described zzso By contrast, some similarities were found with the zzso element zzso of genes under zzso control in zzso and with DNA elements zzso zzso regulation of expression of two different genes in the lower zzso zzso zzso This suggests that control of zzso gene zzso by zzso could involve a mechanism different from the one zzso by a classical zzso
