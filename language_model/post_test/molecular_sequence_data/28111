zzso analysis of the zzso zzso 6 gene from chicken revealed that its 3' region is virtually identical with a chicken zzso 7 S zzso which was reported to induce the expression of zzso functions in zzso zzso Using chicken and quail cell lines depleted of zzso DNA, we demonstrate that the 7 S zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso and not by nuclear zzso DNA as suggested zzso Moreover, no 7 S zzso transcript of the expected length (about 400 zzso is zzso either in these cell lines or in heart and liver zzso The only zzso species zzso with a 7 S zzso probe is an abundant, 900 base long transcript of zzso origin that we identify as the zzso zzso 6 fused zzso We suggest that the characterized zzso 7 S zzso zzso is derived from an unrelated contaminant in the zzso zzso
