The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a typical zzso zzso which can cause zzso in zzso Host zzso and blood cells are important sources of nutrients for development, growth and reproduction of zzso zzso In this study, a zzso clone zzso a 47 zzso zzso of zzso zzso was characterized by sequencing analysis, and its zzso was investigated zzso The zzso tree prepared based on the zzso gene showed high zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso at zzso pH (from zzso to zzso and its activity was almost completely inhibited by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso zzso zzso was localized in the zzso of the adult zzso zzso zzso that the protein has a specific zzso These observations suggest that zzso may act as a zzso zzso for acquisition of nutrients from host zzso Further investigations may provide insights into zzso zzso in zzso zzso
