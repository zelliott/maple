Recent advances in the molecular characterization of specific zzso of the zzso zzso have allowed rapid progress in the study of the structure, function, and regulation of these members of a family of zzso zzso zzso Two distinct zzso have been identified, one from zzso zzso and another found specifically in the diluting segment of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso The discovery of three alternatively spliced zzso of the zzso zzso which differ only by 31 zzso acids and which appear to be zzso distributed within the zzso thick ascending limb of the loop of zzso highlight this spliced region as an important functional component of the zzso
