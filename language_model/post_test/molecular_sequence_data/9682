zzso is an essential zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso protein similar to the zzso zzso protein zzso We have found that zzso like zzso and zzso can be attached to other proteins zzso and have characterized the processes leading to the zzso of the zzso zzso for zzso First, the zzso translation product is zzso zzso to expose zzso the mature zzso The presence of zzso is critical for zzso abilities to be zzso to protein zzso and to complement the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a novel zzso zzso consisting of zzso a previously identified 71 zzso protein similar to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso a 40 zzso protein similar to the zzso of zzso zzso with conditional zzso zzso showed that zzso is required for zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso are both essential zzso providing additional evidence that they act in a distinct zzso whose role in cell viability is to zzso zzso to other zzso
