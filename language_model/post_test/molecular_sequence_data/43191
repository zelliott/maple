Here we present the first description of the presence of two distinct types of zzso zzso genes in the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso We cloned and determined the zzso sequences of all four zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso comparisons revealed that the zzso of zzso zzso contains two distinct types of zzso zzso zzso each type consisting of two identical or nearly identical copies, and three identical copies of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the two types of zzso zzso genes differ at 98 zzso positions zzso of total zzso together with six regions of zzso None of the base zzso or zzso zzso to any of the approximately 600 zzso zzso or rarely variable zzso indicating that both genes are zzso Both types of zzso zzso genes are transcribed and processed as determined by Northern zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso
