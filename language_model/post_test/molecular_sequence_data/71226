We have cloned and zzso a full length rabbit zzso 1 and partial rabbit zzso 3 zzso The derived rabbit zzso 3 zzso revealed zzso zzso to the zzso zzso to the zzso human, dog, and zzso and zzso to the chicken zzso 3 zzso Using Northern zzso analysis, we investigated the tissue and brain cellular distribution of zzso 1 and zzso 3 zzso In addition, we examined the effect of development and zzso upon brain zzso 1 and zzso 3 zzso zzso While zzso 1 zzso was observed in most zzso zzso 3 was expressed predominantly in the brain, zzso stomach, and lung with minor amounts in the heart, kidney and skeletal zzso In the brain, both zzso 1 and zzso 3 were noted in zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso 1 and zzso 3 zzso levels demonstrated a similar zzso progression zzso secondary to zzso zzso Further, while zzso did not significantly affect brain zzso 1 zzso and zzso it altered zzso 3 zzso levels in a zzso manner, with a zzso increase in the cerebral cortex, a zzso increase in the zzso and a 50% increase in the zzso nucleus zzso We zzso that the rabbit zzso 3 zzso sequence exhibits zzso zzso to that of other species in the coding region with a zzso sequence identity in the zzso zzso The zzso expression of rabbit zzso 3 mimics that of the human zzso zzso development and zzso with zzso injury cause an increase in brain zzso 3 zzso as a response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso
