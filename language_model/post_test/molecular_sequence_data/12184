The zzso strain of zzso has four genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso located at three zzso zzso These four zzso genes are zzso over their regions of DNA zzso When zzso copy number is reduced by deletion of two zzso arrayed genes zzso a zzso with zzso zzso zzso results, because the two remaining zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso supply insufficient zzso zzso These two zzso genes can be inherited through zzso even when they are zzso away from each other in crosses to a strain with zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso genes are zzso and zzso plants yield occasional zzso zzso sectors and zzso zzso lines display zzso reduced zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso that this zzso acts in a concerted manner across the zzso rather than at individual zzso
