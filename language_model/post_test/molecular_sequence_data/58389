The solution structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso This zzso belongs to a separate class of small bacterial zzso c for which no zzso structure has been reported so zzso It is characterized by a very low zzso potential zzso zzso and is isolated from the zzso of zzso purple zzso zzso For the 78 zzso zzso zzso zzso derived distance constraints were used in a combined simulated zzso molecular dynamics zzso The final ensemble of 37 structures presents a backbone zzso of less than zzso A compared to the mean zzso The physical viability of these structures was investigated by subjecting eight of them to a constraint free molecular dynamics zzso No systematic zzso change was observed and the average backbone zzso compared to the initial structures was less than zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a striking resemblance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in backbone zzso occur in three small regions which are implicated in zzso protection of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that only the common zzso c core, zzso three zzso is zzso The folding of the protein chain around the zzso zzso is very different and results in more efficient zzso protection in zzso zzso The zzso surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be significantly different from zzso zzso c and bacterial zzso zzso but similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso
