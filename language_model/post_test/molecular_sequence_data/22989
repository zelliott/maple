zzso sequences were identified immediately upstream of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso but were absent in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted from zzso of zzso sequences upstream of zzso zzso provided strong promoter zzso and it was demonstrated that the change in the zzso binding site sequence resulting from zzso of zzso did not influence expression of the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso were almost identical and that zzso elements had a high percentage of zzso
