To perform genetic analysis of the zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso may provide new insights into the genetic evolution and origin of the Argentinean zzso zzso 

A total of 76 sequences were analyzed by neighbor joining zzso maximum zzso and maximum likelihood zzso The analysis of the selective pressures was performed using the zzso zzso 

The trees showed similar zzso Two zzso were zzso the first zzso was formed by strains isolated mainly from a donkey, whereas the second zzso presented four large groups from different geographic regions exclusively from zzso zzso In this zzso we identified a group formed by South African and another one by South American and European zzso In the latter, the zzso group was formed by seven Argentinean zzso In the NJ tree, we identified a group formed by six Argentinean zzso The zzso test showed a D value of zzso indicating that the sequences analyzed follow a neutral evolution zzso 

We concluded that the Argentinean sequences have a zzso origin and that the fixation of point zzso might follow the neutral model zzso however, we identified zzso pressures that may be involved in the differentiation of the zzso zzso
