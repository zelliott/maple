Whole body zzso is an important factor contributing to low back and zzso zzso zzso loading as a mechanical stimulus is transferred to zzso zzso as energy from ground reaction forces, as well as a direct input from the use of motorized tools and zzso zzso zzso degradation parallels increased age and mechanical stimuli resulting in disc zzso and eventual spinal zzso 

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between zzso loading and zzso zzso expression in cultured rabbit zzso zzso 

An in zzso rabbit model using cultured zzso zzso cells isolated from normal zzso disc was used to study zzso and zzso expression in response to zzso 

zzso zzso cells were isolated by zzso zzso from New Zealand White zzso zzso stimulation was applied to zzso cells in zzso using an zzso platform to deliver zzso zzso gravity load at 6 zzso for 2, 4, 6 or 8 zzso Gene expression was assessed by reverse zzso zzso chain zzso 

zzso collagen Type III and zzso zzso gene expression was suppressed by zzso loading in rabbit zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene might lead to a decrease in zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso load may play an important role in zzso zzso metabolism of zzso disc cells, especially in the gene expression zzso of zzso It has been proposed that zzso loading increases production of zzso zzso zzso We have demonstrated that gene expression for key zzso messages and zzso zzso is decreased by zzso In conclusion, we believe that study of the roles between zzso zzso gene suppression and mechanical stress may clarify the zzso of disc zzso such as disc zzso or zzso
