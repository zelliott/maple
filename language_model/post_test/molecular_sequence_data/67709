zzso and zzso zzso are bacterial zzso of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we isolated and characterized zzso and zzso zzso from across Thailand together with their associated zzso zzso and characterized their zzso zzso zzso were isolated from soil samples using a zzso zzso zzso from zzso were cultured and zzso based on zzso zzso The zzso were identified based on sequences of zzso zzso and internal transcribed zzso zzso A total of zzso soil samples were collected from 159 sites in 13 provinces across zzso A total of 126 zzso isolated from samples taken from 10 provinces were positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis separated the 69 zzso zzso into 4 zzso Groups 1, 2 and 3 consisting of 52, 13 and 1 zzso related to zzso zzso and group 4 consisting of 3 zzso related to zzso zzso The zzso host for zzso related to zzso zzso was zzso zzso and for zzso zzso was zzso zzso The zzso species were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis divided zzso zzso into five zzso Groups 1 and 2 consisted of 45 and 8 zzso defined as subspecies zzso and zzso zzso One isolate was related to zzso and zzso two zzso were related to zzso and one isolate was the zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the major zzso host for zzso This study reveals the genetic diversity of zzso and zzso zzso and describes new associations between zzso and their bacterial zzso in zzso
