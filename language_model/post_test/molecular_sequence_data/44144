zzso also known as heart muscle zzso is a recently identified zzso zzso We have isolated two human zzso that zzso different zzso of zzso Using reverse zzso we provide evidence that both zzso are derived by alternative zzso and zzso two proteins of 88 and 90 zzso that are detected in zzso analyses with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso cells, and zzso protection experiments with isolated zzso and zzso indicate that zzso is an integral membrane protein of the inner zzso zzso zzso zzso is transported into isolated zzso zzso in a reaction that depends on the membrane potential across the inner zzso membrane zzso zzso During zzso in zzso import, zzso is zzso processed to the mature protein that is also detected in cellular zzso indicating that the zzso leader sequence is zzso zzso analysis and our results suggest that zzso is anchored in the inner zzso membrane with an zzso zzso domain, while the majority of the protein is zzso into the zzso zzso
