zzso in zzso cancer zzso and zzso are receptors of zzso a family of guidance cues that promote zzso outgrowth and guide growth cones in developing nervous zzso The zzso mechanisms of zzso however, remain zzso In this paper, we show that both zzso and zzso become zzso zzso in cortical zzso in response to zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso is increased in zzso zzso and that zzso zzso is located in growth zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso selectively interacts with the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso suggesting a role of zzso or zzso in zzso zzso Of interest to note is that zzso zzso and zzso 5 zzso zzso not only bind to the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but also interact with the zzso domain of zzso suggesting a differential signaling between zzso and zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso family zzso activity attenuated zzso zzso zzso Together, these results suggest a role of zzso family zzso and zzso zzso of zzso receptors in regulating zzso zzso
