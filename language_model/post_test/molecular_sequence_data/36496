We have previously identified zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso as the major site of attachment for zzso binding affinity zzso and have shown that when this zzso is zzso to zzso zzso zzso the affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso can still bind zzso to the zzso presumably by interaction with a different zzso in the zzso domain zzso Using zzso zzso we have determined the alternative zzso attachment site and the functional importance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of the zzso to the zzso and zzso responses to zzso and zzso zzso zzso plus one or more of these other zzso were zzso to zzso Analysis of these zzso zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells provides strong evidence that zzso zzso is the zzso that is zzso zzso labeled by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso portions of the zzso that are far apart in the linear zzso zzso namely regions near zzso and zzso are probably closely positioned in the zzso pocket, with the zzso zzso being zzso zzso or less zzso The affinity of zzso binding to receptors was reduced only zzso and zzso respectively, in the double and quadruple zzso to Ala zzso and zzso was an effective zzso of zzso from an zzso reporter gene zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
