To define early molecular targets of zzso action, the differential display technique was used to identify genes with altered levels of expression in zzso breast cancer cells treated with the synthetic zzso zzso zzso for 3 zzso zzso was first isolated as a zzso zzso clone and its zzso regulation confirmed by Northern zzso Cloning of the complete coding region of zzso revealed that it shared a high degree of zzso acid sequence identity with zzso of the zzso zzso from several zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso was observed in several normal breast zzso and breast cancer cell lines and in a variety of human zzso with highest expression in the breast, zzso and zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso was rapidly and zzso induced by zzso expression zzso between 2 and 4 h and returning to control levels by 12 zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso were inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and occurred via the zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso was also inhibited by zzso D but not by zzso zzso is therefore a novel human gene that is directly regulated by zzso via the zzso zzso
