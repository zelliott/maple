The effects of elevated atmospheric zzso zzso zzso and subsequent plant responses on the soil microbial community composition associated with trembling zzso was assessed through the zzso of zzso complete zzso DNA sequences amplified from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso enrichment zzso experiments microbial community zzso This in-depth comparative analysis provides an unprecedented, detailed and deep branching profile of population changes incurred as a response to this environmental zzso Total bacterial and zzso abundance does not change; however, an increase in zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso of the domain bacteria and zzso of the zzso zzso potentially implicated in ammonium zzso significantly decreased with elevated zzso These changes in soil zzso are evidence for altered interactions between trembling zzso and the zzso in its surrounding soil, and support the theory that greater plant detritus production under elevated zzso significantly alters soil microbial community zzso
