A zzso region consisting of zzso clustered charged zzso acids is present at the center of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso In this study, the role for this central zzso region zzso in the virus replication in zzso zzso cells was investigated by extensive deletion and substitution zzso A total of 31 zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso alone abolished viral zzso in zzso cells and impaired virus replication in primary zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso and charge of the central region are insignificant for the function of zzso Of the 16 substitution zzso 3 zzso with substitution of zzso and zzso with an A zzso did not grow in zzso zzso Upon zzso four zzso zzso two zzso with deletion of zzso or zzso a zzso with substitution of zzso and zzso with zzso and a zzso with substitution of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso were found to express zzso at a very reduced level relative to that by the zzso zzso These results have thus demonstrated that zzso acid zzso 88 and 89 of zzso are critical for the replication of zzso in target cells by enhancing the zzso expression of zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso were found to be extremely zzso among the zzso proteins of naturally occurring zzso field zzso as well as those of laboratory zzso zzso
