There is tremendous interest in developing zzso artificial zzso factors that functionally mimic zzso zzso zzso for use as zzso zzso as components of synthetic cell circuitry, and in zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that a zzso display selection against the zzso zzso domain binding motif of the zzso zzso produces distinct sequences that function with similar binding modes and potency as natural zzso These findings set the stage for binding screens with small zzso libraries against zzso binding motifs to yield next-generation small zzso zzso
