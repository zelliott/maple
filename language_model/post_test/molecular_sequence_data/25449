The binding of human plasma zzso zzso zzso freshly prepared by zzso zzso to several neutral and zzso zzso was examined by TLC zzso with the anti zzso B zzso zzso zzso was found to bind characteristically to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the former being a more potent zzso than the latter, indicating that the sequences Gal beta zzso beta zzso and zzso beta zzso are involved in the binding of zzso A weak positive reaction with zzso zzso which has the same internal recognition zzso was also observed (the binding ability was only zzso of that in the case of zzso No binding to other neutral zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso and therefore substitution of the zzso zzso with zzso acid was thought to inhibit the zzso The results indicate that, along with the binding of zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso interaction with some zzso chains in the zzso or with zzso zzso on the plasma zzso may be important for the binding of zzso to zzso
