All zzso zzso a small zzso envelope zzso zzso which mediates viral assembly and zzso by an unknown zzso We have previously shown that the E protein from Severe Acute Respiratory zzso coronavirus zzso forms zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gage, zzso zzso zzso zzso SARS coronavirus E protein forms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now report that three other E proteins also form zzso zzso zzso These E proteins were from zzso representative of zzso groups zzso human coronavirus zzso zzso mouse zzso virus zzso and infectious zzso virus zzso zzso It appears, therefore, that coronavirus E proteins in general, belong to the virus zzso channels zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso the zzso and zzso E protein zzso channel zzso in zzso and also inhibited replication of the parent zzso in cultured cells, as determined by plaque zzso zzso zzso had no zzso effect on a zzso zzso with the entire coding region of E protein deleted zzso Taken together, the data provide evidence of a link between zzso of E protein zzso channel activity and the zzso activity of zzso
