The most distinctive feature of zzso zzso zzso is the specific timing of their expression during embryonic zzso In zzso nuclear transfer, zzso zzso zzso in the donor nucleus are replaced with zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to the involvement of zzso zzso zzso in nuclear zzso We recently have discovered a mouse zzso zzso zzso named zzso and demonstrated its expression pattern in normal zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to determine whether the replacement of zzso zzso zzso with zzso occurs during the process of mouse nuclear zzso zzso was detected in the donor nucleus soon after zzso zzso zzso was restricted to the zzso in up to zzso stage zzso After fusion of an zzso with a cell expressing zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso immediate release of zzso in the donor nucleus was zzso In addition, we used zzso recovery after zzso zzso and found that zzso is more mobile than zzso in living zzso The greater mobility of zzso may contribute to its rapid replacement and decreased stability of the embryonic zzso zzso These results suggest that rapid replacement of zzso with zzso may play an important role in nuclear zzso
