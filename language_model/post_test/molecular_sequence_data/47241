zzso zzso zzso is a most important regulator for zzso zzso zzso The type II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are located at the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells and major functional zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso The consumption of a zzso diet zzso the synthesis of zzso whereas a high zzso diet decreases zzso The molecular mechanisms of regulation by dietary zzso are not yet zzso In this report, in weaning mice fed a zzso diet for 4 days, the zzso zzso level was increased zzso compared with mice fed a normal zzso zzso This increase was due to an zzso of the zzso zzso In the zzso gene promoter, the DNA footprint analysis showed that six regions were masked by the binding zzso but at the position zzso to zzso upstream of the zzso start site, the binding clearly responded to the levels of dietary zzso The zzso response element zzso of the zzso gene was found to consist of the motif related to the E box, zzso A zzso zzso system was used to clone a zzso factor that binds to the zzso sequences in the zzso promoter of the zzso zzso Two zzso clones that zzso protein of the mouse zzso factor zzso zzso were zzso This is a zzso protein that activates zzso through the zzso site of the zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso completely inhibited the binding to the zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso with the zzso gene promoter markedly zzso the zzso zzso The feeding of a low zzso diet significantly increased the amount of zzso zzso in the zzso These findings suggest that zzso may participate in the zzso regulation of the zzso gene by dietary zzso
