zzso zzso cells die by zzso after zzso and this process may reflect altered expression of zzso zzso Several of these zzso including zzso zzso and zzso share zzso at the zzso acid level in the zzso and zzso zzso through which they also zzso To understand their role in the zzso response to zzso the authors studied their expression in the adult rat zzso and after zzso nerve zzso 

An initial survey was conducted with reverse zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso against identified members of this family and against the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression at the zzso zzso zzso and protein level was studied by zzso Northern zzso zzso protection analysis, in zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso The effect of retinal zzso cell zzso on the zzso level of zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso results indicated that rat retinal cells predominantly express the long form of zzso Both zzso analysis and quantitative zzso using zzso protection zzso demonstrated that zzso message was at least 16 times more abundant than that of zzso In zzso zzso and indirect zzso demonstrated that nearly all zzso cells of the zzso express zzso Northern and zzso protection analyses showed a moderate decrease in zzso message shortly after zzso nerve zzso 

These findings suggest that the zzso gene zzso is the zzso member of the zzso family in the adult zzso and that its level decreases after zzso nerve zzso Changes in zzso expression may correlate with increased retinal zzso cell zzso after zzso
