zzso zzso such as double Holliday zzso can be resolved by zzso or dissolved by the combined action of a DNA zzso and a zzso In zzso dissolution is zzso by the zzso complex consisting of a zzso zzso a type zzso zzso and the structural protein zzso zzso instability 1 zzso Throughout zzso the zzso complex is involved in DNA repair and in the suppression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are also sterile due to extensive zzso breakage in zzso I, indicating that both proteins are essential for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso domain and two zzso binding zzso zzso To define specific roles for these individual zzso we performed zzso experiments on zzso zzso with an zzso full-length open reading frame zzso or deletion zzso lacking specific zzso We show that the zzso domain and the zzso domain 1 are both essential for the function of zzso in DNA zzso repair as well as zzso zzso but partially zzso for zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain 2 is not necessary for either zzso or zzso HR, but it seems to have a minor function in DNA zzso zzso
