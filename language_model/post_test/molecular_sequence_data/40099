To examine zzso function, we attempted to identify highly expressed genes in mouse zzso using a zzso zzso containing zzso products amplified from a mouse zzso zzso zzso We isolated one novel and four known zzso zzso protein 1 zzso complement zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso core domain 16 zzso unknown functions in the zzso The novel zzso designated zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso A, member zzso harbors an open reading frame of 1 233 zzso zzso a putative protein of 411 zzso zzso including a zzso zzso These five genes were predominantly expressed in the zzso as compared to other zzso In zzso zzso analysis revealed their zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a significant increase in zzso expression of these genes around zzso zzso decreased their zzso except zzso zzso zzso restored these reduced expressions, except zzso however, this restoration was not observed with 17 zzso zzso Administration of T and zzso combination recovered the zzso zzso zzso this recovery was also observed with T zzso However, the recovery of zzso zzso zzso was zzso Neonatal zzso treatment suppressed the zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in the zzso of zzso zzso this was not observed with zzso These results suggest that our zzso system can provide a novel insight into the zzso function on a molecular basis, and the five genes might play important roles in the zzso
