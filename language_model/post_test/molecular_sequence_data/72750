zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disease attacking zzso zzso receptors zzso of the zzso zzso zzso production is regulated by zzso helper T cells that are specific to zzso Therefore the suppression of zzso T cell activity could reduce zzso zzso zzso zzso therapies aimed at T cells, we studied the therapeutic effect of zzso as a T zzso zzso zzso zzso in which experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso with synthetic zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso were treated daily with zzso (1 zzso zzso prevented the reduction in zzso of miniature zzso potential zzso which was induced by H alpha zzso zzso zzso also suppressed zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso production accompanied by a decrease in the zzso T cell response against H alpha zzso These findings indicate that zzso prevents induction of rat zzso evoked by zzso T cells against H alpha zzso
