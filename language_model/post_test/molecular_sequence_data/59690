Despite increasing recognition of the importance of zzso zzso in human disease little is known about either the zzso properties or zzso of this enteric zzso The complete coding sequence of a zzso zzso gene has yet to be zzso We have cloned and zzso the complete zzso regulatory zzso gene from the type strain of this zzso The zzso zzso fur zzso was isolated from a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso constructed in zzso zzso The open reading frame identified encodes a zzso consisting of 156 zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso zzso fur gene contains 3 putative zzso sequences and two zzso zzso sequences indicating the potential for zzso and zzso regulation, zzso zzso extension analysis identified a single zzso start site 262 zzso upstream from the zzso initiation zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso protein of zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the arrangement of the zzso and zzso genes downstream of fur is precisely zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso chain reaction close linkage of fur with zzso and zzso was also observed among multiple zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli suggesting a possible functional relevance for this zzso genetic arrangement in zzso
