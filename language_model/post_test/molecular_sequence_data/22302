zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso that function by removing zzso zzso from the cellular zzso Here, we show that the African zzso zzso zzso expresses four zzso zzso three of which we have validated zzso as iron dependent, a feature normally associated with zzso zzso zzso studies reveal that two of the zzso are found predominantly in a zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso while the other two are targeted to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso repertoire in zzso form zzso was performed using an zzso zzso interference zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso transcripts corresponded with a significant reduction in the corresponding proteins and a dramatic level of cell death within the zzso The importance of one of the zzso zzso zzso only became apparent when zzso were exposed to the zzso agent zzso following induction of zzso These experiments therefore identify essential components of the zzso zzso arm of the zzso zzso zzso zzso system and validate these zzso as zzso targets for drug zzso
