zzso zzso zzso containing novel sequence segments embedded in a deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso have previously been shown to be expressed from a zzso borne growth rate regulated promoter in zzso zzso These zzso accumulate to high levels and their detection is a promising tool for studies in molecular microbial ecology and in environmental zzso zzso a new construct is described which illustrates the versatility of detection that is possible with zzso This zzso zzso construct carries a 72 zzso insert with three copies of a unique 17 base probe target zzso This zzso is 160 zzso in length and again accumulates to high levels in the zzso coli zzso without incorporating into zzso The zzso zzso illustrates two improvements in zzso First, by appropriate selection of insert size, we obtained an zzso which provides a unique and zzso easily quantifiable peak, on a high resolution gel profile of low molecular weight zzso Second, the existence of multiple probe targets results in a nearly commensurate increase in signal when detection is by zzso These zzso are naturally amplified and carry sequence segments that are not found in known zzso zzso It thus may be possible to detect them zzso An experimental step involving zzso or zzso amplification of the gene could therefore be zzso
