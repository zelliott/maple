To investigate the zzso features, genetic drift in the zzso of zzso zzso of the novel influenza A zzso virus and zzso zzso characterized by zzso and zzso zzso in children in Shanghai since the zzso 

Between June 2009 and May 2012, a prospective surveillance study was carried out in zzso children who attended the zzso clinic of Children's Hospital of zzso University for zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso quantitative zzso was performed to detect seasonal influenza A and influenza B virus and the novel influenza A zzso virus in the respiratory zzso zzso drift from the vaccine strain in zzso zzso of the novel influenza zzso virus and the molecular markers associated with zzso resistance in zzso zzso were zzso 

Out of zzso enrolled cases, the novel influenza A zzso virus was confirmed zzso in 222 zzso otherwise healthy children with 133 zzso being boys and 89 zzso zzso The median ages of children with the novel influenza A zzso virus infection during the first wave from August 2009 to February 2010 and the second wave from December 2010 to February 2011 were zzso months and zzso months, respectively zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 119 zzso had the close contact with persons suffering from fever or respiratory infection, of whom, 68 zzso contacts were family members and 47 zzso contacts were zzso During the outbreak in zzso season, 66 zzso were exposed to primary index cases, school students were the major exposure subjects, accounting for zzso The zzso sequences of zzso gene were highly zzso between the vaccine strain zzso and Shanghai circulating novel influenza A zzso strains and only zzso zzso in zzso E of zzso was detected zzso in the circulating zzso The zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso associated with zzso resistance were not found in the circulating novel influenza zzso zzso 

Two major waves of the novel influenza A zzso outbreaks occurred in zzso children during zzso Institutional children were the major affected individuals during the 2009 pandemic zzso zzso and schools were the main sites of transmission among children during influenza zzso zzso vaccination should be enhanced in children and their close family zzso The novel influenza A zzso virus in Shanghai has not undergone significant genetic zzso zzso is effective for the treatment of the novel influenza A zzso zzso
