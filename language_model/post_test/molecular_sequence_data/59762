We have investigated the functional role of the zzso end zzso of zzso on its assembly properties using truncated zzso and human zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain yielded a zzso that did not assemble into 10 zzso filaments but remained in a soluble zzso particle form with a zzso zzso considerably smaller than that of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, removal of the zzso zzso domain had no obvious effect on the zzso zzso In particular, zzso equilibrium analysis under low zzso strength conditions yielded zzso particle species of Mr 135,000 to zzso indistinguishable from those obtained with zzso When induced to form filaments from this state by rapid dilution into filament forming zzso zzso and zzso protein generated similar zzso zzso However, as determined by scanning transmission electron zzso under these conditions zzso formed filaments of zzso diameter, corresponding to various distinct zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso yielded zzso values zzso between 40 and 45 zzso zzso filaments produced zzso which could be fitted by three zzso zzso zzso between 37 and 131 zzso In contrast, when zzso zzso instead of being rapidly diluted into, filament forming zzso zzso gave zzso with one major peak at about 54 zzso The zzso zzso observed for zzso was already evident at the earliest stages of zzso For example, ten seconds after zzso zzso filament segments zzso to 63 zzso were formed with both zzso and zzso zzso but the diameters were considerably larger for zzso compared to zzso zzso 3) zzso versus zzso zzso indicating a distinct role of the zzso tail domain in the zzso control during zzso filament zzso Despite this difference both zzso and zzso filaments appeared to grow zzso in a modular fashion from such zzso filament zzso This suggests that assembly occurred by a principally similar mechanism involving the zzso or zzso of zzso zzso
