zzso zzso of zzso is a critical mechanism for the zzso of factor zzso a zzso of the blood zzso zzso and is typically achieved with zzso a zzso zzso clinically used for zzso Although numerous efforts have been directed toward the design of better zzso a fundamental zzso of these studies has been the assumed requirement of an zzso or a zzso zzso We demonstrate here a concept that small zzso zzso molecules may be rationally designed to interact with and activate zzso for enhanced zzso of factor zzso The rational design strategy is based on a study of complexes of natural and zzso zzso with zzso zzso using zzso interaction zzso technique, a quantitative computerized tool for analysis of molecular zzso A linear correlation was observed between the free energy of binding for zzso zzso complexes and the zzso score over a wide range of approximately 13 zzso indicating strong zzso capability of the zzso zzso Using this approach, a small, zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was designed to mimic the zzso end zzso unit zzso of the sequence specific zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested a comparable zzso geometry and interaction profile for zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso binds zzso with equilibrium zzso zzso of zzso and 66 zzso at pH zzso I zzso and pH zzso I zzso respectively, that compare favorably with 2 and 80 zzso observed for the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of factor zzso nearly zzso demonstrating for the first time that zzso zzso of zzso is feasible with appropriately designed small zzso organic zzso The results present unique opportunities for de zzso zzso design based on this first-generation zzso
