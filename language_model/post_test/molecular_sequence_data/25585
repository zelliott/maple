T zzso zzso requires recognition by the T cell of zzso fragments of foreign zzso bound to a self major zzso complex zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests that part of the class II region of the zzso influences the zzso in zzso of zzso class I zzso on the cell surface, by regulating the availability of peptides that bind to and stabilize the class I zzso Two closely related genes in this region, zzso and zzso were cloned and had sequence similarities to a zzso of genes involved in the zzso transport of a variety of zzso across cell zzso Thus, these zzso transport protein genes may be involved in transporting zzso or zzso fragments zzso from the zzso into a zzso compartment containing newly zzso zzso zzso
