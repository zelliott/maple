The protein composition of zzso zzso strain zzso cultured at two different zzso zzso was determined by using two-dimensional zzso gel zzso The cellular levels of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were considerably higher in cells grown in a low concentration of organic zzso medium zzso zzso zzso zzso of carbon per zzso than cells grown in a high concentration of organic zzso medium zzso 200 zzso of C zzso or cells starved for organic zzso In the zzso zzso the cellular levels of the zzso proteins were higher at the exponential growth phase than at the stationary growth zzso A sequence of the gene for zzso revealed that the zzso acid sequence had a high degree of similarity to the zzso zzso zzso of several zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso activity of zzso was higher in cells growing zzso in zzso medium than in zzso zzso may be involved in the growth under zzso zzso The zzso role of zzso is discussed zzso
