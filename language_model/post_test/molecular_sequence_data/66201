In zzso bacteria, the introduction of zzso bonds into folding proteins occurs in the zzso and is zzso by donation of an energetically unstable zzso from zzso which is subsequently zzso through interaction with zzso zzso bacteria lack a classic zzso but nonetheless zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes just one zzso zzso a zzso and no zzso Here we report the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso which incorporates a zzso fold with an inserted zzso domain, like its zzso coli counterpart zzso but it lacks the characteristic zzso patch and has a truncated binding groove near the active zzso These findings suggest that zzso has a different zzso specificity than zzso zzso studies indicate that the oxidized and reduced forms of zzso are energetically zzso in contrast to the energetically unstable zzso form of zzso Further, the partial zzso of zzso by zzso is independent of zzso and zzso zzso show that zzso does not interact with zzso The identical zzso of oxidized and reduced zzso may facilitate direct zzso of the protein by zzso zzso without the need for zzso
