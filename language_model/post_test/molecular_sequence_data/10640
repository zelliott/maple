Fourteen strains of a zzso unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the milk of sheep with zzso zzso from different regions of zzso The strains zzso closely resembled one another and zzso were similar to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso investigations were consistent with membership in the zzso zzso and comparative zzso zzso gene sequencing studies showed that the unknown zzso from sheep was indeed a member of the zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso the new zzso formed a distinct zzso that exhibited zzso zzso sequence divergence with other zzso Based on both zzso and zzso findings, a new species, zzso zzso is proposed for the organisms from zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
