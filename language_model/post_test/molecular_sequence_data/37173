zzso of zzso zzso begins when the viral zzso zzso is directed to the plasma membrane by an zzso zzso zzso zzso While dispersed basic zzso acids within the M domain are critical for stable membrane association and zzso particle zzso additional zzso or motifs may be required for specific plasma membrane targeting and zzso We have identified an zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso that retains significant membrane affinity despite having a deletion of the fourth zzso of the M zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso distribution revealed that it was not localized to the plasma membrane but instead was zzso to zzso zzso zzso plasma membrane targeting was restored by the addition of zzso plus a single basic zzso by multiple basic zzso or by the zzso zzso zzso domain from the cellular zzso zzso These results suggest that the fourth zzso of the zzso M domain promotes specific targeting of zzso to the plasma zzso either through a direct interaction with plasma membrane zzso or a zzso cellular factor or by maintaining the zzso of zzso to expose specific plasma membrane targeting zzso
