Various surface modifications have been applied to titanium zzso zzso zzso in an attempt to enhance zzso crucial for ideal prosthetic zzso Despite the numerous studies demonstrating that zzso surfaces influence in zzso cellular behavior, there is relatively little data reporting their effects on bone zzso The objective of this article was to examine the effects of chemically zzso zzso surfaces with a common zzso zzso a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso on the zzso of bone zzso The expression of proteins known to be associated with zzso zzso and bone zzso were studied during the growth of human zzso cells zzso on these zzso zzso zzso grown for 7 days on zzso surfaces displayed significantly increased levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with the production by zzso grown on the native zzso A pattern that was also reflected at the protein levels for zzso type I zzso and bone zzso Moreover, zzso grown for 7 and 14 days on zzso zzso expressed significantly higher level of zzso differentiation factors and lower levels of zzso and zzso proteins compared with other surfaces zzso These results suggest that different chemical treatments of implant material zzso surface result in differential bone responses, not only their ability to form bone but also to stimulate zzso zzso
