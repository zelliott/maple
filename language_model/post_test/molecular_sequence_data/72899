Bone zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso localized predominantly in zzso zzso but also detected in zzso sites undergoing focal zzso We have previously characterized the human zzso gene and have shown that the upstream sequence contains zzso zzso and zzso motifs at the expected locations from the zzso start site zzso zzso Kerr et zzso zzso and a potential zzso binding motif located within the first 30 zzso of zzso 1 of the human zzso zzso analyses of the human zzso zzso 1 sequence fused to a zzso reporter gene indicate that zzso enhances zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso and rat skin zzso Though this enhancing activity was lost with inclusion of 68 zzso of zzso containing a zzso motif in these zzso reporter activity in the zzso cells was elevated zzso to zzso relative to that of rat zzso zzso zzso mobility shift, zzso and zzso experiments indicate that zzso is present only in the extracts of zzso isolated from the zzso cells and may contribute to the elevated zzso activity of the human zzso promoter construct in zzso
