zzso and feather disease virus zzso causes severe disease characterized by irreversible feather disorders and severe zzso in many zzso zzso zzso cannot be zzso in tissue or cell cultures, rendering virus propagation and thus diagnosis rather zzso To develop reliable diagnostic methods, the region zzso the zzso zzso protein C1 was cloned from an infected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed this gene had zzso to zzso zzso acid identity to published zzso No protein was detected after induction of full-length C1 expression in zzso zzso However, deletion of an zzso zzso sequence facilitated zzso zzso a zzso zzso of this zzso was zzso and used for zzso of zzso The immune zzso detected C1 with an apparent molecular weight of 27 zzso in western blots of organ zzso of zzso zzso Using zzso as zzso 11 zzso zzso were tested for the presence of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results obtained correlated well with the zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso suggesting zzso has value as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso
