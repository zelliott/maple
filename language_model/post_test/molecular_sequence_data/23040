zzso binding proteins of a new family particularly well represented in zzso zzso have been called Bug zzso One zzso Bug protein is part of a zzso zzso zzso while the functions of the other 77 are zzso We report the first structure of a Bug zzso zzso It adopts the characteristic Venus zzso motif observed in other zzso binding zzso with two zzso zzso zzso by a deep zzso zzso displays a closed zzso resulting from the fortuitous capture of a zzso identified from the electron density as an zzso The structure reveals a distinctive alpha zzso zzso involving two water molecules that bridge the zzso oxygen atoms to the zzso Both water molecules are hydrogen bonded to a common zzso group from zzso and each forms a hydrogen bond with one zzso oxygen atom of the zzso Additional hydrogen bonds are found between the zzso alpha zzso oxygen atoms and protein backbone zzso groups and with a zzso zzso zzso This specific zzso motif is highly zzso in Bug zzso indicating that they may all be receptors of zzso acids or other zzso zzso with a similar binding zzso The present structure thus unveils the bases of zzso binding in this large family of zzso binding zzso several hundred members of which have been identified in various bacterial zzso
