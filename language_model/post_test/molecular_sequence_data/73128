zzso zzso type 1 zzso produces a single zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso which acts as a zzso factor zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our earlier study has shown that the zzso zzso transcript is spliced in the leader region and the zzso zzso gene product zzso zzso its own promoter through the region which includes its zzso initiation site zzso et zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we investigated zzso zzso gene expression throughout zzso productive infection and demonstrated that zzso a novel promoter is located downstream of the zzso promoter and an early transcript is transcribed from this promoter region, zzso a negative regulatory element, which is composed of a 20 zzso direct repeat unit repeated 20 times, is located between the two promoters and the repeat unit shows high zzso to a motif called direct repeat 2 in zzso sequence of zzso zzso virus type 1, zzso the zzso promoter and synthesis of the zzso zzso appear to be turned off after zzso phase and the second promoter becomes active during early and late zzso and zzso a gene product expressed only by the second promoter also possesses regulatory zzso These findings indicate that expression of the zzso zzso gene is alternatively regulated by the two zzso
