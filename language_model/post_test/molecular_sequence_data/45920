zzso zzso channels have been widely observed but have not been identified at a molecular zzso Here we report that a zzso protein similar to the zzso domain of zzso zzso channels is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this protein showed zzso outward currents accompanied by tail zzso Current reversal zzso at equilibrium zzso for zzso The currents exhibited zzso gating and zinc zzso sensitivity, two features which are characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso dependence to sequence changes suggest that mouse zzso zzso protein is itself a channel, rather than a regulator of another channel zzso
