By screening a rabbit zzso library, an alternative zzso transcript of zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected containing a zzso zzso longer zzso region zzso than the main zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso animals, northern zzso showed that zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was exclusively expressed in red blood cells and bone zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained a novel zzso repetitive zzso zzso 23 zzso in length zzso This motif is related but not identical to the zzso repetitive differentiation control element zzso of 19 zzso residing in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to interact with human zzso proteins E1 and K, thereby zzso zzso From zzso expressing the long zzso zzso two to three unidentified zzso with molecular weights of zzso and zzso zzso which bound to zzso were isolated by zzso affinity zzso A 93 zzso protein from lung zzso which was selected by zzso zzso was able to suppress zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso by zzso zzso A possible interaction between zzso zzso zzso trans factors in zzso control of zzso synthesis is zzso Furthermore, the zzso part of the highly related rabbit zzso zzso gene was zzso Very similar repetitive zzso elements of the type zzso (20 zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found in the part corresponding to the zzso of the zzso
