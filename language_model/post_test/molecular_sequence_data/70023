The zzso zzso near zzso located at 75 zzso of the zzso coli zzso was previously identified as the regulatory factor of cell zzso In this paper we have examined how zzso gene expression is controlled during the growth cycle using a zzso protein fusion zzso zzso Its expression was induced at stationary phase while it was nearly abolished in zzso Using a zzso protection zzso zzso transcript at stationary phase was detected in zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso Furthermore, primer extension analysis indicated that the zzso transcript controlled by zzso zzso at a G located 185 zzso upstream from zzso of the zzso coding zzso Compared with the zzso 70 recognition zzso the zzso region of zzso promoter resembled the zzso box, but no zzso sequence was observed at the zzso zzso These results were consistent with the characteristic sequence profile of zzso promoter recognized specifically by zzso in zzso which is the only example of the type III promoter so far detected in zzso and in zzso
