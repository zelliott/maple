Most of the 97 transcripts of the genes on zzso VI of zzso zzso that were identified by a series of Northern zzso experiments zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 19, zzso zzso have been correlated with the open reading frames zzso deduced from the zzso sequence data of this zzso zzso et zzso Nature zzso 10, zzso zzso This was performed by comparing the zzso constructed physical map and the one produced from the zzso sequence data, as well as the sizes and positions of observed transcripts and those of zzso zzso Thus, 75 zzso of zzso VI were correlated uniquely with the corresponding transcripts and 3 zzso with two transcripts of different zzso Comparing the relative abundance levels of individual transcripts with that of the zzso transcript, highly expressed genes of zzso VI were found to be located almost exclusively on the zzso zzso Based on the correlation between the abundance level of the zzso identified transcripts and the zzso adaptation zzso of the corresponding zzso the genes on zzso VI of zzso zzso were classified into three zzso The data thus provides information concerning their zzso locations as well as their likely levels of expression in zzso growing zzso
