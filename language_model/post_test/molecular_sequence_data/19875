The opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso zzso genetic change during chronic airway infection of zzso zzso zzso zzso One common change is a zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso regulator that responds to a zzso zzso signal to activate expression of acute zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso visibly accumulated the zzso zzso signal zzso Using this colony zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso zzso that emerged in the airway of a zzso patient early during chronic infection, and during growth in the laboratory on a rich zzso The zzso zzso zzso in these strains zzso a growth advantage with particular carbon and nitrogen sources, including zzso zzso in part due to increased expression of the zzso zzso regulator zzso This growth zzso could contribute to selection of zzso zzso both on rich medium and within the zzso zzso supporting a key role for bacterial zzso adaptation during chronic zzso zzso of zzso also resulted in increased zzso activity that increased tolerance to zzso a widely used zzso zzso Loss of zzso function may represent a marker of an early stage in chronic infection of the zzso airway with clinical implications for zzso resistance and disease zzso
