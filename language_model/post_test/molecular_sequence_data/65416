zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is one of a family of five single zzso domain zzso zzso zzso channel ancillary zzso currently under intense scrutiny to establish their position in channel complexes and zzso alpha zzso contact points, but its structure is zzso zzso zzso are associated with inherited and acquired cardiac zzso Here, synthetic peptides corresponding to human zzso zzso and separate zzso were structurally analyzed using zzso and CD zzso The zzso zzso domain was soluble and predominantly zzso in zzso media, but predominantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain was predominantly a mixture of zzso and zzso structure in zzso zzso with a minor contribution from zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain was zzso in zzso zzso zzso into zzso environments resulted in zzso and adoption of increasing amounts of zzso with the zzso order sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of secondary structure changes with zzso transition temperature during heating suggested that the zzso zzso incorporates into zzso zzso zzso zzso was soluble in zzso zzso and calculated to contain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso structure in this environment, as determined by CD zzso Thus, zzso is highly dependent upon zzso interaction via zzso and/or protein contacts for adoption of ordered structure without zzso zzso consistent with a role as a zzso zzso within zzso channel zzso These data will provide a structural framework for ongoing zzso in zzso zzso studies of zzso and its zzso
