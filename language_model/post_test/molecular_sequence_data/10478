The synthesis of cholesterol and its zzso from plasma LDL are regulated by two zzso zzso factors, designated zzso regulatory element binding zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Here, we used the technique of zzso zzso to generate mice with disruptions in the gene zzso the two zzso of zzso termed zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso normal, but 50- zzso of the zzso zzso mice died in zzso at embryonic day zzso The surviving zzso mice appeared normal at birth and throughout zzso Their zzso expressed no functional zzso There was a zzso zzso of zzso at the level of zzso and a two- to zzso increase in the amount of mature zzso in liver zzso Previous studies showed that zzso is much more potent than zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso of genes zzso zzso of cholesterol zzso zzso with this zzso the zzso zzso animals zzso elevated levels of zzso for zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as measured by the incorporation of zzso was elevated zzso in zzso of the zzso mice, and zzso cholesterol content was increased by zzso zzso acid synthesis was decreased in zzso of the zzso zzso The amount of white zzso tissue was not significantly zzso and the levels of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso were normal in the zzso zzso We conclude from these studies that zzso can replace zzso in regulating cholesterol synthesis in zzso of mice and that the higher potency of zzso relative to zzso leads to excessive zzso cholesterol synthesis in these zzso
