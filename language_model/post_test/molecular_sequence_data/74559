North American zzso populations exhibit remarkable variation in zzso zzso and behavioral characters, as well as an established history of zzso zzso We examined zzso DNA variation from 55 zzso and North American zzso populations using molecular zzso and zzso methods in order to clarify the evolutionary and demographic history of this zzso zzso zzso we addressed the following questions: zzso Do zzso zzso sampled from North America form a zzso group, which would be expected if North American zzso were descended from a single zzso zzso zzso When did zzso colonize North zzso and zzso What is the demographic history of North American zzso since their zzso zzso maximum likelihood methods identified three major zzso lineages for zzso each lineage contained zzso sampled from both zzso and North zzso This suggests a complex colonization history for zzso which likely involved multiple founding zzso zzso analyses placed the colonization of North America by zzso zzso sometime during or after the late zzso This was followed by a sudden increase in population size of more than an order of magnitude for the North American population of zzso approximately zzso years before the zzso These zzso data, in conjunction with data from previous zzso zzso and behavioral studies, suggest that the diversity observed in zzso in North America is the result of a recent evolutionary radiation, which may have been zzso in part, by zzso
