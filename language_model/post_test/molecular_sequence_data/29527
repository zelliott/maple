The zzso domain is a zzso zzso zzso which is found in a wide variety of zzso among which are several zzso and the gene implicated in zzso zzso juvenile zzso zzso The domain mediates binding to other zzso either via their zzso zzso or other zzso In several zzso zzso zzso are found in combination with other zzso binding motifs and some proteins contain two zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso finger proteins function in the zzso zzso as zzso zzso A zzso of the zzso domain is the zzso domain, in which one of the zzso is replaced by a zzso We have cloned and characterized a novel zzso zzso located on zzso zzso zzso is contained in 37 zzso of zzso DNA and consists of 9 zzso and 8 alternatively spliced zzso most of which are alternative first zzso A long and a short transcript of the gene are zzso the short transcript containing zzso zzso zzso This gene encodes two zzso zzso separated by an zzso domain of unknown zzso This is the first reported gene with a double zzso zzso In humans, zzso zzso with a processed zzso located on the opposite zzso zzso zzso is specifically expressed in zzso and zzso whereas zzso is zzso suggesting that its expression may be regulated by elements in the zzso promoter zzso zzso is expressed during zzso most likely in zzso and/or in zzso suggesting a possible role in zzso zzso
