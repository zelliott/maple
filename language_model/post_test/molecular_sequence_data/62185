In a previous study zzso Lee and Juliano zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso we have identified a novel zzso zzso that specifically interacts with the zzso tail of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this protein profoundly affects cell zzso To examine the zzso interaction in detail, and to find the minimal region required for the interaction, several zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso The results obtained for the zzso zzso system indicate that a zzso region of zzso (from zzso zzso to zzso is indispensable for the zzso Also, we demonstrate that the membrane zzso region (from zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso tail is essential for the zzso To characterize more directly the properties of the interaction between zzso and zzso we performed zzso resonance studies in which peptides were immobilized on the surface of a sensor zzso and the zzso zzso protein fragments were zzso zzso with the zzso results, zzso zzso binds well to immobilized zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso and zzso are crucial for zzso zzso These results provide evidence that zzso is capable of directly and selectively binding to a portion of the zzso zzso zzso Further studies demonstrated that the minimal zzso binding region of zzso does not affect cell zzso
