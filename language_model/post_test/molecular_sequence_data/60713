The X region of the zzso zzso contains four major open reading frames zzso two of which, termed zzso and zzso are of still undefined biological zzso By indirect zzso and dual labeling with marker zzso we demonstrate that zzso an zzso acid protein coded by the zzso ORF, is selectively targeted to zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso targeting of zzso is directed by an zzso zzso acid signal sequence that is not zzso upon import and is able to target the Green Fluorescent zzso to zzso zzso of zzso results in specific zzso of zzso zzso and distribution from a typical zzso dispersed network to zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might interfere with processes relying on an intact zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso revealed that a zzso of the cells with zzso zzso show a disruption in the zzso inner membrane potential zzso an early event observed in cells committed to zzso Taken together, these results suggest novel zzso interactions that might be important in zzso replication and/or zzso
