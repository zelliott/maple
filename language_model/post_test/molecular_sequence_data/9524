An increasing number of zzso aberrations is being identified in solid tumors providing novel zzso for various types of cancer and new insights into the mechanisms of zzso We applied next generation sequencing technique to analyze the zzso of the zzso cell lung zzso zzso cell line zzso and discovered a fusion transcript composed of multiple zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Type zzso zzso analysis of the zzso structure revealed that a portion of zzso region encompassing zzso 10 and 11 of zzso has been zzso into the zzso region between zzso 2 and 3 of zzso The key net result appears to be the zzso zzso of one zzso of zzso a gene with tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cell lines led to zzso of colony zzso Our study confirms the utility of next generation sequencing as a tool for the discovery of zzso zzso and has led to the identification of a novel zzso in zzso that may be of zzso zzso and therapeutic zzso
