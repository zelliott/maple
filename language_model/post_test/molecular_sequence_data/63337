Plants guard themselves against pathogen attack using zzso defense zzso zzso represents an important secondary zzso during such defense zzso Upon examination of a pepper zzso library, we observed that the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso significantly in response to infection with the type II zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso which elicits a hypersensitive zzso zzso encodes a protein that contains a C2 domain and it exhibits a high degree of zzso to the protein zzso genes regulated by cold 2 zzso However, little is known about how zzso expression is zzso by zzso stresses such as pathogen zzso Further sequence analysis indicated that the zzso C2 domain is unique and contain certain zzso acids that are zzso within the C2 zzso of other plants and zzso zzso zzso was zzso under both zzso and zzso stress conditions, including bacterial and viral pathogen infection, zzso and cold treatment, but unaffected by treatment with plant zzso chemicals such as salicylic acid, zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso zzso under steady state conditions, zzso was expressed only in the root zzso A zzso fusion protein was used to determine zzso to the plasma zzso A fusion protein lacking the C2 domain failed to target the membrane but remained in the zzso indicating that the C2 domain plays a critical role in zzso Thus, zzso encodes a novel C2 zzso protein that targets the plasma membrane and plays a critical role in the zzso stress and defense responses of pepper zzso
