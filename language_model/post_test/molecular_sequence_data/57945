Human zzso generated by zzso virus immortalized zzso from zzso zzso zzso of an zzso cancer patient were screened for zzso in zzso zzso zzso with a synthetic zzso corresponding to the protein core of the zzso zzso zzso zzso within this region are in fact considered tumor specific since they are selectively exposed in tumor cells due to zzso zzso Human zzso zzso thus selected, zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso This is the first demonstration of the existence of a zzso immune response to selected zzso of zzso zzso zzso and, together with the zzso zzso response already demonstrated, constitutes the basis for the use of synthetic peptides as a vaccine in cancer zzso
