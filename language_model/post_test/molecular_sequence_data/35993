zzso carrier protein 2 zzso is known to be an important zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here are reported the cloning and expression of a zzso zzso human zzso and the assignment of zzso gene to human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame and the zzso zzso consists of 143 zzso zzso This zzso is very similar in zzso acid composition to human, bovine and rat liver zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this zzso has a zzso zzso leader sequence with mature zzso Northern zzso analysis suggests that there are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso species in human liver zzso zzso zzso analysis of human zzso zzso zzso cell hybrid panels indicates that the gene zzso zzso is on human zzso zzso zzso expression of the human liver zzso zzso in zzso cells shows a zzso zzso and increased amounts of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with cholesterol zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso synthesis in comparison with that of the zzso zzso system zzso These findings suggest that zzso plays a role in regulating zzso among other possible zzso
