To date, zzso sequences of only seven human group B zzso zzso strains have been zzso Such data on more zzso are necessary to establish the evolutionary relationship and ecological features of zzso from different geographical zzso The present study was aimed at determining the full-length sequences of all 11 genes of 13 human zzso strains detected during zzso in sporadic and outbreak cases of acute zzso from four different cities of western zzso This study also included zzso of evolutionary rates and zzso selection pressure analysis for all gene zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analyses of structural and zzso genes showed zzso identity with the counterparts of zzso strains isolated in India, Bangladesh and zzso zzso analyses of all gene segments revealed formation of a zzso zzso of the western Indian zzso zzso reflecting their highly zzso zzso All gene segments were also found to be under zzso selection zzso These data suggest that zzso is circulating in the natural host as a series of stable viral zzso Estimates of rates of zzso substitution in all zzso ranged from zzso zzso per site per zzso The rate for human zzso zzso and zzso genes were comparable, respectively, with the evolution zzso of zzso zzso and zzso group A zzso zzso The time of the most recent common zzso of the extant human zzso was estimated to be during zzso zzso and genetic analyses carried out in this study provide data that is useful for the zzso of evolutionary zzso stasis or dynamics existing in the zzso zzso
