A new, simplified method of zzso human zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso (20 zzso is zzso released zzso cannot be converted to zzso and the zzso are not exposed to a zzso zzso as they are when zzso is used for zzso The zzso zzso regain their disc shape and are recovered as single zzso which have released approximately zzso of the contents of their dense zzso Their zzso activity is greater than that of control zzso but somewhat less than that of zzso zzso Without added zzso the zzso zzso zzso slightly in response to 50 zzso zzso and to zzso zzso acid, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso added zzso enhances zzso caused by these zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is caused by zzso in the absence of added zzso it may be that the alternative zzso zzso that is not activated by zzso is responsible for the strong response to zzso zzso responses to most of the zzso are greater than those observed previously with zzso zzso By this method, zzso are obtained that have been zzso in a way that is similar to in zzso zzso They are useful for studies of zzso responses without the complicating effects of released zzso zzso and for investigation of the characteristics and functions of zzso that have come in contact with zzso agents in zzso
