The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso essential for zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso from zzso zzso by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained zzso and zzso zzso deduced zzso zzso The clone was used to transform a zzso zzso derived from the zzso strain of zzso zzso using zzso zzso The zzso strain is known to lack zzso zzso zzso to have an zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 69, zzso The zzso zzso contained six tandem integrated zzso repeats, had double the abundance of zzso transcript found in the host strain, and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso strain was noted to have an abundance of zzso zzso Both zzso zzso in zzso were cloned and zzso in order to look for changes that might explain the zzso zzso One zzso called zzso contained a stop zzso in place of zzso The other zzso zzso called zzso had changes in three zzso zzso two of which were zzso in three zzso and one plant zzso zzso zzso fragments containing zzso from the zzso zzso and from zzso the zzso strain, were inserted into the zzso zzso and used to transform a zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso The zzso zzso fragments from the zzso and zzso both contained zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3' zzso sequences around the coding zzso zzso with zzso from zzso but not from zzso showed restored zzso zzso One or more of these three deduced zzso acids in the zzso zzso of zzso appeared critical for zzso
