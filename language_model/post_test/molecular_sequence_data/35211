To analyze potential zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in patients with zzso zzso and to explore the correlation between the zzso and total serum zzso zzso 

zzso DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of zzso zzso sequence and promoter region of the zzso gene were zzso zzso were identified through DNA zzso 

zzso of the zzso gene were found in 46 out of 61 patients with zzso zzso Five types of zzso were zzso with a decreasing order of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso promoter element, zzso zzso and zzso Compared with those carrying a single zzso zzso or compound zzso zzso total serum zzso was higher in those carrying a zzso zzso in combination with other zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso gene zzso and level of total serum zzso 44 patients were diagnosed with Gilbert syndrome, and 2 were diagnosed with zzso syndrome type zzso 

The level of total serum zzso is correlated with the number of zzso gene zzso as well as their zzso or zzso zzso
