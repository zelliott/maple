Metal zzso zzso is essential for plant nutrition and resistance to toxic heavy zzso Many plant metal zzso remain to be identified at the molecular zzso In the present study, we have isolated zzso zzso from zzso and show that these genes complement the zzso of a metal zzso deficient zzso strain, zzso zzso show zzso to the zzso gene family in bacteria, zzso plants, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso increases zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso complement an iron zzso zzso in zzso This suggests possible roles in iron transport in plants and reveals zzso in the functional properties of zzso zzso In zzso zzso are expressed in both roots and aerial parts under metal replete zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso are induced by iron zzso zzso of the zzso gene leads to slightly enhanced cadmium resistance of root zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso results in cadmium hypersensitivity of zzso root growth and increased zzso of Fe, on zzso zzso Our results show that zzso genes in plants zzso metal zzso and that zzso transport both the metal zzso zzso and the toxic metal zzso
