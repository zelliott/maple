Three strains of bacteria that degrade the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a zzso lake, Lake zzso and the zzso River, Japan, and zzso These strains were zzso and zzso and their cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso by means of single polar zzso zzso colonies were formed on zzso zzso zzso The strains assimilated only zzso among the organic compounds tested as carbon zzso The zzso content of zzso DNA ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the new zzso formed a tight cluster within the family zzso but were clearly separate from established zzso of this family, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence similarities between the new zzso and type strains from established zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso data supported the conclusion that these strains were members of the family zzso The major components of the cellular fatty acids were 18 : zzso zzso zzso and 16 : zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty acids were mainly zzso 14 : 0 zzso zzso and zzso fatty acids were zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso were present as the major zzso and zzso zzso Thus, it is proposed that the three strains represent a new zzso and species of the family zzso with the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
