We have recently described two zzso strains that are zzso in the zzso gene zzso the zzso release factor zzso Both zzso provoke zzso defects in zzso zzso zzso In the present study we report the zzso sequencing, as well as an analysis of residual activities of both zzso zzso zzso Each zzso specifies a different single zzso acid substitution located one zzso acid zzso The zzso acid changes do not affect the level or cellular zzso of the zzso zzso since equal amounts of wild type and zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in wild type and zzso zzso zzso strains produces a zzso consistent with a reduced affinity of the zzso release factors for the zzso indicating that the zzso map in a release factor domain involved in zzso zzso We also demonstrate that nonsense suppression caused by a zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso coli small zzso protein zzso can be reversed by a slight zzso of the zzso zzso
