The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in the regulation of zzso cell zzso Recently, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso restricted zzso gene expression in early zzso cells suggested that the zzso gene is regulated at a zzso zzso To characterize how zzso gene expression is zzso we cloned the zzso of the zzso gene located at human zzso zzso The zzso promoter region contains a zzso box with zzso elements for zzso zzso growth zzso element zzso zzso zzso and fork head zzso zzso zzso an orphan zzso zzso zzso factor implicated in zzso zzso is a zzso for zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso is regulated through zzso zzso of zzso in zzso In an zzso mobility shift zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso could specifically bind to zzso A zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is required for zzso of zzso zzso upon nerve growth zzso growth factor zzso which activates zzso and zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso with reverse zzso nerve growth factor stimulation inhibited binding of zzso zzso to zzso in turn, suppressing zzso gene zzso The results together establish that zzso is a novel negative regulatory element of zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, zzso is the first direct target of zzso involving the regulation of zzso cell death zzso This zzso zzso mechanism of zzso should play an important role in zzso and/or zzso development in zzso
