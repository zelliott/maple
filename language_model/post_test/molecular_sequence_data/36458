zzso zzso zzso when applied in the zzso at low zzso suppress intrinsic controls on zzso zzso through the block of zzso K zzso zzso zzso underlying the adaptation of firing and slow zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso for example, is effective at zzso zzso suggesting zzso of a relatively zzso zzso zzso We have examined the mechanism of this action by using a new, highly specific, zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso II zzso as well as other zzso zzso and show that the zzso block of zzso zzso relies on zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Thus zzso of these channels or of an zzso protein causes the channels to remain closed in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso The very similar zzso effects of zzso and zzso zzso are zzso either through other zzso or by entirely different zzso zzso Block of intrinsic zzso activity by zzso acid also reduced adaptation and zzso and zzso zzso had no further effect on these zzso zzso The removal of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso in animals has a deleterious effect on the performance of tasks requiring spatial memory and is also implicated as a cause of cognitive disorders in zzso By increasing zzso zzso during electrical activity and promoting zzso activity, zzso input provides parallel reinforcing pathways for the induction of long-term zzso an important cellular memory zzso This suggests a possible link between behavioral and cellular approaches to the analysis of learning and zzso
