To contribute to an understanding of the roles and mechanisms of action of zzso in early zzso development, we have characterized the normal expression of zzso zzso zzso and investigated the consequences of zzso of this putative zzso zzso zzso transcripts are expressed throughout development, and are enriched in both the anterior and zzso regions of zzso at late stages of development, where they are found primarily in zzso with lower levels of expression in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso leads to complex zzso distinct from those achieved by zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso or zzso This zzso is unlikely to result from zzso acting as an inducing agent, as zzso of zzso does not rescue zzso structures in zzso zzso does not induce zzso in zzso zzso and zzso does not alter the zzso patterns of expression of zzso zzso or zzso To pursue whether zzso has the capacity to affect zzso movements, we investigated whether zzso of zzso alters the normal zzso of zzso cap zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso blocks the zzso of zzso caps in response to zzso without blocking the differentiation of either zzso or zzso zzso within these zzso The data are consistent with zzso having the potential activity of zzso the zzso movements of zzso
