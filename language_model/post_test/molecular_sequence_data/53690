In this study we used differential display technology in an attempt to obtain an insight into the mechanisms underlying escape of zzso cells to the specific zzso T cell zzso A primary zzso cell line and zzso zzso zzso zzso were raised from a zzso melanoma sample zzso Upon zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso cells, zzso specific for zzso cells were generated and zzso Using a zzso zzso a zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso was zzso We applied a zzso differential display technique to amplify DNA sequences zzso expressed in zzso zzso sensitive zzso or resistant zzso to specific zzso zzso 10 different sequences whose expression was exclusively zzso in zzso cells were zzso Five of them matched with known expressed sequence tags zzso products of unidentified zzso 2 showed high zzso with a zzso zzso and with the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso Most interestingly, genes coding for zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso factor, were only expressed in zzso zzso The latter gene was found to be transcribed in all healthy zzso tested, but only in a zzso of established melanoma cell zzso Taken together, our data underline the relevant potential of differential display technology in the molecular analysis of paired zzso lines endowed with different zzso zzso Cloning of entire open reading frames and zzso studies are warranted to clarify the role of individual zzso displayed genes in the escape of zzso cells from cellular immune zzso
