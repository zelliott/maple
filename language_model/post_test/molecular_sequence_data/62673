We used zzso amplification of zzso prepared from skin zzso to determine the full-length zzso sequence of zzso ( zzso in cattle of several coat zzso An zzso of a zzso was detected in an zzso zzso calf, which resulted in a zzso which caused a premature stop zzso at zzso zzso This zzso was found in the zzso state in this calf and the zzso DNA of two related zzso zzso All six parents of these calves were zzso for this zzso However, an zzso zzso calf did not have this zzso nor was any other zzso detected in the partial zzso sequence obtained from the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso tests were developed to detect this zzso in zzso zzso
