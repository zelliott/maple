The zzso zzso play a central role in the processing of zzso zzso zzso the diagnostic hallmark of systemic lupus zzso target the zzso and D zzso of these zzso We have used patient zzso to clone a zzso from a human zzso zzso library that encodes the full length of a zzso identical with, or closely related to, zzso zzso This zzso is comprised of zzso bases and contains an open reading frame of 855 zzso that is capable of zzso 285 zzso zzso The first 223 zzso acids at the zzso zzso exhibit nearly complete zzso with zzso zzso a newly recognized zzso and zzso component of zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence for B differs from that of the N zzso primarily by a zzso acid insert 12 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso zzso of these zzso The structural differences in these zzso for B and N may regulate zzso alternative zzso mechanisms for zzso In addition, these clones make it possible to map in fine detail the most characteristic zzso responses of systemic lupus zzso
