We have zzso the zzso zzso system to identify proteins that interact with the zzso domain of the insulin zzso zzso We identified a human zzso zzso a protein that appears to be the human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which we term zzso The zzso zzso protein was first identified in a genetic screen to identify cell cycle checkpoint regulatory zzso yet the mechanism by which zzso functions in cell cycle control is currently zzso Here we show that zzso requires the zzso 30 zzso acids of the zzso for interaction and that zzso does not interact with the related zzso growth factor I zzso Interestingly, zzso does not require zzso zzso zzso for interaction because it interacts with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In support of this finding, zzso zzso were found to interact strongly in zzso with receptors derived from zzso zzso Furthermore, using two independent in zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to significantly reduce the interaction of zzso with the zzso Lastly, we show that zzso can be zzso with the zzso from Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell zzso suggesting that this interaction occurs in zzso in cells of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso represents a novel class of proteins that is specific for interaction with the zzso as compared with the zzso growth factor I zzso and that interacts best with the inactive zzso and is released upon zzso zzso The function of zzso and its potential role in insulin signaling remain to be zzso
