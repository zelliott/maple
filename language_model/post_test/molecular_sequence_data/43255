The pH zzso of the affinities for zzso of linear and zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso sequence discovered by zzso display were determined by zzso resonance zzso At pH values ranging from zzso to zzso the zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso were determined by competition, and those for zzso were determined directly by equilibrium affinity zzso The zzso values of the zzso increase by an average factor of zzso zzso zzso per decrease in pH unit between pH approximately zzso and pH approximately zzso Below pH approximately zzso there is a smaller increase in zzso values, and above pH approximately zzso the zzso values become relatively zzso We determined the crystal structures of complexes of zzso with zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso at pH zzso zzso and zzso and with zzso at pH zzso and compared the structures with one another and with those previously determined at other pH zzso At pH values from zzso to zzso the electron density for the zzso His side chain is strong, flat, and well zzso A hydrogen bond between the zzso atom of the His and the zzso zzso zzso group indicates the His of the bound zzso in the zzso is zzso at pH zzso zzso By determining selected structures in two different space groups, zzso with two zzso zzso zzso sites and zzso with one site, we show that below pH approximately zzso the zzso of the bound zzso His in the zzso is influenced by crystal packing zzso The presence of the zzso hydrogen bond along with pH zzso of the zzso affinities suggest that zzso of the zzso His is required for high affinity binding of zzso peptides to zzso both in the zzso and in zzso
