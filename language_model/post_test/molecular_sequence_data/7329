zzso zzso adding either the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso at or near the zzso of zzso is a recently identified zzso modification that zzso some proteins to a membrane zzso One of the most intensely studied zzso proteins is zzso a low molecular weight zzso protein that plays an important role in the regulation of cell zzso zzso zzso by zzso genes with zzso zzso are capable of transforming cells in zzso Such zzso zzso genes are frequently found in a wide variety of human zzso zzso of the Ras zzso to the zzso face of the plasma membrane via zzso is essential for efficient cell transforming zzso Thus, zzso of the Ras zzso reaction is a possible zzso zzso Several strategies have been employed to inhibit Ras zzso including zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso which zzso the zzso reaction, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso the rate limiting zzso in zzso zzso inhibit Ras zzso and block the growth of zzso zzso However, zzso effects do not result from specific zzso of Ras zzso they are also observed in cells transformed by zzso which is independent of Ras zzso A more specific approach to zzso Ras zzso is to inhibit zzso Using random screening of natural products and a rational design approach, a variety of compounds that specifically inhibit zzso have been zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
