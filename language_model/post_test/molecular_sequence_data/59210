Although the zzso alpha zzso gene is zzso expressed in zzso its level of expression varies among tissue and cell zzso In spite of similar zzso distribution in zzso of zzso and birds, the zzso regions of alpha zzso genes exhibit remarkable zzso zzso the core promoter activity of the zzso chicken alpha 1 gene strongly depends upon multiple zzso regulation (six zzso zzso whereas the promoter activity of the zzso rat alpha zzso gene relies on the two zzso and additional positive regulatory zzso Further analysis of the regulatory regions of the zzso alpha zzso genes revealed that the zzso alpha zzso genes may share common zzso mechanisms for subtle zzso zzso the core promoter activities can be either enhanced or zzso depending on the availability of zzso zzso Two potential candidates for such zzso elements in both avian and zzso zzso alpha zzso genes are zzso a newly identified element, zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso or its reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso region of the chicken gene and crude nuclear extracts from zzso chicken and mouse cells showed the existence of a set of proteins that bind to this zzso The amounts of individual regulatory proteins in different cell types seem to vary, resulting in differential formation of zzso complexes in different cell zzso Thus, the regulation of zzso alpha zzso gene expression under different cellular environment as well as in different cell types can be achieved by a shared zzso zzso of the ratio of the abundance of individual zzso zzso
