zzso DNA clones have been isolated from zzso zzso to delineate a protein highly zzso to the human zzso precursor protein zzso zzso change of zzso zzso gene expression has been analyzed with molecular zzso From early zzso there is a high zzso of maternal zzso After zzso the zzso is zzso reaching a minimum level around the zzso zzso Then zzso zzso appears to be zzso and this continues during the subsequent embryonic and zzso zzso zzso patterns differ between the maternal and zzso zzso The ratio of zzso including the zzso inhibitor domain zzso sequence is extremely low for the transcript of maternal origin as compared to that for the transcript of zzso zzso These results suggest some roles for the zzso zzso in zzso early zzso
