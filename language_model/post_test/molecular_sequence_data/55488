zzso zzso virus zzso zzso enters into cells via membrane fusion of the viral envelope with plasma or zzso zzso zzso by viral zzso zzso zzso attach to cell surfaces by binding of viral zzso zzso zzso and zzso to specific cellular zzso Here we show that the human zzso and highly zzso zzso strain zzso enters substantially more efficiently into cells via the zzso human paired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequences between zzso and zzso strains indicates that zzso acid changes within zzso zzso zzso and zzso may cause increased entry via the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso entered substantially more efficiently than viral strain F in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso but not within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso genes zzso viral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the membrane protein zzso were zzso and their predicted zzso acid zzso sequences were compared with virulent strains zzso zzso and the attenuated laboratory strain zzso Most zzso differences between zzso and F were located at their zzso zzso zzso known to bind with the zzso zzso These zzso changes included a zzso change, also seen in the zzso strain zzso as well as zzso and increase of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences revealed multiple zzso changes including an zzso change within the zzso zzso region known to bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso changes were located within the zzso domain of zzso that binds zzso Multiple zzso changes were located within the zzso zzso zzso which were preserved in the zzso zzso but differed for the F zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the membrane protein zzso were zzso between zzso and F zzso 

The results indicate that the observed entry zzso of the zzso strain is most likely due to a combination of increased binding to zzso zzso receptors and enhanced virus entry via zzso fusion of the viral envelope with plasma zzso
