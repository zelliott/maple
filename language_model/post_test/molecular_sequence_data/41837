The mouse zzso gene has been established as a molecular candidate for the zzso complex zzso locus which plays a central role in the transmission ratio distortion zzso expressed by males zzso for a zzso zzso Here we describe a comparison of the mouse and human zzso coding zzso The results show that whole zzso have been added or eliminated from the transcripts expressed in each species, suggesting an evolutionary process of punctuated zzso for this zzso Two of the zzso regions that are most zzso between the two species contain specific zzso zzso The zzso zzso region contains a unique zzso repeat of unknown function and the zzso zzso region contains a pair of zzso zzso within a region that shows additional similarity to the zzso regions of various zzso zzso These results are discussed in terms of the possible function of the zzso zzso
