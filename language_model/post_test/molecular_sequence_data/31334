zzso beta zzso beta zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso were prepared by in zzso zzso They were characterized by zzso sequencing, by partial acid zzso and by zzso zzso zzso The two zzso were isolated also from partial acid zzso of metabolically labeled zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso PC zzso The zzso was retarded in a column of zzso wheat germ zzso the zzso was strongly zzso zzso in this column separated the zzso into two distinct peaks, which represented zzso zzso Together with our previous data on linear zzso zzso these findings show that affinity zzso with immobilized wheat germ zzso can be zzso used in zzso zzso zzso and zzso related to zzso
