The zzso zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso virus zzso types 1 and 2 were zzso in zzso with a technique called DNA family zzso A zzso robotic screen identified zzso with an enhanced ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were combined, zzso and screened on increasingly lower zzso of zzso After four rounds of zzso and zzso two clones were isolated that sensitize zzso coli to zzso less zzso compared with zzso zzso and zzso less than zzso zzso Both clones are hybrids derived from several crossover events between the two parental genes and carry several additional zzso acid zzso not found in either parent, including active site zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso zzso had acquired reduced zzso for zzso as well as decreased specificity for zzso In agreement with the kinetic data, molecular modeling suggests that the active sites of both evolved zzso better accommodate the zzso group of zzso at the expense of zzso Despite the overall similarity of the two zzso zzso each contains key contributions from different parents in positions influencing zzso zzso Such zzso could be useful for zzso gene therapy, and similar zzso approaches could improve other zzso zzso
