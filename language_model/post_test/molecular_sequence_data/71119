The crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso the synthetic analogue of zzso have been determined at zzso and zzso resolution, zzso Both zzso and zzso are engulfed in the active site zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and neither makes contact with the zzso zzso The zzso and binding of zzso are almost identical in both zzso The recognition of zzso by zzso is achieved through a mixture of multiple van der zzso interactions and hydrogen zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso is sandwiched between the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso on one side, and the zzso atoms of the two adjacent zzso on the zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso form the back wall of the zzso acid binding zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a total of seven hydrogen bonds with the zzso atoms of zzso The zzso of zzso and the network of interactions of its zzso zzso with zzso are reminiscent of the other class II zzso The structural similarity between zzso and zzso zzso extends to the zzso acid binding site, which is normally unique for each zzso The complex structures suggest that the zzso zzso may affect the first step of the reaction zzso of zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso The modeling of zzso in the active site of zzso revealed no apparent close contacts between zzso and the zzso zzso This result implies that the zzso mechanism against activated zzso rather than direct recognition, may play the major role in the zzso zzso
