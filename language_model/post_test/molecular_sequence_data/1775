zzso zzso proteins regulate zzso zzso including zzso and zzso The human zzso pathogen zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso the regulator zzso and its zzso zzso described zzso zzso of zzso or zzso led to similar zzso including zzso formation and zzso zzso An zzso deletion generated no zzso under most conditions but caused zzso in an zzso background under embedded or hypoxic zzso This suggests cooperation of these zzso proteins in the suppression of an alternative zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso profiling revealed that zzso and zzso regulate partially overlapping sets of genes associated with filament zzso zzso zzso not only regulates genes involved in zzso but also strongly influences the expression of zzso zzso inducing zzso genes and zzso genes essential for zzso zzso Using one- and zzso zzso we further demonstrate that zzso is a zzso whereas zzso is an zzso of gene zzso Overall, the results suggest that zzso supports the regulatory functions of the primary regulator, zzso and indicate a dual role for these zzso proteins in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso
