Over the past decade and a half, the paradigm has emerged of cardiac zzso and ensuing heart failure as fundamentally a problem in signal zzso zzso on the altered expression or function of zzso zzso factors and their partners, which then execute the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso is itself a zzso for two protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are activated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso terminal domain zzso of its largest zzso controls a number of critical steps subsequent to zzso zzso among them enabling zzso to overcome its zzso in the zzso region and to engage in efficient zzso zzso Here, we zzso our current understanding of the zzso protein zzso in cardiac zzso zzso zzso is essential in tissue culture for zzso enlargement and sufficient in transgenic mice for zzso to occur and yet is unrelated to the zzso gene program that is typical of zzso heart zzso Although this zzso effect of zzso appears benign zzso zzso levels of zzso activity render zzso remarkably susceptible to zzso zzso zzso interacts adversely with zzso pathways for zzso zzso the expression of numerous genes for zzso zzso and, in particular, suppressing master regulators of zzso zzso and function, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear respiratory zzso zzso Given the dual zzso roles of zzso in zzso growth and zzso dysfunction, we suggest the potential usefulness of zzso as a target in heart failure drug zzso
