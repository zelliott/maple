Mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso the binding of zzso to high affinity zzso receptors on the rat zzso leukemia cell line zzso As shown by zzso of thin layer zzso zzso zzso binds avidly to two zzso zzso I and zzso zzso that occur in this cell zzso The two zzso were zzso by zzso exchange zzso followed by zzso continuous zzso zzso About 230 zzso of zzso I and 60 zzso of zzso II were obtained from 20 g zzso zzso of leukemia zzso The structures of both zzso zzso were determined to be zzso derivatives of the zzso zzso by fast atom zzso zzso by chemical zzso zzso of zzso samples, by gas zzso zzso of partially zzso zzso zzso and by treatment with zzso and mild acid zzso The structure of zzso I is: zzso see zzso zzso II has an additional zzso zzso as zzso zzso see zzso The zzso of zzso I contains approximately equal amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fatty zzso The zzso base is predominantly zzso along with a small amount of zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso II contains mainly zzso zzso fatty acid with much lower amounts of zzso zzso and zzso fatty zzso Moreover, the zzso base is approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso No zzso zzso fatty acids were detected in either zzso
