In the present study, both zzso and zzso zzso genes have been isolated and used as a zzso to compare the two small aquarium fish in response to zzso treatment and thus to evaluate the two fish models in development of a zzso system for environmental zzso The isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most abundantly expressed zzso gene in zzso and its complete protein sequence of zzso zzso acids was deduced from a zzso and a zzso zzso The isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso clone covers zzso zzso acids in the zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso are specifically expressed in female liver and their expression can be induced by zzso zzso in male fish both by intramuscular injection and immersion zzso A real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was developed for zzso of zzso zzso level in both control fish and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso for the induction of zzso zzso were observed at 1 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso in a zzso exposure zzso Further zzso studies of the two fish models indicated that zzso was able to respond much faster to zzso treatment than zzso while the zzso can attain a much higher level of zzso zzso than zzso after a long-term zzso zzso The implication of these observations may be that the zzso system is better in monitoring acute treatment while the zzso system is better in monitoring chronic zzso
