The zzso of all major crop plants occurred during a brief period in human history about 10,000 years zzso During this time, ancient zzso selected seed of preferred forms and culled out seed of zzso types to produce each subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso at genes controlling traits of interest increased in frequency, ultimately reaching zzso When selection is strong, zzso has the potential to drastically reduce genetic diversity in a zzso To understand the impact of selection during zzso zzso we examined zzso zzso in zzso zzso a gene involved in zzso zzso Here we show that the effects of selection were limited to the zzso regulatory region and cannot be detected in the zzso zzso Although selection was apparently strong, high rates of zzso and a prolonged zzso period probably limited its zzso Our results help to explain why zzso is such a variable zzso They also suggest that zzso zzso required hundreds of years, and confirm previous evidence that zzso was zzso from zzso zzso of southwestern zzso
