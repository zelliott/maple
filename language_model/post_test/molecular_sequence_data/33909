The zzso protein is known to induce zzso by provoking the zzso zzso transition, and a sequence zzso with the zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso has recently been identified in the zzso thus making it a potential new member of the zzso protein zzso In the present study, we provide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso evidence that a zzso spanning zzso zzso in zzso interacts with the zzso protein zzso We have zzso zzso alone and the complex of its zzso domain zzso with zzso and solved their three-dimensional zzso The zzso zzso is a single domain organized as a distorted zzso with eight zzso strands and two zzso The zzso domain extends across 15 zzso at the end of the second zzso and eight zzso acids in the chain following zzso There are important structural differences in the zzso domain in the intact zzso zzso and the same sequence bound to zzso
