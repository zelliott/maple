In seed plants, successful zzso requires correct regulation of zzso tube zzso At zzso and during growth, the zzso tube interacts with zzso from the zzso while the zzso tube extends via tip zzso Despite the fact that much research has been devoted to the mechanisms regulating zzso tube growth, many aspects are currently zzso Previously, we have isolated a zzso gene from zzso probably functions during zzso tube zzso zzso is part of a family of five zzso Its expression is regulated both at the zzso and at the zzso zzso While zzso transcripts accumulate to high levels between early zzso and mature zzso zzso zzso protein is hardly zzso until zzso and zzso tube zzso In order to zzso the role and function of zzso in the zzso tube, we studied the effect of zzso gene zzso on zzso zzso zzso we have transformed tobacco plants with zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso In these plants, the zzso resistance zzso was linked to the zzso zzso not transmitted through the male zzso This indicated that lowering the transcript level of zzso and/or its family members interferes with zzso zzso Because we could not find a readily distinguishable zzso in zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso plants, we rescued the defective zzso to produce doubled zzso plants that were zzso for the zzso zzso zzso We found that in zzso from these plants the transcript levels of all zzso family members were zzso Although zzso and zzso tubes from these plants appeared completely normal in zzso the zzso tubes showed slower growth rates in zzso and arrested in the style before they reached the zzso so that zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso and its family members are essential for normal zzso tube growth and indicate several possible zzso
