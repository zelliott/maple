The zzso domain is a novel zzso domain composed of repeats of 23 zzso zzso found in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins having the zzso domain are highly zzso particularly in zzso but the functions are mostly zzso In this study, the zzso property of the zzso domain in zzso was zzso Use of zzso selecting the DNA groove and an zzso in which the zzso pairs of the probe were replaced with zzso pairs in mobility shift zzso demonstrated that zzso approaches DNA from the major zzso zzso zzso using zzso of the same length but containing the zzso site at different positions showed that zzso zzso DNA through its zzso To induce the sharp bend of DNA, the zzso domain alone was insufficient and the long zzso extending region was zzso Moreover, the basic region extending from the zzso of the zzso domain stabilized the DNA binding of the zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso properties of the zzso domain are affected strongly by the structure of the zzso regions in the zzso zzso zzso
