zzso and zzso are bacterial toxins that form pores in host cells by zzso We propose that they may have similar structures despite a poor sequence zzso The crystal structure of zzso reveals a protein composed of four zzso arranged in the shape of an zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso shows a similar arrangement of zzso The sequence of zzso recognizes the template of zzso from a library of protein zzso A three-dimensional model of zzso has been constructed by the comparative approach using the structure of zzso This model, together with results on the activity of zzso zzso and the positions of zzso sites, has been used to propose functional roles of individual zzso
