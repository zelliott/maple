The small zzso proteins have undergone a tremendous diversification in plants; whereas only a single small zzso protein is found in zzso and many animals, over 20 different small zzso proteins are found in higher zzso The small zzso proteins in plants have diversified in both sequence and cellular zzso and are zzso by at least five gene zzso In the study, 44 small zzso protein DNA and zzso acid sequences were zzso using both zzso analysis and analysis of zzso substitution patterns to zzso the evolutionary history of the small zzso zzso The zzso relationships of the small zzso zzso estimated using zzso and distance methods, reveal the gene duplication, sequence divergence and gene conversion have all played a role in the evolution of the small zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and conservative and radical replacement zzso zzso relation to zzso indicates that the small zzso protein gene families are evolving at different zzso This suggests that the small zzso proteins may have diversified in function as well as in sequence and cellular zzso
