If the genetic code arose in an zzso world, present zzso assignments may reflect primordial zzso acid zzso Whether zzso selected from random pools to bind free zzso acids do so using the zzso zzso at their binding sites has been zzso Here we defend and extend our previous analysis of zzso binding sites, and propose a model for the maintenance of zzso acid interactions through the evolution of zzso acids from zzso zzso into the building blocks of zzso
