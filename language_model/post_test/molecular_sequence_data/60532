A novel zzso factor in zzso zzso zzso containing one zzso motif was studied for zzso change that was induced by zzso zzso was shown to bind to the upstream zzso sequence of a gene in zzso zzso containing zzso element by gel mobility shift zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso indicated an increase of zzso content of zzso occurred upon binding to the upstream zzso zzso These results suggest that the binding of zzso to the zzso element is required for the zzso change that may zzso zzso of the target zzso
