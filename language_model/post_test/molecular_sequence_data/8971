A membrane alignment technique has been used to measure the distance between two zzso zzso spin labels on the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso The zzso zzso peptides were mechanically aligned using zzso lipids on a zzso zzso support, and zzso zzso were recorded at specific zzso Global analysis in combination with rigorous spectral simulation was used to simultaneously analyze data from two different sample zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso We measured an zzso distance of zzso zzso from a dual zzso zzso zzso zzso at positions 7 and 13 that closely matches with the zzso zzso distance obtained from a model of the labeled zzso zzso zzso In addition, the angles determining the relative orientation of the two zzso have been determined, and the results compare favorably with molecular zzso The global analysis of the data from the aligned samples gives much more precise estimates of the parameters defining the geometry of the two labels than can be obtained from a randomly dispersed zzso
