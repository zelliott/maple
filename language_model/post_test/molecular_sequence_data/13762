zzso loss studies have suggested that a zzso tumor zzso gene resides in a zzso region of zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso amplification of a zzso zzso spanning this region yielded four zzso with high zzso to a rat protein zzso zzso from a zzso approximately 100 zzso zzso to zzso Isolation of a near full-length zzso from a human fetal brain zzso library revealed a protein zzso zzso with a zzso zzso almost identical to human zzso zzso and highly zzso to rat zzso Northern zzso demonstrated expression in most zzso including zzso zzso and cultured zzso were studied for genetic zzso in this gene using zzso gel zzso routine Southern zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were were not detected in any of the zzso and all studied zzso expressed the zzso suggesting that this zzso is not the putative zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso
