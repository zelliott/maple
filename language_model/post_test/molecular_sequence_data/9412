zzso zzso zzso zzso is an umbrella term for a zzso group of zzso zzso of uncertain prevalence and zzso zzso zzso cases of zzso with fused in zzso inclusions zzso have been described recently, but their molecular characterization is still zzso Using shotgun mass zzso we identified a total of 107 zzso expressed proteins in the prefrontal cortex, zzso and zzso lobe from zzso patients compared to zzso These proteins are involved in a range of biological pathways such as cellular transport in the prefrontal cortex, energy metabolism in the zzso and protein metabolism in the zzso zzso In addition, they were validated by selective reaction monitoring zzso zzso of the zzso zzso findings with similar studies of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia led to identification of proteins that may be related to zzso and psychoses, zzso Further studies of zzso and other zzso zzso are warranted, although this will require intensive zzso zzso
