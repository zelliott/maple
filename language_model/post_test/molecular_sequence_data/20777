A zzso set by zzso zzso in urine sediments for zzso detection of zzso cancer has been identified zzso In this study, we have evaluated 10 DNA zzso zzso that have been reported zzso in western countries for zzso cancer diagnosis for a better zzso 

The promoter zzso Islands of the following 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been subjected to zzso zzso analysis in the DNA of 2 zzso cancer cell lines, 2 normal zzso zzso and urine sediments of 82 zzso cancer patients, 15 zzso zzso patients and 5 healthy zzso 

Both zzso and zzso genes were zzso zzso in the normal zzso zzso showing no cancer state zzso While the zzso states were detected in urine sediments of zzso cancer at a frequency not less than zzso zzso zzso nine genes were also zzso in the patients of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cancer and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso diseases, showing the zzso cancer zzso 

zzso of the zzso gene into a set of 11 genes has improved the zzso cancer zzso The zzso of predicting disease onset in this study with the previously recommended targets in western countries suggests a possible disease disparity between these two zzso zzso the zzso zzso might be mistaken as the cancer specific in the studies where no zzso zzso controls were zzso
