zzso zzso zzso are highly expressed in young zzso and zzso They may have a substantial regulatory influence on zzso metabolism as well as on zzso zzso zzso they are emerging as potentially interesting zzso targets to increase plant biomass production, especially under zzso On the one hand, zzso are well known as soluble and zzso zzso On the other hand, they contain complex zzso zzso zzso regions with a basic region zzso and a zzso domain zzso Here we analyzed in depth the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso It was found that correct sorting to the zzso zzso zzso depends on the presence of intact zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso remains inserted into zzso on its way to the zzso and the classical sorting zzso zzso zzso is zzso However, our data suggest that zzso might follow an alternative, zzso protein 3 zzso route as zzso zzso transport and a direct recognition of the zzso motif in the zzso of zzso might have evolved as a simple and more efficient sorting mechanism as compared with the zzso sorting zzso zzso protein of 80 zzso zzso sorting mechanism followed by those proteins that travel to the zzso as soluble zzso
