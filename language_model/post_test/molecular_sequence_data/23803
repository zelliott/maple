A family of genes of the zzso race of zzso zzso zzso were described that zzso proteins that belong to the zzso of zzso zzso and were demonstrated to have a unique domain zzso The genes are zzso expressed in the zzso zzso The protein products of at least two genes zzso and zzso are expressed in specifically differentiated zzso cells of the zzso and zzso into the environment through long cell zzso A comparison of the results obtained by electron zzso and zzso with literature data allows the assignment of these cells to the group of zzso zzso The observation of the zzso of the cell zzso in normal and artificial zzso zzso indicated that the zzso contact at the edge of the head part of the zzso body directs and maintains the growth of the zzso cell zzso during zzso The English version of the zzso Russian Journal of zzso zzso 2004, zzso 30, zzso 6; see also zzso
