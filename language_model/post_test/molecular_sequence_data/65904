zzso zzso zzso zzso the first step in the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity is controlled through the zzso modification of its regulatory zzso The regulatory domain of zzso can be zzso at four zzso zzso 19, 31, and 40) by a variety of protein zzso zzso of zzso does not by itself increase zzso activity but zzso its binding to the zzso zzso That leads to the enhancement of zzso activity with a still not fully understood zzso The main goal of this work was to investigate whether the zzso protein binding affects the zzso of the regulatory domain of human zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso was used to generate five zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso located at five different positions within the domain zzso 14, 34, 73, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso of zzso and zzso does not itself induce any significant structural changes in regions surrounding inserted zzso On the other hand, the interaction between the zzso protein and zzso zzso decreases the zzso exposure of zzso zzso at positions 14 and 34 and zzso distinct structural change in the vicinity of zzso The zzso protein binding also reduces the sensitivity of zzso zzso to zzso by protecting its zzso part zzso 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso is an zzso protein with a low content of secondary structure and that neither zzso nor the zzso protein binding changes its secondary zzso
