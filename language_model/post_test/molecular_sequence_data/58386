The structure of a complementary hybrid duplex of zzso and DNA has been determined by X-ray zzso A ten zzso DNA zzso of sequence zzso was zzso to complementary zzso zzso and zzso producing zzso zzso that zzso to zzso A zzso The hybrid adopts a geometry that is neither strictly A nor zzso rather the zzso possesses qualities of both, reminiscent of zzso descriptions of a hybrid zzso or zzso All of the zzso maintain the zzso zzso seen in zzso while both zzso and zzso zzso are found in the zzso The minor groove zzso zzso to zzso zzso is intermediate between standard values for A (11 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The global parameters rise and zzso tilt (or zzso are like that of zzso however the slide and zzso displacement zzso are more like that of zzso thus giving the hybrid a unique zzso In addition, the zzso zzso in a manner that allows the formation of zzso that stack zzso thereby providing a glimpse of how an extended (20 zzso zzso of zzso hybrid might zzso This duplex sequence was selected for study because it is specifically recognized by the zzso H function of zzso reverse zzso A structure of a zzso of this zzso is of potential value in understanding requirements for the selectivity of this important drug zzso The minor groove of the hybrid duplex, lined with the zzso of the zzso rings, is the single distinguishing characteristic of the zzso hybrid, undoubtedly an important structural feature zzso zzso
