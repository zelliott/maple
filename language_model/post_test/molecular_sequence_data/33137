The deletion of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso had led to the zzso of genes involved in secondary metabolism and zzso of zzso the zzso control zzso zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso was created and used for zzso profiling by zzso zzso Most of the zzso target genes were zzso acid zzso genes besides a zzso of the zzso bridging factor zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso exhibit no zzso zzso and that both proteins do not interact with each other in zzso zzso Moreover, results presented here suggest that zzso is not responsible for the zzso zzso of secondary metabolism and that its role is focused on the zzso of zzso acid zzso in response to the zzso acid status of the zzso Surprisingly, zzso control is zzso by nitrogen limitation in an zzso zzso
