We present a detailed analysis of the protein structures in the 30 S zzso zzso from zzso zzso and their interactions with 16 S zzso based on a crystal structure at zzso A zzso With 20 different zzso zzso the 30 S zzso adds significantly to our data base of zzso structure and zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso many of the proteins have long, extended regions, either in the zzso or in internal zzso which make extensive contact to the zzso component and are involved in stabilizing zzso zzso zzso Many zzso proteins share similar zzso sandwich zzso but we show that the zzso of this domain varies zzso as do the ways in which the proteins interact with zzso Analysis of the zzso interactions in the context of zzso assembly shows that the primary zzso are zzso proteins that bind at zzso zzso zzso whereas proteins with long extensions assemble zzso We attempt to correlate the structure with a large body of zzso and genetic data on the 30 S zzso
