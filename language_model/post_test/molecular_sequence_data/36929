We describe the complete zzso sequence of a full length zzso clone zzso a new mouse zinc finger protein zzso zzso and zzso it on zzso 5 by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of the zzso protein zzso zzso contains zzso zzso acids and the zzso domain of 197 zzso encodes 7 zinc zzso We also present evidence that zzso is a strong zzso zzso The zzso domain was localized in the non finger region and a fusion protein containing 112 zzso acid zzso from this region of the zzso and the DNA binding domain of the zzso Gal 4 zzso very efficiently zzso the expression of a reporter zzso zzso harboring the zzso target zzso By in zzso zzso and northern zzso technique, the zzso transcript can be detected at a highly elevated level during zzso Its expression accompanies the progression from zzso zzso to round zzso The zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso do not show any zzso level of the zzso Interestingly, other zzso express low levels of a slightly shorter transcript with a different zzso end as determined by zzso zzso The presence of both a zzso zzso domain and 7 DNA binding zinc fingers, coupled with the cell zzso specific expression pattern, suggests that zzso has the potential to regulate zzso during zzso
