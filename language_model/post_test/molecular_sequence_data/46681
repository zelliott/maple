A family of protein zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to zzso zzso zzso zzso We have identified zzso zzso four distinct mouse zzso zzso zzso designated zzso through zzso Mouse zzso and zzso diverge from the known human zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and are 13 zzso longer and 16 zzso zzso respectively, than human zzso while zzso very likely represents the mouse equivalent of human zzso Mouse zzso is identical to the other zzso zzso in the zzso region, but comprises only 59 of the 263 zzso acids of the putative zzso zzso As zzso retains the region involved in interacting with activated zzso but most likely lacks zzso activity, this zzso might represent a naturally occurring inhibitor of other zzso Analysis of the zzso organization of zzso gene revealed that the four zzso are generated by alternative zzso zzso from a single approximately zzso zzso zzso made up of at least 17 zzso and located on mouse zzso zzso Similar to human zzso zzso contains three zzso zzso within its zzso region known to serve as zzso for zzso Mouse zzso lacks these zzso sites, but carries a basic zzso containing consensus sequences for zzso by protein zzso C and zzso protein zzso Mouse zzso displays none of these zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso are predicted to differ in terms of their regulation by zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression revealed that the four zzso zzso are zzso expressed in mouse zzso suggesting that the four zzso zzso are involved in regulating zzso or cell zzso functions in zzso
