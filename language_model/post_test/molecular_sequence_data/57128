In zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso levels are increased by zzso and by agents that raise zzso zzso levels such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, insulin lowers zzso levels, an effect dominant over the zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso increase zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso human zzso cells and that insulin zzso this zzso In studies reported here, zzso zzso cells were used to further evaluate the role of zzso in stimulating zzso zzso zzso studies found that either zzso or zzso zzso zzso alone, or the combination of zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso increased zzso protein levels, zzso levels, and promoter activity, but that the addition of zzso to zzso was required to give a approximately zzso increase in promoter zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter were used to show that much of the effect of zzso and zzso was zzso by the region between zzso and 246 base pairs zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cap zzso zzso I protection zzso showed that zzso zzso nuclear extract zzso the region from 273 to zzso zzso zzso of the cap zzso this region, designated zzso has a central zzso motif common to zzso elements zzso zzso the zzso motif in the zzso zzso promoter construct to zzso led to a 51% decrease in the ability of zzso and zzso to stimulate zzso promoter activity above control zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso A zzso with the native zzso zzso promoter construct zzso zzso promoter activity zzso but the zzso zzso decreased by zzso the ability of zzso to stimulate zzso promoter activity above control zzso zzso the zzso motif to zzso also blocked the ability of both crude zzso zzso nuclear extract and zzso zzso protein to bind to the zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso element is a zzso that zzso at least part of the zzso effect of zzso on the human zzso zzso
