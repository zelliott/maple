zzso are zzso zzso of great zzso zzso While zzso are generally zzso zzso the zzso fungus zzso zzso produces two closely related zzso zzso composed of a large zzso zzso to the other zzso zzso and a small zzso The sequence of the small zzso does not show significant zzso to any other protein or domain of known function and consequently its function is zzso The highest similarity to proteins of known structure is to a putative zzso zzso from zzso zzso which shows an identity of zzso zzso zzso of the small zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso were obtained using the zzso zzso method at zzso from a solution consisting of zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso pH zzso The zzso belonged to the zzso space group zzso or zzso with zzso parameters a zzso zzso c zzso zzso The zzso unit contains two molecules related by a zzso twofold zzso A complete data set extending to a maximum resolution of zzso was collected at zzso using a wavelength of zzso
