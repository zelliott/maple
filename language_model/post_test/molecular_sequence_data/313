A general method is described to zzso peptides containing zzso from complex zzso zzso aimed at zzso mass zzso analysis to study different aspects of zzso zzso The enrichment method is based on zzso capture of zzso peptides by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and is demonstrated for two different zzso zzso of peptides derived from zzso c treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows several zzso containing zzso zzso of peptides derived from an zzso coli zzso pulse labeled with the zzso zzso acid zzso as substitute for zzso allows identification of numerous newly zzso zzso Furthermore, the method is found to be very specific, as after enrichment over zzso of all peptides contain zzso zzso
