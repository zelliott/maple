zzso is an important component of the immune response against bacteria that is characterized by its ability to break down bacterial zzso We constructed a high-quality zzso library from mantle tissue of adult Japanese zzso zzso zzso The zzso which is high zzso with zzso zzso genes of other species was found in the zzso zzso In the present study, the complete express sequence of zzso zzso genes from Japanese zzso zzso as zzso was directly obtained by zzso The complete sequence of zzso zzso consisted of a zzso untranslated region zzso of 25 zzso an open reading frame zzso of 606 zzso and a 3' zzso of 100 zzso with one zzso signal zzso The deduced zzso acids of zzso were 201 zzso acids with a putative signal zzso of 18 zzso acid zzso It shared the sequence similarity and the common structure features with the zzso zzso from other zzso zzso reverse zzso real-time zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso transcripts of zzso zzso could be detected in various zzso of unchallenged zzso and the highest expression of zzso was detected in zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in zzso after zzso zzso challenge was zzso and reached the maximum level at zzso post zzso and then dropped back to the original level even lower than the control zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso of zzso sequence of zzso was identified by zzso walking, and several potential zzso factor binding sites zzso were detected in the putative promoter zzso One part of the zzso promoter region contains nine sites of zzso and three sites of zzso zzso zzso and these zzso were found organize into two zzso The two zzso were associated with different zzso The zzso could be selected to analyze the zzso control of zzso zzso zzso gene and the zzso immune zzso
