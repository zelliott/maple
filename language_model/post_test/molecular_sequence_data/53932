zzso termination is the final step that completes the synthesis of a zzso zzso translation termination by introduction of a nonsense zzso leads to the synthesis of a truncated zzso We report the identification and characterization of the product of the zzso zzso a zzso belonging to the zzso family of zzso that is involved in modulating translation zzso zzso is zzso to zzso a factor previously shown to function in both zzso turnover and translation zzso zzso of zzso induced a nonsense suppression zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression is apparently not due to induction of zzso even though zzso of zzso alleviated the nonsense suppression zzso observed in cells zzso zzso suggesting a more direct role of zzso in the translation termination zzso The zzso gene product was shown to interact with translation termination factors and is localized to zzso Taken together, these results indicate that at least two members of a family of zzso zzso zzso translation termination efficiency in zzso
