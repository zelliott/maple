The zzso differentiation zzso marker zzso was initially characterized as a primary response zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso cells in response to differentiation induced by zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso possesses a unique modular structure, which consists of an zzso zzso zzso similar to the zzso segments of zzso zzso 1 and zzso and a zzso region related to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Toll and zzso zzso zzso In this report we describe the cloning and gene structure of mouse zzso The complete coding sequence of mouse zzso spans five zzso with the first zzso zzso the complete death zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized to the zzso region of mouse zzso 9 by zzso zzso zzso The human zzso zzso was mapped to zzso zzso by zzso analysis of a human zzso 3 zzso cell hybrid mapping zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed widespread expression of zzso in many adult mouse zzso and zzso studies detected zzso zzso in T and B cell lines and zzso embryonic stem zzso The broad expression pattern demonstrates that mouse zzso expression is not restricted to cells of zzso lineage as was originally zzso
