The cucumber zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been transferred into zzso zzso and zzso zzso plants using an zzso zzso zzso The transferred gene is found in variable copy number in different zzso and is zzso transmitted in each case as a single zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates in the zzso during the first three days of zzso then declines in amount as the zzso emerge from the zzso The decline is more pronounced in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is also detected at a low level in petals of transformed zzso zzso In these respects the pattern of zzso gene expression is similar in cucumber and in transformed plants, showing that the transferred DNA zzso contains a functional zzso zzso A 1076 zzso zzso of zzso sequence was linked to the zzso reporter gene and transferred into zzso where it was shown to direct zzso and spatial patterns of expression similar to that of the complete zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso activity demonstrated that the zzso gene is expressed not only in zzso of transgenic plants, but also in zzso and some zzso cells during early zzso The relevance of these findings to the control of zzso zzso gene expression is zzso
