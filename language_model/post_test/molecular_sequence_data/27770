Human zzso zzso was zzso from urine and subjected to detailed structural zzso The protein was zzso with zzso acid and zzso with zzso zzso zzso V-8 zzso and zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso fragments were separated by zzso zzso using zzso columns and zzso acid zzso zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso was zzso by sequence analysis and alignment of peptides derived from different zzso zzso A procedure using in zzso zzso zzso of a large zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by direct sequencing was carried out to provide overlap for two zzso sites at zzso 78 and zzso Three zzso zzso sites were confirmed by the direct sequence analysis of the isolated zzso However, the third zzso at zzso occurs only in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively separates two species of zzso which zzso to molecules zzso and zzso at zzso zzso The human urinary zzso contains zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso and zzso as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The primary structure is completely identical to that deduced from a human zzso DNA sequence zzso Lin et zzso manuscript in zzso and is different in one zzso acid zzso zzso zzso from that deduced from pancreatic or kidney zzso zzso
