Although zzso silk has been studied for a number of years the structures of the proteins involved have yet to be definitely zzso X-ray zzso and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance zzso were used to study major zzso zzso silk from zzso zzso The silk was studied in its natural state, in the zzso state and in the zzso state following zzso The natural silk structure is dominated by zzso aligned parallel to the fiber zzso zzso is characterized by zzso of the orientation of the zzso When the fiber is zzso alignment is zzso However, the same zzso was observed for zzso of minor zzso silk which does not zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso alone cannot explain the zzso in zzso zzso zzso silk showed very little zzso orientation in the natural state and there were no changes upon zzso zzso and X-ray zzso data are consistent with the zzso arising from the zzso sequences known to be present in the proteins of major zzso silk as has been proposed zzso
