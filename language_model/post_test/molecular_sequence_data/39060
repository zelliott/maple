The concept of zzso for zzso channels is zzso Recently, we discovered a novel molecular zzso zzso which increased total zzso protein and functional channels in zzso zzso through a transient interaction with the zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso is a zzso for zzso and zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso and zzso currents without affecting zzso or zzso zzso but had no such effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso or zzso Although zzso belongs to a family of proteins that interact with zzso factors, zzso of channel currents was not blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso A zzso acid zzso of zzso binds to the channel and is indistinguishable from zzso in its enhancement of zzso current and protein zzso Using a zzso zzso we have zzso zzso with zzso and zzso from zzso We propose that zzso is a zzso for specific zzso channels and may have this function in zzso where zzso produces the transient outward zzso zzso
