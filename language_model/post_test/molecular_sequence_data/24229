zzso is the zzso zzso class zzso in humans and can be subdivided into two zzso zzso and zzso each zzso by a separate gene and zzso expressed depending on age and anatomical zzso of the producing zzso zzso of the zzso gene is frequently observed in selected zzso As this zzso may serve to enhance zzso zzso we determined its effect on switching and production of zzso in human B zzso We developed a zzso zzso strategy, involving sequencing the switch zzso zzso region, the only human S region not zzso to date, to assess the proportion of cells switching to zzso and zzso in zzso Our results show that there is no difference in the serum and zzso levels of zzso and zzso or rate of switching to zzso and zzso between normal donors and individuals carrying zzso gene zzso suggesting involvement of a regulatory step in the production of zzso
