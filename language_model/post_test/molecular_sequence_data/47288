We have cloned the zzso gene for the trans zzso zzso zzso from the zzso species zzso zzso using zzso zzso affinity selection and zzso zzso zzso comparison revealed that the trans zzso zzso zzso from zzso species share certain characteristic zzso Interestingly, the affinity selection procedure zzso addition to the bona fide zzso zzso closely related small zzso which can be folded into the same secondary structure, but carries three changes in the loop zzso This raises the possibility that there may be a larger family of zzso zzso in zzso To study the zzso zzso assembly and function in zzso we have established a stable expression system in zzso Two cell lines have been generated that express zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso site, resulting in a zzso of core zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso behaved differently in cell zzso zzso a zzso in nuclear zzso In sum, this demonstrates for the first time that the zzso site of zzso zzso contributes an essential element for stable core zzso assembly and may be important for nuclear zzso in zzso to the zzso site function of zzso zzso zzso in higher zzso
