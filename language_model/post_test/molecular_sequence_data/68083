zzso oxide zzso may mediate the zzso of septic zzso but the effect of zzso on zzso NO zzso zzso zzso expression remains zzso We studied the effects of zzso zzso treatment in zzso on zzso zzso expression using reverse zzso and zzso chain zzso The zzso zzso was absent or negligible in any tissue studied from control rats, but was markedly increased in zzso liver, zzso skeletal muscle and kidney from zzso zzso The zzso increase in zzso zzso was prevented by zzso Our results indicate that zzso treatment in zzso zzso the expression of an zzso zzso via a zzso zzso and thus provide direct molecular evidence for the involvement of NO in septic zzso
