zzso wild zzso strains isolated from zzso cases in the Civil Hospital of Karachi in Pakistan in zzso were selected for partial sequence analysis covering the zzso junction region of the viral zzso to study the genetic relationships and zzso links between zzso zzso zzso was partially amplified by zzso and zzso by a solid phase zzso Computer analysis revealed genetic divergence of the strains within each zzso Most of the zzso differences between strains were zzso only a few specific zzso acid zzso were seen in the zzso zzso Three zzso of zzso type 1 and two of zzso type 3 were zzso while type 2 strains were represented by a single zzso Representatives of all the zzso present have been found among previously or zzso characterized zzso isolated elsewhere, but direct zzso links were found only in the case of zzso zzso Many of the zzso caused by zzso type 1 in other countries were genetically linked to zzso This study clearly shows the endemic circulation and wide variation of all three zzso zzso in southern Pakistan and indicates the need for more effective vaccination zzso to prevent the further spread of these wild zzso
