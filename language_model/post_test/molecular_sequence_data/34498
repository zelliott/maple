zzso forest zzso are usually efficient sinks for the greenhouse gas zzso at least in the absence of significant amounts of zzso We demonstrate here that trafficking with heavy harvesting machines caused a large reduction in zzso consumption and even turned zzso forest zzso into net methane zzso In addition to studying methane zzso we investigated the responses of zzso after trafficking in two different forest zzso zzso generated wheel tracks with different impact zzso moderate, zzso and zzso We found that machine passes decreased the zzso zzso space and lowered zzso zzso in wheel zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded high zzso zzso as demonstrated by quantitative zzso analyses of zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso whereas these sequences were zzso in unaffected zzso Even after a year after traffic zzso zzso abundance in zzso zzso did not decline, indicating a stability of zzso here over zzso zzso wheel tracks exhibited a relatively constant community structure, since we found several zzso zzso sequence types continuously present at all sampling zzso zzso analysis revealed a rather large zzso diversity in the zzso soil, and most zzso gene sequences were mostly similar to known sequences from zzso The majority of zzso gene sequences belonged either to the order zzso or zzso whereas both sites were dominated by members of the families zzso zzso with similar sequences obtained from zzso zzso The results show that zzso wet forest zzso by heavy machinery causes increases in methane production and zzso
