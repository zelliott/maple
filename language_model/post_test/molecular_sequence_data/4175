Two different sites on vitamin zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso the zzso site required for zzso zzso binding and the active site for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso for the zzso but unique since it possesses a zzso recognition site for the zzso distinct from the zzso which is essential as a binding site for zzso However, the exact location and composition of this zzso domain on zzso has remained unclear until zzso Using a zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate in this paper that the high affinity of zzso for zzso cannot be explained by a direct interaction with either the active site or with the zzso site on zzso It is shown using various synthetic peptides derived from zzso that there are two zzso on zzso necessary for zzso one located between zzso 1 and 12 and a second between zzso 26 and 39, zzso at the zzso side of the zzso zzso zzso Both internal sequences contribute substantially to the efficiency of zzso On the basis of these data we zzso the presence of a second zzso zzso site on zzso capable of specifically binding zzso which is the first vitamin zzso zzso of which the zzso binding domain is interrupted by the zzso zzso
