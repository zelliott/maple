zzso virus zzso is considered to be one of the most genetically stable of all the zzso Yet two zzso strains with a zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso were isolated in North America in 1998 and zzso The zzso strains have an accelerated cell spread zzso which zzso them from all zzso and laboratory zzso Since the zzso zzso contains 70 additional open reading frames zzso the possibility existed that the zzso change was actually due to an zzso zzso or deletion elsewhere in the zzso To exclude this hypothesis, the entire zzso of the two zzso viruses were zzso and found to contain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in 14 zzso One zzso zzso was discovered in zzso but none was found in zzso zzso zzso or zzso There were no coding zzso in the major regulatory protein zzso zzso One zzso was discovered which could never have been anticipated based on current knowledge of zzso zzso zzso the origins of replication differed from those in the zzso strain but not in a manner expected to affect cell zzso When the two complete zzso zzso sequences were surveyed in their zzso the most reasonable conclusion was that the increased cell spread zzso was dependent substantially or solely on the single zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso results also expanded the evolutionary database by identifying which zzso zzso were more likely to mutate over zzso
