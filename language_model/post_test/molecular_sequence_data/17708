zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso sequences has emerged as a powerful tool for bacterial zzso However, earlier studies often only included one or a few species per zzso and it is not sure whether the zzso sequences could discriminate closely related zzso The zzso zzso is composed of ten species, some being up to zzso related by DNA zzso The reverse zzso extension method was used to determine zzso to zzso zzso in each of ten zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso sequences determined were zzso The zzso tree obtained with the zzso method showed a cluster of zzso species distinct from both zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso position in the zzso zzso is zzso clearly included in the zzso branch and grouped within the zzso zzso zzso zzso regions in the zzso zzso molecules were identified and could serve as the basis for a specific probe zzso
