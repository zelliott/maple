Active delivery of zzso zzso or zzso at the zzso zzso by genetically modified zzso zzso zzso provides a novel therapeutic approach for the induction of zzso zzso disease is associated with either zzso or zzso responses to specific zzso zzso of zzso and may be treated by induction of zzso zzso We investigated whether oral administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was engineered to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the induction of zzso tolerance was studied in zzso AB degrees zzso transgenic zzso zzso was assessed by zzso hypersensitivity reaction, zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulatory T cell zzso zzso administration of zzso induced suppression of local and systemic zzso T cell responses in zzso AB degrees zzso transgenic zzso Treatment resulted in an zzso decrease of the zzso capacity of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and a significant induction of zzso regulatory T cells were associated with the zzso suppression induced by zzso These data provide support for the development of effective therapeutic approaches for zzso disorders using orally administered zzso zzso Such treatments may be effective even in the setting of established zzso
