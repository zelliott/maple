zzso peptides are a class of zzso derived natural products with diverse zzso The characteristic threaded lasso structure in these peptides derives from an zzso bond attaching the zzso of the zzso to an zzso side zzso Here we describe the zzso expression of a lasso zzso gene cluster zzso two lasso zzso zzso and zzso and solve the solution structure of zzso This cluster also encodes an zzso zzso as a zzso We show that this zzso zzso is a lasso zzso zzso that specifically zzso zzso and zzso converting them to linear zzso zzso is highly zzso and resists zzso after extensive heat zzso In contrast, zzso zzso upon heat zzso zzso has no activity toward zzso zzso demonstrating that this zzso must recognize a knotted structure in order to zzso We also use this zzso as a tool to study evolutionary relationships between lasso zzso gene zzso
