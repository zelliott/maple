zzso are one of the most primitive zzso zzso some 500 million years zzso It has long been known that zzso zzso zzso zzso from their zzso zzso and prevent blood zzso of host zzso We found two major protein components of 160 and 26 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso river zzso zzso zzso The larger protein was identified as river zzso plasma zzso The complete primary structure of the zzso protein was determined by protein and zzso zzso It belonged to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso that includes recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso contraction of zzso zzso smooth muscle, but showed no effect on zzso zzso The result suggests that zzso zzso is an zzso zzso blocker and may act as a zzso which zzso the zzso to feed on the zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein contains a number of short insertions throughout the zzso when aligned with zzso zzso zzso zzso probably due to the large evolutionary distance between the zzso and the zzso and may represent a novel class of zzso zzso family zzso
