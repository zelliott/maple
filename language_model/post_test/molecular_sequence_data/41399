zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to treat a number of diseases such as zzso arthritis and type 2 zzso However, the biological zzso of zzso is very short due to its rapid zzso zzso Our present study aimed to increase the biological zzso of zzso through fusion with human serum zzso zzso and then zzso expression of the zzso and zzso fusion protein zzso in zzso zzso strain by increasing zzso gene copy number or was zzso with zzso By comparing clones containing varying copy numbers of zzso fusion zzso it was observed that higher levels of zzso zzso fusion protein was produced in strain with higher zzso gene copy zzso In addition, zzso protein yield was further improved after being zzso with protein zzso zzso zzso zzso it was significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso in the culture zzso by zzso of zzso binding zzso We have also discussed whether the zzso strain and zzso of zzso could enhance the levels of other zzso zzso fusion protein zzso zzso and human growth hormone fusion zzso Interestingly, the level of this fusion protein was apparently also increased by these zzso In conclusion, our results have demonstrated that increasing copy number and zzso of zzso may raise yield of zzso fusion protein in zzso zzso which might probably contribute to the industry for the development of zzso zzso
