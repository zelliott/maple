zzso The effects of variations in zzso on the kinetic properties of zzso coli zzso H were studied using zzso zzso of various types zzso to complementary zzso The zzso displayed minimal sequence zzso initiated zzso through an zzso mechanism near the 3' zzso of the zzso in a zzso zzso and then was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso supported zzso more effectively than zzso zzso zzso comprised of zzso zzso or zzso did not support zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso of zzso duplexes with full zzso zzso were compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso wings surrounding a zzso zzso Such structural modifications resulted in substantial increases in zzso but significant reductions in zzso zzso The initial rates of zzso increased as the zzso gap size was zzso Multiple zzso gaps increased the zzso but had little effect on zzso zzso The effects of several base modifications on the site of initial zzso zzso and initial rate of zzso were also zzso
