Comparative zzso zzso sequence analysis indicates that two distinct zzso with a sequence zzso of zzso % zzso value, 100 zzso exist within the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso which comprises zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso which comprises zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso discrimination is supported by zzso zzso Members of the zzso zzso lineage have zzso zzso do not produce acids from zzso and are susceptible to zzso in contrast to members of the zzso zzso zzso which have one or more polar zzso produce acid from several carbohydrates and are zzso Members of the zzso zzso lineage are viable for up to 6 days on zzso soy zzso at 25 degrees C, whereas members of the zzso zzso lineage are viable for longer than 9 zzso It is proposed that species of the zzso zzso lineage should be classified in a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, based on the literature and new zzso zzso data, it is proposed that zzso zzso should be renamed zzso zzso zzso zzso
