zzso releasing hormones zzso are an important part of the zzso axis in zzso zzso binding to its receptors zzso stimulates synthesis and release of zzso in the zzso zzso also mediate other processes in the central nervous system such as zzso behavior and zzso As many as five zzso genes have been identified in two zzso fish species, but the function and zzso relationship of these receptors is not fully zzso To gain a better understanding of the functional relationship between multiple zzso in an important aquaculture species, the Atlantic cod zzso zzso we identified four zzso zzso by zzso followed by full-length cloning and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences were used for zzso analysis to identify zzso functional motifs and to clarify the relationship of zzso with other zzso zzso The function of zzso zzso was investigated by quantitative zzso gene expression analysis in the brain and zzso of female cod during a full zzso cycle and in various peripheral zzso in sexually mature zzso zzso analysis revealed two types of zzso zzso Type I including zzso and Type II including zzso zzso and zzso All four zzso are expressed in the brain, and zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the zzso The only zzso zzso expressed in the zzso during the zzso cycle is zzso such that its expression is significantly increased during zzso These data suggest that zzso is the most likely candidate to mediate the zzso function of zzso in Atlantic zzso
