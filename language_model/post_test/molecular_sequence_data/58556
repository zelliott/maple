Unlike previously studied linear zzso containing zzso DNA zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso a 17 zzso linear zzso of zzso zzso zzso replication internally rather than at the zzso zzso and Cohen, zzso Here we identify and characterize the replication origin of zzso showing that it contains a series of direct repeats zzso within a centrally located gene zzso an essential zzso protein zzso a second essential protein zzso which resembles zzso DNA zzso and has zzso activity zzso by zzso DNA, is expressed from the same zzso A 430 zzso locus separated by almost 2 zzso from the zzso of the origin specifies an as yet undefined additional function required in zzso for zzso zzso zzso a 12 zzso linear zzso of zzso zzso zzso near the zzso of the zzso a region configured like the zzso zzso The replication regions of zzso and zzso which are capable of zzso zzso DNA in either a circular or linear form zzso and Cohen, zzso Chang and Cohen, 1994) resemble those of temperate zzso of the zzso and zzso Our observations suggest that zzso linear plasmids may occupy an zzso intermediate position between circular plasmids and linear zzso zzso
