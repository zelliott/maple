zzso of highly zzso human zzso via zzso and zzso zzso molecules zzso and maintains proliferation for more than 3 zzso This potent zzso 2 zzso zzso does not require zzso or accessory zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with high-level expression of the zzso zzso zzso alpha chain zzso zzso gene that is regulated at both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha gene zzso involves the enhanced binding of the zzso factor zzso B to its consensus sequence in the zzso region of the zzso alpha zzso To dissect the molecular basis for the unusually persistent zzso of the zzso alpha zzso we analyzed nuclear zzso B binding to a zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso probe during the time course of zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear extracts contained zzso zzso After zzso two new zzso zzso complexes were identified as zzso B zzso zzso and putative zzso zzso or zzso zzso Both zzso complexes persisted for at least 3 zzso Their relative levels were very similar for the duration of zzso In zzso zzso + zzso zzso triggered a significant zzso zzso decrease, suggesting that oxygen zzso are involved in the signaling zzso of zzso zzso Finally, zzso amounts of zzso zzso an oxygen radical scavenger that efficiently blocked the nuclear appearance of zzso B in zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso alpha cell surface zzso and zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso B plays an important role in long-term zzso of human primary zzso via zzso + zzso
