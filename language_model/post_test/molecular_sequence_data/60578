We report the characterization of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes the closest known zzso relative of the human zzso zzso zzso in the corresponding gene lead to mental zzso in zzso The zzso gene is composed of 10 zzso and we show that a zzso transcript is produced from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein is zzso identical and zzso similar to the human zzso zzso In two regions of more than 250 zzso zzso the proteins display zzso zzso The human and zzso proteins are putative DNA zzso and contain the seven characteristic zzso of this family of zzso In addition to the fact that similar proteins are zzso by the zzso and human zzso they share a partially identical zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso and zzso have zzso from the same ancestral DNA zzso gene and may therefore have zzso similar functions at the cellular zzso
