The zzso locus on human zzso zzso resides at the zzso of two critical cell cycle regulatory zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso Through the use of shared coding regions and alternative reading frames two distinct proteins are zzso zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor whereas zzso binds the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have examined the expression patterns of the zzso locus at the zzso level in normal human and zzso zzso to determine if these genes are zzso zzso We found that both zzso and zzso were expressed in most zzso at low levels zzso only by zzso The zzso was an exception in that it expressed no zzso zzso zzso but expressed high levels of zzso zzso Furthermore, human zzso expressed an additional previously zzso zzso zzso of zzso termed zzso through the use of an alternative zzso donor site within zzso zzso The zzso transcript produced a 12 zzso protein composed of zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso zzso This novel protein did not interact with zzso but was capable of suppressing growth in a zzso zzso The implications of the capacity of the zzso locus to zzso a third transcript, and for pancreatic cancer, in which the zzso locus is nearly always altered, are zzso
