zzso gene zzso are a prevalent class of zzso arising from the juxtaposition of 2 distinct regions, which can generate novel functional transcripts that could serve as valuable therapeutic targets in zzso zzso we aim to establish a sensitive, zzso methodology to zzso catalog functional gene zzso in cancer by evaluating a zzso zzso sequencing zzso Not only did a zzso approach provide a greater dynamic range in comparison with single read based approaches, but it clearly distinguished the high-level zzso gene zzso such as zzso and zzso from potential lower level zzso gene zzso Also, the zzso of a zzso approach enabled the discovery of 12 previously zzso gene zzso in 4 commonly used cell lines that eluded previous zzso Using the zzso zzso sequencing approach, we observed zzso zzso zzso zzso restricted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and overlapping zzso zzso zzso we successfully used zzso zzso sequencing to detect previously zzso zzso gene zzso in prostate zzso Together, this study establishes a highly specific and sensitive approach for accurately and zzso zzso zzso within a sample using zzso zzso zzso
