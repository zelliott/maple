zzso degradation of collagen and the model peptides by zzso has been zzso The zzso of collagen was predominantly observed by use of gel zzso zzso zzso was used as a model for zzso and the zzso modification was examined by zzso acid zzso zzso acid and zzso acid were identified in the zzso of oxidized zzso The formation of zzso acid was reduced by treatment with zzso The model zzso zzso was also zzso by zzso and a new zzso zzso was generated in proportion to the reaction zzso zzso radical zzso show only partial zzso of the degradation of zzso In order to estimate the fragmentation zzso we used zzso zzso as a model for collagen and zzso The degradation products were isolated and zzso Then zzso which provides zzso acid by acid zzso was zzso The formation of a zzso compound from oxidized zzso is direct evidence for the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso formation of zzso and liberation of zzso from zzso exposed to zzso was zzso These results suggest that the zzso of the zzso bond zzso was caused by zzso of the zzso zzso which led to the formation of the zzso zzso We confirmed that zzso zzso leads to the fragmentation of zzso accompanied by the formation of a zzso zzso
