We have recently observed that protein zzso C zzso was involved in the regulation of the zzso of zzso of the zzso components in cultured zzso zzso zzso mast cells zzso by zzso zzso Here we analyzed the probable regulatory effect of zzso on the synthesis and zzso activity of zzso complexes in zzso zzso mast zzso In this study we used the zzso zzso zzso mast cells that were not transformed by the zzso zzso Study of zzso cells showed zzso dependency of zzso zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso zzso whereas its protein expression was dependent on this zzso zzso This suggests the involvement of zzso in the regulation of translation of zzso a level of zzso regulation that was not previously zzso The amount of zzso zzso complex was also lowered in zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important regulatory role in different stages of the signal zzso zzso because of zzso zzso Surprisingly, we have observed that although the amount of total zzso zzso began to increase 15 minutes after zzso zzso the amount of zzso associated with zzso did not increase, even after 45 zzso This association was not affected by zzso Using a zzso protein zzso probe, an expression of zzso zzso zzso was detected in these zzso Furthermore, zzso stimulation caused an increase in the amount of a zzso protein complex that bound to an zzso DNA zzso zzso we propose that this protein complex that contains most of the zzso induced zzso has an important role in zzso signal zzso
