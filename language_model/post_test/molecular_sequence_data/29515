The 3' terminal zzso region of a zzso causing mosaic disease in several zzso species has been cloned and zzso Comparisons of the zzso and deduced zzso acid zzso sequences of the cloned zzso with those from other zzso show that the zzso virus zzso zzso mosaic zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso identity zzso at the coat protein zzso zzso level was observed between zzso and a Brazilian strain of zzso zzso analyses derived from the sequence alignments of the zzso and 3' untranslated region confirmed the identification of zzso as a strain of zzso and the name zzso is zzso
