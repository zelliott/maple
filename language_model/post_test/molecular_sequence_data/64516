zzso and structural changes of zzso tissue occur during the natural course of zzso zzso zzso and these changes may contribute to further zzso We investigated the changes in zzso tissue using zzso zzso and two-dimensional protein zzso zzso 

We established a zzso model of zzso by rapid right zzso zzso pacing at a rate of zzso zzso tissue was obtained after rapid zzso zzso for 6 zzso zzso containing zzso zzso clones were used to evaluate the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso was performed to compare protein zzso In zzso zzso studies, we identified zzso genes with significant change in the left atrium and 81 genes in the right zzso Among the zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso regulatory light chain zzso showed the greatest fold of change zzso and zzso in the left and right atrium, zzso In protein zzso the expression levels of three protein spots spanning from 18 to 20 zzso in the zzso region zzso zzso were specifically elevated in the zzso zzso Interestingly, through tandem mass zzso analysis, these three spots were identified as zzso Thus, zzso expression at the zzso and protein levels corresponded well, and both indicated a significant increase in zzso 

Both zzso zzso and two-dimensional zzso protein zzso studies revealed characteristic changes in zzso zzso We demonstrated the zzso of zzso regulatory light chain zzso zzso with a significant increase of its zzso zzso zzso
