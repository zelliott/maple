The zzso component of bone zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These proteins regulate zzso growth, cell signaling and zzso and provide bone with its zzso zzso zzso of bone zzso proteins have historically been studied individually or in small numbers zzso to limitations in zzso zzso Current zzso and zzso technologies allow a global view of protein expression patterns in complex zzso To our knowledge, no zzso profile of bone zzso has yet been zzso zzso we have used mass zzso as a tool to generate a profile of proteins present in the zzso zzso of adult rat zzso Overall, 108 and 25 proteins were identified with high confidence in the zzso and zzso respectively, using a bottom up zzso zzso zzso of these proteins were present in both the zzso and zzso including the bone specific zzso zzso type I zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso Interestingly, type II zzso a protein thought to be exclusively expressed in cartilage, was identified in both the zzso and zzso This observation was validated by Western zzso Additionally, the presence of zzso another protein expressed in cartilage was identified in the bone zzso extracts by Western zzso The zzso profile generated using this technology represents an initial survey of the acid soluble proteins of bone zzso which provides a reference for the analysis of zzso from the normal composition due to zzso or disease zzso
