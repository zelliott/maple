zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso is used as a food zzso and is the most important member of a group of zzso containing zzso bridges zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Schneider, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kellner, and zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso and its structural zzso zzso encodes a zzso that is zzso zzso revealing the active zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the additional genes zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Over their entire zzso these genes were zzso to genes recently identified as important for the zzso of zzso that is, zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso and zzso corresponded to open reading frames of zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso open reading frame is zzso to proteins of the zzso zzso B protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso are responsible for the zzso of a variety of compounds, including large zzso zzso and zzso tumors, indicating that zzso may be involved in zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso transcript for the zzso structural zzso and the zzso start point of the zzso gene was determined by primer zzso Additionally, a zzso of at least 3 zzso was identified by using a zzso probe specific to zzso zzso were raised against the zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso analysis revealed a molecular weight of about 115 zzso which is in accordance with the theoretical protein size of zzso zzso as calculated from the zzso open reading zzso Several zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso is associated with the zzso This was confirmed by preparing zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was tightly associated with the zzso fraction and was released by sodium zzso zzso treatment zzso These results suggest that zzso is membrane associated and that zzso zzso occurs at the cell zzso
