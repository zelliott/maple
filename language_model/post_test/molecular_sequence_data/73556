Two zzso zzso receptors have been cloned from zzso the D1 and zzso zzso also known as zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in zzso Although zzso receptors are known to stimulate zzso release, the zzso zzso zzso this action has not been zzso We investigated D1 zzso zzso expression in rat zzso cells obtained after zzso zzso of kidney zzso and differential zzso zzso cells in primary culture were zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso These cells expressed the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso function was demonstrated by a zzso stimulation of zzso production by zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso also caused a zzso increase in zzso production and zzso zzso that was blocked by the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso Although the D1 zzso do not distinguish between the cloned zzso zzso the actions of zzso were due to occupancy of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso the only other zzso zzso zzso is not expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso but not sense zzso zzso completely blocked the zzso effect of zzso on zzso production and zzso zzso We conclude that there is selective zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso linked to the stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells is the zzso zzso
