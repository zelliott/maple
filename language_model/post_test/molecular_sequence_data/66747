zzso is a key zzso for maintaining zzso in mouse embryonic stem zzso zzso The function of zzso in zzso cells of other species, however, especially zzso zzso cells, is not zzso In the present study, we cloned two zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso monkey zzso cells, and found that they have high zzso to human zzso and zzso To examine their function, zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso monkey zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso cell differentiation into zzso and zzso lineages and disrupted proliferation of zzso monkey zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso did not induce differentiation of monkey zzso zzso These findings indicate that a certain zzso expression level has an important role in sustaining zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso
