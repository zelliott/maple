zzso zzso infections are difficult to treat due to zzso zzso zzso formation by zzso zzso is an additional factor in its ability to resist zzso zzso The zzso and zzso activities of the human zzso zzso zzso and its fragments zzso zzso and zzso against clinical zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The minimal zzso concentration zzso of zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso ranged from 16 to 32 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso varied from zzso to 16 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso ranged from 16 to 64 zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity against five zzso zzso zzso including four zzso clinical zzso within 30 zzso at zzso of zzso zzso By zzso the fragments zzso and zzso eliminated all tested strains at 8 and 64 zzso zzso zzso and its fragments displayed zzso activities between zzso zzso A minimum zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso inhibited and dispersed zzso zzso zzso at 32 zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso inhibited zzso at zzso of zzso zzso zzso the truncated zzso of zzso effectively dispersed zzso at 64 zzso At zzso no zzso toxicity was observed at the zzso doses when zzso zzso were zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso exhibit significant zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso The prevention of zzso formation in zzso by zzso zzso and zzso adds significance to their zzso These peptides can be potential zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso
