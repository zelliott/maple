Using a differential screening strategy, we have cloned a novel zzso zzso zzso related to the transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso were detected primarily in the zzso marginal zone of late zzso zzso they became highly localized to the zzso lip of early zzso and were not observed at later zzso This zzso which is most zzso to the mouse gene zzso displays a new pattern of zzso zzso These findings highlight the potential role of these growth factors during early zzso zzso
