We report expression profiles of several genes of zzso zzso cell wall zzso zzso in particular, to better understand sugar transport and its zzso in developing zzso of grain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene expression analyses for zzso using zzso gel zzso and real-time quantitative zzso approaches on developing zzso including the zzso zzso tissue appended to the zzso showed expression of zzso zzso zzso primarily in the zzso sugar unloading zone of zzso The expression of zzso zzso was significantly less abundant and restricted to the zzso The protein and zzso activity data zzso the zzso transcript expression profile that showed zzso zzso protein zzso expression preceding the zzso phase of zzso development, zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a single zzso of zzso The highest level of zzso activity was unique to the zzso part of the zzso in particular the zzso zzso transfer cell zzso layer and the maternal zzso region that were highly enriched for the zzso zzso as seen by zzso High zzso ratio in zzso zzso seeds, and negligible starch deposition in zzso zzso the zzso activity zzso Additionally, we report zzso profiles of several other genes related to zzso metabolism in developing zzso zzso As in zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso and zzso during the early zzso stages of zzso is essential for the normal development of zzso zzso The unique zzso of the zzso protein to both zzso and zzso ends of zzso zzso shown here for the first time is likely to greatly increase zzso of both zzso zzso and water through zzso sensing into developing zzso This trait is unique to zzso among zzso and may facilitate its survival in drought zzso
