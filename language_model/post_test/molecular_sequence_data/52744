In zzso molecular mechanisms and factors involved in the tight regulation of zzso expression and activity are still largely zzso In this study, we provide evidence for a role of zzso and their receptors in the zzso regulation of zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso and, consequently, in the zzso of the zzso Through a computer analysis of the zzso zzso zzso we identified a putative zzso response element zzso which was capable of binding in zzso human zzso zzso alpha zzso In zzso DNA zzso revealed specific modifications of the zzso region in zzso but not zzso cells upon treatment with zzso zzso indicative of zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso transient expression of zzso but not zzso remarkably increased zzso promoter activity, and zzso of the zzso significantly reduced this zzso No zzso activity was detected in human zzso zzso cells grown in the absence of zzso but the addition of the hormone induced the zzso within 3 h of zzso The expression of zzso zzso and protein was induced in parallel with zzso zzso This prompt zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso The identification of zzso as a target of zzso represents a novel finding which advances the understanding of zzso regulation in zzso cells and has implications for a potential role of hormones in their zzso and zzso zzso
