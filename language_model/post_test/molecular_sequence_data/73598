zzso is a 60 zzso zzso zzso which was originally discovered in human breast cancer cells, and subsequently found in other zzso and normal gastric zzso zzso We have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of a zzso zzso of human zzso using zzso distance and 137 zzso angle constraints obtained from analysis of zzso zzso zzso A series of simulated zzso calculations resulted in the zzso determination of the zzso zzso bonding pattern and produced a family of 19 structures consistent with the zzso The zzso contains a single zzso sequence zzso a region of about 40 zzso with a characteristic sequence pattern, which has been found, either zzso or as a zzso in about a dozen zzso zzso The zzso domain contains three zzso bonds, whose zzso 2-4 and 3-6 zzso pairings form the structure into three closely packed zzso with only a small amount of secondary structure, which consists of a short zzso packed against a zzso zzso zzso The structure of the domain is very similar to those of the two zzso zzso that occur in zzso zzso zzso zzso the only member of the zzso family whose three-dimensional structure has been previously zzso Outside the zzso domain, which forms the compact zzso of the zzso the N and zzso strands are closely zzso forming an extended zzso which has some zzso character for part of its length and which becomes more zzso towards the zzso as indicated by zzso zzso We have considered the structural implications of the possible formation of a native zzso zzso zzso zzso of the surface features of zzso and zzso and consideration of the sequences of the other human zzso zzso in the light of these structures, illuminates the possible role of specific zzso in zzso zzso
