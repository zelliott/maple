zzso and zzso zzso by zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso were zzso Two closely related new zzso zzso and zzso were identified and zzso These elements are not highly related to other zzso sequences identified in zzso or other zzso zzso zzso Based on their structures and the sequences of the zzso terminal repeats and the putative zzso zzso the zzso elements zzso zzso are similar to zzso of zzso zzso and several related zzso All the IS elements that have been identified in this strain are found in multiple copies (10 to zzso and they have high-level promoter activity capable of stimulating zzso from a distance up to 500 zzso from a target zzso zzso zzso was originally isolated after prolonged selection for the ability to zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso as a sole carbon zzso Three IS elements are located near the first gene of the zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso inserted 110 zzso upstream of zzso and created a fusion promoter responsible for zzso zzso of the zzso Our results confirm the hypothesis that IS elements play a central role in zzso of zzso genes and likely have zzso rapid evolution of the zzso zzso
