zzso to a zzso product derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences led to the identification of a zzso zzso zzso DNA segment zzso a protein zzso that displays significant sequence identities to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso protein shows a common structure with zzso systems, it possesses an unusually long zzso zzso extension zzso zzso zzso After zzso expression of zzso in zzso coli zzso strain zzso which lacks zzso zzso zzso and zzso transport systems, both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso but only in cells grown at high zzso or subjected to a sudden zzso zzso Competition experiments demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not effective competitors for zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso has a high affinity for zzso with zzso of 16 zzso 2 zzso and 56 zzso 6 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in cells grown in minimal medium with zzso M zzso zzso activity appears to be zzso zzso In an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was reduced by about zzso suggesting that zzso represents a major component of the overall zzso zzso activities in response to salt zzso zzso activities of a zzso strain grown in various conditions showed that zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments performed with zzso and zzso zzso cells, treated or not with zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso is the consequence of immediate zzso of existing proteins by high zzso most likely through zzso zzso Growth experiments underscored the crucial role of zzso as an emerging system involved in the rapid acquisition of zzso by zzso zzso subjected to zzso zzso
