Analysis of the live attenuated zzso virus zzso vaccine strain zzso indicated location of a major zzso for zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso et zzso 1984, zzso zzso 52, zzso To more precisely zzso the zzso marker rescue experiments were performed using cloned zzso of zzso zzso were analyzed after zzso infection for their zzso in chicken, as well as after zzso infection for zzso in zzso We show that the zzso associated with zzso in strain zzso is located in a zzso zzso of zzso which encompasses the zzso zzso and zzso genes and a putative origin of replication zzso zzso zzso Kern, and zzso zzso zzso 1992, zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of this region of the strain zzso zzso and comparison with the corresponding region in zzso zzso strain zzso revealed the presence of eight point zzso Four zzso exchanges reside within the zzso gene with three of them leading to zzso acid zzso one is located in the zzso region between the zzso and zzso genes and three are localized downstream from the zzso zzso Neither the zzso gene nor the putative origin sequence was zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso strain zzso led to a marked zzso of the virus for pigs infected by the zzso zzso In zzso our data show that the zzso zzso gene is a major zzso of zzso zzso and that point zzso affecting the zzso gene of live vaccine strain zzso contribute to its attenuated zzso
