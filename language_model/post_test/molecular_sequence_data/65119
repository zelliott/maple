An zzso for the comparative sequencing zzso of zzso is shown to be suitable for the sequence zzso of zzso acids ranging in length from a few to 80 zzso The zzso is based on the matching of a zzso zzso spectrum generated by zzso zzso to zzso values predicted from a known reference sequence employing established fragmentation zzso Prior to mass zzso investigation, the zzso were zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso using monolithic separation zzso This study evaluated the potential and the limits of zzso regarding the length and the charge state of zzso the selected collision energy, and the analyzed amount of sample using a zzso zzso trap mass zzso The results revealed that zzso could be very reliably zzso up to zzso although the zzso was successfully used to even verify sequences up to zzso The relative collision energy was typically in the range between 13 and zzso which allowed in most cases a zzso of the reference sequence in a window of at least three consecutive collision zzso To select a proper charge state for zzso a compromise had to be found between high signal intensity and low charge zzso Furthermore, by reducing the zzso flow rate during zzso of the zzso the sequence of a zzso was successfully verified from the analysis of 295 zzso of the raw zzso zzso was proven to be zzso and was applied to the zzso of the zzso zzso locus zzso contained in a zzso pair zzso chain reaction zzso
