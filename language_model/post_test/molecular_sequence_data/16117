The structures of two cloned zzso of zzso zzso and mouse zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso were compared by electron microscopic analysis of various zzso zzso restriction zzso mapping and zzso sequence zzso Each clone was shown to be derived from a distinct region of the mouse zzso but the two exhibited structural similarity over a region of at least 11,000 bases which included a zzso zzso processed zzso of approximately zzso zzso It is concluded that the two zzso regions were derived from a common ancestral region by zzso or zzso The zzso regions of the two clones contained members of the long zzso repetitive zzso zzso zzso repeated sequence 1 of zzso zzso family lying in opposite orientation to one another, so that zzso DNA from the clones could form zzso zzso The complete zzso sequences of three zzso members in zzso zzso were zzso The longest of these zzso had inserted into the zzso processed zzso and, although it contained internal zzso appeared to possess intact zzso and 3' zzso A second zzso member zzso also appeared to have an intact zzso end but had lost most of its 3' portion, and a third member zzso was an internal zzso The repeated sequence at the zzso ends of zzso and zzso showed these to be members of the zzso zzso
