The zzso proteins zzso by zzso act as zzso gene zzso zzso to counter host zzso during zzso Here we report the crystal structure of Tomato zzso virus zzso zzso protein bound to a 19 zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso adopts an all zzso structure and forms a zzso to measure zzso duplex in a zzso zzso zzso has a pair of zzso structures to recognize simultaneously two zzso turns of zzso zzso duplex by fitting its zzso backbone into two adjacent major grooves of zzso zzso The zzso zzso between zzso and the zzso base of zzso duplex from both ends enhance the zzso zzso further zzso to form a zzso of zzso through the zzso zzso motif at its zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that zzso might interfere with the zzso gene zzso zzso by directly binding to zzso zzso
