zzso is a zzso of the zzso family from zzso tuberculosis that has been shown to sense zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We establish here that zzso binds zzso to multiple sites in zzso tuberculosis DNA and protects an unusually long 90 zzso zzso sequence from zzso zzso to zzso with respect to its own initiation zzso zzso interacts with four zzso imperfect zzso repeats matching the consensus sequence zzso in the protected zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso forms zzso zzso (up to an zzso The zzso of zzso is in agreement with the cooperative binding of zzso to multiple sites on zzso Two promoters transcribe zzso and the major promoter physically zzso with zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by cooperative interaction of zzso with multiple sites on DNA that zzso the major zzso zzso The combined results of a zzso reporter zzso an zzso shift zzso and a zzso I zzso experiment establish that zzso not zzso zzso the interaction of zzso with DNA to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
