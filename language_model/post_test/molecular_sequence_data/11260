We investigated the copy number of the gene for alternative zzso zzso of zzso zzso by amplification by zzso and Southern zzso These studies indicated that there are at least four copies of the zzso gene in zzso We isolated zzso clones containing individual copies zzso as zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, two of the zzso genes zzso and zzso were located in tandem in a zzso 5 zzso region on one of the zzso of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso sequences of the four zzso genes showed that all zzso genes are divided by three zzso and the positions of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the zzso We examined whether expression of zzso zzso zzso like the tobacco zzso zzso is enhanced by treatment with zzso A, an inhibitor of complex III in the zzso respiratory zzso We found that, in young plants, the amount of zzso zzso zzso was dramatically increased by addition of zzso A, while the zzso of the other three genes zzso zzso and zzso did not respond to zzso zzso zzso by zzso showed that zzso and zzso were expressed in all zzso examined zzso and zzso zzso zzso and roots of zzso old zzso In contrast, transcripts of zzso were detected only in the flowers and zzso and transcripts of zzso were detected mainly in zzso zzso and zzso These results suggested that transcriptions of the four genes for alternative zzso of zzso are zzso zzso
