zzso relationships between viruses may be obscure by protein sequence but unmasked by zzso Analysis of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and protein sequence analysis reveals analogies with zzso and T4 that suggest a mosaic of such zzso The zzso zzso is consistent with the zzso zzso protein fold but has a different zzso incorporating three additional zzso on each zzso zzso zzso to zzso the zzso major zzso protein has an zzso extension, or zzso that is missing in the mature zzso and by zzso with zzso may function as an assembly or scaffold zzso This zzso is predicted to be largely zzso as for that of zzso but is approximately zzso longer zzso with the larger zzso Thus, zzso architecture appears likely to be specified by the zzso Unlike zzso the zzso zzso binds a decoration protein in the center of each zzso similarly to the zzso protein of zzso zzso suggesting a common role for these zzso The zzso has unusual zzso symmetry that may aid in the unique zzso zzso process, and joins the zzso at a disk where tail fibers zzso This intriguing mix of characteristics embodied by zzso zzso offers insights into virus zzso zzso function, and the evolutionary connections between related zzso
