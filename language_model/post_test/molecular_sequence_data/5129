zzso zzso possesses at least seven zzso expressed genes that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences predict zzso processing at zzso zzso in the zzso reminiscent of the maturation of zzso zzso zzso where a zzso is converted into a biologically active zzso by zzso a zzso zzso zzso To investigate involvement of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso a genetic selection was performed based on zzso zzso A zzso strain of zzso zzso was transformed with a zzso zzso zzso DNA library and screened for the production of active zzso Positive clones were zzso for killer toxin activity, another zzso zzso zzso that rescued both defects contained a sequence zzso a protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso Both zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso by successive zzso zzso zzso continued to zzso active zzso however, the zzso was zzso processed and zzso at reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso were incapable of forming zzso instead zzso into zzso shaped zzso The ability to normally process zzso and form zzso was restored upon transformation of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso
