We analyzed a zzso zzso region of zzso zzso that contains a cluster of two zzso genes showing sequence similarity with genes in a cluster of three zzso genes previously identified in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso genes are designated zzso and zzso In addition to being different in gene number, the cluster of genes in zzso zzso differs dramatically in zzso structure from the zzso genes in zzso zzso the zzso orientation of the genes in the cluster also differs between the zzso Our findings support a model in which the zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso and zzso zzso evolved zzso Furthermore, while in zzso zzso the zzso gene cluster lies only 10 zzso distant from the zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso and zzso zzso gene clusters in zzso zzso are located very far apart and on a different zzso than that expected from the known zzso arm zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso A region of the zzso containing the zzso and zzso zzso gene clusters appears to have been relocated between zzso zzso
