zzso M is a zzso and zzso zzso isolated from the bark of the mulberry zzso zzso In order to understand the function and application of this novel zzso the binding property of zzso M was studied in detail using an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with extended zzso zzso From the results, it was found that the zzso zzso and zzso structural units of zzso such as those of the bovine zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the most active zzso but not the zzso or zzso including zzso from zzso The binding affinity of zzso M for zzso can be ranked in decreasing order as zzso zzso carrying multiple zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso with a single zzso core zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Man zzso 3 or 6 Man zzso Man zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating the unique specificity of this zzso that may not only assist in our understanding of cell surface zzso zzso recognition, but also provide zzso guidelines for the application of this structural probe in zzso and clinical regimens, especially in the detection and zzso of zzso zzso
