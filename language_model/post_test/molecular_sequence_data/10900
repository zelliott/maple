The promoter for a tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a key regulatory step in zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso promoter was fused to the zzso zzso reporter zzso and the zzso and spatial expression patterns of zzso activity were examined in zzso transformed plants and in transient expression zzso using zzso zzso of zzso No zzso activity was observed in any zzso under normal growth zzso A low level of zzso activity was detected in wounded zzso zzso and stem zzso whereas a much higher level was observed when these zzso were challenged with zzso or microbial zzso The zzso expression pattern directed by the zzso promoter was identical to the induction patterns observed for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso salicylic acid nor zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso expression to only a limited zzso Although the zzso promoter contains zzso resembling previously identified zzso control zzso other zzso important for quantitative and qualitative gene expression were identified by deletion and zzso zzso The zzso promoter differs from previously described zzso promoters because it only supports zzso gene expression and directs unique spatial expression zzso
