zzso zzso max zzso zzso resistance to any population of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso O'Donnell, zzso & zzso required a functional zzso at zzso zzso zzso the soybean zzso zzso zzso was an zzso endemic, zzso of soybean whereas zzso zzso zzso agent of sudden death syndrome zzso was a recent, zzso zzso This study examined the role of a zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso model zzso at zzso on zzso 18 of the zzso zzso within the zzso locus in causing resistance to zzso and zzso 

A zzso zzso encompassing the zzso locus was zzso from a resistant zzso and compared to the sequences of two susceptible zzso from which 800 zzso were zzso zzso alignments zzso that the resistance zzso was an zzso region of about zzso at the center of which the zzso was the most zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso were made of plants that were either zzso at, or transgenic (and so zzso at a new zzso with, the resistance zzso of zzso Those plants infested with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso showed that the zzso for resistance was zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso was sufficient to zzso nearly complete resistance to both root and leaf symptoms of zzso caused by zzso zzso and provided partial resistance to three different populations of zzso zzso female zzso were reduced by zzso In the presence of zzso the plants with the zzso were nearly zzso as fully resistant to zzso zzso reduced to zzso of the susceptible zzso as well as zzso A reduction in the rate of early zzso root development was also shown to be caused by the resistance zzso of the zzso Field trials of transgenic plants showed an increase in zzso zzso to insect zzso 

The zzso that soybean has adapted part of an existing pathogen recognition and defense cascade zzso zzso and insect zzso to a new pathogen zzso zzso zzso has broad implications for crop zzso zzso resistance to many pathogens might be achieved by manipulation the genes zzso a small number of pathogen recognition zzso
