To examine whether unknown viruses or zzso processes contribute to the development of zzso liver disease, we studied 48 patients undergoing liver transplantation who had zzso non-B zzso zzso zzso of unknown zzso or zzso zzso After the diagnosis of zzso C virus infection was established by the presence of viral zzso or viral zzso patients were reclassified into three groups: zzso C virus infection, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso appearance, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso features were compared in the three zzso Thirty-one percent of patients had neither zzso C virus infection nor classical zzso zzso and were classified as having zzso zzso Unlike zzso appearance in zzso C virus infection but similar to that in zzso zzso zzso zzso appearance of zzso zzso showed inactive zzso with little zzso After zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was demonstrated in zzso of patients with zzso C infection but in no patient with zzso or zzso zzso The zzso score, developed from clinical criteria associated with zzso liver disease, was significantly lower in zzso zzso and zzso C virus infection than in zzso zzso zzso antinuclear zzso smooth muscle zzso and zzso zzso zzso not commonly present in serum of patients with zzso zzso whereas zzso to soluble liver zzso were found with increased frequency in this zzso We conclude that in many patients with liver disease, no zzso can be zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
