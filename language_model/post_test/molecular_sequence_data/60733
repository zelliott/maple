zzso zzso is thought to be essential for the stabilization of zzso zzso through which zzso and zzso are zzso but little is known about the regulation of zzso in human gastric zzso zzso 

A total of 27 primary gastric tumors, 29 cases of zzso zzso and 30 cases of normal zzso as well as 8 gastric zzso cell lines, were examined for the relation between zzso zzso and gastric zzso zzso activity was detected by zzso repeat amplification zzso and the expression of each zzso zzso was evaluated by Northern zzso analysis or reverse zzso chain zzso 

zzso activity was found in all 8 gastric zzso cell lines and in 25 of 27 gastric zzso tissue samples zzso and zzso observed in 11 of 29 gastric zzso zzso samples zzso None of 30 normal gastric tissue samples displayed zzso zzso The zzso expression of human zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in 26 of 26 tumor tissue samples zzso and in 19 of 24 zzso zzso zzso in which zzso activity was weak or zzso zzso gastric zzso expressed the zzso zzso albeit at low zzso In contrast to zzso human zzso zzso component and human zzso protein expression did not parallel zzso activity, which was independent of tumor stage and zzso 

zzso expression is zzso during an early stage in the zzso process, and zzso zzso may be a critical step in gastric zzso
