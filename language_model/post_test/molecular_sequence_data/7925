In many zzso zzso nitrogen fixation occurs in differentiated cells called zzso zzso strains that do not form zzso may fix nitrogen in zzso cells, primarily under zzso zzso We describe here two functional zzso zzso in a single zzso the zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso reporter with a fluorescent zzso zzso for in zzso zzso of gene zzso we have shown that the two clusters of zzso genes are expressed zzso One zzso functions only in zzso under either zzso or zzso growth conditions, whereas the second zzso functions only under zzso conditions in zzso cells and zzso zzso between the two zzso clusters suggest that the zzso that is expressed in zzso is zzso regulated while the other is regulated by environmental zzso
