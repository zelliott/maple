zzso zzso are the dominant major outer membrane protein zzso of these zzso They are composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are functionally important and may also be useful for molecular zzso methods but have not yet been well zzso We therefore zzso the zzso gene from 39 zzso zzso including zzso sequence type zzso reference zzso zzso from patients with the zzso syndrome, other clinical zzso and zzso reference zzso These were compared with additional sequences available from zzso Three distinct zzso lineages were observed after zzso zzso Both zzso coli and zzso zzso were found with group 3 zzso zzso and this was the only group showing any evidence of zzso among zzso zzso There was no zzso between zzso genes from zzso zzso groups 1 and 2, suggesting there may be functional constraints on changes at this zzso Most of the zzso acid differences among the three groups were present in zzso zzso and dissimilar zzso were found when groups 1 and 2 zzso were zzso Different zzso sequence groups may have different biological or zzso properties, which in turn may be associated with survival in different zzso host adaptation, or zzso
