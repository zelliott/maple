Group 1 of plant zzso proteins zzso and a variety of related zzso proteins constitute a zzso of proteins that share structural zzso Little is known about their function, but all the family members identified to date are zzso zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso and are zzso as soluble proteins or are targeted to zzso Here we report the identification of a novel family member that zzso to the zzso site of the zzso system in zzso zzso After zzso zzso of isolated zzso zzso a 17 zzso protein was found associated with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso determined by zzso and molecular zzso revealed a significant zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso in zzso Interestingly, the protein remained associated with the zzso fraction in the presence of zzso zzso By mass zzso zzso was shown to be zzso zzso of zzso 1 from zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso indicating a direct interaction between these two zzso zzso together with zzso or zzso interactions at zzso pH zzso to the highly basic zzso of zzso zzso zzso could explain the strong membrane association of zzso zzso screening revealed that zzso is not zzso expressed in liver, heart or adrenal zzso High expression was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso and embryonic zzso zzso with the involvement of zzso proteins in the plant immune system, these data could indicate that zzso is involved in the immune zzso
