zzso B is a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We have used a specific zzso and Northern zzso zzso to investigate the possible synthesis of zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso The concentration of zzso zzso B in whole human zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso wet weight in males and zzso zzso zzso zzso wet weight in females zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso wet weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso wet weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso wet weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) in zzso with no apparent significant difference between the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso extracts revealed two zzso peaks, the major one of which corresponded in position to that of zzso zzso and a later minor peak to the position of the zzso zzso zzso On fast protein liquid zzso zzso zzso again zzso in two peaks, a minor peak corresponding to the synthetic zzso B standard, and a major more zzso peak which was the big zzso B zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso from human zzso revealed the presence of a zzso band of between 750 and zzso base zzso These results suggest that zzso B is zzso in the human zzso zzso where it may be of importance in the regulation of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso condition is not associated with abnormal levels of this zzso
