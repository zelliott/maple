A computer program, which runs on zzso personal computers, is described that assists in the design of synthetic genes coding for zzso The goal of the program is the design of a gene which zzso contains as many unique restriction sites as possible and zzso uses a specific zzso zzso The gene designed according to the criteria above is zzso suitable for zzso zzso experiments and zzso zzso for zzso The program zzso protein sequences into zzso DNA zzso generates a map of potential restriction sites and locates sequence positions where unique restriction sites can be zzso The zzso acid sequence is then zzso according to a specific zzso usage to remove any zzso zzso restriction sites, if potentially present, can be zzso into the zzso zzso acid sequence by using zzso zzso assigned to different restriction zzso
