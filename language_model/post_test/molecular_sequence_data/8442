zzso class II molecules associate with zzso chain zzso during zzso If zzso folding of class II zzso interferes with their association with zzso and is involved in their zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes two zzso zzso and zzso The role of these zzso has been studied in zzso only in inappropriate zzso zzso To circumvent this problem, we have generated zzso zzso mice zzso zzso which express exclusively the zzso and zzso zzso Low level expression of zzso or zzso is not sufficient for rescuing high levels of cell surface class II zzso However, low levels of the typical compact zzso zzso indicative of tight zzso binding are zzso Thus, both zzso participate in class II folding and zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso retrieve the zzso T cell population, which is reduced in the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the immune response to protein zzso is restored by both zzso
