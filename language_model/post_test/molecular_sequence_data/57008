The zzso gene encodes a zzso membrane protein in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a crucial member of this zzso complex and is believed to function as an zzso of signal zzso in a manner analogous to that of the zzso components of the T cell zzso zzso We have isolated a full-length human zzso zzso clone by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that there is an extremely high degree of evolutionary conservation between the human and mouse zzso particularly in the zzso and zzso regions, where the identity is zzso In addition, the zzso region in both proteins contains an identical zzso motif that is present in a number of molecules involved in zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of human cell lines zzso with both zzso and human zzso zzso gives patterns consistent with a zzso gene occupying a small region of the zzso zzso Using human zzso zzso DNA, we have localized the zzso gene to human zzso zzso via zzso in zzso zzso zzso is the first gene localized to this area of the zzso Interestingly, a subset of human B cell chronic zzso zzso zzso has zzso in this locus on zzso zzso
