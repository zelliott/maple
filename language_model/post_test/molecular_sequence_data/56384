zzso of tissue zzso in human zzso has been suggested by previous studies using zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this potent biological factor by zzso would be of marked significance in the inflammatory zzso The present study zzso the zzso chain reaction following reverse zzso generation of total zzso zzso to demonstrate the presence of tissue zzso zzso in the human zzso In addition, use of zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of zzso for the zzso zzso but not for the zzso gene product or the gene for zzso zzso These results confirm that tissue zzso is present in zzso and may be zzso as part of the inflammatory zzso
