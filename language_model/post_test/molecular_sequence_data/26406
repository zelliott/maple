We have previously identified and characterized a zzso from zzso that zzso insulin and transforming growth zzso but not zzso growth factor, at zzso zzso On the basis of zzso properties and zzso zzso this zzso was identified as the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We now report the cloning and sequencing of the zzso coding for the zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates that the zzso is translated from a zzso transcript similar in size to one of the two human zzso zzso The gene for the zzso has been mapped to zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso is very similar to that of the human zzso and both zzso share limited but significant identity with the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso studies based upon zzso degradation products, and zzso zzso have suggested that the zzso can initiate cellular insulin degradation in zzso zzso To determine whether zzso expressed in zzso cells can also degrade insulin, we zzso the zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cells showed increased zzso activity, demonstrating that the zzso can be functionally expressed in zzso zzso These results indicate that the properties of the zzso are zzso zzso
