zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso have been shown to be essential for proper zzso zzso Recent studies have also suggested that although the zzso plays an apparent role in zzso zzso other zzso structural zzso are zzso The objective was to explore the role of the zzso zzso in the regulation of calcium zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso studies were carried out using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that lacks the zzso CT zzso zzso progress was monitored via changes in solution zzso zzso zzso formed were characterized using zzso selected area electron zzso and zzso In controls, zzso calcium zzso was initially formed and subsequently transformed to randomly oriented zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the control, zzso stabilized zzso formation for zzso day, while zzso accelerated the transformation of zzso to zzso but had little effect on crystal shape or zzso In conclusion, the zzso domain found in zzso as in zzso appears to have the capacity to interact with forming calcium zzso mineral zzso zzso suggest that the zzso domain of zzso may play a direct role in early stages of zzso zzso
