zzso infection of barley and zzso particularly by the zzso species, is a direct cause of spontaneous zzso of beer, referred to as zzso We have shown previously that small zzso zzso zzso act as zzso factors in zzso The aim of our present study was to isolate and characterize zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and related zzso We generated profile hidden zzso models zzso zzso for the zzso classes zzso zzso and II from the multiple sequence alignments of their known members available in public domain zzso We searched the published zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso The best matching sequences and the corresponding genes were isolated from zzso zzso and the related species zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso One each of the putative zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes were expressed in the zzso host zzso zzso The proteins corresponding to the genes were zzso and identified as zzso and named zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of these zzso were observed to induce vigorous beer zzso
