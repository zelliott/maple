Taking advantage of highly zzso zzso present in the zzso gene from zzso coli and zzso zzso we designed zzso zzso zzso corresponding to these zzso These zzso were used as zzso in zzso in order to amplify DNA sequences from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso product was used as a probe to recover zzso fragments from a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence zzso of the cloned zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso indicated that the deduced gene product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso acids zzso with a deduced molecular weight zzso of zzso zzso of this zzso sequence to the corresponding sequences from zzso coli and zzso zzso revealed a high degree of conservation and suggested that the zzso zzso zzso zzso has putative zzso binding zzso
