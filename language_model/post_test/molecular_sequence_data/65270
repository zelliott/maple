zzso in zzso systems to study the life cycle of zzso C virus zzso were recently developed for zzso zzso zzso which has unique replication capacity in zzso zzso We developed zzso zzso zzso containing the structural genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso and all or part of zzso of the zzso zzso strain zzso that, after zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso produced infectious zzso Compared with the zzso control virus, production of viruses was zzso However, efficient spread of infection and high zzso zzso and zzso zzso were obtained in serial zzso zzso analysis of recovered viruses and subsequent reverse genetic studies revealed a vital dependence on one or two zzso zzso depending on the zzso zzso zzso of zzso viruses was zzso zzso The zzso 4 cell culture systems permit functional analyses as well as drug and vaccine research on an increasingly important zzso in the Middle East, Africa, and zzso We also developed zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso with vital zzso in zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrated high zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso patient zzso zzso Furthermore, availability of zzso viruses with envelope proteins of the six major zzso zzso permitted zzso zzso zzso and zzso serum zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso will be of importance for future studies of zzso zzso and accelerate the development of passive and active zzso
