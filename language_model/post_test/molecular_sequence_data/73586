zzso of the zzso catalyze the zzso of closed complexes between this zzso and a zzso to open complexes in a reaction that depends upon zzso of a zzso zzso The zzso normally bind to DNA sites with the properties of zzso enhancers and contact the zzso by means of DNA loop zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso forms of the zzso nitrogen regulatory protein C zzso that lack one zzso of the zzso zzso zzso motif or the entire motif retain residual capacity to activate zzso from solution, despite the fact that they are largely unable to zzso and have greatly decreased ability to zzso zzso We show that substitution of zzso for three zzso zzso in the second zzso of the zzso yields a stable, zzso form of zzso defective in zzso Like zzso forms with deletions of one or both zzso the zzso protein failed to bind DNA in a sensitive affinity zzso zzso indicating that its affinity for a strong zzso was reduced by at least zzso (The zzso detected zzso by two zzso forms of zzso with single zzso acid zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein had normal zzso activity in solution but, unlike the activity of the zzso zzso zzso which could be zzso at least tenfold by an zzso carrying a strong zzso the zzso activity of the zzso zzso protein was not zzso At zzso of 100 zzso or greater, the zzso zzso protein activated zzso from the major zzso zzso In agreement with the fact that it did not show zzso zzso in other zzso its ability to activate zzso was no greater on templates carrying the zzso zzso than on templates lacking an zzso The results indicate that both roles of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the formation of an active zzso of zzso can be zzso if the protein is present at high zzso in zzso
