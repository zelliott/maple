New zzso (N zzso 24) for the amplification and sequencing of the complete or near complete zzso zzso DNA, about 1000 zzso of the control region, 390 zzso of zzso zzso I, and the near complete zzso b are zzso The zzso zzso DNA zzso successfully amplify DNA in zzso other zzso successfully amplify DNA in zzso and other zzso An overview of published literature and sequence data banks identified 170 zzso and 96 nuclear DNA zzso that have been used or are highly likely to be useful in zzso zzso zzso their locations within zzso and sequence location and identity in zzso and human and/or mouse are presented for each zzso The utility of each primer was estimated by identifying the zzso yet most inclusive, zzso category within which each primer has been zzso zzso from all published sources are mapped zzso We hope that these new zzso as well as the list of zzso that have been useful in zzso will encourage further systematic and population genetic studies of zzso
