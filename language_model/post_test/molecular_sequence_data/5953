The process of zzso which occurs in the gastrointestinal zzso is greatly amplified and accelerated during the zzso adaptation which occurs in the residual zzso after massive small zzso zzso zzso As with growth and development, these processes must involve the coordinated regulation of many zzso Several families of nuclear proteins are known to be involved in the control of gene expression during development including the zzso zzso their expression has not been characterized in the gastrointestinal tract during normal cellular renewal or adaptation, and zzso zzso zzso were cloned from zzso zzso Three known genes were zzso zzso zzso and zzso but no novel members of this gene family were zzso The zzso sequence for rat zzso differs from that previously zzso zzso is relatively zzso expressed with increased expression during both development and zzso zzso expression of zzso was zzso zzso exhibits limited expression in the adult gastrointestinal tract but may play a role in the fetal gastrointestinal zzso
