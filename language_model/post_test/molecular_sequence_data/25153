We present a general model for the evolution of zzso satellite DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso with two zzso zzso of 12 zzso zzso and 6 zzso zzso zzso types zzso and zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso is zzso by two distinct satellite DNA families designed zzso and zzso zzso is a diverse satellite family of the zzso zzso of which certain members with a 100 zzso repeat unit are found to occur at the zzso regions of each zzso zzso while others are zzso zzso clone zzso zzso a higher order repeat zzso which zzso specifically to zzso zzso zzso is a homogeneous satellite occurring at the zzso zzso regions of all zzso zzso DNA sequence analyses showed that all clones investigated are built up from a 14 zzso repeat unit which is highly zzso In zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso revealed a distinct spatial arrangement of the zzso zzso zzso
