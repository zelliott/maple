In order to obtain zzso clones coding for zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed utilizing the zzso sequences of known zzso and were used to amplify partial zzso fragments from liver zzso Five new zzso genes were zzso Three of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assigned to the zzso zzso found previously in fish and zzso The other two zzso zzso and zzso were quite similar to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso two full-length zzso clones corresponding to zzso and zzso were isolated and zzso The zzso zzso designated as zzso and zzso had open reading frames zzso proteins of zzso and 520 zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the expression of zzso was limited to the liver, zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was expressed zzso
