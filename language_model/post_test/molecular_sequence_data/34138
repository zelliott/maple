The zzso zzso dog offers a unique mechanism for studying the zzso of elite athletic zzso They are a group of mixed breed dogs, comprised of multiple common breeds, and a unique breed entity seen only as a part of the zzso dog zzso zzso zzso dogs are divided into 2 primary groups as determined by their racing zzso zzso dogs are capable of running over 1000 miles in 10 days, whereas sprint dogs run much shorter zzso approximately 30 miles, but in faster times, that is, zzso zzso Finding the genes that distinguish these 2 types of performers is likely to illuminate genetic contributors to human athletic zzso In this study, we tested for association between zzso in 2 candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso and myostatin zzso and enhanced speed and endurance performance in 174 zzso zzso zzso We observed 81 novel genetic zzso within the zzso gene and 4 within the zzso zzso including a zzso within the zzso gene that significantly zzso value zzso zzso zzso distinguished the sprint versus distance zzso
