The key zzso acid zzso that influence the function of the zzso zzso iron response regulator protein zzso ) were zzso Several zzso zzso proteins containing zzso in zzso acids corresponding to candidate zzso and zzso sites were zzso The ability of the zzso proteins to repress the promoter of the membrane bound zzso zzso gene was investigated using a zzso fusion zzso A single zzso at zzso zzso significantly decreased the repressive activity of zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis revealed the importance of zzso zzso the zzso motif zzso zzso and zzso and zzso for the zzso function of zzso zzso zzso is essential for the iron responsiveness of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso proteins showed differential abilities to complement the zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso
