Recently we found that the human zzso zzso cell zzso protein zzso interacts with the cell cycle control protein zzso and zzso this protein to the nucleus where it exerts its zzso checkpoint zzso Here we have successfully isolated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso encodes a 211 zzso acid protein that is highly zzso to human zzso thus pointing to an important function for this protein in higher zzso The full-length zzso zzso encodes a 544 zzso acid zzso zzso this protein contains an zzso region distinct from that in mouse and human, whereas the zzso region is highly zzso Northern zzso and zzso analyses revealed a relatively low expression of both zzso and zzso in most zzso zzso However, an abundant expression was observed in zzso and zzso indicating a role in zzso division zzso zzso and zzso analyses revealed that, despite its distinct zzso zzso the zzso is still capable of interacting with zzso and of shuttling this protein to the zzso zzso the well-established animal model zzso zzso can be used as a powerful system to study in detail the role of zzso and zzso in the intricate processes of cell cycle zzso
