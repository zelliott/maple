zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso zzso widely distributed throughout the zzso It is involved in the regulation of various zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso motor activity, brain development, zzso survival, inflammation and zzso Since little is known about its distribution in humans, our aim was to examine zzso in human zzso Furthermore, based on the presence of zzso zzso zzso structurally the closest to zzso in milk and zzso and its receptors in the zzso zzso our aim was to study zzso in human zzso 

The presence of zzso was determined by mass zzso in plasma samples from healthy male and female volunteers zzso zzso as well as in plasma and milk samples from zzso women zzso zzso zzso concentration was measured with a specific and sensitive zzso 

Our results revealed that zzso is present in human zzso its concentration is relatively stable in healthy volunteers and it is not significantly altered by zzso age, food intake or hormonal cycle in zzso However, zzso plasma levels significantly increased in zzso women having zzso month-old zzso Moreover, this study is the first which provides evidence for the presence of zzso in the human milk with levels zzso greater in the milk zzso than in the respective plasma zzso 

We found zzso in human plasma and its increase during the first 6 months of the zzso zzso A zzso nearly zzso higher concentration of this zzso was detected in human zzso Based on the literature, several important actions of zzso zzso can be suggested such as zzso zzso zzso zzso transfer as well as regulation of zzso of certain zzso of the zzso The novelty of the present descriptive data provides a basis for further investigations on the mechanism of zzso zzso in human milk and its functional zzso
