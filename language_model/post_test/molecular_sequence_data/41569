The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain of the giant muscle protein zzso is thought to be an zzso zzso zzso zzso Various observations suggest, however, that the domain may not be completely devoid of internal interactions and structural zzso To test the zzso of random zzso models for zzso we determined the mean zzso distances of an zzso and a zzso synthetic zzso zzso calculated from the efficiency of the zzso resonance energy transfer zzso between an zzso intrinsic zzso donor and a zzso added zzso zzso zzso obtained in zzso and zzso zzso We find that the zzso zzso of mean zzso distance deviates from predictions of a purely statistical zzso zzso Furthermore, the addition of zzso zzso zzso whereas the addition of salt increased the zzso efficiency, pointing at the disruption of zzso zzso zzso temperature between 10 and zzso increased the zzso zzso efficiency in both peptides but with different zzso indicating that their elasticity and zzso stability are zzso zzso suggest that whereas the short zzso zzso displays an overall random structure, the long zzso zzso retains zzso loose zzso zzso zzso in the local structure and dynamics of the zzso domain may play a role in the zzso of passive muscle zzso
