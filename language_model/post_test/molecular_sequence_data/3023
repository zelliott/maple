The zzso zzso zzso protein regulates zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by binding in a zzso zzso manner to specific sites on zzso zzso and stabilizing a secondary structure of the downstream zzso that favors termination of zzso The high-resolution structure of zzso zzso was used to guide zzso zzso of 12 zzso acid zzso that were thought likely to be involved in the binding of zzso zzso zzso were constructed and evaluated for their effects on regulation of zzso genes in zzso and their zzso zzso activity, which is zzso by zzso zzso A substantial fraction of the zzso zzso proteins did not have native structures, but eight zzso zzso were zzso and characterized zzso for their zzso zzso activity and for their ability to bind zzso zzso in zzso On the basis of these studies zzso zzso zzso and zzso were implicated in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also likely to be involved in zzso zzso but zzso substitution zzso in these zzso may have altered their zzso interactions zzso zzso was implicated in zzso regulation, but a specific role in zzso binding could not be demonstrated because the zzso zzso protein could not be zzso in native zzso The results confirm a role in zzso binding of a positively charged face of zzso previously identified from the zzso zzso The zzso binding zzso lie in two sequence segments that are zzso in zzso proteins from many zzso
