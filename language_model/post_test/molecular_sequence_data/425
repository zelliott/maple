zzso zzso is a class zzso plant zzso in green algae zzso zzso and responsible for fast zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibits the fastest sliding movement of zzso at 60 zzso as observed so far, zzso of the zzso speed of zzso It has some distinct properties differing from those of muscle zzso Although knowledge about zzso zzso is very limited at present, we have tried to zzso functional bases of its characteristics by comparing with those of other zzso In particular, we have built the putative atomic model of zzso zzso by using the zzso modeling system and zzso Based on the putative structure of zzso zzso zzso we have analyzed the relationship between structure and function of zzso zzso to understand its distinct properties from various aspects by referring to the accumulated knowledge on zzso and structural properties of other classes of myosin, particularly animal and zzso zzso zzso We will also discuss the functional significance of zzso zzso in a living zzso
