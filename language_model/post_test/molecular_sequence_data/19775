zzso zzso zzso forms a symbiotic relationship with zzso zzso to produce zzso root zzso under zzso zzso By screening its zzso zzso library, a zzso in the zzso gene was found to form zzso on zzso zzso Its effect was further confirmed by zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that the zzso gene encodes a deduced protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso contains a putative signal zzso 11 zzso zzso and an zzso zzso domain, which locates on the zzso membrane and is necessary to zzso zzso Plant studies showed that the zzso gene zzso formed ineffective zzso and this symbiotic zzso was linked to abnormal zzso zzso
