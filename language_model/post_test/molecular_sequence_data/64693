zzso are a family of zzso that alert the immune system against viral infections of host zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact with specific cellular receptors and stimulate the production of second zzso leading to the expression of zzso and zzso zzso We report in this study that zzso stimulates the expression of a novel gene that encodes a protein with zzso zzso acid sequence identity with zzso the founding member of the newly formed zzso zzso zzso We named this protein zzso zzso zzso because its expression in zzso cells is zzso by zzso zzso zzso is expressed in virtually all zzso and the highest level of expression is zzso in zzso zzso zzso cultured zzso and the zzso Interestingly, although the expression of zzso zzso is not significantly different in resting zzso cells, it is markedly elevated in activated zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso migration and zzso Taken together, these results raise the possibility that this novel zzso has zzso zzso
