zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso is a serious disease of tobacco in North and South zzso In contrast, the disease rarely occurs on tobacco in Georgia and Florida, although bacterial zzso is a common problem on zzso We investigated whether this difference in disease zzso could be explained by qualitative characteristics of zzso gene zzso in the zzso zzso population in the zzso United zzso zzso analysis established that zzso zzso has a zzso open reading zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of zzso from 139 zzso zzso strains generated either zzso or approximately zzso DNA zzso zzso that zzso a hypersensitive reaction zzso on tobacco contained the zzso zzso and were zzso on tomato and zzso on zzso All zzso strains generated a approximately zzso DNA fragment, and wilted both tomato and zzso The DNA sequence of zzso in six zzso strains revealed the presence of one of two putative miniature zzso zzso elements zzso a zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso or a zzso zzso between zzso 461 and zzso or zzso and zzso Southern analysis suggested that the zzso zzso is unique to strains from the zzso United States and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were present in strains from 96 and zzso of North and South Carolina sites, respectively, and only in 13 and zzso of the sites in Georgia and Florida, zzso Introduction of the zzso zzso on a zzso into four zzso strains reduced their zzso on both tobacco and zzso zzso of zzso in an zzso zzso strain, resulted in a zzso that was zzso virulent on zzso Thus, the zzso of bacterial zzso of tobacco in the zzso United States is partially explained by which zzso zzso dominates the local zzso zzso zzso
