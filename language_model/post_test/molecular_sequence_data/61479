A zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced by employing a zzso zzso zzso on the basis of the zzso acid sequence deduced from zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso zzso cells that zzso reacted with the zzso zzso corresponded to those positively stained with an zzso against human zzso zzso The zzso was used for the development of a specific and sensitive zzso zzso for the measurement of zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of variation were zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and adult zzso or medium in which zzso zzso cells were zzso yielded zzso zzso that were parallel to the standard zzso zzso zzso growth hormone, zzso hormone, zzso hormone, and zzso derived from zzso hormones did not react in this zzso zzso zzso in the zzso culture medium was confirmed to exist in the form of zzso coupled with the zzso by an zzso experiment using the zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso released from zzso cells into the medium was also confirmed to possess a considerable activity in stimulating the release of zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso The effects of zzso hormones such as zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso and zzso hormone zzso on the release of zzso by dispersed anterior zzso cells of the zzso larvae and adults were also zzso zzso markedly zzso the release of zzso from both adult and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso moderately zzso the release of zzso from adult zzso cells but not from the zzso zzso This is the first report on the development of an zzso for zzso zzso which has provided the direct evidence that the release of zzso from the zzso zzso is enhanced by the zzso releasing hormones such as zzso zzso and zzso
