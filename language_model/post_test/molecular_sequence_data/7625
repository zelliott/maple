We have previously reported new zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the Japanese laboratory mouse strains zzso and zzso Here we show by zzso analysis that both zzso and zzso zzso with very slow deletion of T cells bearing V beta zzso The zzso sequences of the open reading frames in the 3' long terminal repeats of zzso and zzso were very similar to those of zzso mouse zzso tumor virus C4 zzso and zzso which zzso V beta zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso female mice carrying zzso but not zzso were found to be able to produce zzso zzso which can vigorously stimulate V beta zzso T cells after local injection in zzso in an zzso zzso On the other hand, mice carrying zzso but not zzso could not produce such an zzso in zzso The zzso sequences of zzso open reading frame were completely matched with those of zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso but not zzso is capable of producing a zzso virus of which the zzso stimulates V beta zzso T zzso
