zzso an zzso hybrid zzso is generated when female wheat lines are zzso with zzso from zzso We have investigated the zzso DNA zzso and the expression of a total of 11 different zzso zzso varying in their nuclear and zzso zzso In Southern zzso using zzso zzso to the upstream zzso zzso zzso fragments characteristic of both wheat and rye zzso can be detected in all zzso lines zzso In addition, clones isolated zzso a zzso zzso library exhibit either a zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso By zzso zzso four different zzso gene copies were identified in zzso three of which zzso to maternal zzso or paternal zzso zzso zzso Three percent of all clones represent a novel type, that might have arisen by zzso zzso Although these data suggest zzso inheritance of zzso in zzso zzso zzso gene copies can also be detected in maternal wheat zzso Their zzso as zzso by competitive zzso is about zzso of total zzso gene zzso The high abundance of zzso sequences in the F1 hybrid might therefore be due to either the transmission of rye zzso in the zzso cross and/or the amplification of sequences in zzso that persist in zzso amounts in zzso These data suggest that amplification and zzso of zzso zzso molecules are affected by different nuclear zzso Interestingly, sequence analysis of zzso zzso clones indicates a selective zzso of zzso zzso gene copies in zzso zzso gene expression may therefore possess mechanisms to compensate for the variation of zzso zzso
