zzso zzso convergence or zzso a common occurrence in zzso tends to obscure recognition of zzso relationships among zzso widespread zzso zzso with either enclosed underground zzso or exposed zzso fruit bodies, that often establish zzso interactions with zzso zzso Focusing on zzso zzso commonly known as zzso we zzso the zzso zzso from nine species belonging to three different families zzso zzso and zzso A data set consisting of zzso secondary zzso sites, including 24 zzso sequences from the zzso DNA database and using three reconstruction methods, was employed to zzso zzso in an zzso ranging from the zzso to the zzso zzso As revealed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso represent a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso within zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso constitute together with zzso a distinct zzso zzso zzso within zzso The lack of zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso strongly supports the zzso of the latter zzso to the original zzso zzso zzso Within zzso which are sister to the highly evolved zzso the zzso zzso cannot be considered zzso if zzso is zzso The zzso of zzso and other relationships that were not supported by high zzso values, nor zzso by zzso evidence, were supported by a parallel analysis of the faster evolving internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso zzso episodes of fruit body zzso shifts are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In all cases, the shift from an zzso to a zzso form is the most zzso interpretation of character zzso without any instance of character zzso
