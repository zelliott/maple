zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso salt lake in zzso China, and were subjected to zzso zzso The cells of both strains were zzso and growth required at least 10 % zzso zzso The cellular polar lipids were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were different in that strain zzso did not require zzso and had strong ability to zzso zzso for growth, whereas strain zzso required zzso and did not zzso zzso zzso or zzso for zzso Both strain zzso and strain zzso were most closely related to members of the zzso zzso and zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso zzso especially their cellular polar zzso the two zzso were assigned to the zzso zzso Moreover, the DNA zzso values for strains zzso and zzso with respect to members of the zzso zzso were found to be well below 70 zzso Thus, strains zzso and zzso represent two novel species within the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso are zzso
