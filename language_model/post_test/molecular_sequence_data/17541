A gene from zzso zzso that is expressed specifically in the nervous system beginning at the stage of neural plate formation has been isolated and several zzso have been zzso The sequence of the predicted protein contains two copies of a presumed zzso domain, each of which includes two short zzso motifs characteristic for zzso zzso called the zzso and zzso consensus zzso We name this gene zzso zzso for nervous zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons suggest that the zzso protein is a zzso nuclear zzso zzso but it is clearly distinct from previously reported zzso proteins such as the zzso zzso and C1 zzso zzso zzso zzso an alternative zzso event giving rise to two predicted protein zzso that differ from each other by seven zzso zzso In zzso zzso to zzso brain shows that the zzso gene is expressed in the zzso zone where cell proliferation takes zzso The occurrence of an zzso protein with nervous zzso expression suggests that it may be involved in the zzso control of zzso zzso
