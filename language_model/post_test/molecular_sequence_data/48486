zzso and structural properties of zzso from zzso zzso whose zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso and of zzso missing either the first 20 zzso zzso acids zzso zzso or the first 33 zzso zzso acids zzso loop of 20 zzso acids and a zzso zzso preceding the zzso fold zzso zzso zzso have been zzso In keeping with the zzso zzso crystal structure, here reported at zzso resolution, which shows an increased exposure of the zzso zzso to the zzso the analysis of zzso binding zzso highlights high accessibility of zzso to the zzso pocket in zzso zzso CO binding to zzso zzso displays a marked zzso behavior, with a fast binding process close to that observed in zzso and a slow zzso process, characterized by a zzso zzso zzso removal of the first 33 zzso zzso a substantial zzso of the overall zzso structure, with loss of zzso content and potential partial collapse of the protein zzso As such, zzso binding zzso are characterized by very slow rates that are independent of zzso zzso this being indicative of a high energy barrier for zzso access to the zzso possibly due to localized zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
