The zzso sequence and zzso organization of zzso zzso zzso zzso the structural gene for zzso zzso zzso and zzso the structural gene for the zzso zzso have been zzso zzso and zzso are organized as a single zzso transcribed from the same start site, under conditions of both nitrogen limitation and nitrogen zzso This start site may be used by two different promoters since the expression of a zzso fusion was high in the presence of zzso and enhanced under conditions of nitrogen limitation in the zzso zzso The increase was not observed in zzso or zzso zzso In addition, this fusion was zzso under both growth conditions, in the zzso zzso strain, suggesting that zzso zzso regulates its own zzso A DNA zzso similar to a zzso promoter consensus, was found in the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso seems to be transcribed from a zzso promoter that operates under conditions of nitrogen limitation and from another zzso promoter in the presence of zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso strains zzso their zzso in the zzso state, but only the zzso zzso zzso for zzso does not zzso molecular nitrogen for zzso The level of zzso zzso is not affected in the zzso zzso as compared to that in the wild zzso Under symbiotic conditions, the zzso and zzso zzso strains induced zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first example in zzso zzso of a protein required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation but zzso in bacteria growing in the zzso zzso
