zzso protein interaction is characterized by cycles of association and zzso We present evidence which indicates that during zzso protein interaction, the zzso tail of the G protein gamma zzso which is masked in the beta gamma complex, is exposed and establishes zzso contact with the zzso This potential zzso switch provides a mechanism to regulate zzso protein zzso This switch may also be significant for the role of the beta gamma complex in regulation of zzso zzso
