zzso proteins zzso are found in many marine fish and have been classified into five zzso zzso zzso types zzso and the zzso zzso Type I zzso are zzso partially zzso zzso zzso The winter zzso zzso zzso produces two type I zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso that are zzso by distinct gene families with different zzso zzso zzso and zzso share a high level of identity even though the zzso have approximately half the activity of the zzso zzso zzso based on two representative zzso and zzso were generated to examine the role of the zzso in zzso zzso Through systematic exchange of N and C zzso between zzso and zzso the zzso were determined to be the major zzso agents for the variation in activity levels between the two zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso possessed greater zzso ability compared with their zzso zzso The observed 50% difference in activity between zzso and zzso can be divided into approximately zzso for differences at each zzso and approximately zzso for differences in the zzso Furthermore, the N zzso was determined to be the most critical component for zzso zzso
