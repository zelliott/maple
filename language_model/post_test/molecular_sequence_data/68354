The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso that is located upstream of, and zzso with, the zzso zzso The zzso coding region of zzso is derived from a conventional zzso zzso zzso while the origin of the remainder of the sequence is zzso We show that an apparently functional copy of zzso is present in the pol zzso zzso indicating that the pol zzso is not caused by the absence of an intact, expressed zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso transcripts present in both sterile and zzso zzso pol zzso plants are shown to map to sequences resembling zzso zzso sites, whereas the zzso zzso of two transcripts specific to restored lines map to sequences which resemble neither one another nor zzso promoter zzso It is suggested that the complex zzso transcript pattern of zzso plants is generated by a combination of multiple zzso initiation and processing events and that the nuclear zzso gene acts to specifically alter zzso transcripts by affecting zzso zzso Northern analyses demonstrate that the effect of the zzso gene on zzso transcripts is not tissue or zzso zzso However, the expression of the zzso region is zzso regulated in pol plants, resulting in decreased levels of zzso zzso transcripts in floral tissue relative to zzso It is suggested that this zzso regulation may be related to the absence of overt zzso effects of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
