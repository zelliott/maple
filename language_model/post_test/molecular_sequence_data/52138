We have previously identified the gene (the zzso zzso defective in the zzso and zzso outer membrane zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and shown that this gene is analogous to the zzso coli gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Others have tentatively implicated zzso in a different function, zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso in the zzso outer membrane zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso Ito, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1988) is due to a zzso in zzso this zzso changed zzso zzso from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso was completely reverted by plasmids containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso or an identical zzso zzso prepared by localized zzso under the control of zzso zzso partial zzso zzso studies with plasmids carrying various zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene indicated that the ability of these plasmids to complement the zzso zzso was similar to their ability to complement the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso closely resembled that of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was zzso to zzso antibiotics and zzso antibiotics against which the intact outer membrane is an effective zzso zzso As previously demonstrated with the zzso zzso the outer membrane of the zzso zzso became selectively zzso after incubation for 1 h at the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and less than zzso of the zzso marker zzso were released into the zzso All of these findings are consistent with our concept that zzso is an essential gene involved in generation of the outer zzso
