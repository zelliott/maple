We have previously described a zzso of zzso zzso leukemia cells zzso selected in a low level of zzso which zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso and exhibits a zzso at the locus zzso this zzso zzso clones containing the entire zzso DNA from both zzso and zzso were isolated and zzso zzso analysis indicates that, with exception of the zzso the zzso locus in both cell lines is zzso The zzso in zzso results from the zzso of an zzso A particle zzso in the head-to-head zzso orientation 72 base pairs zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso The zzso likely provides an alternative promoter for zzso expression which may produce a novel transcript with enhanced zzso zzso of the zzso appears to zzso or relocate normal zzso regulatory sequences as expression of the zzso transcript in zzso is not regulated by the folate status of the zzso
