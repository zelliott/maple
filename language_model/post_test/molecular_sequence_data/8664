Four zzso zzso of zzso zzso defective in the synthesis of zzso zzso were zzso by a gene from that species, which is similar to the zzso regulator, zzso of zzso zzso It was confirmed that this zzso zzso zzso which we term zzso like zzso zzso its own zzso as well as that of zzso and zzso two zzso involved in zzso The sequence of zzso suggested that it might bind to a transition metal and its zzso abilities were shown to require zzso in the zzso repression was also enhanced with increasing levels of zzso Certain zzso zzso in which its 3' end was removed were zzso zzso when plasmids containing such zzso forms of the gene were introduced into zzso zzso zzso the zzso were zzso Such effects were also seen in a wide range of bacteria, including zzso coli and zzso Several zzso that were zzso by zzso also accumulated zzso suggesting a zzso in zzso zzso
