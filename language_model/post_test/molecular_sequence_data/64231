A search of the recently completed zzso database of rice zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso This first report of a complete zzso family from a zzso species reveals that the zzso family is comparable in size with that of the zzso zzso zzso which consists of 33 zzso zzso This is surprising because zzso the specific zzso of zzso is considerably less abundant in cell walls of zzso than zzso and is not typically ascribed an important structural role in zzso As a first step toward determining the roles of rice zzso the expression patterns of all 29 zzso genes were examined using a quantitative DNA zzso procedure with zzso zzso zzso The analysis showed that most members of the rice zzso family exhibited zzso and growth zzso zzso This was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse zzso chain reaction analysis of representative zzso zzso This revealed in more detail the temporally and zzso controlled expression profiles of individual zzso genes at particular sites in zzso Previous reports indicated that grasses have relatively greater zzso zzso activities, one of the two zzso activities zzso by zzso than in equivalent zzso in zzso This zzso together with the zzso and growth zzso expression of a large rice zzso gene family, suggests that zzso metabolism plays a more central role in zzso cell wall restructuring than has been reported zzso
