The zzso coli zzso contains two opposed sets of zzso DNA replication pause zzso sites that, according to the replication fork trap theory, control the termination of zzso replication by restricting replication fork fusion to the zzso zzso In contrast, a recent hypothesis suggested that termination occurs at the zzso locus zzso Using two-dimensional zzso gel zzso we examined DNA replication zzso at the zzso sites and at zzso in zzso zzso Two definitive signatures of zzso zzso replication fork arrest and zzso replication zzso clearly detected at zzso sites, but not at zzso We also detected a significant pause during the latter stages of replication fork convergence at zzso zzso zzso of fork pausing at the zzso sites in both their native zzso context and the zzso context further supported the fork trap zzso
