One of the mechanisms by which zzso zzso acid zzso has been shown to suppress the growth of zzso zzso zzso cells involves an increase in the zzso of zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of tumor zzso This increase in zzso of zzso by zzso results from increased stability of zzso protein as a result of an increase in zzso of the protein by the zzso zzso zzso We show that upon zzso treatment, zzso interacts with the zzso zzso and specifically zzso two zzso zzso and zzso adjacent to zzso and zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso studies reveal that zzso can form a complex with the nuclear transport zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding to the same zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso and zzso results in zzso of zzso in the zzso Our studies suggest that one mechanism by which zzso treatment of zzso cells zzso zzso arrest involves the recruitment of zzso to the zzso of zzso resulting in the zzso of the zzso and zzso adjacent to the zzso and the subsequent interaction of zzso with zzso leading to transport of the zzso to the nucleus where it zzso zzso zzso
