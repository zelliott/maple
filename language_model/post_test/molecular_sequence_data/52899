A major obstacle that limits the potential of human gene therapy is the inefficiency of gene delivery to appropriate sites in zzso Previous studies demonstrated that the zzso surveillance function performed by von zzso factor zzso could be incorporated into zzso zzso by molecular engineering of the zzso zzso envelope zzso zzso To advance the application of zzso targeting technology beyond laboratory animals, we prepared an extensive series of zzso proteins bearing modified zzso zzso sequences and assembled these zzso proteins into targeted zzso that are capable of zzso human zzso Initially, a dual envelope zzso was zzso which required zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso streamlined zzso zzso proteins were constructed wherein the zzso zzso domain of the targeting partner was replaced by the zzso zzso zzso Ultimately, an optimal construct was developed that exhibited properties of both zzso zzso zzso and near zzso zzso zzso and could be arrayed as a single envelope on a zzso zzso On zzso zzso enhanced focal zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso was demonstrated in a rat model of balloon zzso Moreover, zzso of tumor zzso zzso zzso was detected after portal vein infusion of a zzso zzso in a nude mouse model of liver zzso We conclude that the unique properties of these targeted zzso zzso zzso would be suitable for improving therapeutic gene delivery in numerous clinical applications, including vascular zzso laser and other surgical procedures, orthopedic injuries, wound healing, zzso arthritis, inflammatory disease, and zzso zzso
