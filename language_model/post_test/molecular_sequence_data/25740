The interaction of zzso zzso a fluorescent DNA zzso has been studied by using the zzso zzso zzso duplex zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that there was only a single class of binding site and that the zzso complex had a zzso constant of zzso zzso zzso X zzso M at 25 degrees zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso complex and by means of ID and zzso zzso zzso techniques the binding site was defined as the minor groove formed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso were measurable and resonance doubling occurred because of the lifting of the zzso symmetry of the zzso on zzso zzso Many individual zzso of both strands of the DNA could be assigned for the complex because of these features, along with the occurrence of slow exchange on the zzso time zzso The results of this zzso zzso solution study were compared with those of previous X-ray zzso studies of the same zzso From nuclear zzso effect data measured for the complex, a detailed three-dimensional model was constructed with the aid of molecular zzso
