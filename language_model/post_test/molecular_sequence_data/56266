The zzso members of the zzso zzso growth factor zzso family, zzso zzso zzso and basic zzso zzso are among the growth factors that act directly on vascular cells to induce zzso cell growth and zzso In zzso the role of the zzso prototypes in vascular pathology has been difficult to zzso We report here the introduction, by direct gene transfer into zzso zzso of a zzso expression zzso zzso a zzso form of zzso This zzso transgenic model defines gene function in the zzso wall in zzso zzso expression induced zzso zzso in zzso arteries 21 days after gene transfer, in contrast to control arteries zzso with an zzso coli zzso zzso Where there was substantial zzso zzso zzso formation was detected in the expanded zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso wall in zzso and, through its ability to stimulate zzso in the zzso zzso could stimulate zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene transfer of zzso could also be used as a genetic intervention to improve blood flow to zzso zzso in selected clinical zzso
