The zzso model has been refined by a Directed zzso zzso a zzso procedure which combines a zzso method of selecting zzso to be refined at each cycle with a zzso zzso routine to get the best fit for the particular selected zzso The zzso crystal structure was used as a starting zzso The experimental data were obtained by X-ray fiber zzso patterns from oriented zzso zzso After 250 cycles we were able to obtain an almost perfect fit of the calculated zzso pattern to the experimental zzso pattern as well as a reasonable zzso including zzso interactions of the zzso zzso with an zzso shift in the C zzso of zzso A from the crystal zzso The zzso of the zzso packing was calculated by molecular dynamics using the program zzso In addition, the binding site of zzso a zzso zzso from the mushroom zzso zzso could be zzso Furthermore, we were able to determine differences in the structures of zzso with and without zzso The method proved itself robust and showed a high degree of zzso
