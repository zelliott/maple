The utility of zzso to assess zzso response of zzso zzso clams from three sites of zzso zzso at the southern end of the National Park of zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso expression profiles were analyzed by zzso in soluble zzso of zzso zzso zzso Nearly 2000 zzso spots were detected in zzso gels, with focused areas in the zzso pH zzso Different protein expression signatures were found at each site, with the highest number of more intense spots in animals with the highest metal zzso zzso more intense protein spots were analyzed out by zzso trap tandem mass zzso de zzso sequencing and a zzso search for their possible zzso While sequence tags of 16 more intense protein spots were zzso including several proteins induced by zzso exposure of model organisms, only 2 proteins were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso were significantly higher in animals with the highest metal zzso Thus, we propose these two zzso zzso and zzso as novel pollution zzso
