zzso syndrome is the most common form of zzso deafness and characterized by zzso zzso hearing loss and zzso This disorder was mapped to zzso 7 and the gene causing zzso syndrome zzso was subsequently identified by zzso zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso protein designated zzso zzso is closely related to a family of zzso transport proteins that includes the rat zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and the human zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso by zzso zzso On the basis of this zzso and the presence of a slightly modified zzso signature sequence zzso its putative second zzso domain, zzso has been proposed to function as a zzso zzso We were unable to detect evidence of zzso transport following the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso or in zzso cells following infection with zzso zzso The rates of transport for zzso and zzso were significantly increased following the expression of zzso in both cell zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso functions as a zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso and may provide insight into zzso physiology and the zzso of zzso zzso
