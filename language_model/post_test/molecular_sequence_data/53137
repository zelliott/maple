zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso for the zzso zzso (also named zzso zzso has two alternatively spliced zzso in the zzso This alternative zzso event is generated by retaining of zzso 3, 81 bases in zzso in the zzso region zzso the second zzso loop of zzso A full-length rat zzso zzso has zzso zzso acid zzso However, as revealed by sequencing of rat zzso zzso DNA and zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso 3 brings in an zzso stop zzso and, therefore, creates a truncated zzso frame zzso only the zzso half of zzso (from the zzso to an alternate zzso tail zzso to the fourth zzso zzso The two alternatively spliced transcripts are zzso expressed in zzso In zzso zzso cells, the full-length zzso displays zzso and selective binding for zzso and zzso the production of zzso zzso In contrast, the truncated zzso binds zzso and other zzso peptides very poorly and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and it does not mediate any zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso Apparently, this truncated zzso does not function as a zzso for zzso or other zzso zzso Such alternative zzso to create a truncated zzso zzso might be an zzso mechanism to zzso regulate zzso zzso
