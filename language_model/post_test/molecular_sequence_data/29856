zzso I is a peripheral membrane protein of synaptic zzso that mediates their attachment to the zzso Human zzso clones containing the full coding sequence of zzso I were isolated, and the zzso were mapped and zzso Human zzso I is zzso by a single copy gene containing 13 zzso ranging in size from 58 base pairs to more than 1 zzso that are zzso distributed over more than 30 zzso of DNA on the zzso The differential zzso of the primary zzso I transcript that generates zzso zzso and zzso involves alternative use of zzso zzso sites at the last zzso zzso The primary structure of zzso I is highly zzso between the human, zzso and bovine proteins zzso zzso The zzso placement within that primary structure zzso with the previously zzso domain model of the zzso zzso I contains zzso A and B, while zzso 12 contains almost all of domain D, and zzso 13 contains the alternatively spliced zzso E and zzso zzso C, the central zzso domain implicated in the binding of zzso I to zzso and to synaptic zzso is divided into nine zzso
