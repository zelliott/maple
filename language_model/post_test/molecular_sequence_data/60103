zzso zzso occurs in mice defective in zzso a gene zzso zzso zzso proteins capable of zzso zzso intermediate filaments to zzso zzso While zzso zzso mice fail to anchor zzso zzso zzso zzso mice still zzso in the absence of zzso We report a novel neural zzso form that lacks the zzso domain and instead binds and zzso zzso This interaction is functionally zzso in mice and in zzso zzso lacking zzso display short, zzso and unstable zzso defective in zzso zzso zzso zzso neural zzso represent zzso proteins that when absent lead to devastating zzso Moreover, zzso can functionally account for the extraordinary stability of zzso zzso necessary for transport over long zzso Its zzso zzso all three zzso networks, a feature apparently central to zzso zzso
