The release of zzso proteins from the zzso is a key event in cell death signaling that is regulated by zzso family zzso For example, zzso of the zzso zzso Bid, by multiple zzso leads to the formation of truncated Bid that, in turn, promotes the zzso of zzso into the zzso outer zzso resulting in pore formation and the release of proteins residing in the zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein in the zzso is targeted to the zzso by a yet unknown zzso Several proteins of the outer zzso membrane have been proposed to act as receptors for zzso among them the zzso zzso channel, zzso and the zzso protein zzso of the outer zzso the TOM zzso zzso the unique zzso zzso zzso has been ascribed a similar zzso Here, we review recent work on the mechanisms of zzso and the targeting of zzso to the zzso and discuss the advantages and limitations of the methods used to study this zzso
