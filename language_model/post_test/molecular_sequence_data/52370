A point zzso in a highly zzso region of the beta 1 zzso zzso to Ala zzso zzso abrogates the zzso zzso binding of alpha 5 beta 1 to zzso zzso without zzso gross structure or zzso zzso The zzso zzso also interferes with binding to zzso a zzso that lacks zzso zzso In spite of the lack of zzso zzso binding by alpha 5 beta zzso it was recruited to zzso plaques formed on zzso by zzso zzso zzso Thus, intact zzso binding function is not required for recruitment of alpha 5 beta 1 to zzso zzso zzso of beta zzso partially zzso with zzso alpha 5 beta 1 function, thus defining a dominant negative beta 1 zzso zzso
