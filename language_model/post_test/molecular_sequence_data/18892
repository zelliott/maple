zzso C virus zzso has been reported to regulate cellular zzso zzso The zzso core protein is considered to be a potential zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso are largely zzso Our preliminary experiments revealed significant zzso of zzso zzso by zzso core protein in zzso zzso Through target gene prediction zzso zzso was predicted to be a potential target of zzso The present study was initiated to investigate whether zzso is zzso regulated by the zzso core zzso and involved in the regulation of the zzso proliferation of zzso zzso 

zzso levels were examined by zzso real-time zzso zzso Cell proliferation was analyzed by zzso and colony formation zzso Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow zzso zzso reporter zzso was conducted to confirm zzso zzso zzso expression was determined by real-time zzso and Western zzso 

zzso core protein significantly suppressed zzso zzso and led to significant zzso zzso with a zzso zzso promoted zzso Moreover, we validated that zzso zzso zzso while zzso mimics inhibited cell zzso zzso zzso and western zzso zzso was demonstrated to be regulated by zzso zzso activity zzso showed that while zzso mimics significantly reduced the zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso inhibitor showed no effect on zzso zzso Most notably, salvage expression of zzso after zzso core infection for 24 h almost totally reversed the zzso effect of the zzso core zzso and meanwhile, reduced the expression of both zzso zzso and protein to zzso zzso 

These findings provide important evidence that the reduced zzso expression by zzso core protein can indirectly lose an zzso effect on zzso which might, at least partially lead to cell proliferation of liver cancer zzso zzso may have a therapeutic potential to suppress liver cancer zzso
