Although influenza viruses can zzso a wide variety of birds and zzso the natural host of the virus is wild waterfowl, zzso and zzso When other species of animals, including zzso zzso zzso horses, and humans, are infected with influenza zzso they are considered zzso zzso The distinction between the normal and zzso host is important when describing virus evolution in the different host zzso The evolutionary rate of influenza virus in the natural host reservoirs is believed to be slow, while in zzso the rate is much zzso The higher rate of evolution in zzso is thought to be a result of selective pressure on the virus to adapt to an zzso host zzso zzso and turkey influenza virus zzso have previously and incorrectly been lumped together with wild waterfowl, zzso and zzso influenza viruses when determining rates of evolutionary zzso To determine zzso and evolutionary rates of a virus in any host species, two primary assumptions must be zzso first, all zzso included in the analysis must have descended from a single introduction of the virus, and second, the outbreak must continue long enough to determine a zzso For poultry, three recent outbreaks of avian influenza meet these criteria, and the sequences of the zzso and zzso genes were zzso zzso from all three outbreaks were compared to an avian influenza virus consensus zzso which at the zzso acid level is highly zzso for all the internal viral zzso The consensus sequence also provides a common point of origin to compare all influenza zzso The evolutionary rates determined for all three outbreaks were similar to what is observed in zzso providing strong evidence of adaptation of influenza to the new host species, chickens and zzso
