We have used zzso I zzso to examine the binding of five different zzso zzso to a zzso zzso tract containing four zzso zzso Although all the expected zzso formed with high affinity zzso approximately zzso zzso one zzso produced a footprint at a second site with about zzso lower zzso We have explored the nature of this secondary binding site and suggest that it arises when each end of the third strand forms a zzso triplex with adjacent regions on the duplex, generating a zzso zzso triplex with a zzso in the center of the third strand zzso This unusual binding mode was examined by use of zzso that were designed with the potential to form different length zzso zzso of various base zzso We find that zzso containing zzso zzso are generally more stable than those with zzso zzso though zzso can be formed with zzso of up to nine zzso generating complexes with zzso zzso zzso These structures are much more stable than those formed by adding two separate zzso zzso which do not generate zzso I zzso though a stable complex is generated when the two halves are zzso joined by a zzso zzso zzso zzso produces less clear zzso presumably because this zzso agent binds to triplex DNA, but confirms that the zzso can bind in unexpected zzso These results suggest that extra care needs to be taken when designing long zzso zzso so as to avoid triplex formation at shorter secondary zzso
