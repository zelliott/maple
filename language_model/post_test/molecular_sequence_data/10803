zzso related to the zzso type 1 zzso gene have been identified on several human zzso In the zzso region of zzso 14 and 15, two zzso zzso have been zzso zzso comparison between zzso zzso amplified from two zzso artificial zzso clones zzso to zzso region zzso and published zzso sequences localized at zzso suggested that a third zzso zzso resides in this zzso zzso The previous zzso of an zzso locus to the zzso part of zzso 15 could not be confirmed by zzso Our findings further support zzso spreading of partial zzso gene copies at zzso zzso during zzso
