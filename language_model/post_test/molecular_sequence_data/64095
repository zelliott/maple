The zzso gene zzso zzso island zzso is important for the zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we have compared the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso in four clinical zzso These zzso were selected from patients matched for age and sex from the same geographical zzso The patients suffered from either gastric cancer zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso All four strains induced an zzso zzso response in zzso cells and zzso zzso into host cells where the protein was zzso zzso and thus zzso a functional type IV zzso system zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso gene contains a variable region close to its 3' zzso Different compositions of this region has been proposed to exert various degrees of zzso changes in cultured gastric zzso cells, and there are indications that the structure of the repetitive region is connected to the severity of zzso One of the studied strains zzso possessed five zzso repeat regions while the other three strains zzso one zzso zzso zzso zzso also contained a major zzso or large zzso in the zzso region between zzso and zzso zzso zzso similar to that of genes zzso and zzso was found in the zzso end of this zzso The 3' end was similar to the corresponding region of strain zzso zzso including a mini zzso element and a zzso of the 3' end of the zzso zzso Finally, a novel gene was identified in the zzso zzso in three of the zzso strains at the position of zzso This zzso zzso is present in approximately half of Swedish zzso zzso zzso
