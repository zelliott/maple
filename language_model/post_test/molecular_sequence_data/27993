A major 70 zzso protein of the zzso zzso outer membrane is coded by a nuclear zzso zzso on zzso zzso and transported to the zzso outer zzso In order to investigate in detail the information necessary for zzso the 70 zzso protein at the outer zzso we have examined the zzso and zzso location of fusion proteins which consist of various lengths of the zzso region of the 70 zzso protein with an zzso active zzso The results indicate that the extreme zzso 12 zzso acids of the 70 zzso protein function as a targeting zzso whereas the subsequent zzso region (up to zzso 29) is necessary for zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, we have found that a fusion protein which contained the zzso 19 zzso acids of the 70 zzso protein is localized on the outer membrane as well as in the zzso zzso Changes in the dual zzso of this fusion protein accompanied its overproduction or expression in a zzso zzso zzso
