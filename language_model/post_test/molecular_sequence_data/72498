A single protein of 12 zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso from both the zzso spliced zzso zzso and doubly spliced zzso zzso While many full-length sequences of zzso are known, data on the zzso regions of African zzso are zzso We have undertaken to sequence the zzso gene in zzso from Central and West Africa naturally infected zzso and have compared them to known zzso sequences of zzso Our data on sequence and in zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso is a zzso acid zzso protein among zzso strains from Central and West Africa, in contrast to the zzso protein found among zzso strains around the zzso The zzso sequences of zzso exhibit a marked genetic zzso at the level of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso wheel analyses reveal that zzso of zzso in zzso zzso are zzso in contrast to zzso in zzso from zzso Although zzso and zzso show a similar putative zzso site, a second potential site was located exclusively in zzso from zzso There are differences in the predicted zzso zzso in zzso between zzso and zzso Furthermore, the secondary structure data according to the zzso and zzso zzso predict an zzso domain at the zzso zzso in zzso and this domain may be truncated in zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso shows two zzso zzso motifs zzso at the zzso zzso and in the middle region, zzso This is the first report describing the size differences in zzso protein between zzso and zzso which may provide insights into zzso mechanisms used by zzso and zzso
