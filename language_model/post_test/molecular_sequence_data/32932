Native states of proteins are flexible, zzso more than just the unique native zzso The zzso and dynamics resulting from this zzso ensemble are inherently linked to protein function and zzso zzso zzso is one feature determined by this zzso energy zzso As an attempt to investigate zzso of proteins on a zzso scale, we challenged the zzso coli zzso with extensive zzso and determined which zzso if any, have zzso their energy landscape for resistance to zzso To our surprise, multiple soluble proteins survived the zzso zzso binding zzso a zzso from zzso zzso was characterized by in zzso zzso studies to identify the physical origin of zzso zzso This experimental characterization shows that kinetic stability is responsible for the unusual resistance in zzso binding zzso The zzso functions of the identified survivors suggest that many of these proteins may have evolved extreme zzso resistance because of their critical roles under stressed zzso Our results suggest that under functional selection proteins can evolve extreme zzso resistance by modulating their zzso energy landscapes without the need to invent new zzso and that proteins can be zzso on a zzso scale according to their energetic properties by using zzso as a structural zzso
