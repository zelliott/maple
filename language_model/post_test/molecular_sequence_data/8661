zzso relationships of several species within the zzso zzso were investigated using characters from the nuclear zzso zzso zzso variation within 24 zzso including 5 soybean sudden death syndrome zzso zzso was assessed using zzso sequence data and restriction zzso length zzso zzso By these techniques, the zzso agent of soybean zzso was identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In separate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso were used for rooting zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was strongly supported by zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that this complex is composed of a number of zzso distinct species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and biological species designated as zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The results demonstrate complete zzso between biological and zzso species within the zzso zzso In addition, DNA sequence data were used to design a zzso primer pair which could specifically amplify DNA from zzso of the zzso pathogen from infected zzso
