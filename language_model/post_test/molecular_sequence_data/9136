zzso peeling skin syndrome zzso is an zzso zzso zzso characterized by lifelong, continuous shedding of the upper zzso Using zzso zzso mapping and zzso sequencing, we identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso in a large zzso family with zzso zzso type zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso which we show by zzso zzso to be expressed throughout normal zzso A zzso zzso for total zzso zzso zzso zzso comparing human zzso zzso zzso expressing wild type and zzso zzso zzso revealed decreased levels of total zzso zzso in cells expressing zzso zzso suggesting loss of zzso Western zzso revealed lower expression levels of zzso zzso zzso compared to wild type, suggesting that accelerated degradation may result in loss of function, leading to zzso type zzso This is the first report describing a zzso as the cause of zzso type zzso
