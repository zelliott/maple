The combined thickness of the zzso and media of the carotid artery zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with cardiovascular disease and zzso Previous studies indicate that carotid zzso thickness is a significantly zzso zzso but the responsible genes are largely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso whose activity regulates zzso metabolism in the liver and zzso zzso zzso in measures of zzso metabolism within the normal range have been associated with risk factors for cardiovascular zzso We performed a genetic association study in zzso members of 224 families to assess the relationship between zzso in the gene coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso and carotid zzso zzso 

Families were zzso via a zzso zzso zzso was measured using zzso zzso Single zzso zzso zzso tagging common variation in the zzso gene were zzso Association was assessed following adjustment for significant zzso including zzso cardiovascular risk zzso zzso studies to determine the effect of particular zzso on zzso were zzso 

There was evidence of association between the single zzso zzso zzso in zzso five of the zzso zzso which encodes an zzso change from zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso and mean carotid zzso thickness zzso zzso was associated with a zzso (or zzso zzso higher mean carotid zzso thickness measurement per zzso and determined zzso of the population zzso in the zzso 

Our results suggest a novel role for the zzso gene in zzso zzso
