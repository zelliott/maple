Exposure of the zzso zzso pump of human zzso to zzso led to the rapid loss of zzso zzso A zzso of about 12 zzso was removed from the zzso in 1-2 zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso showed that this zzso contains the zzso binding zzso The remainder of the zzso zzso was zzso to a number of fragments ranging from 3 to 120 zzso none of them bound zzso To isolate the zzso binding domain, zzso which had been coupled to the zzso zzso (a zzso radioactive zzso zzso was allowed to bind to the zzso zzso After zzso to couple the zzso to the zzso the zzso bond was split and the zzso removed, leaving the pump zzso zzso This pump was zzso with zzso and the products were separated by gel zzso zzso The only radioactive peak zzso at about 12 zzso was further zzso on zzso high pressure liquid zzso zzso zzso acid analysis showed the zzso to have a minimal molecular mass of zzso zzso and to contain a single zzso After attempts to sequence the zzso directly zzso zzso zzso was carried out on the labeled zzso producing both soluble and zzso labeled zzso After zzso zzso zzso of the soluble material, a single radioactive peak was zzso Its sequence was zzso see zzso A portion of this peak was passed through a zzso zzso it bound in the presence of zzso and was zzso by zzso and by a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso peak produced the same sequence as shown above, but starting at zzso and ending at zzso zzso analysis of this zzso showed that it shares features with the zzso binding zzso of other zzso which are regulated by zzso
