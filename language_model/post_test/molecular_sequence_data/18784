zzso selection, zzso formation, and zzso in most bacteria are orchestrated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is linked to splitting and segregation of an zzso chain of zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to a zzso full-length zzso zzso zzso contains a truncated zzso zzso zzso which is located adjacent to genes controlling zzso and zzso chain zzso We analyzed the role of zzso in cell division and zzso together with the full-length zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that loss of zzso has a strong effect on zzso zzso zzso which, however, could be rescued by the presence of nitrate in the zzso Fluorescence zzso revealed that zzso does not zzso with the zzso proteins zzso and zzso but is confined to zzso spots at zzso and at the cell pole, coinciding with the zzso protein zzso In zzso coli, both zzso zzso form distinct structures but zzso when zzso suggesting an zzso recruitment of zzso In zzso analyses indicate that zzso is able to interact with the zzso zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso shares key features with its full-length zzso but is involved in zzso control for zzso zzso
