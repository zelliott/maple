The zzso zzso zzso machinery consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso a zzso of zzso zzso and an zzso zzso that is structurally very similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso This constellation of factors is sufficient to assemble specifically on a zzso zzso promoter and to initiate zzso at a specific start zzso We have used this system to study the functional interaction between zzso zzso factors and zzso zzso with special emphasis on the zzso function of zzso A zzso analysis of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveals that this structure zzso rapid and apparently systematic evolution in zzso and zzso evolutionary zzso We provide a detailed analysis of these changes and discuss their possible functional zzso
