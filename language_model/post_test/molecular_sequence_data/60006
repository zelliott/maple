The zzso sequence zzso derived from the zzso sea zzso zzso protein zzso triggers fusion between zzso zzso It exhibits many similarities to viral fusion peptides and may have a corresponding function in zzso The zzso and zzso interactions of B18 are investigated here at the zzso level by electron zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso is shown to zzso into two distinctly different zzso structures, depending on the presence of zzso which controls its zzso zzso In zzso buffer the zzso per zzso assembles into zzso zzso zzso whereas in the presence of zzso it forms smooth zzso zzso When B18 per zzso is added to zzso large zzso zzso they become visibly disrupted by the zzso but no genuine fusion is zzso Only in the presence of zzso does the zzso induce extensive fusion of zzso which is evident from their dramatic increase in zzso Besides these zzso changes, we observed distinct zzso and particulate structures in the zzso which are attributed to B18 in either of its two zzso zzso We conclude that membrane fusion involves an zzso zzso zzso which can zzso further in the zzso The role of zzso is to promote this local zzso structure in B18 and to prevent its zzso as zzso zzso
