We zzso on cellulose zzso zzso zzso peptides which included all of the sequences predicted for the severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso zzso zzso We zzso these zzso with four pairs of acute and zzso zzso from recovered SARS zzso We correlated positively reacting peptides with the in zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso We found that zzso zzso with high zzso activity recognized exclusively only a limited number of peptides on the zzso This suggests that zzso against the zzso represented by these peptides could be responsible for much of the zzso zzso zzso The findings have implications for monitoring zzso responses to zzso as well as for developing a successful SARS zzso
