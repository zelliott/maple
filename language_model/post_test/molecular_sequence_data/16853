zzso of the zzso gene zzso starts within the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at the zzso stage and is inhibited by the late zzso Such zzso zzso is essential for the normal development as the experimental zzso of the zzso expression elicits severe brain zzso To identify zzso regulators that are responsible for the zzso zzso we have used the zzso zzso system and identified a novel zzso zzso gene zzso that belongs to a family of zzso zzso zzso In terms of gene zzso zzso shares many common features with its zzso in other species, including expression in the embryonic brain and in the zzso cells of the zzso and lateral line zzso However, we have also observed several features specific for zzso such as expression in precursors of the zzso zzso cells that may indicate a possible common evolutionary origin of all zzso cells derived from the embryonic zzso Another specific feature is that the zzso expression in the anterior neural plate starts early, within the area overlapping the zzso expression territory at the zzso stage, and it zzso with the beginning of the zzso zzso Using various loss and zzso techniques, including zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso and its dominant zzso and zzso versions, we have shown that zzso can indeed play a role of zzso inhibitor of zzso in the anterior neural plate during the zzso zzso
