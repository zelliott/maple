A growing number of molecular studies show that many zzso have zzso structures and that their distinct lineages are usually limited to different zzso As a conservative test of the extent to which zzso zzso zzso may exhibit zzso structure, we chose to study zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we document the existence of several distinct zzso species within zzso zzso based on zzso DNA sequence zzso According to our findings, zzso zzso has strong intercontinental genetic zzso and, more surprisingly, has strong zzso zzso structure, particularly within North America, often corresponding to certain zzso and/or zzso zzso Our results indicate that the view of zzso zzso as a common, zzso easily identifiable, ecologically plastic fungus with a wide niche does not correctly represent the ecological and biological zzso On the contrary, the strong associations between zzso species and different zzso support the developing picture of zzso zzso and relatively narrow to very narrow niches for some zzso
