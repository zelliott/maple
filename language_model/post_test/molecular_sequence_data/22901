zzso zzso cataract syndrome zzso is caused by zzso in the regulatory iron responsive element zzso in the zzso of the zzso transcript that reduce binding affinity to the iron regulatory proteins zzso and lead to a zzso zzso of the protein in tissue and zzso zzso zzso have been reported within the zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 of which were available to zzso In addition, we included in this study three new zzso Thus, we analyzed 24 zzso spanning over a DNA stretch of 48 zzso including four deletions zzso zzso long and 20 zzso seven of which were conservative zzso With this unique experimental model we developed a microchip diagnostic platform for identifying known molecular defects in the zzso zzso structure with a zzso array approach, which we zzso after studying the effects of various zzso The system enables electronic deposition of zzso zzso to selected zzso Under zzso conditions, no zzso was found, even for zzso that affected the same or adjacent zzso zzso The same zzso could be serially zzso with all the 24 reporter probe sets, which allowed correct zzso right up until the end of the zzso zzso validation on 200 samples in a blinded fashion gave total zzso of zzso This pilot study represents a first step toward developing a diagnostic microchip for large-scale analyses for zzso studies and screening of zzso associated with iron zzso
