zzso II is a zzso zzso to zzso in zzso coli with two binding sites: a zzso site associated with the first few zzso and an anchor site binding zzso approximately 15 to 25 from the zzso When zzso II degrades zzso zzso zzso the zzso complex zzso at discrete intervals of 12 zzso zzso II stalled at the last zzso of zzso zzso zzso The more zzso released, the faster the stalled complex zzso and the less it inhibited zzso II activity, zzso the zzso association weakened zzso Using zzso I zzso I) as a probe, a method was developed to identify zzso zzso in zzso interacting with a zzso PAGE bands corresponding to zzso zzso from the zzso were consistent with interaction at the zzso site, and following a zzso bands approximately 15 to 25 from the zzso with anchor site zzso Both 3' and zzso binding were necessary to maintain the zzso Of most significance, the original anchor site zzso remained fixed at the anchor site while the zzso was pulled, or zzso through the zzso site, zzso the zzso did not zzso through the zzso DNA zzso with zzso zzso were good competitive zzso of zzso zzso A zzso arm was essential, while optimal binding required both zzso and zzso zzso I probing indicated that the zzso at the anchor site were specified by the spatial distance from the zzso site, and on only one of the duplex zzso When degradation of a structured zzso paused or stopped, the zzso zzso commenced cycles of zzso Duplex strand binding by zzso II made complex DNA or zzso structures accessible to degradation by other zzso and further verified the zzso I zzso zzso
