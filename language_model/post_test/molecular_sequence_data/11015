A zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso mass of the zzso zzso zzso was 42 zzso as determined by zzso Following separation by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be zzso and detected in zzso by activity zzso The zzso showed dual zzso specificity with a high preference for zzso zzso temperature for activity was 90 degrees C or above, and a zzso of 22 zzso was found for the zzso when incubated at 90 degrees C in a 50 zzso zzso buffer zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso acid zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso was zzso DNA sequencing identified the zzso gene as an open reading frame zzso a protein of 412 zzso acids with a molecular mass corresponding to that determined for the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence closely resembled that of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and bacterial zzso zzso with 57% identity with zzso zzso from zzso zzso All the zzso acid zzso directly zzso zzso and zzso (except zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso are zzso in the zzso from zzso zzso The primary structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso zzso among zzso Multiple alignment of all the available zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the three zzso of life shows that they can be divided into three distinct zzso zzso
