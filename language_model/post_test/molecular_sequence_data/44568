Almost exactly 50 years ago, zzso zzso Fisher and zzso Race proposed a model for the evolution of the zzso zzso genes in which the less common zzso were derived from the zzso ones by zzso and in which the gene order was zzso No zzso bearing on this model was available then, and has not been until zzso Here we present evidence for zzso zzso exchange zzso zzso occurring once in human history to generate the common zzso zzso zzso We have also used new zzso to construct zzso which suggest that zzso zzso played a major role in the generation of the less common zzso but only if zzso lies 3' of zzso zzso the order is zzso We provide both genetic and physical evidence supporting this zzso
