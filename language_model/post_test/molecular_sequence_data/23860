The zzso zzso zzso are small, autonomously replicating linear zzso that have a zzso repeat of a zzso sequence at their zzso The plasmids are possible evolutionary precursors of the zzso complex zzso as they zzso an active reverse zzso zzso that is involved in zzso zzso Using an in zzso system to study reverse transcription, we show that the zzso zzso is capable of copying in zzso zzso by use of zzso zzso or extension of zzso zzso zzso The ability of the zzso zzso to use zzso zzso zzso it from the closely related zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso products are similar, but not zzso to those obtained with conventional zzso and differences reflect the ability of the zzso zzso to initiate zzso synthesis with loosely associated zzso The zzso zzso can also copy DNA templates and extend 3' mismatched DNA zzso zzso Analysis of zzso in zzso replication zzso suggests that zzso repeats are added during reverse transcription, and the ability to extend loosely associated zzso could play a role in repeat formation by mechanisms similar to those associated with zzso and certain zzso zzso
