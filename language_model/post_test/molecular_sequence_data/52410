A rapid and simple application of the zzso chain reaction is described for the detection of human zzso zzso zzso in cells infected zzso The method was first used to study the zzso of two zzso zzso and confirm the link between the zzso of one, zzso for the major zzso zzso and viral zzso The zzso chosen in this region were specific for zzso zzso and sensitivity experiments showed that a single infected cell in 5 zzso zzso can be zzso zzso of this transcript should be suitable for diagnostic purposes, permitting the distinction between zzso and active zzso
