A zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso replacing the zzso zzso was identified from tick zzso The zzso zzso product was most similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso factor D and shared significant zzso with a number of zzso gene products of zzso including insect zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses confirmed that the tick zzso zzso zzso expression levels were highest in zzso and to lesser degrees in zzso and then zzso zzso whereas zzso levels of expression in whole ticks were found to be slightly higher in fed versus zzso adults or zzso Challenge of fed adults by zzso coli injection demonstrated that transcript abundance was significantly increased above those of zzso controls in a zzso zzso Additionally, an apparent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and expression zzso from a zzso zzso cell line indicating cross species zzso
