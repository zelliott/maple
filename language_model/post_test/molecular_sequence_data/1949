zzso zzso proteins regulate processes that are vital to development, and each possesses two tandem zzso finger zzso an zzso zzso finger and a zzso zzso zzso These zzso fingers require zzso to fold, to bind DNA recognition zzso and to regulate zzso While the zzso zzso finger is necessary and sufficient to bind to single zzso DNA sites, the zzso finger interacts with DNA such that the double finger unit zzso zzso has a binding and zzso profile that is tuned by the zzso zzso zzso was used as a zzso probe in a series of competition zzso to determine the affinity of zzso and zzso for the zzso finger from chicken zzso and the double finger from human zzso zzso to in this report as zzso and zzso For zzso these experiments yielded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso these experiments yielded equilibrium zzso for the process of two zzso binding to form zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso coordination environment of zzso zzso was confirmed with X-ray zzso zzso A detailed analysis of these data suggests that the zzso and zzso fingers of zzso act as independent and identical zzso sites and each finger binds zzso with an affinity equivalent to that of zzso
