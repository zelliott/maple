zzso the zzso effects of long-term population history from gene flow can be zzso Here, we address the question of what zzso about gene flow can be made from zzso sequence data in three closely related species of zzso zzso zzso species A, C, and D, from southeast zzso A total of 84 sequences of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso I gene were obtained from 14 populations in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of sequences obtained from two populations of zzso zzso C indicates no contemporary gene flow between zzso The zzso value of zzso therefore probably represents a recent common history, perhaps involving colonization zzso zzso zzso A and D are zzso yet no differentiation was seen either within or between zzso The zzso zzso of their zzso smooth zzso mismatch zzso and excess of low frequency zzso indicate population expansion in zzso zzso A and zzso This, rather than widespread gene flow, explains their low zzso zzso values zzso and zzso The greater genetic diversity of zzso zzso D suggests that expansion occurred first in species D and subsequently in species zzso The current geographical separation and low hybrid fitness of these species also argue against ongoing zzso gene zzso They suggest instead either historical zzso of zzso from zzso zzso D into species A followed by independent range expansions, or a selective sweep of zzso that originated in zzso zzso zzso While not excluding contemporary gene flow, historical population processes are sufficient to explain the data in zzso zzso A and zzso The zzso relationships between zzso could not be used to make zzso of gene flow because of extensive zzso due to zzso sites and possibly also zzso However, it is concluded that this approach, rather than the use of fixation zzso is required in the future to understand contemporary gene flow in these zzso The implications of these results for understanding gene flow in another important and comparable group of malaria zzso mosquitoes in Africa, the zzso zzso complex, are also zzso
