A gene for zzso syndrome was recently zzso and zzso were reported in five zzso 

To test whether zzso in this zzso zzso could explain the disease in our independent collection of sporadic and dominant zzso syndrome zzso and to test whether zzso occurred in a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were found in each of five zzso Four of the five were new; one was reported in a sporadic case in the original zzso syndrome study of five zzso All zzso from the two studies were zzso zzso zzso were observed within three zzso B protein zzso the zzso zzso 2 domain, repeat 14, and repeat zzso This suggested that as few as five (of the total of zzso coding zzso of zzso could be screened to detect zzso syndrome zzso Four of these zzso were screened in a sixth zzso case and a previously reported zzso substitution zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso may be responsible for all cases of zzso zzso They appear to occur in specific functional zzso of the zzso B zzso This should simplify diagnostic screening of the zzso zzso zzso in larger patient series are warranted to zzso zzso The study confirmed the extreme zzso in clinical presentation and the presence of unaffected zzso A molecular screen would be valuable for diagnosis and genetic zzso
