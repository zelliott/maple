zzso zzso is a key second zzso in zzso where it regulates a diverse array of cellular processes in response to external zzso An important zzso sensor in both animals and plants is zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso plants possess a unique family of zzso zzso zzso The majority of these zzso have not yet been zzso and investigation into their physical properties and cellular functions will provide insight into zzso signal zzso in zzso Here we describe the characterization of zzso a zzso acid zzso protein from zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and CD zzso zzso displays significant zzso secondary structure, binds three molecules of zzso with affinities ranging from 30 to 430 zzso and zzso a zzso zzso change that results in the exposure of one or more zzso zzso Gene expression analysis revealed zzso transcripts at various stages of development and in many cell types, including the support cells, which surround zzso zzso zzso on the leaf zzso Using zzso zzso screening we identified a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Because zzso is a protein known to function in zzso development, we examined transgenic zzso knockout plants and found that they possess zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso our data support a role for zzso as a zzso sensor that functions during cell branching in zzso
