The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed by human zzso zzso zzso and their zzso is a member of the zzso family of cellular zzso receptors which play important roles in zzso cell zzso These cell surface molecules contain an zzso zzso domain followed by an zzso growth zzso domain and a variable number of short consensus repeat sequences similar to those found in zzso binding zzso In this report, the structure of the zzso gene that encodes the zzso protein was determined by zzso overlapping zzso DNA clones that zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene spans greater than 30 zzso base pairs of DNA and is composed of at least 10 zzso The zzso end of the zzso zzso was mapped by primer extension analysis revealing a single initiation region for zzso zzso II through X contain translated zzso zzso II encodes the translation initiation zzso zzso III, the leader zzso IV, the zzso zzso zzso the zzso growth zzso zzso VI and zzso the short consensus repeat zzso zzso VIII, the zzso zzso zzso IX encodes seven zzso acids containing a potential zzso zzso and zzso X encodes the five remaining zzso acids of the zzso tail and the long 3' untranslated zzso zzso of zzso zzso clones derived from zzso revealed that the protein expressed by zzso would be identical in sequence with the protein expressed by zzso and zzso that would zzso different zzso of zzso protein were not zzso In addition, the level of zzso expression by zzso and zzso from two patients with zzso nocturnal zzso a disorder in which linkage of zzso anchors to proteins is zzso was similar to that of normal zzso zzso the usage of zzso II through X results in the generation of a single major zzso protein product expressed by zzso and zzso
