The zzso DNA zzso zzso has a zzso zzso complex composed of the 84 zzso portal protein zzso that forms the central channel of the zzso DNA packaging zzso The overall zzso of the zzso portal complex is similar to that of the portal complexes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Secondary structure prediction of zzso portal protein and its zzso onto the crystal structure of the zzso portal complexes suggested that the zzso portal protein complex shares zzso zzso zzso that were found in the zzso zzso of the zzso portal zzso To identify the zzso acids involved in zzso contacts in the zzso portal ring complexes and validate the zzso model, we performed comparative zzso exchange analysis of zzso and in zzso assembled portal proteins of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange experiments provided evidence of zzso interactions in the zzso portal complex similar to those in the zzso portal that map to the regions predicted to be zzso zzso zzso
