zzso that interact with zzso acids are central to numerous cellular zzso and their continuing characterization represents one of the zzso challenges in the zzso zzso Here we describe a simple zzso approach for the identification by mass zzso of proteins in crude extracts that interact with zzso zzso It incorporates the zzso mobility shift zzso and is based on the finding that when a protein forms a complex with zzso acid its zzso mobility is affected as well as that of the zzso zzso Our method should greatly reduce and in some cases may even eliminate the need for extensive protein zzso and as such should contribute significantly to the functional zzso of the zzso zzso it requires no prior knowledge of the molecular mass, zzso structure, or zzso of the interacting zzso Proof of principle is demonstrated using a recently discovered zzso zzso however, the approach should also have application in the identification of proteins that interact with zzso
