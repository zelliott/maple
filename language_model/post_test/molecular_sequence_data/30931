The availability of the zzso acid sequence for nine different zzso zzso family zzso and the revised zzso acid sequence of the chicken zzso zzso zzso and Dixon zzso reveals a much close relationship between zzso and avian zzso than was previously thought zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of all zzso genes for which zzso DNA or zzso sequence is available reveals both marked sequence similarities in the zzso zzso gene family and internal repeated sequences in the chicken zzso zzso The detailed alignments of the zzso regulatory DNA sequences shows several consensus sequence patterns, particularly the conservation of a zzso response element zzso in all the zzso genes and of the regions zzso the zzso box, zzso site, zzso coding region, and zzso zzso In addition we have found a high frequency of the CA zzso immediately adjacent to the zzso element of both the zzso genes and the zzso transition zzso a feature not present in other zzso which suggests the existence of an extended zzso motif involved in the coordinate expression of zzso and transition protein genes during zzso zzso these findings suggest the existence of an zzso zzso zzso gene line and are discussed in the context of different hypotheses for zzso gene evolution and zzso
