The zzso syndrome and the zzso syndrome are caused by the loss of function of distinct but closely linked genes on human zzso zzso Based on a zzso artificial zzso restriction map and two key patients we have determined that the shortest region of deletion overlap in the zzso syndrome comprises 320 zzso The region includes the anonymous DNA marker zzso zzso and the gene for the small nuclear zzso N zzso The zzso gene maps 130 zzso zzso to zzso and is transcribed from zzso to zzso
