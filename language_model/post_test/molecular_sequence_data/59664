zzso DNA fragments generated by the reverse zzso of cellular zzso are called zzso Because they are flanked by short repeats, zzso zzso are believed to integrate at staggered zzso zzso Recently, a significant sequence pattern associated with the integration of zzso and ID repeats was identified zzso zzso It is represented by the zzso zzso consensus sequence around the zzso ends of zzso repeats of zzso zzso as well as, of B1 and B2 zzso elements as shown in this zzso This consensus is a potential target for zzso zzso which probably occurs in the complementary strand between 3' AA and the following 3' zzso zzso The first four bases of the zzso repeats corresponding to the 3' zzso consensus sequence show some sequence variations that may be affected by complementary base pairing between the zzso zzso tails and the DNA target sequences prior to zzso and reverse zzso We discuss potential evidence for such base pairing based on correlated variations in zzso composition of different tail and target zzso
