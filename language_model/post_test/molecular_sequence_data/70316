The main stream of biology today is the analysis of the molecular mechanisms of major biological phenomena through studies of the genes governing these processes and their protein zzso An example is the problem of tumor zzso which is extremely important both theoretically and zzso Here we describe the data obtained on the zzso zzso structure and zzso control of the zzso zzso that encodes zzso 1, a protein which seems to play an important role in the control of zzso in mouse zzso In particular, the experiments on tumor cell zzso with constructions containing either a sense or zzso zzso sequence under a strong zzso element show the direct dependence of the zzso zzso on the expression of the zzso gene at least in some zzso Gene zzso encodes a protein belonging to the family of zzso proteins and may be involved in the control of cell zzso in different types of cells, such as zzso and zzso The relationship between zzso and other genes zzso and zzso in zzso cells is zzso
