In this report, we characterize an alternate gene element of the zzso zzso zzso First, we have looked at the expression of the alternate zzso C beta 0, in normal T cell zzso as well as in fetal vs adult whole zzso The C beta 0 zzso is expressed in only zzso or less of zzso messages in four of four mature T cell clones zzso C beta 0 is found at zzso higher levels in both fetal and adult zzso zzso Thus C beta 0 is zzso regulated by T cells, although expression of the alternate zzso is relatively constant from the fetal zzso to the adult zzso Second, evolutionary conservation of the C beta 0 gene element was studied in both the rat and the zzso The rat zzso contains a gene element highly zzso to the mouse C beta 0 zzso but the rat C beta 0 gene contains zzso in both zzso sites that probably prevent the gene element from being spliced into zzso We have also zzso the first zzso of rat C beta 1, and find that the C beta 0 zzso and the zzso around C beta 0 are zzso between rat and mouse to the same level as the C beta 1 coding zzso The zzso around C beta 1, in contrast, shows the decrease in conservation between the two species that is expected for a zzso zzso Analysis of the putative C beta zzso region in the human reveals no sequences zzso to the C beta 0 gene zzso Because the mouse is the only species that has zzso a functional C beta 0 zzso we conclude that the C beta 0 zzso does not play a general role in T cell zzso
