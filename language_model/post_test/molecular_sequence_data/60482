zzso genetic zzso and zzso structure of the Dover zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined along the zzso slope of the zzso Pacific Ocean using sequences of the left domain of the zzso DNA zzso control zzso Six sites were sampled in three primary zzso provinces (based on surface water zzso ranging from the zzso to the warm temperate zzso Many zzso were zzso zzso 90 for 110 zzso zzso joining and zzso analyses of the entire data set showed that some groups of zzso of adult Dover sole were widely distributed, suggesting either zzso or zzso and zzso However, a substantial number of groups of related zzso were geographically zzso and there were significant differences among sites in the distribution of restricted zzso (based on a reduced number of zzso supporting geographical zzso zzso differentiation of populations appeared to be consistent with the zzso hypothesis for retention of the zzso larvae in currents and recruitment to adult zzso reducing long-distance zzso zzso of this study indicate zzso structure among some zzso despite extended zzso zzso zzso and apparent environmental zzso in the adult zzso along the zzso zzso
