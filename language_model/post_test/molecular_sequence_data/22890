zzso zzso is commonly associated with zzso production in zzso zzso Both the full-length zzso zzso zzso gene and a 470 zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso gene have been cloned from zzso zzso In addition, we cloned a zzso zzso zzso of a putative zzso cassette zzso gene zzso together with part of two putative zzso zzso zzso genes zzso 1 and zzso zzso Increased expression of all five genes was observed under zzso conditions, indicating not only their likely involvement in zzso zzso but indicating for the first time that regulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso is zzso at the level of gene zzso
