We have isolated a full-length zzso clone that encodes for a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso of the zzso family, zzso zzso zzso zzso The proposed zzso protein contains zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is viable, but exhibits zzso upon reaching stationary phase in liquid media and zzso zzso growth on solid zzso Analysis of the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso indicates that asexual zzso of zzso zzso cells into zzso is zzso zzso and zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can substitute for the zzso function in zzso zzso
