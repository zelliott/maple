The zzso B zzso occupy a unique niche among a larger zzso by predominantly regulating zzso zzso In humans, there are 13 family members that map to zzso gene clusters at either zzso or zzso While most of these zzso display a unique zzso profile and appear to be well zzso in zzso the zzso B zzso of several species show evidence of relatively recent zzso amplification zzso However, it is not clear whether these zzso gene amplification events yield zzso with functional zzso or, through selective pressure, zzso with more diverse zzso zzso A recent comparative zzso analysis of the mouse zzso B cluster at zzso found nearly complete conservation of gene number, order, and orientation relative to those of zzso in zzso The only exception was the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso The human zzso locus contains two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas the mouse locus contains four zzso and three zzso At least two of these genes zzso functional, dual zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso was shown previously to inhibit both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We now report that mouse zzso extends the zzso repertoire of the mouse zzso locus to include a second zzso inhibitor with activity against both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings confirmed that the zzso expansion of the zzso B zzso in the mouse was associated with a functional diversification of zzso zzso
