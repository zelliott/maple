A series of zzso zzso zzso have been zzso for use on automated DNA zzso After zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso on the DNA zzso the excess zzso is removed by washing the solid zzso The zzso and its linkage to the zzso are stable during the conditions of DNA synthesis and zzso zzso zzso is attained with the zzso zzso zzso zzso a polystyrene based affinity zzso which selectively retains zzso zzso zzso Analysis by zzso zzso zzso effectively separates fluorescent dye zzso zzso from zzso zzso
