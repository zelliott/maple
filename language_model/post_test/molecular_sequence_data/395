zzso zzso in zzso zzso is controlled zzso by the zzso zzso zzso S and Z zzso mapped to zzso zzso linkage groups 1 and 2, respectively, with their corresponding zzso regions on rice zzso 5 zzso and zzso None of the gene products of S and Z have yet been zzso zzso zzso libraries were developed to enrich for zzso expressed genes in zzso zzso zzso were identified from the zzso libraries that were zzso to sequences on rice zzso and zzso These represent potential zzso candidate zzso zzso ten expressed zzso candidate genes were zzso A rapid increase in gene expression within two minutes after zzso contact was revealed, reaching a maximum between 2 and 10 zzso The potential involvement of these genes in the zzso reactions is zzso
