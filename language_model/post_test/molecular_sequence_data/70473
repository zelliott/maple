The zzso zzso plays a role in the assembly of major zzso complex zzso class I molecules in the zzso zzso by zzso the interaction of class zzso zzso with zzso We report here the identification of the zzso gene in the chicken zzso (B zzso This gene is located at the zzso end of the complex, between the class II zzso and zzso zzso Like its human counterpart it comprises 8 zzso but features a significantly reduced zzso size as compared to the human zzso Chicken zzso codes for a zzso protein with a probable zzso zzso retention zzso zzso IV and zzso and possibly zzso III, code for separate zzso that are related to the zzso zzso zzso (this relationship was so far zzso for human zzso domain IV which has lost its two zzso Two different zzso corresponding to the zzso gene were isolated, possibly related to alternative zzso zzso the zzso domain zzso by zzso IV is missing in one of the zzso suggesting either that this domain is not necessary for the protein to perform its function, or that the two alternatively spliced zzso are translated into two functionally different forms of the zzso
