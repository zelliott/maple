A zzso avian zzso zzso vaccine zzso was previously shown to give variable outcomes in experimental zzso Following plaque zzso three of 12 viruses obtained from zzso failed to induce protection against virulent challenge, whilst the remainder retained their protective zzso The zzso sequences of two protective viruses were identical to the zzso consensus, whereas two zzso viruses differed only in the zzso gene zzso termination zzso Northern zzso showed that the zzso in the zzso zzso region of the zzso viruses led to enhanced levels of zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso A synthetic zzso was used to demonstrate that the altered zzso zzso region reduced the level of protein expression from a downstream zzso The zzso of the remaining eight zzso viruses were zzso in the region where the zzso consensus sequence differed from the virulent zzso The seven protective clones were zzso whereas the zzso virus retained the virulent zzso sequence at two positions and contained extensive zzso in its attachment zzso protein sequence associated with a reduced or altered expression pattern of G protein on Western zzso The data indicate that the efficacy of a putative protective vaccine strain is affected by zzso altering the balance of G protein zzso
