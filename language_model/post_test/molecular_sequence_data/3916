zzso dominant lateral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a form of zzso characterized by partial seizures, usually preceded by auditory zzso The gene for this disorder has been mapped by linkage studies to zzso region zzso Here we show that zzso in the zzso gene segregate with zzso in two families affected by this zzso Both zzso introduce premature stop zzso and thus prevent the production of the full-length protein from the affected zzso By zzso studies, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso which contains several zzso repeats, is expressed zzso in the zzso cell compartment of the zzso Moreover, we provide evidence for genetic zzso within this disorder, since several other families with a zzso consistent with this type of zzso lack zzso in the zzso zzso
