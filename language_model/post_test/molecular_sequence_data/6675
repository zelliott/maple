The zzso box sequence in zzso is located about 25 zzso upstream of many genes transcribed by zzso zzso II zzso zzso and some genes transcribed by zzso zzso III zzso zzso The zzso box is recognized in a zzso manner by the zzso zzso protein zzso an essential factor involved in the initiation of zzso by all three zzso zzso zzso We have investigated the recognition of the zzso box by the Pol II and Pol III zzso zzso machinery and its role in establishing the zzso zzso specificity of the zzso zzso templates were constructed that contained a zzso zzso box as the sole promoter element but differed in the orientation of the zzso zzso box zzso As expected, Pol II initiated zzso in zzso nuclear extracts downstream of the zzso zzso zzso In distinct contrast, zzso that initiated downstream of the zzso zzso box was carried out specifically by Pol zzso zzso this effect was observed regardless of the source of the DNA either upstream or downstream of the zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may bind in opposite zzso on Pol II and Pol III promoters and that opposite, yet zzso surfaces of zzso may be zzso by the Pol II and Pol III zzso machinery for the initiation of zzso
