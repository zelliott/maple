The zzso properties of protein L from zzso zzso and protein G from zzso have been successfully combined through the construction of a novel hybrid zzso consisting of a single zzso domain from each zzso The zzso and zzso properties of this construct have been characterized through equilibrium and zzso zzso zzso circular zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso and zzso stability studies using a chemical zzso in order to examine the structure and availability of zzso binding sites in each zzso These studies show that despite the small size of the protein zzso zzso each domain behaves in an independent manner with respect to the binding characteristics of the same domain in zzso
