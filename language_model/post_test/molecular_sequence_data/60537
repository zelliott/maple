The interactions between the mouse major urinary protein zzso zzso and the zzso zzso have been characterized in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced in a bacterial expression system and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced zzso An equilibrium diffusion zzso and zzso zzso revealed that both zzso of the zzso bind to the zzso protein with a zzso of 1 zzso of protein to 1 zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso constant and zzso regime zzso zzso were determined for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso chemical shifts of zzso were assigned using triple resonance and zzso zzso zzso zzso Changes in protein zzso and zzso chemical shifts upon addition of zzso were used to identify the zzso binding zzso Several zzso signals, corresponding to zzso on one side of the binding site, were split into two zzso in the saturated zzso zzso Similarly, two overlapping zzso spin systems were present in zzso zzso zzso of labeled protein bound to zzso zzso The two sets of zzso were attributed to the two possible zzso of the zzso zzso zzso indicated that the orientation of the zzso in the zzso binding cavity is opposite to that modeled in a previous X-ray zzso
