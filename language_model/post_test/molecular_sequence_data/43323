Diversity within bacteria isolated from activated sludge and the Baltic sea and recognized by the zzso targeted zzso probe zzso zzso by zzso et zzso 1993 to recognize zzso zzso was zzso The partial zzso sequences of zzso genes of the zzso revealed that the activated sludge and Baltic sea zzso each formed a separate group distinct from zzso zzso The analysis of zzso and zzso sensitivity as well as whole cell protein patterns revealed the same zzso but in these characters also zzso variation was zzso As a conclusion, neither of the studied groups were zzso zzso but they probably belong to two previously unknown species common in activated sludge or the Baltic zzso
