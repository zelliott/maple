In zzso zzso the promotion of flowering by cold temperatures, zzso is regulated via a zzso zzso box zzso factor, zzso zzso C zzso zzso leads to the zzso repression of zzso zzso a process that requires the zzso group zzso protein zzso 2 zzso and the plant zzso protein zzso zzso 3 zzso We demonstrate that the repression of zzso by zzso requires zzso of other zzso zzso Complex 2 proteins and zzso We show in zzso that zzso and zzso are part of a large protein complex that can include the zzso proteins zzso INDEPENDENT zzso zzso zzso and zzso These findings suggest a single protein complex is responsible for zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso at zzso in zzso zzso The abundance of the complex increases during zzso and declines after plants are returned to higher temperatures, consistent with the complex having a role in establishing zzso zzso
