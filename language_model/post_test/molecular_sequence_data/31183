The recent development of zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso has provided a system for cloning fragments that are over ten times larger than those that can be cloned in more established zzso We have developed a method for the rapid isolation of terminal sequences from zzso zzso The zzso clone is zzso with a range of restriction zzso a common zzso is zzso to the DNA fragments and terminal sequences are amplified using a zzso specific primer and a zzso specific zzso zzso data derived from these terminal specific products can be used to design zzso for a further round of screening to isolate overlapping zzso The method also provides a convenient method of generating zzso zzso Sites for the mapping of complex zzso
