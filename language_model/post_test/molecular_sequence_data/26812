Following the successful production of zzso zzso several studies investigating the physiology of this zzso zzso have been zzso In this report, we review studies of its biological effect, measurement and zzso To use serum zzso level in detecting zzso abuse, new method has been established and serum zzso zzso were measured in normal subjects and athletes, and no abnormal results were found among zzso Another study confirmed that serum zzso increased remarkably and zzso decreased following the zzso administration of zzso The duration was relatively short, approximately zzso in our and other zzso The increase of the ratio, zzso was the most suitable indicator of zzso zzso Studies supported by the WADA were undertaken in collaboration with an Australian zzso A new approach for the zzso zzso zzso by beads zzso platform is being zzso It is concluded that the direct measurement of zzso is a valid scientific approach, for detecting zzso abuse, although the duration of the positive results is zzso Our method will be useful in combination with the marker method, an zzso test or test for target zzso Furthermore, its application for the doping test passport is considered to be a possible future zzso
