We previously demonstrated that defective zzso interaction between zzso zzso to zzso and central regions (2000 to zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso leak in failing hearts and that zzso zzso zzso the zzso leak by correcting the defective zzso zzso In the present report, we identified the zzso domain and characterized the role of this novel domain in the regulation of the zzso zzso 

An zzso using a zzso zzso technique (a very sensitive zzso zzso revealed that zzso specifically bound to zzso zzso fragments zzso to zzso and 1981 to zzso but not to other zzso fragments from the 1 to 2750 region (1 to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to 1503, zzso to zzso zzso to zzso By further analysis of the zzso zzso was found to specifically bind to its zzso With the use of the zzso matching this zzso zzso as a carrier, the zzso was zzso labeled with zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso After zzso zzso the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was detected by an zzso raised against the central region zzso Moreover, of several zzso zzso fragments, only zzso was specifically zzso zzso this suggests that the zzso zzso binds with zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the interaction between zzso and zzso causing domain zzso as evidenced by an increased accessibility of the bound zzso to a zzso zzso zzso In failing zzso the frequency of spontaneous zzso spark was markedly increased compared with normal zzso whereas incorporation of zzso markedly decreased the frequency of spontaneous zzso zzso 

We first identified the zzso site as zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso interaction between the zzso and central zzso seems to mediate stabilization of zzso in failing hearts, which may lead to a novel therapeutic strategy against heart failure and perhaps lethal zzso
