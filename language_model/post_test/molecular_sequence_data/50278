Two zzso restriction and modification zzso systems, designated zzso and zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso zzso Further analysis revealed that the zzso zzso genes are zzso in both zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene of strain zzso was further characterized by zzso and expression studies in zzso coli followed by zzso sequence zzso The zzso gene is zzso zzso in size and may code for a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso shares substantial similarity with four distinct regions from several zzso and zzso and contains the zzso motif that is so far only found in zzso zzso overlapping with the zzso gene and in reverse orientation, an additional zzso was identified with a size of 606 zzso potentially coding for a protein of 202 zzso acids zzso zzso zzso This zzso is suggested to zzso the corresponding zzso zzso
