We have shown previously that the skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso of approximately 16,000 zzso codes zzso zzso acid zzso zzso the calcium release channel in skeletal zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the brain contains an zzso species with an estimated size of approximately zzso zzso zzso with the zzso region of the skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning and zzso analysis indicated that two transcripts differing in their start sites are produced from the skeletal muscle zzso zzso gene in a zzso fashion, and that the zzso in brain may code the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression experiments suggested that the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the skeletal muscle zzso zzso can function as a translation initiation zzso and that the expressed protein composed of the zzso terminal 656 zzso acid zzso of the zzso is located on the zzso zzso zzso
