zzso zzso is the zzso agent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso disease which zzso severe worldwide economical losses in zzso Little is known about zzso interactions at the molecular level for this zzso zzso zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso zzso zzso Major zzso structural proteins from the spore wall zzso and the polar tube zzso are known to be involved in host zzso We developed a zzso approach to identify few zzso zzso proteins belonging to these cell zzso zzso extraction protocols were zzso and four zzso zzso spore protein extracts were compared by zzso and zzso to establish complementary zzso zzso Three proteins were shown to be located at the zzso zzso Moreover, 17 zzso zzso were raised against major zzso zzso proteins from all zzso and three spots were shown to zzso to polar tube proteins zzso by zzso zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso on zzso zzso patterns for each zzso were obtained by zzso and zzso zzso sequence tags were deduced by de zzso sequencing using zzso Online and zzso then evaluated by MASCOT and zzso zzso Identification parameters were higher than zzso hits, strengthening our strategy that could be enlarged to a zzso zzso
