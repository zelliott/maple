The human zzso zzso zzso zzso is located in the joining region between the long zzso and short zzso unique sequences of the virus zzso zzso and this zzso junction has been used to differentiate zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there are differences among strains of human zzso which could be characterized by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of the zzso of zzso DNA and to compare a zzso method of strain differentiation with conventional restriction zzso length zzso zzso methodology by using zzso junction zzso Laboratory strains of zzso and viral zzso from individuals with zzso infection were characterized by using both zzso and zzso The zzso zzso amplified regions in the major zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso junction zzso zzso laboratory strains zzso zzso and Davis were zzso in terms of size of the amplified product, when analyzed by zzso with zzso specific for the zzso but were indistinguishable by using zzso targeted to zzso and zzso zzso When this technique was applied to a characterization of zzso from individuals with zzso infection, selected zzso could be readily zzso In addition, when the zzso zzso product was analyzed with restriction zzso zzso for the presence of specific zzso these DNA differences were zzso zzso analysis across the variable zzso of zzso demonstrated differences among strains which were confirmed by zzso in 38 of 40 zzso zzso The most zzso restriction zzso sites in the zzso for distinguishing zzso zzso were those of zzso and zzso This indicates that the zzso of zzso is zzso among wild zzso and zzso of the zzso of zzso is a practical way to characterize differences in strains of zzso
