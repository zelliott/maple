A zzso zzso zzso zzso strictly zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso zzso was isolated from soil and its zzso position was investigated using a zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso zzso formed a distinct lineage within the zzso zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the only zzso zzso and zzso and zzso as the major fatty zzso The cell wall zzso of strain zzso zzso contained zzso acid and the major zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The polar lipids were composed of zzso zzso zzso two unidentified zzso four unidentified zzso an unidentified zzso two unidentified zzso and another unidentified polar zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso data and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was classified as a representative of a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
