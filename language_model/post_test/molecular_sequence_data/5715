zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of steroid zzso at an extremely fast rate, overcoming a large disparity of zzso values between a zzso zzso and its zzso The crystal structures of zzso from zzso zzso and of the zzso in complex with zzso an analogue of the reaction zzso have been determined at zzso and zzso A resolution, zzso The structures reveal that the side chains of zzso and zzso (a newly identified zzso zzso form hydrogen bonds directly with the zzso of the bound inhibitor in a completely zzso milieu of the active zzso No water zzso is found at the active site, and the access of bulk zzso is blocked by a layer of zzso zzso zzso is surrounded by six zzso zzso and consequently, its zzso appears to be elevated as high as zzso to be consistent with early zzso No interaction was found between the bound inhibitor and the zzso 101 zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso which was suggested to contribute significantly to the rate enhancement based on zzso zzso This observation excludes the zzso 101 as a potential zzso zzso and requires that the rate enhancement should be explained solely by zzso and zzso zzso analyses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso contributes much more significantly to the rate enhancement than zzso Previous studies and the structural analysis strongly suggest that the zzso hydrogen bond of zzso zzso zzso along with a moderate strength hydrogen bond of zzso ( approximately 4 zzso accounts for the required energy of 11 zzso for the zzso zzso
