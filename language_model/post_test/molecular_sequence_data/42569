An zzso is described for the systematic characterization of the zzso properties seen at each position in a multiple protein sequence zzso The new zzso allows questions important in the design of zzso experiments to be quickly answered since positions in the alignment that show unusual or interesting zzso substitution patterns may be rapidly zzso The strategy is based on a flexible zzso description of zzso acid properties, which is used to define the conservation between any group of zzso zzso zzso in the alignment are gathered into zzso on the basis of sequence zzso functional, evolutionary or other zzso All pairs of zzso are then compared to highlight positions that zzso the unique features of each zzso The zzso is zzso in the computer program zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which provides a zzso summary of the analysis and an zzso zzso shaded and/or zzso multiple sequence zzso The zzso is illustrated by application to an alignment of 67 zzso zzso where patterns of zzso zzso zzso that constitute the protein core are zzso The analysis of charge conservation across zzso zzso identifies the locations at which zzso charges change zzso The zzso zzso the analysis of multiple sequence data by condensing the mass of information present, and thus allows the rapid identification of zzso of structural and functional zzso
