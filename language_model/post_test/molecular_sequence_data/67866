zzso of zzso zzso in DNA is a common zzso modification in zzso that plays a central role in maintenance of zzso stability, gene zzso zzso zzso development, and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zinc finger protein implicated in zzso zzso binds to both zzso zzso zzso sites and a specific zzso DNA motif zzso and zzso zzso by recruiting zzso zzso zzso machinery to target zzso Here we report structures of the zzso zinc finger zzso domain in complex with its zzso zzso DNA target zzso and with a zzso zzso DNA sequence derived from the promoter region of zzso zzso of specific bases in the major groove of the core zzso and zzso sites is accomplished through both classical and zzso zzso zzso interactions with zzso in the first two zinc fingers, whereas zzso in the zzso extension following the third zinc finger bind in the opposing minor groove and are required for zzso zzso The zzso region is zzso in the free protein and adopts an ordered structure upon binding to zzso The structures of these zzso complexes provide insights into the mechanism by which a zinc finger protein can recognize zzso sites as well as a specific, zzso regulatory DNA zzso
