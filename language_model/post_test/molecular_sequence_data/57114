A zzso clone zzso the human zzso zzso zzso resident protein zzso was isolated and zzso It predicts a zzso protein with a large zzso zzso region showing sequence similarity to zzso and a short zzso domain containing a zzso zzso sequence that may be relevant to its retention in the zzso It is zzso zzso to the canine zzso membrane zzso called zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cameron, zzso zzso zzso zzso Doherty, zzso zzso II, zzso zzso Bell, zzso zzso zzso zzso Thomas, zzso zzso and Bergeron, zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Previously, in zzso we have characterized zzso as a protein associated with partially assembled zzso proteins including the T cell zzso the membrane zzso and the heavy chain of the major zzso complex class I molecules zzso zzso David, zzso Watkins, zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 89, zzso Here, we show that within a short zzso labeling period, zzso associates zzso with many different newly zzso zzso However, in a T cell line that cannot assemble a complete T cell zzso because it lacks the alpha zzso the zzso T cell zzso beta zzso which are retained in the zzso remain associated with zzso throughout a prolonged chase time zzso Together, these data offer further evidence suggesting that zzso may act in assisting protein assembly and/or in the retention within the zzso of zzso protein zzso
