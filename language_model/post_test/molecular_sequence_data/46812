We previously reported a zzso selection method using DNA latex particles to identify expressed genes in specific regions of zzso and named this zzso scanning method zzso et zzso 1995 Gene 155 zzso We applied the zzso scanning method to the zzso zzso DNA on zzso zzso zzso 5, and constructed a zzso zzso in which zzso for genes on the zzso zzso DNA were zzso We isolated zzso zzso clones from the zzso and determined partial sequence of them to produce expressed sequence tags zzso derived from the zzso zzso In total, 74 zzso groups of zzso were obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of these zzso clones had significant zzso to functional proteins such as protein zzso zzso zzso zzso acid binding protein and zzso channel zzso We compared the zzso sequences isolated by the zzso scanning method to the zzso zzso sequence corresponding to the zzso zzso region, and found that zzso of the selected zzso are located in the zzso We discuss the zzso and efficiency of the zzso scanning method for cloning zzso zzso and its useful application in zzso zzso
