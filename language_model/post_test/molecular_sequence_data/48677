We have isolated and in zzso characterized a zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso factor from zzso zzso Its zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso consisted of a zzso zzso ORF, zzso and 188 zzso of zzso and 3' zzso regions, respectively, zzso a protein of zzso zzso with deduced molecular mass zzso zzso and zzso of zzso In zzso and zzso analysis further suggested that the protein showed features of a typical member of the zzso family of zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that multiple copies of the gene could be present in the zzso Its transcripts were abundant in leaves, zzso and zzso but scarce in roots and could strongly be induced by cold treatment (4 zzso zzso by drought and salt stress, and did not respond to zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a potential candidate for zzso zzso engineering in crop plants upon its further functional zzso
