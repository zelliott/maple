The anatomical relationship between zzso factor zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso cells in the human zzso was investigated by zzso In the zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was present exclusively in zzso cells, while zzso zzso zzso was present in both zzso and zzso zzso No zzso zzso were observed in the zzso zzso All zzso zzso cells in the zzso were also zzso zzso We confirmed the presence of zzso in the zzso cells by using two kinds of zzso zzso one of which recognized the side chain of zzso while the other recognized the ring structure of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was observed not only in the same zzso but also in the same nerve fibers of zzso zzso The present results raise the possibility that zzso and zzso may be zzso together into the human portal zzso
