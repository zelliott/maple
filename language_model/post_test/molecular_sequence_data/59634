The human zzso zzso family displays broad spectrum zzso zzso and zzso activities on a variety of cell zzso The diverse biological activities of the zzso are conveyed to cells through specific interactions with zzso zzso Despite considerable effort, no crystal structure of a member of this family has yet been reported, because the quality of the protein zzso have been zzso for zzso zzso Until now, structural models of the zzso have been based on the structure of zzso zzso zzso These models are likely to be zzso as the zzso acid sequence of zzso differs significantly from the zzso at proposed zzso zzso zzso information on a zzso zzso would provide an improved basis for modeling the structures of the entire zzso zzso 

The crystal structure of zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso zzso zzso exists in the crystal as a zzso zzso which associates in a novel zzso Unlike other structurally characterized zzso extensive interactions in the zzso interface are zzso by a zinc zzso zzso The overall fold of zzso zzso is most similar to the structure of zzso zzso to zzso zzso is a zzso zzso in the AB loop which is held to the core of the zzso by a zzso zzso 

The structure of zzso zzso provides an accurate model for analysis of the zzso 15 related type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso displays considerable structural similarity with zzso zzso and zzso which also bind related class 2 zzso zzso From these structural comparisons and numerous studies on the effects of zzso on biological activity, we have identified protein surfaces that appear to be important in zzso zzso This study also reveals the potential biological importance of the zzso zzso zzso
