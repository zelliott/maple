The zzso zzso zzso was erected on the basis of zzso zzso an zzso fungus originally isolated from zzso zzso It produces a mixture of volatile organic compounds zzso with zzso activity that can be used as zzso The zzso currently comprises five zzso Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a new species of zzso on the basis of five zzso zzso strains from leaves of zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified broad leaf tree in the zzso Nature Reserve, Zhejiang Province, Southeast of zzso They exhibit white colonies on potato zzso zzso zzso media, zzso zzso zzso but did not zzso The optimum growth temperature is zzso The results of a zzso analysis based on four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are consistent with the hypothesis that these five strains belong to a single zzso All five strains also produce volatile chemical components with zzso activity in zzso which were different from those previously described for other zzso zzso
