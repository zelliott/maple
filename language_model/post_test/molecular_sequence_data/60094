In this report 118 mouse zzso genes are described which, together with the 22 zzso genes reported previously zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amount to 140 genes that had been cloned and zzso in our zzso For 73 of them zzso are known, zzso zzso they have to be considered functional zzso although 10 genes of this group have zzso zzso from the zzso promoter, zzso site or zzso zzso signal zzso Twenty zzso genes have been defined as only potentially functional since they do not contain any zzso but no zzso have been found zzso for zzso Of the 140 zzso genes 47 are zzso There are indications that two to five zzso genes or zzso exist in the zzso locus which we have not yet been able to zzso The 140 zzso genes and zzso were assigned to 18 gene families, 4 of them being zzso zzso This differs from previous zzso of the families only by the combination of the zzso and zzso families and by the addition of the zzso zzso gene as a new separate zzso zzso identity usually was zzso or above within the gene families and zzso between genes of different zzso Many of the mouse zzso gene families show significant zzso to the human ones, indicating that in evolution zzso gene diversification predated the divergence of the zzso and zzso zzso
