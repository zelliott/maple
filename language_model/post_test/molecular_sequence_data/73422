Analysis of the hinge region of zzso zzso by zzso scanning zzso revealed that this sequence motif has a pronounced effect on the stability and zzso activity of the active zzso The zzso of the zzso acid zzso in the zzso position of the two zzso zzso zzso bonds zzso and zzso to Ala showed that the zzso zzso were more resistant to zzso However, these zzso were not completely stable and zzso occurred mainly at the zzso zzso bond and the zzso of the active zzso was increased by zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso Ala zzso of the minor zzso site zzso lead to increased zzso of the zzso to zzso However, when the other zzso position zzso was altered to Ala no effect on stability was zzso The analysis of the ability of the zzso active zzso to zzso zzso I collagen was assessed and our results demonstrate that the hinge sequence motif of zzso zzso is important for zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso sequence motif to zzso showed that the zzso activity was reduced by zzso In addition, zzso of the downstream sequence motif zzso to zzso had an even more marked effect on the zzso activity, which was reduced by zzso When the Pro zzso in the hinge motif zzso zzso zzso and zzso were altered to Ala the zzso activity dropped to zzso of the value observed for zzso zzso
