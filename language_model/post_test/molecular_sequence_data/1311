We assessed the utility of zzso gene expression as a marker of minimal residual disease zzso in zzso The zzso gene family shows a high degree of zzso zzso zzso into two zzso zzso zzso and zzso form one zzso almost identical among themselves, while zzso to zzso constitute the other zzso The entire zzso family zzso was studied by zzso followed by Southern zzso to increase both the sensitivity and specificity of the zzso Surprisingly, expression of zzso was detected in 59% of peripheral blood samples from normal controls zzso as well as in a similar proportion from zzso patients with localized disease zzso 1 and zzso The study of zzso zzso and zzso with specific zzso lowered this percentage to zzso zzso of which only two zzso showed a high level of expression zzso zzso after zzso We conclude that zzso genes can show a zzso usually low level of illegitimate expression in normal blood cells, and therefore their use as zzso markers should be taken with zzso
