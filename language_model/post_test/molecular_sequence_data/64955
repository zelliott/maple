We report application of a zzso methodology that allows the easy characterization and zzso of genes zzso on an infectious bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso We characterized zzso generated by zzso zzso zzso of a zzso clone of guinea pig zzso zzso A pool of zzso zzso zzso zzso were screened initially by restriction profile analysis to verify they were zzso and subsequently zzso zzso DNA from individual zzso was zzso onto guinea pig lung zzso cells in order to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso as either essential or zzso gene zzso depending upon their ability to zzso viable, zzso zzso Representative zzso were more fully zzso Analysis by sequencing the zzso zzso site on the zzso zzso and by zzso of virus using zzso of guinea pig zzso zzso demonstrated that a zzso with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso was a zzso gene for viral replication in tissue zzso A zzso with an zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso a zzso which could be rescued by zzso zzso of zzso DNA with zzso zzso zzso suggesting an essential role of this putative zzso gene in virus zzso
