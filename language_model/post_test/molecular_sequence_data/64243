zzso and zzso analyses indicate that recent circulating zzso influenza viruses in the United States have been alternating between two genetic and zzso distinct lineages since zzso The evolution rates for these two zzso the Kentucky and the Florida zzso are very zzso For the earlier zzso in the Kentucky zzso there are multiple and sequential zzso zzso at zzso sites B and zzso However, there are no changes at any of these zzso sites for zzso and zzso In the Florida zzso except for zzso with one zzso acid substitution at zzso site B, viruses in this lineage do not have zzso zzso at any of the zzso zzso The lack of zzso acid zzso at these zzso sites suggests a mechanism other than immune selection is responsible for the maintenance of these viral zzso zzso analysis indicates that these two lineages are zzso zzso and the pattern of zzso of horse zzso towards these two lineages zzso in consecutive years, parallel to the zzso of virus lineage seen in the zzso zzso This alternate circulation may play a role in the maintenance of these two lineages of zzso influenza zzso
