zzso zzso proteins zzso play pivotal roles in cellular zzso gene transcription, and zzso metabolism in zzso and zzso In this study, a putative zzso zzso referred to as zzso was isolated from the Asian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso consisted of 725 zzso and zzso a protein of 204 zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicated that zzso was a member of the zzso zzso The zzso structure of this zzso which was common among zzso multifamily members, spanned 1,900 zzso and included four zzso and three zzso Gene expression analysis revealed that zzso was highly expressed in the zzso phase of zzso development, with peak expression observed in the fat bodies of the zzso phase zzso The zzso transcripts in the fat body were zzso by exposure to dietary fatty acids such as zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, and zzso zzso zzso factor binding sites for zzso zzso and functional zzso binding site, which were respectively associated with tissue expression and zzso zzso were detected in the zzso promoter zzso The evidence provided in the present study suggests that zzso may regulate insect growth and development, and zzso zzso
