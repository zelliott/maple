The function of a putative zzso zzso was investigated in zzso zzso zzso The protein is predicted to be a type 2 membrane protein with a signal zzso Two independent zzso lines with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 1 zzso gene were zzso The gene was shown to be expressed in all zzso but particularly in vascular zzso of leaves and zzso Analysis of cell wall zzso isolated from leaves and stems showed that zzso content was reduced to about zzso and zzso respectively, of zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated a specific decrease in zzso with no change in other zzso zzso or in zzso The cellular structure of the stem was also not zzso zzso zzso I from zzso zzso contained only about zzso of the zzso amount of zzso confirming the specific zzso in zzso zzso analysis showed that the small amount of zzso present in zzso tissue was structurally similar to that of the wild zzso Transformation of zzso plants with the zzso gene driven by the zzso promoter led to full zzso of the zzso but none of the zzso had more zzso than the zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso is an zzso zzso To our knowledge, the identification of other zzso has not been zzso
