zzso zzso and zzso zzso are closely related large zzso class I zzso Each contains a zzso zzso domain of approximately 200 zzso which is thought to permit them to zzso zzso zzso zzso that has been zzso with a chemically similar but zzso zzso zzso We describe the first crystal structure of a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso at zzso A zzso The overall architecture is similar to that of zzso zzso except that the putative editing domain is inserted at a different position in the primary zzso This feature is unique to zzso zzso zzso as is the presence of a novel additional zzso inserted zzso zzso of native zzso and complexes with zzso and a zzso zzso analogue shows that binding of the zzso zzso of zzso causes significant zzso changes in the active site required for zzso acid zzso and tight binding of the zzso These changes are zzso to more distant regions of the zzso leading to a significantly more ordered structure ready for the subsequent zzso and/or editing zzso
