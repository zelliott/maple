Because of the extreme genetic zzso of zzso C virus zzso we analyzed whether specific zzso are differently prone to develop resistance to linear and zzso zzso zzso 

The study includes zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso patients infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso 3 zzso 4 zzso 5 zzso and 6 zzso zzso was calculated as the sum of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso were analyzed zzso zzso analyses on zzso and on putative zzso have been also zzso 

Overall, zzso was moderately zzso with zzso zzso zzso showing zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso positions zzso were fully zzso zzso zzso zzso highlighted that most of the zzso involved in zzso were highly zzso while 7 zzso zzso together with selected zzso located in proximity of the zzso pocket, were highly variable among zzso Four zzso zzso were found as natural zzso in selected zzso zzso present in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso present in zzso zzso zzso present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso specifically showed zzso zzso zzso at two zzso zzso Regardless of zzso 13 zzso zzso were associated with low zzso requiring only 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, by using zzso as reference zzso zzso led to a lower zzso for the development of some zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The high degree of zzso genetic zzso makes zzso and even zzso differently prone to the development of zzso zzso Overall, this can account for different responsiveness of zzso to zzso with important clinical implications in tailoring individualized and appropriate zzso
