To provide rapid and accurate prenatal genetic diagnosis for a fetus with high risk of zzso A zzso 

Based on zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso of the parents, particular zzso of the zzso gene were screened at 10th zzso week with amplification zzso zzso system zzso zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso and direct DNA zzso 

zzso screening has identified abnormal double zzso in the zzso products of zzso 1 and 10, whilst only a single peak was detected in normal zzso zzso of zzso specific zzso derived a specific product for the zzso zzso whilst no similar product was detected in normal zzso zzso of zzso products confirmed that zzso 1 and 10 of the zzso gene from the fetus contained a zzso paternal zzso del zzso zzso deletion and a zzso maternal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which resulted in a compound zzso zzso 

The fetus was diagnosed with zzso A syndrome and a zzso similar to the zzso zzso of the pregnancy was zzso Combined zzso zzso and DNA sequencing are effective for rapid and accurate prenatal diagnosis for fetus with a high risk for zzso A zzso Such methods are particularly suitable for early diagnosis when zzso is zzso Furthermore, combined zzso and zzso are suitable for rapid processing of large numbers of samples for the identification of new zzso
