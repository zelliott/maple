To determine the cause of an epidemic of zzso in zzso 

Laboratory examinations were made of eyes and brains of a large number of zzso using zzso zzso zzso electron zzso zzso methods, and zzso with zzso zzso In addition, potential insect viral zzso identified during the disease outbreak were examined for specific viral zzso zzso 

For zzso analysis, 55 apparently blind and 18 apparently normal wild zzso and zzso were obtained from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western zzso A total of zzso wild zzso and zzso (including 23 animals with apparent zzso were examined zzso 

zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from zzso affected with zzso in a major epidemic in zzso Australia in 1994 and 1995 and extending to Western Australia in zzso zzso examinations showed severe zzso and inflammation in the eyes, and mild inflammation in the zzso In affected zzso zzso virus zzso was detected by zzso analysis and zzso were seen in electron zzso There was zzso variation in the newly isolated zzso virus from archival zzso virus that had been isolated in northern zzso There were also variations of up to zzso in zzso sequence from the reference archival zzso zzso chain reactions showed that zzso virus was present during the epidemic in three species of zzso zzso zzso C zzso and C zzso zzso virus zzso acid was also detected by zzso in a zzso zzso taken from a blind zzso in zzso 

zzso virus and perhaps also zzso virus are the cause of the outbreak of zzso in zzso Other viruses may also be involved, but the evidence in this paper indicates a zzso of zzso virus, an zzso transmitted by zzso has the strongest zzso association, and zzso analysis implicates it as the most damaging factor in the affected zzso
