In order to isolate promoters of mouse zzso zzso zzso we used inverse zzso with highly overlapped zzso corresponding to the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso primer sets only covered a zzso to zzso region of the zzso zzso and zzso mouse zzso DNA was used as a zzso zzso Only one band for each zzso was seen after zzso The amplified DNA fragments could direct zzso production when the zzso coding sequence was zzso after the zzso The sequence of the zzso which zzso to the type II zzso showed partial zzso with the promoter region of the human zzso type II zzso Thus, the inverse zzso with highly overlapped zzso could be an easy way to isolate the promoter regions of many zzso
