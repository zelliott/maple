zzso have been introduced in the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso in order to convert its zzso selectivity from a specificity towards zzso into a preference for zzso In the zzso zzso five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected on the basis of a sequence alignment with zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso two of the five zzso mentioned above zzso zzso have been used in combination with another one designed from zzso considerations zzso Both zzso exhibit a zzso selectivity at the advantage of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso In order to zzso the zzso site plasticity at the molecular level, crystal structures of these zzso have been zzso when zzso with either zzso zzso resolution zzso A, R zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso or zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso zzso A, zzso The four refined models are very similar to that of the zzso zzso and as expected resemble more closely the zzso form than the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso low affinity for zzso seems to be essentially retained because of repulsive zzso contacts between the extra zzso and the unchanged zzso group of zzso zzso Such an zzso effect is not well compensated by putative attractive interactions which had been expected to arise from the zzso zzso In this zzso recognition of zzso is slightly affected with respect to that known on the zzso because zzso only zzso destabilize hydrogen bonds and van der zzso contacts originally present in the natural zzso Thus, the zzso zzso does not mimic efficiently the zzso zzso and long-range and/or zzso effects, not easily predictable from visual inspection of three-dimensional structures, need to be taken into account for designing a true zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the case of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso are practically reversed with respect to those of the zzso The strong zzso of the affinity for zzso obviously proceeds from the suppression of the two zzso hydrogen bonds between the zzso zzso and zzso positions and the zzso zzso zzso As expected, the efficient recognition of zzso is partly promoted by the removal of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso hindrance zzso zzso Another interesting feature of the reshaped zzso site is provided by the local stabilization of the extra zzso which forms a hydrogen bond with the zzso zzso group of the zzso zzso When compared to the presently known natural zzso zzso this result clearly demonstrates that an absolute need for a zzso involving the zzso is not required to switch the zzso selectivity from zzso to zzso In fact, as it is the case in this zzso only a moderately polar hydrogen bond can be sufficient to make the extra zzso of zzso well recognized by a protein zzso
