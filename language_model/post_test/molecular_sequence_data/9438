The sequence specificity of the zzso drug, zzso was determined in a DNA sequence that contained seven zzso repeats and a run of ten consecutive zzso zzso zzso zzso forms DNA zzso at consecutive zzso zzso Hence these DNA sequences were examined in order to gain an insight into the important human zzso regions that are damaged by zzso A zzso zzso amplification zzso was employed with an automated DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso detection to zzso determine the DNA sequence specificity of zzso in a zzso clone containing seven zzso repeats and a sequence of ten consecutive zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso damaged the ten consecutive zzso sequence although the zzso DNA sequences were also a major site of zzso zzso zzso
