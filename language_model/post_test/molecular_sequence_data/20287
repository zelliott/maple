zzso Aedes aegypti were engineered to express a zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso in the zzso zzso to trigger zzso interference zzso and generate resistance to dengue virus type 2 zzso in the zzso Here we characterize zzso and zzso zzso of one line, zzso between generations zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was integrated at a single site within a zzso region of the zzso zzso The virus resistance zzso was strong until zzso and suppressed replication of different zzso zzso From zzso the resistance zzso to zzso became weaker and eventually was zzso Although the sequence of the zzso was not zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso was not detected and the zzso zzso mosquitoes lost their ability to silence the zzso zzso
