zzso grass zzso zzso zzso zzso clones zzso the group II zzso zzso g II were previously isolated on the basis of zzso of human, zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso protein expressed as a fusion protein with zzso zzso sequencing reveals an open reading frame predicting expression of a zzso zzso zzso exhibiting zzso zzso zzso with the group II zzso of zzso zzso zzso p zzso In zzso translation of different sized clone fragments generated by zzso chain amplification confirms zzso expression of a zzso zzso by zzso and the position of a zzso stop apparently zzso during expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The unusual characteristics of the zzso fusion proteins may be exerting zzso zzso in zzso g II, as reflected by previous demonstrations of differences in human zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis using zzso partial and full-length zzso suggests that group II zzso may be zzso by a different family or families of temporally expressed genes from those zzso group I major zzso although a group I gene may have been the zzso
