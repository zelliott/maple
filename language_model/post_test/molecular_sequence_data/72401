The zzso position of the ancient family zzso within the zzso class zzso as well as the relationships of its Recent zzso and species, were assessed using an zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso c zzso I) approach to zzso zzso In order to orient the zzso within zzso partial zzso zzso sequences were determined for 7 zzso and 22 other zzso that span the major groups within the class as well as for one zzso and two zzso which serve as zzso zzso analyses of a sequence of approximately 450 base pairs zzso near the zzso end of the zzso zzso support the zzso of the following higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso sequences and 579 zzso of zzso c zzso I zzso analyzed separately and together, indicate that zzso are included within zzso but comprise a zzso that is the sister group to the other families referred to this zzso zzso of the zzso is also supported by the unique presence of seven separate zzso zzso in length from 1 to 68 zzso within the V2 variable region of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and species within zzso are fully resolved using zzso molecular zzso consisting of partial sequences of zzso zzso and zzso and including data on length variation within the zzso
