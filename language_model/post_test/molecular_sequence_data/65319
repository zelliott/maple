A zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso sand in Korea and then characterized using a zzso zzso zzso were short rods zzso zzso zzso zzso and were zzso (each cell having at least one zzso zzso were zzso zzso circular and convex with clear zzso Growth of the strain was observed at zzso degrees C, pH zzso and zzso zzso up to zzso % zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed a clear affiliation between the novel strain and members of the zzso zzso The sequence similarities between zzso and type strains of the zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso However, zzso zzso between the isolate and type strains of other related species produced low values zzso zzso The major zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso cellular fatty acids were 18 : zzso zzso zzso and 18 : 0 zzso zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso traits and data from the comparative zzso zzso sequence analysis, strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
