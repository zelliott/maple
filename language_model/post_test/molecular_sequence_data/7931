Major targets for zzso associated with the development of zzso diabetes zzso zzso include zzso fragments with a molecular mass of 37 zzso and/or 40 zzso of a pancreatic zzso cell zzso of unknown zzso The zzso identifying zzso against the zzso zzso in human zzso is based on the zzso of zzso rat zzso cell proteins with zzso from zzso patients, followed by limited zzso zzso of the zzso zzso To identify zzso clones coding for the zzso zzso we have screened a zzso expression library from rat zzso cells with a serum from an zzso patient that zzso the zzso zzso in our zzso Among the zzso products that reacted with the zzso serum, we identified one zzso clone whose open reading frame encodes a protein with a predicted mass of 105 zzso that we termed zzso for zzso zzso cell zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence has high zzso to a recently cloned putative zzso zzso zzso from human and mouse zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso results in a zzso with the expected molecular mass of 105 zzso The evidence that zzso is indeed the precursor of the zzso zzso fragments is based on the following three zzso zzso zzso from zzso patients containing zzso to the zzso zzso zzso the in zzso translated zzso whereas zzso from healthy subjects as well as zzso from zzso patients not zzso with the zzso zzso do not zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the in zzso translated protein with zzso containing zzso to the zzso zzso followed by limited zzso zzso of the zzso proteins results in a zzso zzso zzso The protein derived from our zzso but not from an unrelated control zzso clone can block zzso of the zzso zzso from a labeled rat zzso cell zzso The availability of the cloned zzso zzso should facilitate the identification of individuals at risk of zzso with increased zzso Furthermore, the identification of the zzso zzso as the putative zzso zzso zzso is of relevance in zzso the role of this zzso in the development of zzso
