zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso are two newly identified zzso zzso zzso Our recent studies suggest that disruption of zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of human leukemia and zzso The zzso transcripts for zzso and zzso share an identical sequence at the zzso untranslated region zzso zzso and in part of the coding zzso however the other regions of the transcripts diverge from each other and it was not clear whether the differences resulted from alternative zzso or zzso from two distinct zzso Here we describe the assignment of both zzso zzso to the same 16 zzso DNA segment located on zzso zzso Despite the presence of at least three zzso products of zzso zzso in the human zzso only the 16 zzso structural zzso gene on zzso 1 is actively zzso In addition, multiple zzso sites and a rare zzso zzso were found within the zzso zzso zzso initiation site of the zzso gene was determined by primer zzso analysis of the zzso promoter revealed that it lacks the zzso box but contains a zzso zzso When cloned into a zzso reporter and zzso into human cells, the zzso promoter construct generated zzso activity that was at least 2000 fold greater than the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that at least five different zzso and zzso transcripts are expressed in a broad range of human zzso
