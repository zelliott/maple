The zzso gene encodes a protein that, in zzso form, is associated with obesity and type II diabetes in zzso zzso analysis has revealed no similarities to other zzso however, and no clues as to possible zzso The possibility nonetheless remains that zzso is functionally or zzso related to other zzso whose sequences are divergent to the point that only a comparison of three-dimensional structures might detect zzso To explore this possibility, we conduct a zzso search of a zzso structure database, to determine whether the zzso protein might adopt a fold similar to any known zzso This search reveals that the zzso sequence is zzso at a significance level of P zzso zzso with structures from the family of zzso zzso that includes zzso and growth zzso A structural model of zzso based upon these results is physically and biologically plausible and leads to testable predictions, including the prediction that zzso may activate the zzso pathway, via binding to a zzso resembling those of the zzso zzso
