zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso reduce zzso zzso zzso in the three intervals tested, as much as zzso but have no zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to within 1 zzso of zzso The gene was cloned by genetic zzso and its zzso sequence zzso zzso analysis and gene replacement confirmed that the clones contained the zzso gene on DNA fragments as short as zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso predicted that zzso had a 49 zzso zzso separating two zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso This predicted zzso was confirmed by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso During zzso induced zzso in a zzso zzso zzso the zzso transcripts were induced to zzso levels at zzso but were present at much lower levels before and after this zzso The transient induction of the transcripts and the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that the zzso gene product is required during the early stages of zzso for zzso zzso
