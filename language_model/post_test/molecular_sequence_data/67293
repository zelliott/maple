zzso are extensively associated with insects, playing key roles in insect defense, nutrition and zzso Most of the associations reported involve zzso Despite the fact that zzso associated with insects were shown to produce zzso barriers against pathogens to the hosts or to their food and zzso there are few studies focusing on their association with zzso Thus, we surveyed the zzso diversity on a specific region of the zzso of seven species of zzso zzso zzso known to carry a diversity of zzso zzso 

A total of 34 zzso were placed in 11 different zzso zzso zzso zzso held the highest diversity with six zzso families represented by nine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) were all associated with three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) had the lowest diversity, being associated with two zzso and zzso and one zzso families, zzso zzso and zzso were the most common families with zzso from three different insect species each zzso 

Many zzso shared a low zzso zzso gene similarity with their closest type strains and formed new zzso lines on the periphery of several zzso This is a strong indicative that zzso zzso can harbor new species of zzso which might be derived from specific associations with the species of zzso zzso Although the well-known role of zzso as a source of zzso the ecological features of these zzso on the zzso biology remain zzso
