The X-ray crystal structure of the zzso zzso C zzso from the human pathogen zzso zzso has been determined both in free form at zzso A resolution, and in complex with the competitive inhibitor zzso at zzso A zzso The structure was solved by a combination of molecular replacement using the structure of zzso zzso zzso and single zzso zzso The zzso consists of a single zzso zzso domain with the active site located at the zzso side of the zzso Unlike other zzso zzso the barrel in zzso is open because it lacks hydrogen bonding interactions between zzso V and zzso zzso binds to the active site pocket by making specific hydrogen bonding interactions with a number of charged zzso acid zzso as well as a zzso stacking interaction with a zzso zzso Despite a relatively low sequence identity of approximately zzso the structure is highly zzso to that of zzso zzso with an zzso zzso for zzso common C alpha positions of zzso zzso zzso differences are found for loop regions that accommodate most of the numerous zzso acid insertions and zzso The active site pocket is also well zzso with only two zzso acid replacements directly implicated in zzso zzso
