zzso are zzso zzso bacteria that reside and replicate in zzso by zzso host cell defenses and modulating cellular zzso including host cell gene zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso influence host gene zzso have largely remained zzso Numerous zzso and tandem zzso proteins associated with zzso interactions have been identified in zzso species, but their roles in zzso are zzso In this study, we determined by zzso zzso zzso and by zzso in zzso nuclear extracts that the zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with DNA sequencing revealed an zzso zzso zzso interaction located within host promoter and zzso zzso zzso the most abundant repetitive elements in the human zzso A specific zzso zzso motif within zzso elements was identified using zzso mobility shift and zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso and DNA zzso analysis zzso determined that genes zzso zzso zzso with promoter zzso elements primarily related to transcription, zzso zzso activity, and structural proteins associated with the nucleus and zzso zzso were the primary targets of zzso Several zzso target genes zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso zzso were strongly zzso during infection, as determined by quantitative zzso This is the first study to identify a nuclear zzso of zzso zzso protein by zzso zzso and to identify a specific binding motif and genes that are primary targets of a novel molecular strategy to zzso host cell gene expression to promote survival of the zzso
