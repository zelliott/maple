During routine zzso of 180 juvenile hard clams, zzso zzso from a site in Virginia, USA, in 2007, we discovered a single individual heavily infected with a zzso resembling a zzso some members of which cause lethal zzso zzso zzso electron zzso of spores and sequencing of small zzso zzso DNA confirmed a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Further sampling of clams at the site found zzso up to 38% using zzso chain reaction zzso No zzso were found in routine zzso screening of the same individuals, but zzso of clams judged positive by in zzso zzso zzso revealed very faintly zzso zzso No unusual zzso have occurred among the sampled zzso Analysis of clams from Massachusetts to Florida by zzso failed to detect the zzso but a zzso found in a clam from New Jersey in 2001 was subsequently identified by zzso as zzso zzso No other zzso have been reported in thousands of hard clams from the US east coast examined zzso since the zzso The discovery underscores critical questions about how to assess the risks associated with zzso in groups known to be zzso but that themselves are not considered a zzso
