DNA zzso beta zzso zzso is important for the base zzso repair zzso zzso zzso of Pol beta is frequently found in cancer cells and is thought to be associated with zzso In this study, we examined zzso zzso in extracts derived from a human zzso cell line that over expresses Pol beta compared to normal control zzso Using an in zzso zzso zzso we found an increased rate of zzso zzso arising during DNA repair in zzso extracts derived from the Pol zzso zzso We demonstrate that the addition of excess Pol beta to a control cell extract enhances the zzso potential of the zzso Furthermore, using cell extracts and zzso Pol zzso we demonstrate that the mechanism of zzso formation involves zzso of Pol beta during the zzso zzso step of zzso and that this zzso is fixed by zzso synthesis zzso by an excess of Pol zzso
