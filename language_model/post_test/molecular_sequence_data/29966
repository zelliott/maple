The zzso clones zzso two chicken zzso zzso family zzso containing genes zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of their zzso acid sequences with another chicken zzso family zzso protein and with those of mouse zzso revealed that strong zzso are located in the zzso terminal regions and around the zzso Although zzso in other regions were relatively low, some short zzso sequences were also zzso zzso zzso full length proteins were zzso and used for the production of specific zzso and for DNA binding zzso The binding profiles of these proteins to the zzso and zzso sequences of zzso and zzso coding regions were analyzed by zzso and zzso I footprint zzso These two zzso proteins bound to the same sites in the zzso sequences of their coding regions with various affinities and their binding affinities to each site were nearly the zzso The consensus sequences of the high and low affinity binding sites were zzso and zzso zzso A clustered binding site was identified in the zzso of the zzso zzso suggesting that this clustered binding site works as a zzso element for zzso and/or zzso of zzso gene zzso
