zzso bacteria possess an outer membrane layer which zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso To overcome this barrier, bacteria have developed several systems for protein zzso The type V zzso zzso encompasses the zzso zzso the zzso zzso system, and the recently described type zzso or zzso family of zzso Since its discovery in the late 1980s, this family of zzso proteins has expanded zzso due largely to the advent of the zzso age, to become the largest group of zzso proteins in zzso zzso Several of these proteins play essential roles in the zzso of bacterial infections and have been characterized in detail, demonstrating a diverse array of function including the ability to zzso host cell zzso and to zzso zzso However, most of the zzso proteins remain to be zzso In light of new discoveries and controversies in this research field, this review considers the zzso zzso process in the context of the more general field of bacterial protein zzso and zzso zzso
