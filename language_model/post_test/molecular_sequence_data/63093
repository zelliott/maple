To search DNA zzso difference between zzso twins zzso for bipolar disorder, we applied a comprehensive zzso scan method, zzso zzso difference analysis zzso to zzso cells derived from the zzso zzso isolated 10 DNA fragments derived from zzso region of known zzso Among these 10 regions, four regions showed DNA zzso differences between bipolar twin and control zzso confirmed by zzso zzso We performed a zzso study of DNA zzso status of these four regions by zzso Two regions, upstream regions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso DNA zzso status in bipolar zzso zzso a gene on X zzso showed significantly higher DNA zzso level in female patients with bipolar disorder compared with control zzso However, there was no difference of zzso zzso In zzso DNA zzso level was significantly lower in patients with bipolar II disorder than in zzso The expression level of zzso was significantly higher in bipolar II disorder than in zzso We found strong inverse correlation between gene expression and DNA zzso levels of zzso These results suggest that altered DNA zzso zzso of zzso might have some significance in zzso of bipolar zzso
