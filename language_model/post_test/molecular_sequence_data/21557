Respiratory zzso virus zzso is the most common respiratory pathogen in infants and young zzso The zzso of this infection in the respiratory system has been studied zzso but little is known about its consequences in other zzso We studied whether zzso zzso human bone zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso and in zzso and investigated whether and how this infection affects zzso structure and zzso support zzso zzso human zzso were infected in zzso with zzso zzso expressing green fluorescent zzso In addition, zzso from zzso zzso was amplified by zzso and the products were zzso to confirm zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso by zzso for zzso Finally, we analyzed infected zzso for the expression of multiple zzso and zzso evaluated their zzso support capacity, and measured their zzso activity for both zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso support zzso replication in zzso with efficiency that varies among cell lines derived from different zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso to the zzso zzso were found in zzso primary human zzso zzso infection disrupted zzso zzso zzso altered zzso expression patterns, decreased the ability of zzso to support B cell zzso and modulated local zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso human zzso in zzso and this infection has important structural and functional consequences that might affect zzso and immune zzso Furthermore, we have amplified viral zzso from zzso primary zzso suggesting that in zzso these cells provide zzso with an zzso zzso
