zzso previously known as zzso belongs to the zzso family of protein zzso We report the isolation and characterization of the complete gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso The gene contains seven zzso spanning over 6 zzso of zzso DNA, and the zzso boundaries zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso gene mapped on mouse zzso 2, which is consistent with the known region of zzso with human zzso zzso The length of the individual zzso ranged from 82 to zzso zzso and zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso The further zzso zzso region of the gene showed features of a zzso promoter, such as the lack of a zzso zzso box and the presence of a zzso box as well as several zzso boxes, which are potential binding sites for numerous zzso zzso Additionally, we performed a basic analysis of the zzso activity of the promoter and found that the 364 zzso of zzso zzso zzso region were able to elicit high zzso levels of a zzso reporter gene in zzso zzso This study provides the molecular basis for understanding the zzso control of the zzso zzso and could serve to facilitate the molecular genetic investigation of zzso function during mouse zzso zzso
