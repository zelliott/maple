zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso genes were studied during development of pure cultures of rat zzso zzso and zzso The three cell types contained five zzso zzso produced using both alternative promoters and zzso one was specific for mature zzso The zzso gene is expressed only in zzso and the zzso gene in all three cell types, especially in immature zzso Most of the zzso zzso are highly zzso Their zzso regulation involves either differential expression of zzso in zzso and zzso and/or changes in alternative zzso in zzso zzso zzso may be important during the growth of zzso and zzso cell zzso while specialized zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso may be involved in the function or plasticity of the mature zzso
