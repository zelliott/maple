Human zzso zzso contained potent zzso activities for zzso human zzso cells in zzso zzso Because these activities were not replaced by known zzso zzso such as zzso growth factor or transforming growth factor zzso we sought to identify the breast cancer cell zzso by zzso and N alpha zzso zzso zzso acid extracts of outdated human zzso were concentrated by ammonium zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso columns in zzso zzso zzso zzso Two major activities were resolved by molecular sieve methods and zzso further by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were accomplished yielding zzso zzso zzso products that were homogeneous as determined by zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso The factors were identified as zzso growth factor I zzso and II zzso and truncated zzso by N alpha zzso acid zzso In zzso experiments, zzso zzso and zzso promoted multiple divisions of the zzso cells with zzso values of 12 and 100 zzso zzso The specific activities and other zzso characteristics of zzso zzso and zzso were similar to those of zzso human growth zzso This is the first report of the zzso of zzso growth factors from human zzso zzso
