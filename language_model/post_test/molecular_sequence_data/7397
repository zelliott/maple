Distribution and variation of two zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso elements were investigated in zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso screening revealed that zzso and internally deleted elements of both types occur in three geographic zzso strains and in the related species, zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate differences in the evolutionary zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso deleted zzso elements fall into two size classes present in all three zzso zzso In contrast, internally deleted zzso elements vary between the strains in number and zzso With respect to zzso location, zzso elements seem to be restricted to zzso zzso sites, whereas the positions of zzso elements appear to be geographically zzso In one strain of zzso zzso zzso elements seem to accumulate in the zzso zzso of a zzso segment shows zzso and zzso divergence of zzso zzso In a zzso segment of the zzso zzso no zzso were found, neither within nor between zzso This finding suggests recent zzso of zzso elements via zzso between zzso and zzso zzso identity and variation in zzso locations among different copies imply that zzso elements are zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso mobility cannot be zzso In a survey of several other zzso no zzso sequences were detected so zzso zzso the origin of the zzso zzso remains unknown, whereas the source of zzso elements can be traced back to the zzso zzso
