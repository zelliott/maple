We isolated two zzso T zzso zzso lines, which were independently obtained by mixed zzso cell culture from zzso zzso of a patient with pancreatic zzso Both lines behaved zzso in all the functional aspects tested and appeared to be zzso We analyzed their T cell zzso zzso gene structures, including zzso zzso zzso which are unique to each zzso zzso and contribute to zzso zzso Each line consisted of a zzso zzso expressing V alpha 18 and V beta zzso The alpha chain gene was composed of V alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha and the zzso zzso of V beta zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso The sequences were all zzso and therefore should yield functional zzso The zzso sequences were identical between the two zzso These data suggested that the two zzso clones having the same zzso had descended from a common precursor zzso The zzso expansion of zzso lines with the identical zzso implies that they are directed against the same tumor zzso which seemed to be zzso dominant in the specific interaction between the zzso and the zzso pancreatic zzso
