zzso zzso type 31 zzso is an zzso zzso neurodegenerative disorder showing progressive zzso zzso mainly affecting zzso zzso The zzso critical region was tracked down to a 900 zzso zzso in zzso zzso where the disease shows a strong founder zzso By performing comprehensive Southern zzso analysis and zzso and zzso sequencing, we isolated two genetic changes segregating with zzso One was a zzso change in an zzso of the zzso zzso 2 gene zzso However, this did not appear to affect zzso or expression zzso The other was an zzso from zzso zzso long, consisting of complex zzso repeats including a long zzso zzso In controls, shorter zzso zzso insertions lacking zzso were found only zzso The zzso repeat zzso length zzso correlated with patient age of zzso and an expansion was documented in a single family showing zzso The repeat zzso was located in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso expressed in the brain and formed zzso zzso in the zzso of patients' zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso showed that essential zzso factors, zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso bind to zzso in zzso Because zzso is a characteristic sequence of zzso zzso we speculate that the zzso might have originated from zzso zzso is important because it exemplifies human diseases associated with zzso zzso repeats that can expand through zzso Our finding suggests that the zzso zzso zzso when zzso might cause a disease involving the essential zzso zzso
