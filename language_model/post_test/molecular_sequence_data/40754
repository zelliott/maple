zzso zzso zzso play an important role in human health through the metabolism and trafficking of cholesterol as well as providing the zzso for steroid hormone zzso These particles contain zzso primarily zzso and zzso and progress through various structural forms including zzso zzso and zzso entities as cholesterol zzso and zzso are zzso The zzso form of HDL is stabilized in solution by two zzso belts of zzso Previous protein engineering of the zzso sequence has led to a series of zzso zzso zzso termed membrane scaffold proteins zzso which have shown great value in assembling zzso soluble membrane zzso termed zzso of homogeneous size and composition and in the assembly of numerous integral membrane proteins for zzso and zzso zzso In this communication we document a protein engineering approach to generate and zzso an extended zzso zzso which will zzso zzso into larger zzso with diameters of zzso zzso We extensively characterize these structures by size exclusion zzso and solution X-ray zzso
