A zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso which was isolated from zzso sand in zzso city, Korea, was characterized on the basis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso represents a new lineage within the zzso sequence similarities between strain zzso and members of other related zzso were less than zzso zzso zzso zzso was also distinguished from related zzso based on differences in several zzso zzso zzso were straight or slightly curved rods and formed white colonies on zzso zzso The major zzso zzso was zzso 8 zzso and zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso traits together with results of comparative zzso zzso sequence analysis, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species in a new zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
