The zzso zzso of zzso cell acute zzso leukemia zzso produces zzso a zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso of zzso joined to the zzso zzso zzso zzso causes T cell and zzso leukemia in mice, blocks differentiation of cultured zzso zzso and zzso zzso through a mechanism accompanied by zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso Here we investigate whether zzso gene expression also occurs specifically in the zzso subset of zzso cell ALL in zzso Two new zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso were zzso activated in each of seven zzso cell zzso zzso expression was extremely low in zzso from patients having zzso ALL not associated with the zzso and elevated more than zzso in zzso from patients with zzso ALL associated with the zzso zzso zzso expression was strong in brain and zzso the same zzso exhibiting the highest levels of zzso zzso zzso encodes a signaling protein containing a zzso binding domain zzso to that of zzso zzso regulators and two SAM zzso zzso to those in the zzso tail of zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso expression of zzso genes is a characteristic of zzso zzso zzso as was previously found in zzso transformed by zzso zzso zzso zzso could interfere with normal signaling controlling proliferation or zzso
