The use of molecular methods is altering our understanding of the microbial zzso and the complexity of the tree of zzso Here, we report a newly discovered zzso zzso zzso lineage named the zzso zzso using near-complete zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso demonstrate that this group represents an zzso distinct lineage branching with zzso and zzso zzso Environmental DNA sequencing revealed extensive diversity at North Atlantic, North Pacific, and European freshwater sites, suggesting a broad zzso and wide habitat zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrate that the zzso are often rare but can form transient zzso in the zzso Sea, where high zzso zzso gene copies zzso were detected in late zzso This pattern is consistent with these microbes being a member of the rare zzso whose constituents have been proposed to play important roles under zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso revealed that cells from this unique lineage were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso larger than zzso dominant zzso zzso and appear to contain two to four zzso The zzso are unique, zzso zzso zzso algae that are absent from zzso zzso models and current versions of the tree of zzso
