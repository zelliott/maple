zzso electron transfer from zzso domain to zzso domain in zzso oxide zzso zzso is dependent on the binding of zzso zzso Rate zzso for the binding of zzso to zzso target peptides was only determined previously by surface zzso resonance zzso zzso 35, zzso zzso suggesting that the binding of zzso to zzso is slow and does not support the fast electron transfer in zzso measured in previous and this zzso To resolve this contradiction, the binding rates of zzso Alexa 350 labeled zzso zzso zzso to target peptides from three zzso zzso were determined using zzso zzso All three target peptides exhibited fast zzso zzso at zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso orders of magnitude faster than those determined previously by zzso zzso rates of zzso target peptides from zzso complexes were measured by zzso zzso with zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso Our data suggest that the binding of zzso to zzso is fast and zzso competent for efficient electron transfer and is unlikely zzso in zzso zzso Only zzso was able to bind zzso zzso but in a very different zzso from its binding to zzso zzso
