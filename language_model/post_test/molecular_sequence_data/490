zzso zzso was used to study the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso sequence of zzso protein where, from zzso to zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso is zzso repeated three zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the three repeats zzso zzso peptides towards zzso zzso was examined at different pH values and, for zzso at different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques were performed to understand the details of metal binding sites and the zzso zzso of the zzso The results confirmed that each zzso sequence of zzso is able to independently coordinate one, two or three zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratios, zzso At higher pH values, the coordination of zzso involves zzso zzso of zzso and three preceding zzso zzso zzso from the zzso giving a zzso zzso zzso in a square zzso zzso In addition, at lower pH values, the involvement of zzso of zzso group from zzso zzso with the formation of a zzso giving a zzso zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso was zzso zzso results allowed us to build a model for the structure of the major zzso zzso changes in the zzso of the zzso with organized zzso and zzso side chain orientation promoted by zzso zzso were zzso
