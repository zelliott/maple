The zzso Genome Initiative has released up to now more than zzso of the zzso sequence of zzso zzso About zzso of the identified genes have at least one zzso In order to understand the biological function of individual zzso it is essential to study the structure, expression and organization of the entire zzso zzso A systematic analysis of zzso families, made possible by the amount of zzso sequence data available, provides important clues for the understanding of zzso evolution and zzso In this paper, four zzso families of zzso zzso are zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso Members of zzso and zzso have already been reported in zzso The zzso genes specify proteins containing motifs of zzso zzso No plant genes similar to the zzso genes have been reported to zzso The novel zzso family, most likely zzso encodes proteins with no identified zzso zzso and in zzso analysis led to the characterization of 29 novel genes belonging to these four gene zzso The organization, structure and evolution of all the members of the four families are discussed, as well as their zzso zzso zzso data of some of the zzso of each family are also zzso
