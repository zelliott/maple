Various zzso zzso have a higher concentration of zzso than zzso This zzso concentration zzso across the cell membrane is maintained by a zzso zzso zzso To understand the zzso role of the zzso zzso in the zzso we cloned a zzso zzso zzso zzso from a mouse retinal library, determined its zzso and pharmacological properties, and identified the specific cellular sites expressing the zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein sequence of the mouse retinal zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso sequence identity to the canine zzso rat brain, mouse brain, and human zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso and the mouse brain zzso zzso may be zzso of one zzso The zzso synthetic zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso transport activity in zzso zzso zzso that saturated with an average zzso of zzso zzso for zzso Unlike the previous studies, we determined the rate of zzso zzso as the external concentration of zzso was zzso a single zzso process with an average apparent equilibrium constant zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, the rate of zzso zzso showed a zzso dependence when the external concentration of zzso was varied zzso equilibrium constant, zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso dependence data suggest that at least two zzso and one zzso are required to transport one zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso the pH of the transport buffer also affected the rate of zzso zzso the rate showed a minimum between pH zzso and zzso and a maximum between pH zzso and zzso The zzso transport was inhibited by various zzso tested with the following order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity was not inhibited by the inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso but was inhibited significantly by the active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was both concentration and time zzso The cellular sites expressing the zzso zzso zzso in the mouse eye, as determined by in zzso zzso technique, showed low levels of expression in many of the zzso zzso specifically the zzso and the retinal zzso zzso zzso the highest expression levels of zzso zzso zzso were found instead in the zzso body of the mouse zzso
