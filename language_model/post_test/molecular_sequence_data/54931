An experimental study has shown that the structure of a zzso zzso proposed earlier is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have structures zzso from systems zzso (or zzso zzso (where R is the rest of the zzso zzso and X and Y represent the zzso side chains of the individual zzso acid zzso 

zzso zzso calculations were carried out at the zzso level of zzso 

The calculations suggest that zzso zzso are formed by zzso zzso processes involving either zzso the zzso zzso or zzso zzso as appropriate, or zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso at the backbone zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso bond zzso then zzso an zzso zzso processes which can occur along the zzso zzso
