zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene fork head proteins are prototypes of an extensive family of zzso zzso factors that share zzso in the winged zzso zzso zzso One of these zzso family members, zzso head zzso zzso was isolated by zzso amplification of zzso brain zzso and exhibits abundant expression in the adult zzso zzso In this study, we performed in zzso zzso of zzso mouse zzso and report on a novel expression pattern of the zzso gene in both the zzso and differentiated zzso zzso zzso which is responsible for the synthesis and zzso of zzso fluid zzso zzso We also showed that zzso is a potent zzso zzso in zzso zzso and defined several protein sequences important for zzso zzso zzso We used in zzso zzso site selection with zzso zzso protein and determined that the zzso protein recognizes the DNA consensus sequences zzso or zzso (where H is not G, W is A or zzso D is not C, and K is G or zzso We used this zzso consensus to identify potential zzso target genes in the zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated that these promoter sequences bind to zzso zzso protein in zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso formed specific zzso complexes with the promoter regions of the human zzso beta zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator and zzso zzso growth hormone zzso and zzso growth factor II zzso Furthermore, we identified putative zzso target genes in the zzso zzso including the zzso cell zzso protein gene and the zzso zzso a winged zzso family member involved in the zzso regulation of genes in the zzso zzso In support of these binding studies, zzso zzso show that zzso zzso expression of the zzso and zzso cell zzso protein promoter zzso
