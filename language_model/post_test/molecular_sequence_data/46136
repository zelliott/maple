The rapid growth of protein sequence databases has necessitated the development of methods to zzso derive zzso for zzso zzso Most such methods focus on zzso zzso such as molecular function or biological zzso zzso to supply zzso zzso zzso to functional sites based on structural information at the level of individual zzso acids are relatively zzso In this chapter we will describe a method we have developed for zzso of functional zzso within zzso proteins that relies on zzso site zzso rules zzso Site zzso derived from structural and experimental zzso These zzso Site Rules are manually defined to allow for conditional propagation of zzso Each rule specifies a zzso set of conditions zzso candidates for zzso must pass a zzso zzso test zzso is, have zzso match to a zzso zzso match a zzso profile zzso and, finally, match functionally and structurally characterized zzso of a zzso Positive matches trigger the appropriate zzso for active site zzso binding site zzso modified zzso or other functionally important zzso zzso The strict criteria used in this process have rendered zzso zzso suitable for zzso zzso
