zzso zzso profiling was used to reveal hydrogen zzso zzso regulatory mechanisms in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we focused on the role of the zzso zzso a known regulator of the zzso response in zzso The zzso profiles of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains that were exposed to 1 zzso zzso for 7 zzso or were not exposed to zzso were zzso Three classes of zzso genes were identified based on their expression patterns in the wild type of zzso zzso strains with differing predicted roles of oxidized and reduced zzso as zzso of zzso DNA binding studies revealed that zzso binds upstream of class I zzso which are induced by zzso and exhibit similar zzso levels of expression in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on class II zzso which are also induced by zzso but exhibit significantly lower zzso levels of expression in the zzso strain than in the zzso is zzso Interestingly, reduced zzso also activates expression of few genes zzso zzso The role of reduced zzso as an zzso is shown for the first zzso Our data reveal that the zzso response is fast and zzso In addition, we found that additional regulatory pathways are involved in the zzso zzso
