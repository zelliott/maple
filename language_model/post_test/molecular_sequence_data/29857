The zzso zzso of zzso coli binds to the operators of three zzso concerned with zzso zzso and regulates their zzso zzso zzso can repress expression of the zzso zzso in zzso at lower zzso zzso than those required by the zzso zzso The five known zzso have been zzso and characterized using a modified filter binding zzso In four of the five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso charged zzso zzso located on the surface of the zzso that faces the operator are replaced by positively charged or neutral zzso Each of these proteins has higher affinity for the zzso operator than zzso zzso zzso rates of zzso of the zzso complex were found to be responsible for the higher zzso The fifth zzso zzso has an zzso acid substitution in the turn of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso was indistinguishable from zzso zzso in our filter binding zzso We conclude that rapid zzso of zzso from operator is important for zzso zzso function in zzso The zzso charged zzso zzso that are replaced in zzso are probably responsible for the characteristic rapid zzso of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso
