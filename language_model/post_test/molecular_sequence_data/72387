zzso agents were isolated from the zzso of three wild mice zzso zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into laboratory zzso The laboratory mice developed clinical signs and zzso and three zzso were maintained by passage in zzso zzso were effective in preventing infection of mice with these agents, but zzso and zzso were zzso The agents did not grow in bacterial growth media or chicken zzso In zzso of blood from infected mice stained by the zzso or the indirect zzso method, numerous organisms were found on the surfaces of zzso zzso zzso revealed cell zzso zzso zzso of 350 to 700 zzso in zzso On the basis of these results, the zzso were identified as zzso zzso There was no zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso or other related zzso Western zzso analysis of three strains of zzso zzso with mouse zzso to zzso zzso revealed identical major zzso of zzso 65, 53, 45, and 40 zzso By zzso analysis of the three zzso segments of the zzso zzso zzso the three strains of zzso zzso were found to be zzso The zzso zzso genes of one of the zzso zzso zzso four strains of zzso zzso and two strains of zzso zzso were zzso and zzso The sequences of two strains of zzso zzso from cats in California were zzso as were the sequences of a strain from a cat in Ohio and a strain from a cat in Florida, but the similarity of sequences between the California and the zzso strains was only zzso The sequence of an zzso zzso strain was unique and was more closely related to that of the zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso than to that of the California strain of zzso zzso zzso The sequence of zzso zzso from a pig in Illinois was identical to that from another pig from zzso The similarity of the zzso zzso gene sequence of zzso zzso with those of three zzso strains was 84 to zzso with that of zzso zzso being most similar to that of the zzso zzso strain from zzso In the zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso formed a distinct zzso more closely related to zzso zzso (79 to zzso zzso than to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be reclassified in the same zzso in the family zzso
