The zzso light chains are components of zzso coated zzso structural constituents involved in zzso and membrane zzso The zzso light chain B zzso gene encodes two zzso termed zzso and zzso via an alternative zzso zzso zzso We have determined the structure of the rat zzso light chain B zzso The gene consists of six zzso that extend over zzso zzso The first four zzso and the last zzso are common to the zzso and zzso zzso The fifth zzso termed zzso is included in the zzso in brain, giving rise to the brain specific form zzso but is excluded in other zzso generating the zzso zzso zzso rat zzso cell cultures express predominantly the brain specific zzso zzso whereas primary rat cultures of zzso express only the zzso zzso suggesting that expression of the zzso zzso form is limited to zzso Further evidence for zzso zzso of the zzso form is provided using a zzso cell line, zzso which can be induced by zzso acid to express a zzso zzso zzso with the induction of the zzso zzso In order to determine the sequences involved in alternative zzso site selection, we constructed a zzso containing the alternative spliced zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso reflects the zzso pattern of the zzso gene upon zzso in zzso cell and primary zzso cell cultures, indicating that this region of the zzso gene contains all the necessary information for zzso zzso
