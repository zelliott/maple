zzso a member of the zzso family, activates receptors on specific growth cones, thereby zzso their zzso zzso a previously cloned zzso zzso has recently been identified as a candidate zzso for zzso We have completed the cloning of chick zzso and -5 and show that zzso zzso zzso and -5 bind to overlapping but distinct zzso zzso We zzso that in zzso there are distinct receptors with different affinities for zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, these four zzso all bind zzso zzso with similar zzso Strong binding to zzso is zzso by the zzso third of the zzso while the zzso domain zzso their unique binding patterns in zzso We propose that zzso is a common component of a zzso zzso complex, and that additional zzso expressed zzso components interact with the zzso zzso to zzso binding zzso
