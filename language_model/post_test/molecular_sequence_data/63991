The transport of zzso through the zzso pathways of zzso and zzso is pivotal for zzso zzso zzso This review focuses on the assembly and structural evolution of zzso zzso zzso transport carriers that are essential for the transport of zzso from the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso 

The assembly of zzso zzso to zzso transport carriers zzso with the coating of specific areas of the zzso zzso membrane with zzso and the zzso zzso An important advance has been the zzso analysis of the zzso zzso The proteins form a zzso shaped structure, with a zzso face that seems to match the zzso of transport zzso zzso cells produce two zzso of zzso designated zzso and zzso both of which are expressed in zzso zzso is defective in zzso retention disease and Anderson disease, two rare zzso disorders characterized by severe fat zzso and a failure to thrive in zzso Patients with zzso retention disease and Anderson disease selectively retain zzso particles within zzso zzso By zzso with zzso zzso may drive the formation of zzso zzso to zzso transport carriers from zzso zzso sites close to, but separate from, zzso of the zzso zzso coated with zzso The zzso machinery also mediates the transport of zzso to the zzso 

New insights into the role of the zzso machinery in the zzso transport of zzso including zzso and zzso may suggest new drug targets for zzso the zzso abnormalities of the zzso zzso
