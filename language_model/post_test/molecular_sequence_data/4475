Using methods based upon the zzso we have analyzed sequences that zzso the V domain of bovine zzso heavy zzso zzso comparison indicates that the heavy chain repertoire in cattle is dominated by a single zzso gene family that is zzso to human zzso The third zzso region zzso is particularly variable and zzso of the sequences zzso a zzso in excess of 21 zzso zzso Southern zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, and sequencing of segments from the zzso indicate that the dominant zzso gene family is of small size, zzso as few as 10 unique members, and carries a very low level of diversity in zzso 1 and zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences with those gathered from adult bovine zzso zzso demonstrates a pattern of zzso substitution that is consistent with diversification through zzso zzso
