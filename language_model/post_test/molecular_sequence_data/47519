zzso recruitment and zzso of zzso by zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction is critical for the zzso of zzso downstream of zzso damage in zzso Here we report the solution structure of the zzso zzso domain and its surface of interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of six tightly packed zzso zzso and is zzso similar to the zzso zzso with the exception of a zzso observed in the middle of the zzso zzso By using chemical shift zzso data, the zzso interaction was mapped to the zzso surface of zzso zzso centered around zzso 2 and zzso Interestingly, a significant portion of the chemically zzso zzso are zzso indicating that in addition to the zzso interactions predicted zzso zzso interaction is also an important driving force underlying the zzso zzso On the basis of the identified functional zzso of zzso zzso and the surface charge zzso we propose a model of zzso interaction between zzso and zzso
