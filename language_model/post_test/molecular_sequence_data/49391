A novel approach to isolation and functional characterization of the zzso zzso genes basing on the use of two strains of different origin is zzso One of these strains is better suited for the isolation of zzso DNA fragments, while the other is preferable for their functional zzso Thirty three zzso sequences governing expression of a reporter protein have been zzso Analysis of the sequence zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso revealed two zzso Another isolated DNA zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso V zzso zzso of the corresponding gene resulted in zzso of a zzso zzso zzso Y, into the culture zzso
