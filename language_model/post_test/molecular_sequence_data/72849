The zzso nuclear gene zzso identified through zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso a zzso zzso of the bacterial zzso protein zzso zzso analysis showed that the mature zzso is a zzso zzso component of the zzso 54 S large zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso are zzso and convert to zzso or zzso degrees ] zzso zzso indicating that zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso is regulated zzso in response to carbon source and the zzso of zzso is dependent on the presence of the 21 S large zzso zzso zzso showed that a highly zzso zzso acid sequence zzso to zzso of zzso is essential for zzso zzso of zzso for zzso the most highly zzso zzso in the zzso protein family, caused zzso respiratory growth but did not affect the assembly of 54 S zzso zzso zzso protein synthesis was normal in the zzso to zzso zzso zzso grown at the zzso temperature (30 degrees zzso and was severely impaired after growth at the zzso temperature (18 degrees zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso coli zzso which has been implicated in a direct involvement in zzso zzso zzso The conditional zzso of the zzso zzso indicates that zzso is not essential for zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso
