zzso are potent zzso agents that specifically target bacterial DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso use of these agents has contributed to the rise of bacterial zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso resistance arises by zzso in zzso zzso Recently, a zzso zzso was discovered that encodes zzso resistance to zzso We have cloned the zzso resistance zzso termed zzso and found it in an zzso environment upstream from zzso Delta 1 and zzso The gene product zzso was a zzso protein belonging to the zzso repeat family and shared sequence zzso with the immunity protein zzso which is thought to protect DNA zzso from the action of zzso zzso zzso had zzso repeat zzso of 11 and 28 tandem copies, separated by a single zzso with a consensus sequence of zzso zzso zzso X zzso Because the primary target of zzso is DNA zzso in zzso zzso we tested the ability of zzso to reverse the zzso of zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso protected zzso coli DNA zzso from zzso by zzso zzso protection was zzso to the concentration of zzso and zzso zzso to the concentration of zzso The protective activity of zzso was lost by boiling the protein and involved neither zzso zzso nor independent zzso zzso Protection of zzso IV, a secondary target of zzso action in zzso coli, was not zzso How zzso protects DNA zzso and the prevalence of this resistance mechanism in clinical zzso remains to be zzso
