There are two major zzso zzso testosterone zzso and zzso zzso which induce different responses in zzso These zzso regulate the target gene zzso via binding to and zzso the same zzso zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms that differ between these two very close zzso through the same zzso protein to target the distinct zzso responses remain zzso Using zzso genetic selection, we identified two kinds of zzso response elements zzso which could respond zzso to T zzso zzso These two zzso also show different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells in terms of copy number and comparisons with the classic mouse zzso tumor virus zzso Together, our results suggest that the selective ARE sequence may play an important role in the differential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
