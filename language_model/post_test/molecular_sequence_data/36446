Our previous reports showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso outgrowth in zzso cells, and that zzso zzso and zzso proteins from zzso cells zzso specifically from a zzso zzso affinity zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that the zzso zzso and zzso proteins are components of zzso well-known for its role in zzso zzso of zzso into its heavy and light chains showed that the zzso heavy chains have the ability to bind to a zzso affinity column zzso Furthermore, zzso enhances the rate of zzso of zzso zzso to the coat zzso zzso does not cause zzso outgrowth in zzso cells, and has no effect on the rate of zzso zzso On zzso analysis of zzso cells with an zzso heavy chain zzso enhanced zzso of the zzso heavy chain was observed zzso with zzso outgrowth initiated by zzso but not by zzso This study provides new insights into both the role of the zzso zzso and the regulatory mechanism of zzso zzso
