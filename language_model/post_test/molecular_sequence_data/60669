Several members of the ABC family of proteins have been implicated in zzso resistance associated with cancer zzso A novel member of this gene family, designated zzso has been identified using zzso zzso chain zzso The full-length zzso spans zzso base pairs and encodes an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids predicted to contain two sets of zzso zzso and two zzso binding zzso characteristic of ABC zzso The zzso sequence described zzso extends that of three recently reported zzso zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso van zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1997) Cancer zzso 57, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cancer zzso 90, zzso in the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis detected five transcripts that were zzso expressed in several tissue types, and the gene zzso zzso was mapped to zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso cells expressing a green fluorescent zzso construct confirmed plasma membrane zzso of the fusion zzso zzso of zzso resulted in reduced labeling with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso or zzso zzso consistent with zzso being an zzso zzso zzso export was zzso but zzso We also show that this export pump does not zzso resistance to various classes of zzso drugs but does provide small but significant resistance to zzso and zzso zzso zzso
