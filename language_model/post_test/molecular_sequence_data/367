In zzso zzso the essential gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso protein that interacts with zzso and zzso genetically and zzso and is required for zzso end protection and zzso length zzso The molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso in zzso length regulation and zzso end protection remains zzso In this work, we observed a weak interaction of zzso and zzso in a zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso itself exhibits a weak zzso activity, but enhances the zzso zzso zzso ability of zzso zzso is zzso with zzso In the zzso zzso or zzso cells, the impaired interaction between zzso and zzso results in much longer zzso as well as a decreased association of zzso with zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso proteins fail to stimulate the zzso zzso activity of zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso enhances the zzso zzso activity of zzso to zzso regulate zzso zzso
