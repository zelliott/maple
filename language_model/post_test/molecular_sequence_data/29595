zzso peptides of zzso A and B zzso and zzso were compared for zzso responses in isolated bovine coronary arteries zzso measuring diameter changes as a function of zzso zzso developed and maintained zzso tone zzso at approximately zzso from 50 to 150 zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso and zzso zzso both displayed significant intrinsic zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso from 70 to 150 zzso zzso zzso zzso At 75 zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso persisted at moderately elevated zzso zzso zzso However, this effect was diminished by zzso toxin zzso and abolished by zzso to several zzso of zzso channels zzso zzso and zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso domain of zzso has zzso effect in the zzso active zzso We propose that zzso and the naturally occurring zzso I are regulatory peptides of relevance for the coronary zzso and that a zzso zzso and zzso channel zzso may be involved in the signal zzso
