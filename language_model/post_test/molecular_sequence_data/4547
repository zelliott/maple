A search of the zzso zzso zzso data base for zzso zzso sequences identified a zzso pair open reading frame, located on zzso zzso at locus zzso zzso That gene encodes a putative zzso acid protein with an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso core domain shows a zzso identity and zzso similarity to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso identity and zzso similarity to the zzso core domain of zzso the zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain in zzso coli produces a soluble protein that exhibits the typical oxidized versus reduced differential zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso reveals other similarities to zzso Both proteins are predicted to have two zzso zzso each capable of spanning the membrane twice, and both have the zzso motifs that are characteristic of zzso fatty acid zzso These similarities to zzso suggested that zzso played a role in the zzso or modification of fatty zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso did not give any visible zzso and there was no zzso difference in content or distribution of the most abundant long chain saturated and zzso zzso fatty acid zzso Northern zzso analysis, however, showed that this gene is expressed at much lower levels ( approximately zzso than the zzso zzso suggesting that it might act on a smaller subset of fatty zzso Analysis of zzso very long chain fatty acids revealed an approximately zzso reduction of zzso zzso and a complementary increase in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso genes in the zzso strain restores zzso zzso fatty acids to wild type zzso Also identified are a number of zzso to this gene in other zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso which does not contain the zzso zzso domain, in the zzso strain produced an approximately zzso increase in zzso zzso and reduced the levels of its zzso zzso suggesting that it functions in very long chain fatty acid zzso using an alternate electron transfer zzso
