zzso is an alternative zzso factor that controls a large zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso requires zzso a protein zzso zzso zzso zzso In a closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso upon interaction with zzso a zzso which following an zzso stimulus switches from a zzso zzso complex, the zzso to the zzso domain of zzso Active zzso zzso zzso and thereby triggers the release of zzso from its zzso complex with zzso While zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso zzso proteins similar to zzso and the components of the zzso are not, raising the question of how zzso activity and hence zzso activity are controlled in zzso zzso We found that in contrast to the case in zzso zzso the induced expression of zzso was sufficient to stimulate zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso following alkaline stress did not lead to a clear zzso of zzso and its regulators zzso and zzso or to a change in the zzso ratio in zzso zzso When expressed in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso displayed a high activity even in the absence of an inducing zzso This high activity could be transferred to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso protein by a fusion to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the data suggest that the activity of the zzso zzso zzso and hence zzso may be subjected to different regulation in comparison to that in zzso zzso
