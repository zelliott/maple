The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso 2007) and other zzso strains of the zzso zzso described as belonging to the species zzso zzso or zzso zzso are used commercially to promote the growth and improve the health of crop zzso Previous investigations revealed that a group of strains represented a distinct zzso related to zzso zzso however, the exact zzso position of this group remains elusive zzso et zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrated the ability of a group of zzso strains closely related to strain zzso to colonize zzso zzso On the basis of their zzso traits, the strains were similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso but differed considerably from this type strain in the DNA sequences of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis performed with partial zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences revealed that the zzso strains of the zzso zzso including strain zzso formed a zzso which could be distinguished from the cluster of strains closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed with zzso DNA from strains zzso zzso and zzso yielded zzso values of zzso zzso Several methods of zzso analysis, such as direct zzso comparison, digital zzso and zzso comparative zzso zzso were used as complementary zzso The group of zzso strains could be distinguished from strain zzso zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso by differences in the potential to zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on the differences found in the marker gene sequences and the whole zzso of these zzso we propose two novel subspecies, designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso representatives, zzso This is in agreement with results of zzso and zzso tests and the zzso zzso of cellular zzso all of which suggested that the zzso represent two different zzso
