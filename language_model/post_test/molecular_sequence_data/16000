zzso zzso zzso methods have been used to make zzso resonance assignments for the 97 zzso acid zzso of the zzso from the green zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained for all backbone zzso and the majority of the zzso zzso Spin system identification relied heavily on the observation of relayed zzso to the backbone zzso zzso zzso assignments were made by using the sequential assignment zzso During this process, an extra zzso zzso was identified that had not been detected in the original zzso acid zzso zzso of regular secondary structure were identified from characteristic zzso zzso between backbone zzso zzso alpha zzso constant values, and the observation of slowly exchanging zzso zzso The protein in solution contains eight zzso one short segment of zzso five reverse turns, and five zzso The zzso may be arranged into two zzso on the basis of extensive zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso determined from the zzso experiments is that of a Greek key zzso and is similar to that observed for French bean zzso in solution and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso While the overall structures are similar, several differences in local structure between the zzso zzso and higher plant zzso have been zzso
