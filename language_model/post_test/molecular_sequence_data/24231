zzso is a key zzso zzso that plays a zzso role in innate zzso By employing zzso to search for genes zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso we identified a novel zzso transcript designated zzso zzso zzso in zzso by zzso zzso codes for a protein with seven zzso zzso a feature commonly shared with the G zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is most similar to the human orphan zzso zzso zzso % zzso and zzso (30 % zzso zzso zzso was readily induced in zzso after stimulation with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso was zzso in mice suffering from microbial zzso or from zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso locus revealed an zzso zzso open reading zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicates that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso maps to mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells with a zzso fusion construct showed zzso zzso at the cell surface, suggesting a zzso at the cell zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso is a new zzso representative of zzso with potential importance in zzso zzso
