zzso zzso from zzso zzso was isolated and characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso were zzso recently to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso The genes for the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso C (238 zzso and D zzso zzso of the zzso have been cloned by using zzso zzso deduced from zzso acid sequences of peptides isolated from the zzso zzso and zzso to be clustered in an zzso in the order of zzso The zzso was found to zzso more genes than zzso The zzso coli, transformed with the zzso containing the insert zzso and about zzso zzso of an upstream region, expressed the four zzso of the zzso but the proteins did not show zzso zzso It indicates that, like the zzso from zzso zzso and zzso pneumoniae, more genes are needed for the formation of the functional zzso zzso
