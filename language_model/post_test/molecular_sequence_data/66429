zzso zzso a complex of five zzso sibling species, is a major zzso of malaria in India and neighboring zzso The five species are zzso designated as species A, B, C, D, and zzso zzso zzso examination has been the only method available that zzso four members of this complex in areas where species E is not zzso However, this technique requires the mosquitoes to be in the zzso stage and thus limits its application to only about one fourth to one third of the total adult collection and excludes immature stages zzso For species zzso both zzso zzso examination and zzso zzso examination of F1 males are zzso A zzso chain reaction zzso zzso based on the D3 domain zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso zzso involving zzso of zzso are available for the discrimination of the members of the zzso zzso zzso However, both these can only differentiate species A and D from species B, C, and zzso We report here two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using sequence differences in the zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso species A and D, whereas the zzso zzso zzso species B, C, and zzso Thus, with a combination of two zzso zzso namely the zzso zzso followed by either the zzso or the zzso zzso it is possible to identify individual specimens of any of the species of this zzso This zzso system is the first, and the best available at present to distinguish all sibling species and especially to discriminate zzso species B from all the zzso species, A, C, D, and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Until another zzso method involving fewer steps is developed, this zzso system can be used in all malaria zzso studies where zzso zzso is zzso
