Eight zzso zzso strains of bacteria that were zzso zzso and able to reduce nitrate to zzso were isolated from soil beneath moist zzso and zzso zzso in northern zzso The DNA zzso contents for the strains ranged from zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that each strain belonged to the zzso zzso The highest level of zzso zzso gene similarity was found between the eight strains and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, despite relatively high zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso repetitive elements zzso and zzso analysis revealed that at least two of the strains differed from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and between strain zzso and strain zzso zzso zzso were below those recommended by the ad hoc committee for those belonging to the same zzso zzso zzso features that differentiate these novel strains from zzso zzso included their inability to zzso zzso and ability to zzso zzso as sole carbon zzso Unlike strains zzso and zzso strains zzso and zzso produced ethanol as an end product of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso and did not zzso zzso zzso zzso was the major zzso zzso and zzso : zzso was the most abundant fatty acid for strains zzso and zzso On the basis of these results, strains zzso and zzso are each considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are proposed, zzso The type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
