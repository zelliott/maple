Human zzso the zzso of zzso zzso is associated with a zzso protein whose zzso location and function is zzso We show here that the zzso open reading frame zzso which is zzso to this human zzso encodes the so far largest zzso zzso zzso green fluorescent protein zzso zzso was localized to the nuclear pores and therefore named zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso reveals association with zzso zzso is essential for cell zzso A zzso zzso zzso is neither impaired in nuclear import of a zzso nuclear zzso zzso reporter protein nor in zzso export, but association of zzso with nuclear pores is inhibited at the zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso is seen at the inner site of the nuclear zzso at a distance of 60 zzso 15 zzso from the central plane of the zzso This suggests that zzso is an zzso zzso structural component of the nuclear pore complex with a preferential location at the inner site of the nuclear zzso
