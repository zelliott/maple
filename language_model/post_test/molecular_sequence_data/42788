To characterize zzso rapidly in 43 patients with zzso major in Taiwan, we zzso a method of natural and amplified created restriction site zzso analysis for detection of zzso gene zzso After analysis, eight different point zzso were found among 86 known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accounting for 40 of the 86 zzso with zzso zzso zzso is the most common zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso in 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso in 7 zzso nonsense zzso 17 zzso in 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in 2 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in 1 zzso and zzso 3' end zzso in 1 zzso The first four zzso account for 80 of all 86 zzso of zzso major in zzso Furthermore, the zzso gene zzso was identified successfully in one zzso zzso biopsy for prenatal diagnosis and in zzso of blood from one patient who had received bone zzso transplantation zzso Complete diagnosis is possible in all of the Chinese families with zzso in Taiwan, and the first zzso prenatal diagnosis can be achieved simply by using only 13 zzso zzso and 10 restriction zzso This zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso sensitive, precise and safe method in detecting the zzso of zzso in zzso
