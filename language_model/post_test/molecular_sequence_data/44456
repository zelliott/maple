zzso zzso is a new class of widely distributed zzso zzso of potential importance in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To detect these organisms in the environment, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Two sets of specific zzso amplification zzso and two zzso zzso zzso were designed and tested against both closely and zzso related environmental zzso All of these zzso and zzso were specific to the species zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso amplification primer sets was evaluated with DNA isolated from zzso zzso zzso pure culture and from sterile zzso seeded with a known number of zzso and zzso coli zzso These primer sets were able to detect 1 zzso to 1 zzso of template DNA from the pure culture and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells per g of soil in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso These two zzso amplification zzso were also successfully tested at two field zzso The zzso identified the zzso zzso strains among the zzso bacteria isolated from a zzso zzso at Moffett Field, zzso Also, the presence of zzso zzso was detected in the groundwater samples from a zzso zzso at an industrial site in Detroit, zzso which showed zzso zzso zzso
