The evolutionary zzso of highly toxic proteins expressed in snake zzso zzso from proteins without toxic function and expressed in zzso zzso remains poorly zzso Here we examine gene structure of a representative of a zzso protein with an zzso zzso evolutionary zzso The structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was assembled from zzso sequences of overlapping zzso zzso The gene comprises 12 zzso interrupted by 11 zzso In a zzso model of the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso interrupting coding regions lie just after or between secondary structure zzso Long zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso short zzso nuclear zzso zzso and a zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso were identified within zzso 1, 3, 7 and zzso zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons between zzso zzso and its closest zzso zzso from a zzso Homo zzso and the zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso of these three proteins share zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso positions interrupted by each of the 11 zzso of the zzso zzso gene are entirely zzso in the zzso zzso and human zzso zzso However, the zzso and the human zzso genes contain 5 zzso not present in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso exhibit zzso and zzso distinctions in their inserted zzso These findings identify zzso as possible key elements in the recruitment and amplification process of zzso into the zzso zzso of extant zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing projects may shed light on this intriguing aspect of the emergence and evolution of zzso toxin zzso Furthermore, the organization of the zzso reported here provides a zzso explanation for the emergence of zzso zzso zzso zzso by short zzso
