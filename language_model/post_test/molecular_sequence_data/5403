To achieve expression of human mature zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell expression system, the zzso zzso region of full-length zzso was deleted using zzso chain reaction and the resulting zzso was cloned into zzso zzso After zzso into zzso insect cells and plaque zzso mature human zzso was zzso by the infected cells into the medium as determined by zzso zzso sequencing, and molecular weight zzso In both zzso cell cultures, and in suspension cell culture, maximum expression was achieved by the fifth zzso For the first 4 days, 50 to zzso of the zzso zzso was retained in the zzso This zzso zzso was represented by mature zzso as shown by zzso and zzso zzso Further incubation resulted in a sharp decrease in the cell zzso content without a corresponding increase in protein in the medium and most likely represents zzso degradation of the zzso We conclude that the deletion of the zzso while not preventing the correct zzso of zzso during zzso processing, results in reduced zzso of mature zzso The zzso cell expression system described in this study provides a useful method for producing zzso mature zzso and is a potential tool for understanding the function of zzso in zzso transport and zzso of zzso from zzso
