zzso and zzso are zzso components of zzso pits that are required for zzso zzso The most striking difference between these two related proteins is that zzso is also found in the nucleus, whereas zzso is excluded from this compartment at steady zzso To better understand the individual functions of these two zzso the mechanisms responsible for their different zzso were zzso Interestingly, some zzso of zzso were found in the zzso This nuclear zzso was correlated with the loss of the last approximately 100 zzso acids of zzso suggesting the presence of a nuclear export signal zzso within this zzso As expected, the last 25 zzso acids contain a zzso sequence matching with classical zzso show a zzso zzso nuclear export activity, and bind to the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso In contrast, no zzso could be found in zzso a result in keeping with its zzso nuclear zzso that appears to be regulated by alternative zzso Altogether, these results are the first characterization of zzso shuttling signals for zzso zzso They also provide an explanation for the different nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso and further evidence for a possible nuclear function for zzso protein family zzso
