Although the numbers of malaria cases in China have been declining in recent years, outbreaks of zzso zzso malaria were still being reported in rural areas south of the Yellow zzso To better understand the transmission dynamics of zzso zzso zzso in China, the extent of genetic diversity of zzso zzso populations circulating in zzso of zzso province of China were investigated using three zzso genetic zzso zzso surface proteins 1 and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso protein zzso 

zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso from zzso of zzso province were collected from 2009 to 2010 and were zzso using zzso or DNA zzso 

Seven and six distinct zzso zzso were identified using zzso analysis of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of zzso zzso block 5) revealed that there were zzso and zzso types but not zzso type, and seven distinct zzso zzso in zzso were zzso with zzso zzso 2 zzso being zzso zzso All the zzso carried zzso with zzso type but not zzso or zzso zzso types in the zzso zzso analysis of zzso gene revealed 12 distinct zzso zzso with zzso being zzso zzso 

The present data indicate that there is some degree of genetic diversity among zzso zzso populations in zzso province of zzso The genetic data obtained may assist in the surveillance of zzso zzso infection in endemic areas or in tracking potential future disease zzso
