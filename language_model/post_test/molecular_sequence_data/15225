zzso and zzso zzso hypotheses of schizophrenia have been proposed, prompting searches for zzso against viruses or brain structures, and for altered levels of zzso Previous experiments have shown that zzso zzso of the zzso heavy chain 3' zzso zzso are associated with several zzso diseases, suggesting a possible correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso To test this, we analyzed levels of serum zzso and zzso zzso in two independent zzso one of 88 schizophrenic zzso (24 zzso and a second of 133 healthy subjects zzso zzso Both groups were similar in the frequency of individuals with altered serum concentration of zzso classes and zzso zzso zzso zzso percent; zzso zzso With the possible exception of a stabilizing effect of olanzapine, no zzso drug consumed during the month prior to serum sampling in the schizophrenia group significantly affected zzso zzso In both patient and control zzso an increased frequency of the zzso zzso corresponded to increased zzso plasma levels, while an increased frequency of the zzso zzso corresponded to decreased zzso plasma zzso zzso analysis with nuclear extracts from human B cells showed that the zzso factor zzso bound to the zzso region of both zzso and zzso while zzso bound only to the zzso We predict that differences in zzso factor binding sites in the two zzso zzso of the 3' zzso zzso zzso may provide a mechanism by which differences in zzso expression are zzso
