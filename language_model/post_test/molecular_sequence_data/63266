zzso fatty zzso like zzso acid, can bind proteins and affect their zzso The zzso proteins bind zzso sites on a diverse array of client proteins and, in this way, are involved in many zzso signaling zzso In this study, we used a novel approach to discover that zzso is able to directly bind zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso acid, at zzso zzso reduced the binding of zzso to zzso zzso an interaction that is important in regulating zzso In addition, high zzso of zzso acid caused the zzso of zzso an event observed in neurodegenerative zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso acid directly interacts with zzso and that this interaction may be important in both normal and pathological cellular zzso If so, then factors that mediate the release, metabolism and zzso of zzso acid into zzso represent key points of zzso
