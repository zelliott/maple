zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso storage disorder caused by a zzso of N zzso zzso zzso has variable clinical zzso To date we have identified 65 zzso zzso in the zzso gene from zzso zzso patients, but the correlation between zzso and zzso has remained zzso We studied 17 zzso zzso using zzso approaches and 32 zzso zzso using structural zzso Fifteen zzso zzso and two newly engineered active site zzso zzso zzso were characterized by transient expression zzso zzso zzso except for zzso and zzso were zzso and detected as zzso precursor forms while the zzso and zzso zzso were of a soluble mature zzso zzso found in the severe zzso had no zzso zzso found in the mild zzso had a considerable residual activity zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso are members of a highly zzso gene family sharing an extensive sequence zzso Thus, a zzso structural model of human zzso was constructed from the X-ray crystal structure of N zzso and zzso A, using zzso zzso and 32 zzso zzso were zzso zzso we propose that there are at least three different reasons for the severe zzso zzso destruction of the zzso core or modification of the zzso zzso removal of a salt bridge to destabilize the entire zzso zzso modification of the active zzso In contrast, mild zzso were mostly located on the surface of the zzso zzso These studies shed further light on the zzso correlation of zzso zzso and zzso relationship in the zzso zzso
