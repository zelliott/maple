zzso zzso are widespread among zzso and studies in several systems have revealed that zzso can regulate expression of specific zzso zzso zzso transcripts are initially processed to approximately zzso zzso zzso structures zzso exported to the zzso further processed to yield approximately zzso zzso and finally incorporated into zzso zzso which are thought to be the active zzso Here we study nuclear export of zzso and show that the process is zzso and thus zzso Export is sensitive to depletion of nuclear zzso and, according to this zzso zzso by a zzso zzso An unbiased affinity zzso approach with immobilized zzso identified zzso 5 as the zzso export zzso We have cloned zzso 5 from zzso and demonstrate that zzso raised against the zzso zzso specifically block zzso export from zzso of zzso zzso We further show that zzso 5 interacts with zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
