zzso of this work is the analysis of molecular dynamics zzso zzso of zzso I zzso and II zzso and their complexes with the zzso zzso hormones zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, simulated in zzso zzso serve in the zzso zzso as carrier proteins for the hormones before their release to the zzso The starting data consisted of two pairs of different zzso for each of the zzso and zzso zzso and two more zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso (six zzso in zzso Using essential dynamics which, to our zzso is equivalent to factor analysis, we found that only about 10 degrees of freedom per trajectory are necessary and sufficient to describe in full the motions relevant for the function of the zzso This is consistent with these motions to explain about zzso of the total zzso of the zzso These principal degrees of freedom represent slow zzso zzso zzso clearly pointing at distinguished mobility of the atoms involved in the zzso zzso
