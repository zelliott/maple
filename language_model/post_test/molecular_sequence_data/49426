zzso zzso contains a zzso acid region with sequence similarity to the active site zzso motif of DNA zzso except for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity and replaces it with zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the results of substituting zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso specific activities and DNA binding values for the zzso proteins determined the range of zzso acids at position 43 that alter zzso zzso Substituting zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso maintained zzso activity, but at a lower zzso On the other hand, substituting positively charged zzso like zzso at position 43, converted zzso to a zzso with no zzso zzso zzso zzso The specific activities of zzso and zzso and their relative sensitivities to salt, the zzso drug zzso zzso and zzso DNA showed that the two activities are zzso The effect of placing a positive charge at position 43 on zzso structure was determined by measuring (for zzso and zzso relative zzso to zzso zzso circular zzso zzso and temperature melting zzso The results provide evidence that a positive charge at position 43 zzso dramatic changes in zzso structure that affect both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The identification of four putative DNA zzso motifs in zzso leads us to speculate that structural changes that zzso these motifs on the zzso structure may account for the changes in zzso
