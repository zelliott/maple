The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene product zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of cellular zzso and has been proposed to play important roles in zzso zzso The most abundant zzso transcripts are zzso zzso zzso that are strongly induced during zzso zzso Here we show that the promoter governing this transcript is strongly responsive to zzso by the viral zzso switch protein zzso By deletion mapping and scanning zzso zzso we have identified three putative zzso response elements zzso B, and zzso in this zzso However, none of these sites appear to directly bind zzso in zzso mobility shift zzso zzso Site C zzso to a zzso binding site for zzso a zzso zzso zzso that is normally the target of zzso zzso zzso can bind zzso and recruit it to its zzso recognition zzso when this happens, the zzso function of zzso can relieve zzso repression and zzso expression of the targeted zzso zzso studies reveal that both sites A and C can bind to zzso sequence inspection reveals that site A is a novel functional zzso of known zzso recognition zzso zzso B zzso to an zzso host zzso zzso The importance of sites A and C in zzso is underscored by the observation that zzso promoter function is dramatically inhibited in cells genetically deficient in zzso The regulation of zzso transcripts by zzso raises the possibility that other zzso of zzso signaling might be able to induce expression of this zzso outside the context of zzso zzso zzso
