Complete DNA sequences have been determined for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso genetic map of the zzso feather star zzso zzso is identical to that of the zzso feather star zzso zzso zzso zzso Smith, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso The zzso gene order of the stalked zzso zzso zzso differs from that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso of the zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso map position is unique among zzso and is likely a derived feature in this stalked zzso zzso compositional analyses of protein genes zzso on the major sense strand confirm earlier conclusions regarding a zzso T over C zzso All three zzso exhibit high T levels in third zzso positions, whereas other zzso classes favor A or C in the third zzso zzso The zzso bias is reflected in the relative synonymous zzso usage patterns of zzso versus other zzso We suggest that the zzso bias of zzso in comparison to other zzso indicates that a physical inversion of the origin of replication has occurred in the zzso zzso zzso rate tests support the use of the zzso b zzso gene in molecular zzso analyses of zzso A consensus zzso tree was generated based on zzso b zzso alignments that placed the asteroids as a sister group to a zzso containing the zzso and the zzso with the zzso zzso to the rest of the zzso zzso zzso
