The rapidly evolving zzso zzso gene has zzso and zzso acid substitution rates suggestive of progression toward a zzso zzso However, molecular evidence has demonstrated that zzso is expressed and zzso We explore in this paper the underlying factors behind the mode and tempo of zzso evolution that allow this protein coding gene to accommodate such elevated rates of substitution and yet maintain zzso Conservative zzso acid replacement may reconcile the fast evolutionary rate in zzso with conservation in protein zzso Based on this premise, we have examined putative zzso acid sequences for zzso from across green plants to determine constraint on this protein as indicated by variation in composition of zzso acid side chain zzso zzso acids in the zzso zzso were divided into six categories based on chemical properties of their side zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso aromatic, and zzso zzso acids that specifically affect protein structure, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The amount of standard zzso zzso in side chain composition was used as a measure of variation and zzso where a low zzso implied high evolutionary constraint and a high zzso implied low zzso Further, we used secondary structure prediction to evaluate if conservation observed in side chain composition was reflected in stable predicted zzso The results of this study demonstrate evolutionary constraint on zzso identify three regions of functional importance, show highly zzso secondary structure, and support the putative function of zzso as a group II zzso zzso
