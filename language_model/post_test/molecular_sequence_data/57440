Nuclear magnetic resonance and circular zzso zzso studies of isolated peptides corresponding to zzso and zzso zzso signal sequences are zzso all of the peptides adopt substantial amounts of zzso structure both in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso begins after the positively charged zzso zzso and is most stable in the zzso core, which zzso with results obtained previously for other signal zzso The zzso is weaker between the zzso core and the zzso such a break in the zzso appears to be common to other signal peptides studied previously and could be of functional zzso No clear correlation could be established between the zzso of the peptides in zzso and their in zzso zzso All the peptides have a higher zzso content in zzso than in zzso and there is a good correlation between zzso content in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso in zzso for the functional peptides increases both at the zzso and in the zzso core, and is driven by a strong association of the core with the zzso chains of the zzso The extension of the zzso toward the zzso may be a result of zzso of the zzso positive charges by the zzso of the zzso which removes zzso zzso interactions with the zzso zzso All these comparisons were facilitated by the use of zzso shifts of H alpha zzso in zzso regions relative to random zzso chemical shifts, which also yielded estimates of zzso content that correlated well with the CD zzso
