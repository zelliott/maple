The zzso group genes in zzso are involved in the stable and zzso repression of gene zzso The zzso group proteins probably operate as zzso complexes that bind to zzso To investigate molecular mechanisms of stable repression of gene activity in zzso we have begun to study zzso zzso of zzso group zzso We identified the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene and the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso which has sequence zzso with the zzso group gene zzso Sex zzso We show that the zzso and zzso genes are expressed in overlapping patterns in the central nervous system of zzso zzso However, zzso is also expressed in the zzso whereas zzso is zzso We further demonstrate that the zzso and zzso proteins are able to interact with each other via zzso sequence zzso These data suggest that also zzso zzso group proteins form zzso zzso
