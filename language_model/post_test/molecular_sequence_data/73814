We have isolated an zzso zzso box zzso zzso zzso from a zzso immature zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains an open reading frame zzso of 309 zzso zzso showing zzso and zzso zzso with human and chicken zzso zzso zzso We also showed that the zzso gene is composed of a single zzso by sequence analysis of the zzso clone and the determination of the zzso start site of the zzso The zzso zzso was detected only in zzso and was at a higher level in immature zzso than in mature zzso During zzso zzso the zzso zzso was most abundant in stage I zzso and the zzso protein was detected in stage I and II zzso zzso zzso protein produced in zzso coli bound specifically to sequences containing the binding motif for the zzso box of zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso demonstrating its zzso DNA binding zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the zzso protein may participate in early zzso of zzso as a zzso zzso
