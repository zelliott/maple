Recent studies have demonstrated nuclear export by zzso E1 zzso but the requisite export zzso for bovine zzso zzso E1 were not zzso In this report we identify three functional nuclear export sequences zzso present in zzso zzso with zzso being the strongest in reporter zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso E1 was modulated by zzso or zzso of zzso the major cellular zzso and export was strongly reduced by the zzso zzso zzso B, indicating that E1 export occurs primarily through a zzso zzso zzso with the in zzso functional results, E1 bound zzso in an in zzso pull-down zzso In addition, zzso E1 bound zzso more effectively than unmodified zzso suggesting that E1 export may be regulated by zzso zzso Lastly, an E1 zzso zzso accumulated in the nucleus to a greater extent than zzso zzso yet was defective for viral origin replication in zzso However, zzso exhibited no intrinsic replication zzso in an in zzso replication zzso zzso that zzso shuttling may be required to maintain E1 in a replication competent zzso
