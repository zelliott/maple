zzso virus zzso zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso is considered to be the major zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso and also it has always been the core of the zzso mechanism of zzso Traditional zzso theory demonstrates that cell surface receptors exert biological functions on the zzso which neither enter into the nucleus nor directly affect the zzso of the target zzso But, advanced studies on nuclear zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso family have greatly developed our knowledge of the biological function of cell surface zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso zzso cell line as a cell model, which is a zzso zzso integrated zzso cell line and the expression of zzso in which could be regulated by zzso zzso We found that zzso could regulate the nuclear zzso of zzso in a zzso manner from both quantitative and qualitative levels through the Western zzso analysis and the zzso analysis with a laser scanning zzso zzso We further demonstrated that the nuclear zzso sequence of zzso played some roles in the location of the protein within the nucleus under zzso regulation, and the nuclear zzso of zzso regulated by zzso was in a zzso zzso These findings provide a novel view that the regulation of zzso on the nuclear zzso of zzso is critical for the process of zzso zzso
