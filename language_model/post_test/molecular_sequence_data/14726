zzso interactions are commonly validated and deconstructed in cell lines zzso with zzso zzso However, due to cell zzso variations in zzso or zzso protein zzso such zzso may not reliably reflect zzso activity in other cell types that are less easily zzso In order to measure zzso activity in primary cells, we constructed zzso a zzso zzso zzso that encodes both a zzso zzso reporter gene controlled by zzso binding sites in its 3' zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensors can be efficiently zzso in primary cells such as human zzso and zzso zzso cells, and allow the detection of zzso and, more importantly, zzso zzso zzso we find that the relative zzso activity is correlated to the zzso zzso allowing quantitative measurement of zzso zzso We have subsequently validated the zzso 3' zzso zzso with known human zzso zzso and zzso targets zzso and zzso Overall, we observe that zzso zzso are highly zzso allowing detection of the independent contribution of multiple zzso to 3' zzso zzso control of zzso In conclusion, zzso is a new tool for the efficient study of zzso activity in primary cells or panels of cell zzso This zzso will not only be useful for studies on zzso biology, but also more broadly on other factors influencing the translation of zzso
