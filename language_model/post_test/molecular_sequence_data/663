To identify the genes involved in zzso zzso 

We zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso samples with the human whole zzso zzso chip to screen zzso expressed zzso Then we detected the zzso expressions of the zzso zzso channel genes zzso in human zzso and zzso by zzso and compared their expressions in the poor and normal zzso zzso 

zzso expressed genes zzso were identified by analysis of the zzso signals, including the 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso zzso was significantly decreased in the poor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with the healthy men zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The decreased expression of zzso in the zzso zzso is possibly associated with the reduction of zzso zzso
