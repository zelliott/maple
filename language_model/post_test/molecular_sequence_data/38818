A high affinity zzso zzso has been identified, zzso and characterized from the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso represents the first high affinity zzso zzso to be described from any system so zzso The strategy for the identification involved investigating candidate zzso zzso from the zzso zzso sequence project followed by genetic and zzso zzso This approach revealed zzso zzso reading frame zzso as zzso a high affinity zzso zzso zzso strains deleted in zzso did not show any zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso transport activity observed in wild type cells was also absent in the zzso zzso The zzso was cloned and kinetic studies indicated that zzso had a high affinity for zzso zzso zzso 54 zzso and was not sensitive to competition by zzso zzso zzso or other zzso zzso zzso was observed, however, with oxidized zzso and zzso zzso The zzso reveals a novel class of zzso that has zzso in other zzso and plants but with no apparent zzso in either zzso coli or in higher zzso other than zzso
