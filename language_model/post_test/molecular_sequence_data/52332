The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso point zzso zzso and a protein lacking the first 162 zzso acids at the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso in zzso coli and zzso to zzso through the use of CM zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso followed by zzso zzso gel zzso Greater than 50 zzso of homogeneous zzso and zzso 162 can be obtained from a single liter of bacterial culture, whereas the same procedure yields only 5 zzso of pure zzso zzso zzso zzso have been obtained for zzso zzso zzso exclusion zzso zzso zzso and zzso concentration dependence experiments have established that the zzso zzso exist and function as zzso in zzso zzso and zzso display identical zzso CD, and zzso zzso and have identical kinetic and structural stability zzso These full-length zzso zzso have zzso zzso an zzso maximum of zzso zzso a zzso number of 1200 zzso at pH zzso 30 degrees C, and an unfolding delta G value of 6 zzso at 25 degrees zzso zzso 162 has very similar kinetic and zzso characteristics to the full-length zzso whereas its CD and zzso zzso show noticeable differences due to the elimination of 162 zzso zzso The zzso zzso are by far the most active zzso known, and their kinetic parameters are extremely sensitive to the zzso strength of reaction zzso
