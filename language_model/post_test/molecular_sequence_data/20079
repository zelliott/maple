zzso C zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso dependent signal zzso in zzso We have previously demonstrated in zzso zzso and human zzso cells the presence of transcripts of two forms of zzso generated by alternative zzso They differ by 45 zzso in the zzso region and are designated as zzso and zzso with and without by 15 zzso acid zzso zzso to zzso The presence of the two zzso has not been shown at the protein level in zzso Moreover, the zzso region of zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso particulate association, and nuclear zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso may be regulated zzso We demonstrate for the first time that both zzso zzso are expressed in zzso at the protein zzso Studies in zzso cells zzso with zzso or zzso zzso along with zzso activated zzso zzso showed that zzso formation was comparable between the two zzso However, the nuclear zzso of the two zzso was different with a higher zzso to nuclear ratio for zzso compared to zzso suggesting that a great proportion of the total zzso was in the nucleus relative to zzso There was no difference in the relative distribution of the two zzso between the zzso and particulate zzso Both zzso alternative zzso zzso are expressed at the protein level in zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso is relatively more enriched in the zzso than zzso suggesting that the two zzso may have different effects in cell proliferation and zzso
