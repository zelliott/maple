zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one component of a zzso high energy channeling complex consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To study the zzso mechanisms specifying zzso gene expression to the heart, transgenic mice were created carrying the zzso sequences of the human zzso gene zzso upstream of the human growth hormone zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the human zzso zzso zzso to zzso base pair zzso did not activate reporter gene expression to a zzso zzso However, the human zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso expressed the zzso reporter gene at a high level in heart and skeletal muscle and at a very low level in esophagus and zzso and it did not express the zzso gene in other zzso tested zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso revealed that reporter gene zzso was specified to cardiac and skeletal zzso zzso precisely the expression pattern of the zzso zzso zzso analysis identified several consensus binding sites between zzso and zzso zzso including four zzso zzso one E box, and one zzso zzso Further analysis of a third transgenic mouse strain demonstrated that the human zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso did not direct zzso expression of the zzso reporter zzso We conclude that this zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso is necessary in specifying expression of the human zzso gene to the zzso and highly metabolically active heart zzso
