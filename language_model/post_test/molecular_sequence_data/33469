Eight zzso zzso zzso zzso in each of which up to three different zzso factor target sites had been previously zzso in gene transfer and zzso studies, were compared to the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso These species zzso about 50 million years zzso The zzso zzso were identified in zzso zzso zzso as zzso sequence patches in similar regions of the respective zzso The similar functionality of several of these control zzso in the two species was confirmed by zzso gene transfer zzso In each case the repertoire of zzso factor target sites was the same in the zzso zzso but the positions of the individual sites with respect to one another was zzso flexible, even though the intervening sequence was often strongly zzso The most invariably zzso features, as seen also in other systems, were pairs of target sites that are immediately adjacent to one zzso Their conservation is probably due to the necessity for interaction of zzso bound zzso factors, while a facilitated form of sequence conversion might be the mechanism of site position zzso
