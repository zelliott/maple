zzso sequence variations of a zzso zzso zzso of infectious zzso and zzso necrosis virus zzso isolated from samples of zzso zzso were determined and compared with an isolate from zzso The infection characteristics of these zzso were examined by zzso in zzso zzso and laboratory challenge studies with zzso zzso zzso of zzso were obtained from samples collected from the zzso Asia region (the Philippines, zzso and zzso zzso of putative zzso were obtained from African samples zzso zzso and zzso The zzso isolate had a very high zzso sequence identity zzso to Hawaii zzso The Thailand isolate showed a slightly lower identity zzso The putative zzso sequences collected from Tanzania and Madagascar showed greater divergence from Hawaii zzso zzso difference for Tanzania and zzso difference for zzso A zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso clustered with zzso found in the western zzso This supports the theory that the Philippines was the origin of zzso that was first detected in zzso In the laboratory infection study, both the zzso and Thailand zzso were passed into zzso zzso and the infected shrimp did not suffer any zzso In another laboratory infection, zzso zzso injected with a tissue zzso of zzso zzso from zzso which tested positive for zzso by zzso did not demonstrate zzso infection, suggesting that this putative zzso is not infectious to zzso zzso
