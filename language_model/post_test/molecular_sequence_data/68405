The ability to identify individual zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1903 zzso Walker zzso is necessary before several important zzso questions can be zzso We have developed such a method based on our discovery of extensive zzso in two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and the zzso specific zzso of which has an internal zzso repeated zzso Using the zzso chain reaction we detected both size and restriction site zzso in the repetitive zzso When the two genes were used in combination we obtained 16 distinct DNA patterns out of 18 zzso zzso Moreover, these patterns proved to be stable under a variety of zzso culture, zzso cell zzso and animal zzso
