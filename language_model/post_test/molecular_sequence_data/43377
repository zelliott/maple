zzso zzso facilitate the passive zzso of small zzso across the outer membrane of the zzso The channel properties and the primary structure of the zzso from zzso zzso were zzso As judged from single-channel zzso experiments, this zzso forms zzso pores that show no zzso selectivity in zzso zzso solution, which indicates that the charges within or near the channel are zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso the gene zzso which codes for this general pore zzso was cloned and zzso Its primary translation product contains a zzso signal zzso followed by the 295 zzso acids of the mature protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso alignments with zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso and secondary structure predictions suggest a typical rigid barrel structure consisting of 16 zzso zzso
