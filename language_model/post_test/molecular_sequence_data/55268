The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence of zzso in the zzso gene in Mexican patients with juvenile zzso zzso zzso 

We studied zzso patients at the National Institute of zzso and zzso in Mexico City and 100 healthy zzso DNA was extracted from the peripheral zzso blood of all zzso The zzso of zzso were then amplified and zzso 

We found three new putative zzso all of which were zzso zzso zzso located in zzso zzso The first identified zzso zzso produces a zzso change in the protein and zzso in the patient's affected father and zzso The second identified zzso zzso produces a zzso change in the protein and was found in the patient's zzso zzso The third identified zzso zzso produces a zzso change in the protein and was also found in the patient's zzso These zzso were not found in zzso 

The frequency of zzso zzso in our sample is zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso in the zzso gene are an important cause of zzso in Mexican zzso
