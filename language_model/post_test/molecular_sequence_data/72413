zzso structure models of zzso were constructed using a routine prediction method based on the X-ray crystal structures of zzso zzso factor zzso and leukemia zzso factor zzso The models were evaluated with the aid of the zzso zzso zzso method program compass and zzso experimental zzso The model constructed from zzso gained higher scores on compass examination than did that from zzso and the zzso data zzso et zzso zzso zzso 35, zzso also turned to be more consistent with the former zzso
