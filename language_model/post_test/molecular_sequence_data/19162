It has been reported that zzso is involved in regulatory T cell induction and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso two kinds of zzso cells contributing to tumor immune zzso Because zzso zzso zzso is the primary zzso for zzso we hypothesized that zzso is mainly responsible for the zzso of zzso Indeed, we found that zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso activated zzso with enhanced zzso activities, including zzso zzso and zzso NO zzso transcription, promoting zzso of zzso zzso oxygen species, zzso and zzso and enhancing zzso of zzso zzso This effect of zzso was zzso by zzso as zzso zzso significantly impaired zzso release of zzso and NO and zzso of T cell proliferation by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso caused zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso or zzso with an inhibitor zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso increased suppression of zzso proliferation by zzso zzso our in zzso study showed that zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso by zzso cells significantly promoted tumor progression and zzso accompanied with more zzso of zzso and regulatory T cells in the tumor site, increased production of zzso zzso and zzso as well as poor zzso zzso In contrast, enforced expression of zzso zzso by zzso cells that only released zzso without expression of surface zzso markedly reduced zzso zzso and induced more zzso zzso instead, showing obvious tumor zzso Our data suggest that zzso acts as a potent zzso of zzso via zzso and reveals another novel zzso effect of this membrane zzso that promotes tumor immune zzso
