zzso zzso protein zzso the major protein component of the zzso space, is in a strategic position to mediate cellular interactions between the retinal pigmented zzso zzso and the neural zzso While zzso appears to be involved in vitamin A transport during the visual cycle in the adult, the role of this protein during eye development has not been zzso As a first step to understanding the role of zzso during retinal development, we have studied the expression of the zzso for this zzso during zzso differentiation in the zzso A rat neural zzso zzso library was prepared from which an zzso clone was zzso The clone contains an open reading frame followed by a 3' zzso sequence ending in 10 zzso zzso The coding region has an identity of zzso and zzso with the zzso sequence of human and bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Royal College of zzso zzso zzso have a zzso and a zzso zzso for zzso which are present in a zzso ratio and thus are the only zzso known to definitely have more than one major form of the zzso zzso zzso Southern blots are consistent with the hypothesis that there is only one zzso of the zzso zzso suggesting that the two forms are produced by alternative processing of the zzso To generate an zzso zzso probe for use in molecular zzso zzso and Northern zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso from the coding region was zzso in between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Total zzso was prepared from zzso rat globes from zzso days zzso The expression of the zzso for zzso was studied by Northern blots and the level of the transcripts determined by solution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total eye zzso are present at zzso This increases to a final level of zzso X zzso zzso total zzso by zzso The one-half zzso level of the zzso occurs at zzso which is 2 zzso before the one-half zzso level of zzso is reached in the zzso space zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso The expression of the zzso for zzso reflects the zzso emergence of the zzso zzso as an important structure within the zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
