A live attenuated virus vaccine has been recently developed to prevent Argentine zzso zzso In this paper, we report the zzso sequence of the zzso precursor gene zzso of the zzso virus vaccine strain zzso zzso and its zzso untranslated zzso The untranslated regions zzso the zzso genes of different zzso are variable in zzso zzso and secondary zzso However, when this highly attenuated zzso virus strain is compared with the zzso strain, which is of intermediate zzso one zzso zzso and four zzso zzso are found at positions that do not affect the predicted secondary zzso When zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso the zzso sequence changes in the zzso open reading frame are concentrated in the zzso and the zzso zzso The comparison of the zzso acid zzso shows that the major changes are located in the zzso region of the zzso
