A complete understanding of the zzso regulation of zzso lineages requires that all relevant factors be zzso Here, we have taken a zzso approach to identify novel proteins associated with zzso a zzso zinc finger zzso factor required for terminal zzso and zzso zzso We identify the zzso zinc finger zzso factor zzso as being a component of zzso complexes involving zzso and its essential zzso zzso of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso and zzso zzso zzso elements of certain zzso and zzso zzso including an zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso studies in zzso and mice demonstrate an in zzso requirement for zzso in zzso and definitive zzso but not primitive zzso zzso aspects of zzso and zzso zzso These findings identify zzso as being a novel zzso factor involved in zzso and zzso development and suggest that it serves a cooperative function with zzso and/or zzso in a zzso zzso zzso
