We recently demonstrated that human embryonic stem cells zzso zzso zzso zzso repair zzso as primary means of zzso break zzso zzso We now show that zzso also use zzso end joining zzso zzso zzso were zzso slower in zzso and neural zzso zzso than in zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were ineffective or partially effective, respectively, at zzso zzso in zzso whereas progressively more zzso was seen in zzso and zzso The lack of any major involvement of zzso in zzso in zzso was supported by zzso zzso zzso zzso of a truncated zzso decoy or zzso zzso reduced zzso by more than half suggesting that repair is primarily zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso suggesting that repair is largely independent of backup zzso Furthermore, as zzso differentiated a progressive decrease in the accuracy of zzso was zzso Altogether, we conclude that zzso in zzso is largely independent of zzso zzso and zzso but dependent on zzso with repair zzso zzso greater than in zzso
