zzso is one of four zzso basic zzso regulatory factors involved in controlling zzso We here describe various protein complexes that increase the affinity of zzso for zzso We mixed an zzso containing a zzso center large enough to accommodate multiple binding sites with crude zzso nuclear extracts and used zzso amplification and selection of targets with an zzso zzso zzso to isolate zzso zzso Since each cycle of selection results in the enrichment for the sequences with the highest zzso we isolated zzso sites in which zzso binding was increased by its interaction with other DNA binding zzso zzso interacts with members of the nuclear factor 1 family, the zzso factor zzso zzso factor 2, and another factor, zzso zzso with zzso proteins 1), that binds to the sequence zzso zzso also exhibits cooperative binding with other proteins that recognize zzso zzso and various constraints on spacing and orientation were zzso The application of this approach to other zzso factors should not only help identify the different functions of zzso versus other members of the muscle basic zzso regulatory family but also help define the general zzso mechanisms involved in zzso gene zzso
