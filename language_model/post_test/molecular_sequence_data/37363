The human zzso contains numerous genes whose protein products are unknown in terms of structure, interaction partner, zzso and zzso To unravel the function of these orphan zzso it is of particular value to isolate native forms of protein and zzso products derived from these zzso From human blood zzso we characterized a novel zzso zzso and zzso zzso that we termed zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso We identified several circulating forms of zzso differing in their zzso zzso all containing a core structure with two zzso bonds formed by zzso zzso in relative 1-3 and 2-4 zzso zzso cloning of the zzso showed that zzso is zzso as a zzso zzso which is predominantly expressed in the liver and highly zzso among zzso This makes it a unique zzso that does not exhibit similarity with any known human zzso regarding its primary structure, zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of the zzso gene resulted in the identification of an alternative promoter and at least four different zzso zzso with the two dominating transcripts being zzso zzso The largest native zzso form of 40 zzso acid zzso is generated from the precursor at a putative zzso site for a zzso zzso In contrast to smaller zzso zzso this zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity against selected microbial model zzso zzso shares some characteristic properties with classic zzso hormones and it is expected that the isolation of this novel zzso will help to unravel its zzso zzso
