We present the cloning and structural analysis of a novel member of the large family of zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that this zzso in adult zzso is expressed almost exclusively in the human zzso In addition, a larger transcript was detected in relatively high abundance in several embryonic zzso indicating different functions during embryonic and adult zzso zzso raised against this zzso was used to locate the expression in adult zzso to the testosterone producing cells of the zzso the zzso zzso zzso We therefore propose the name zzso for this novel zzso zzso is clearly distinct from zzso the other zzso zzso zzso which is expressed by the zzso zzso is probably a zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso The heavy chain consists of 246 zzso zzso corresponding to a molecular mass of zzso Da and a net charge of zzso The size of the light chain is between 9 and 18 zzso acids depending on the site of zzso zzso which remains to be zzso The zzso zzso surrounding the active site indicate a zzso zzso zzso The presence of two zzso sequences zzso and zzso at the zzso of the heavy chain indicate that one or more zzso zzso are responsible for the processing of zzso However, zzso may also be activated by a zzso zzso possibly by auto zzso
