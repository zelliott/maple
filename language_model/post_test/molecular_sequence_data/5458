zzso sequences of incompletely characterized function have been found in the gene promoter regions of many organisms, zzso and members of the zzso zzso prominently among zzso We describe here an in zzso analysis of zzso function in regulating zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a gene that encodes a zzso zzso believed to be involved in regulation of zzso transport zzso and zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso The results of the promoter analysis indicate that a zzso zzso lying close to the zzso start point of this gene is important in determining the frequency of zzso zzso Competition experiments suggest that zzso factors bind to the CT zzso A zzso lying at the zzso of the zzso resembles an zzso element, a type of zzso zzso regulator first discovered in some zzso zzso This zzso zzso appears to be more important in the interactions leading to zzso initiation than more downstream regions within this zzso Two zzso of 37 and 45 zzso respectively, that bind to the zzso and are presumed to be zzso factors were detected in zzso zzso nuclear extracts by southwestern zzso
