zzso is an essential zzso involved in a multitude of zzso and zzso processes and a major constituent of bone zzso zzso zzso in zzso depends on the equilibrium between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but little is known about the molecular nature of the proteins involved in the zzso transport of zzso in these zzso Recently, it was shown that patients with zzso in zzso a member of the transient zzso potential family of zzso channels, suffer from zzso with secondary zzso zzso as a result of impaired zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso is specifically localized along the zzso membrane of the zzso zzso convoluted zzso and the zzso membrane of the small zzso zzso particularly associated with active zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso are zzso with zzso and might function as zzso zzso buffers in the zzso convoluted zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso identified in zzso patients zzso a zzso and zzso zzso channel tightly regulated by zzso zzso zzso The zzso channel displays strong outward zzso has a zzso higher affinity for zzso than for zzso and is blocked in a zzso manner by zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso comprises all or part of the zzso zzso channel of zzso zzso
