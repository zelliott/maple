The jack jumper zzso zzso zzso is endemic to zzso Australia, where around zzso of the population has a history of systemic allergic reactions zzso to its zzso Previous work had indicated that there were several zzso peptides derived from the zzso zzso p 1, the major expressed zzso product being a zzso zzso zzso p 1 zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso Another major zzso had been described as a 27 zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso p 2 zzso p 2 zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso possibly existing as part of a zzso zzso As a preliminary step in detailed stability studies of a pharmaceutical product used for zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing analysis of zzso collected from various locations by both electrical stimulation and zzso zzso dissection was zzso More than 50 peptides in the zzso zzso range were detected in zzso zzso A zzso of zzso p 2 was found as part of the major zzso present in all zzso this was a zzso linked, zzso aligned zzso consisting of zzso p 2 zzso zzso 2, approximately zzso zzso and a previously zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso 1 was found by a combination of tandem mass zzso and zzso sequencing to exist zzso and sometimes exclusively, as a previously zzso approximately zzso Da zzso in which the zzso at zzso 5 is replaced by zzso A range of zzso products of zzso 1 and zzso 1 were also detected in partially zzso zzso Further zzso studies using these peptides are warranted and a revision of the nomenclature of zzso components of zzso zzso zzso may be required to conform with established zzso zzso
