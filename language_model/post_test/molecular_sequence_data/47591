The zzso gene encodes a DNA binding protein that is structurally related to zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso Although the zzso protein binds the same DNA sequence as zzso the in zzso function of this protein remains largely zzso In order to investigate the role of this zzso we generated zzso zzso mice by targeted disruption involving replacement of the zzso sequence in the first zzso with an zzso fusion of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso mice appeared zzso normal and zzso zzso we found the possible existence of additional zzso downstream of the first zzso whose activity was not fully disrupted in the zzso zzso The promoter upstream of the first zzso is regulated in a cell zzso manner so that zzso is active in zzso but almost inactive in lung where the downstream promoter is zzso The specific expression of the zzso fusion protein was detected in layer VI of the cerebral cortex, in the zzso cell layer of the zzso and in the zzso cell layer of the zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that the upstream promoter activity in zzso might be regulated by some zzso zzso
