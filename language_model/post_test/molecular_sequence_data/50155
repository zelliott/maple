zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso has been previously shown to be required for zzso zzso but has no general role in zzso zzso On the other hand, we have recently shown that transgenic tobacco deficient in an zzso zzso zzso activity became more susceptible to both zzso mosaic virus and zzso virus zzso Thus, different zzso may have distinct roles in closely related zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we analyzed roles of a newly identified zzso zzso gene zzso in plant zzso zzso zzso encodes an zzso closely related structurally to zzso and is also induced by salicylic acid treatment and virus zzso A zzso zzso zzso for zzso has been isolated and analyzed for possible zzso in response to viral zzso When infected by a zzso and a zzso the knockout zzso accumulated higher and more persistent levels of viral zzso in both the lower, zzso and in zzso zzso infected leaves than did zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of zzso and plays a role in zzso zzso zzso of short viral zzso and zzso studies using a viral zzso harboring an zzso plant gene suggest that, while not required for zzso zzso zzso can apparently promote turnover of viral zzso in infected zzso
