Recently, the high mobility group protein zzso zzso was identified as a common genetic zzso in benign tumors with zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of breast and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In most cases, the zzso resulted in the separation of the three zzso zzso motifs from the zzso zzso zzso Here, we report about the molecular characterization of a case of zzso zzso carrying a zzso Studies were performed on a cell line derived from the primary zzso zzso cell line zzso Although the zzso 12 zzso was initially mapped more than 1 zzso zzso to the zzso gene by zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis, the present molecular studies reveal a more complex zzso zzso that directly affects the zzso zzso Using zzso analysis, a zzso fusion transcript was detected that contained the complete zzso coding region but lacked the putative zzso zzso zzso motifs that are normally present in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso transcripts were also detected in the tumor zzso The results suggest that zzso in the zzso region of zzso may have to be considered as zzso zzso
