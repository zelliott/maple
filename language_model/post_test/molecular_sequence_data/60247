The zzso zzso zzso is a member of the steroid zzso zzso that may require zzso for proper or zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso as a probe to screen the human zzso expression library, we identified an zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which consists of zzso zzso acids with an apparent molecular mass of 160 zzso zzso comparison in zzso reveals that zzso shares an identical sequence with a zzso zzso element zzso factor, zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso can interact directly with zzso zzso gel pull-down and zzso zzso zzso further suggest zzso can enhance significantly the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso might function as a zzso for zzso zzso in human prostate cancer zzso zzso Our data further suggest that this zzso zzso zzso can function zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Together, our data demonstrate that zzso might represent the first identified zzso zzso zzso for the zzso
