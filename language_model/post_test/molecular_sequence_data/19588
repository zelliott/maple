The zzso sides of zzso zzso 3 and 6 of zzso receptors are connected by a network of zzso interactions that play an important role in maintaining its inactive zzso To investigate the role of such a network in zzso structure and function, we have constructed single zzso at position zzso in zzso 3 and at positions 247 and 251 in zzso 6, as well as combinations of these to obtain double zzso involving the two zzso These zzso have been expressed in zzso cells, zzso using the zzso zzso and studied by zzso zzso Most of the single zzso did not affect zzso formation, but double zzso especially those involving the zzso zzso resulted in low yield of protein and impaired zzso zzso Single zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed the ability to activate zzso in the dark, and zzso and zzso enhanced zzso upon zzso with regard to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (in zzso and zzso double zzso resulted in enhanced zzso compared with the single zzso zzso in the zzso A role for zzso in this network is proposed for the first time in zzso As a result of these zzso zzso in the hydrogen bond interactions between the zzso acid side chains at the zzso region of zzso zzso 3 and 6 have been observed using molecular dynamics zzso Our combined experimental and modeling results provide new insights into the details of the structural zzso of the zzso change ensuing zzso of zzso
