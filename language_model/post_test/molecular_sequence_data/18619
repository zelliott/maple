zzso zzso is the zzso product of zzso zzso that are widely used to produce zzso zzso and zzso It is chemically stable substance and demonstrates zzso effects, toxicity and zzso effects in the zzso The toxin accumulates rapidly in the liver where it exerts most of its damage, but the molecular mechanisms behind its toxicity remain zzso Due to limited information concerning the effect of zzso on liver, this study investigates how zzso causes zzso in zzso Here, suppression zzso zzso was used to identify the zzso in gene zzso of the zzso zzso zzso after exposure to zzso After zzso and zzso the zzso zzso libraries were zzso At random, zzso positive clones were selected and zzso from the zzso libraries, which gave a total of 75 gene zzso zzso The screening identified numerous genes involved in zzso signal zzso zzso zzso innate zzso material and energy zzso translation and zzso which were extensively zzso Two zzso genes were analyzed further using real time quantitative zzso The two genes from the library were found to be zzso zzso These results confirmed the successful construction of the zzso zzso library that was enriched for the genes that were zzso transcribed in the zzso liver challenged with zzso and for the first time present the basic data on toxicity effect of zzso on zzso
