Human zzso zzso is a zzso protein known to be involved in various zzso reactions essential for cell growth and cellular injury zzso We previously demonstrated, based on nuclear zzso zzso that zzso acid zzso zzso zzso gene expression in airway zzso cells at the zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso region of the human zzso gene revealed the presence of a zzso box at zzso and four zzso response element zzso half sites at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso involvement of these four zzso half sites in zzso promoter zzso When the DNA zzso that zzso these four zzso half sites from zzso to zzso zzso was introduced into a zzso promoter of the zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso activities were zzso A zzso zzso approach demonstrated an essential role for zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and an auxiliary role for zzso at zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso experiments further demonstrated specific zzso interactions in these zzso zzso half zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated specific interactions of these zzso half sites with the nuclear extracts obtained from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso experiment further confirmed the interactions of zzso sites with zzso nuclear zzso These results suggest a classic zzso interaction involved in zzso zzso gene expression in human airway zzso
