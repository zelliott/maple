zzso domain proteins contain a zzso zzso domain composed of one to four zzso repeat zzso In animals, zzso proteins are zzso by a small gene family and commonly contain three repeat motifs zzso zzso plant zzso proteins are zzso by a very large and diverse gene family in which a motif containing two repeats zzso is the most zzso In contrast to the conservation in the zzso domain, other regions of zzso proteins are highly zzso To explore the evolutionary origin of zzso zzso we cloned and zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso and conducted a comprehensive zzso analysis of zzso zzso The results indicate that the origins of individual zzso repeats are zzso zzso and that the zzso repeat has evolved more slowly than the zzso and zzso zzso However, it is not clear which repeat is the most ancient zzso The evidence also suggests that zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso in zzso before the divergence of plants and zzso Based on our results, we propose that zzso zzso genes were derived from zzso zzso genes by gain of the zzso repeat through an ancient zzso zzso this gain model is more zzso than the previous proposal that zzso zzso genes were derived from zzso zzso by loss of the zzso zzso A separate group of diverse zzso zzso proteins exhibits a zzso origin and a complex evolutionary zzso Finally, a small group of ancient zzso zzso prior to the amplification of current zzso genes is zzso Together, these results support a new model for the ordered evolution of zzso gene zzso
