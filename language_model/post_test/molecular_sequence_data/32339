Members of the zzso gene family have a general role that promotes zzso cell fate in a model zzso zzso zzso To understand the function of zzso genes in zzso we have isolated all zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso and revealed the spatial and zzso expression pattern of one of these zzso zzso In rice, eight zzso genes constitute a small gene family and are classified into four groups according to sequence zzso zzso structure, and zzso expression zzso zzso shows unique spatial expression patterns that have not previously been reported for other zzso zzso so zzso zzso is expressed in putative precursor cells of both the zzso sheath in the large vascular bundle and the zzso zzso in the zzso In the zzso zzso is specifically expressed in the zzso and zzso from their inception, and is confined to several cell layers of these zzso in the later zzso zzso The zzso zzso are closely associated with cells that subsequently differentiate into zzso zzso These findings suggest that the function of zzso is involved in regulating the differentiation of a few specific cell types and is unrelated to polar regulation of lateral organ zzso
