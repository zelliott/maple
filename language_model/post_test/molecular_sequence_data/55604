Human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso Rex and human zzso virus type 1 zzso Rev are essential gene products required for the replication of these two zzso human zzso Both Rex and Rev act at a zzso level by binding to highly structured zzso zzso the zzso element in zzso and the zzso element in zzso Using a sensitive in zzso zzso of zzso interaction, we now demonstrate that the zzso Rex and zzso Rev proteins readily form zzso complexes in the absence of their zzso zzso elements yet fail to form zzso complexes with each zzso zzso negative zzso have been identified in both the zzso and rev genes which presumably specify a critical zzso or zzso domain in each of these viral zzso Surprisingly, these dominant negative zzso of Rex and Rev fail to interact in zzso These findings raise the possibility that the binding of zzso zzso rather than functional zzso zzso the zzso zzso of these Rex and Rev zzso Further, it seems likely that the assembly of functional and stable zzso of Rex and Rev in zzso may depend not only on the intrinsic zzso zzso of these proteins but also on the binding of a bridging cellular zzso to the related zzso zzso present in each viral zzso
