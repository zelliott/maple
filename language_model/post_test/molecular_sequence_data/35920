The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso DNA, by detection of zzso activity in zzso zzso The gene zzso a protein of 320 zzso zzso which is processed to the mature zzso of 285 zzso acids zzso zzso by zzso at an zzso bond, as determined from zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso A minor sequence zzso at zzso acid 6 is suggestive of an alternative start of translation at the zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso in this case the expressed zzso would remain zzso whereas it is presumed that the main portion is directed to the membrane of zzso by the leader zzso
