The role of the zzso and zzso regulatory factor 1 zzso in the regulation of zzso class I genes in zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso class I genes after treatment of zzso with various zzso occurred over a period of hours and correlated with cell surface zzso zzso analysis of the zzso class I gene promoter region confirmed that induction was controlled by a restricted region of 88 base pairs containing two zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso Further analysis showed that potential zzso zzso activity was zzso zzso the zzso rather than the zzso appeared responsible for enhancement of the zzso class I gene and was supported by three findings: zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso containing zzso as the sole enhancers were highly zzso in zzso and zzso the expression of zzso factor zzso which acts through the zzso to induce zzso class I zzso was induced to high levels in parallel with that of zzso class I zzso The induction of the zzso gene correlated with the prior induction of the zzso factor zzso or zzso B, depending on the zzso indicating that both gamma zzso sites zzso and zzso B sites in the zzso promoter are zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
