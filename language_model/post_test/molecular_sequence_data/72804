We identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso related to zzso zzso a putative protein zzso zzso Although the zzso obtained was incomplete at its zzso region, the deduced zzso acid sequence of its zzso domain exhibits a high degree of similarity to protein zzso N zzso which has a zzso domain related to protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso sequences in the zzso terminal zzso zzso of zzso was observed throughout zzso development, although its expression level decreased at later stages of zzso The expression of zzso is first detected in the newly formed zzso cell layer and is then restricted to the developing zzso musculature, indicating a possible role of zzso in the development of zzso muscles in zzso
