The zzso sequence of zzso zzso linear zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso Huang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lin, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report that the basic zzso locus for zzso replication in circular mode resembles that of zzso linear plasmids zzso and zzso and comprises zzso and the adjacent zzso zzso More efficient replication additionally required the zzso sequence between zzso zzso and 628 upstream of the zzso Replacement of either the zzso or the rep gene of zzso by the corresponding genes of zzso or zzso still allows propagation in zzso although the transformation zzso were 3 orders of magnitude lower than the original zzso suggesting that these plasmids share similar replication zzso To replicate zzso in linear mode, additional zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso protein binds specifically to the zzso in zzso zzso were detected between these zzso replication proteins zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso replication proteins zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso respectively, but the zzso proteins failed to zzso These results suggest that zzso recruits zzso zzso replication proteins for its zzso zzso
