Type IV zzso zzso are dynamic surface structures that undergo cycles of extension and zzso zzso dynamics center on the zzso and zzso zzso which are members of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso of the zzso system in zzso zzso have zzso activity in zzso Using a zzso approach, we systematically zzso zzso and zzso to resolve whether both zzso binding and zzso are important for zzso and zzso function in zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso activity was abolished in zzso by replacement of zzso zzso in the Walker A and Walker B boxes that are involved in zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso proteins containing zzso Walker A or Walker B boxes were zzso in zzso and unable to support zzso zzso zzso proteins containing zzso Walker A or Walker B boxes were also zzso in zzso and unable to support zzso zzso These data provide genetic evidence that both zzso binding and zzso by zzso are essential for zzso extension and that both zzso binding and zzso by zzso are essential for zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso are zzso that act at distinct steps in the zzso zzso cycle in zzso
