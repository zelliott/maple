The zzso division of the zzso zzso gene was found in eggs of the sea zzso zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso Two zzso products of different lengths were detected from a zzso in one zzso derived from a zzso egg, although only one product in one zzso derived from an artificially activated egg by zzso was zzso indicating one copy of the gene in a zzso zzso One of the two zzso products from each zzso egg was identical in size to the product from an artificially activated egg in the same zzso The other zzso product was the same in length as one of the products from the zzso with which the eggs were zzso These results indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene occurs in the sea zzso egg due to zzso and zzso The sequencing of these products demonstrated that their zzso sequences were identical and that the zzso inserted in the zzso products, generated zzso in length due to the frequency of the repeating 53 zzso sequence and zzso of other two zzso
