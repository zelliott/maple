Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso structures revealed several elements that may constitute the zzso functional zzso One such element, the zzso is formed by an zzso zzso segment of the largest zzso of zzso and contacts the nascent zzso at the upstream edge of the zzso hybrid, where the DNA template strand separates from the zzso transcript and zzso with the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso could zzso maintain the correct length of the zzso zzso zzso stabilize the nascent zzso in the complex; and zzso promote or maintain localized DNA melting at the upstream edge of the zzso We generated a zzso zzso zzso that lacked the zzso and studied its properties in zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso is not required for establishment of the upstream boundary of the zzso bubble during promoter complex formation, nor is it required for separation of the nascent zzso from the DNA template strand or zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso makes critical contributions to zzso complex stability through direct interactions with the nascent zzso
