The zzso zzso is a member of the class B family of G zzso zzso closely related to zzso and zzso hormone zzso Although mechanisms of zzso binding have been directly explored for those zzso current knowledge of the molecular basis of zzso binding to its zzso is based only on zzso zzso In this work we have zzso the more direct approach of zzso labeling to explore spatial approximations between distinct zzso within zzso and its zzso For this we have developed two human zzso zzso incorporating a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso half of the zzso in positions 16 and 26, zzso Both zzso specifically bound to the human zzso zzso with high affinity and were potent stimulants of zzso zzso in zzso zzso human embryonic kidney zzso zzso They zzso labeled the zzso zzso in a zzso and specific zzso Further zzso zzso specific chemical and zzso zzso and sequencing of labeled wild type and zzso zzso receptors identified the sites of labeling for the position 16 and 26 zzso as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both were within the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with the former adjacent to the first zzso segment and the latter within the zzso zzso tail of the zzso These data are consistent with affinity labeling of other members of the class B G zzso receptors using analogous zzso and may suggest a common zzso binding mechanism for this zzso
