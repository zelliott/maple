zzso variation in eight effectively zzso genes was surveyed in zzso samples of the closely related zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and in three of these genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genetic differentiation was observed more frequently in zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso Average estimates of zzso variation were highest in zzso zzso zzso and lowest in zzso zzso zzso reflecting differences among species in effective population zzso The low level of variation in zzso zzso zzso is zzso with a bottleneck effect associated with its zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso process was zzso considering the zzso sequences of an zzso species zzso zzso The high number of ancestral zzso relative to exclusive zzso detected in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the significant results of the zzso Fay and Wu H tests, and zzso sharing between the species indicate zzso subsequent to zzso Average zzso variation in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was approximately zzso and zzso higher than that in the zzso zzso zzso The detected reduction of variation in zzso zzso is less than that expected from differences in mating system alone, and therefore from selective processes related to differences in the effective zzso rate, but could be explained by differences in population zzso
