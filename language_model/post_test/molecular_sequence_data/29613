zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso by the zzso protein zzso is crucial for the release of fully infectious zzso To promote zzso degradation zzso has to be zzso on a motif zzso which is zzso in several zzso proteins known to be zzso by the zzso upon zzso Such zzso is required for the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso that triggers zzso degradation by the zzso In the present work, we used two peptides of 22 zzso acids between zzso 41 and 62 of zzso zzso was predicted to form an zzso including the zzso motif zzso and zzso was zzso at the two sites zzso and zzso We zzso the zzso change induced by the zzso of this zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso techniques were used to assess the structural influence of zzso The zzso of the free zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso (at pH zzso and zzso and a zzso mixture of zzso and zzso were completely assigned by a combined application of several two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and of the secondary chemical shifts indicated that the zzso segment zzso shows a less zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso forms a loop with the zzso group pointing away, a short zzso and a flexible extended zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit zzso zzso secondary chemical shift changes from random zzso toward more zzso structure with the combined zzso zzso and zzso zzso and molecular calculation zzso zzso in this molecular region zzso suggest that zzso changes of zzso play an important role in zzso degradation of zzso zzso
