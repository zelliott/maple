zzso of the entire zzso locus on the human Y zzso leads to male zzso The functional roles of the individual gene families mapped to zzso are, however, still poorly zzso since the analysis of the region is complicated by its repeated zzso We have therefore used zzso zzso zzso across approximately 3 zzso of the zzso sequence to identify 17 zzso zzso and have examined them for deletion of individual zzso gene zzso We found five individuals who lacked zzso from a large segment of DNA containing the zzso and zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso Southern zzso analyses showed that the lack of these zzso was due to deletion of the underlying DNA zzso zzso 118 zzso Y markers showed that all five individuals belonged to Y zzso zzso and 15 of 15 independently zzso men in zzso N carried a similar zzso zzso N is known to be common and widespread in Europe and Asia, and there is no indication of reduced fertility in men with this Y zzso We therefore conclude that a common zzso of the human Y zzso lacks the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and thus that these genes cannot be required for male zzso the gene content of the zzso locus is likely to be genetically zzso Furthermore, the observed deletions cannot be derived from the zzso reference sequence by a single zzso event; an origin by zzso zzso from such a sequence organization must be preceded by an inversion zzso These data confirm the expectation that the human Y zzso sequence and gene complement may differ substantially between individuals and more variations are to be expected in different Y zzso zzso
