zzso induced zzso zzso may occur zzso as part of the global zzso response to DNA damage in zzso A key participant in this process is the zzso zzso which is produced in an inactive from but converted to the active form, zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso together with zzso and activated zzso zzso enables the DNA zzso III zzso to replicate across chemical and zzso induced zzso The efficiency of this reaction depends on several intricate zzso zzso 

Recent X-ray zzso analysis shows that in addition to forming molecular zzso the zzso and zzso tails of zzso extend from a zzso beta structure to associate and produce zzso zzso We have investigated this phenomenon and find that these filaments appear to relate to biological zzso Higher order zzso are found in solution with zzso but not with zzso nor with a zzso of zzso lacking the extended N zzso zzso of the N zzso of zzso does not affect its ability to form molecular zzso but does severely compromise its ability to interact with a zzso filament and to participate in zzso zzso in the C zzso of zzso result in both gain and loss of function for zzso 

The zzso of zzso to zzso appears to cause a large zzso change in the protein which allows it to form zzso in solution at zzso relevant zzso Properties of these zzso are consistent with the filament structures seen in zzso of zzso
