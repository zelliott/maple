zzso recent zzso history requires merging zzso and population zzso approaches, taking into account the persistence of ancestral zzso and possible zzso The emergence of a clear zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been hampered by poor zzso sampling and possible occurrence of zzso DNA zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso into several European temperate and possibly American zzso zzso However, no formal test of zzso taking also incomplete lineage sorting into account, has been zzso Here, to clarify the yet poorly resolved species zzso of zzso and test hypotheses of zzso zzso we zzso 14 nuclear DNA and 2 zzso fragments zzso and zzso zzso zzso in 50 specimens from 11 zzso species from zzso North America, and zzso By applying an zzso model to the nuclear data on zzso of species, we find evidence for very limited gene flow from zzso zzso into most temperate European species, and not into the American zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso method, we zzso the species zzso which we find highly zzso with zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso of zzso evolution under the zzso history zzso from nuclear genes did not support the hypothesis of zzso zzso from zzso zzso into the American zzso zzso but did suggest zzso from zzso zzso into 4 temperate European zzso One such event likely resulted in the complete replacement of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of its sister species zzso zzso It is remarkable that zzso zzso in zzso is zzso extensive, and always from the same donor arctic zzso We discuss possible explanations for the phenomenon in relation to the dynamics of range expansions and species replacements during the zzso zzso of the zzso
