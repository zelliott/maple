The three-dimensional structures of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been determined at resolutions of zzso and zzso A, zzso The zzso zzso contains a new type of zzso bond between the sulfur atom of zzso and a carbon atom on the zzso ring of the essential zzso This zzso zzso has only residual zzso activity and contains zzso zzso The chain of water molecules visible in the main channel may reflect the organization of the hydrogen zzso zzso in the active zzso Two alternative mechanisms, involving either compound I or free radical zzso are presented to explain the formation of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso exhibit 75 and zzso of native zzso activity, zzso The zzso zzso contains only zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso contains a mixture of zzso b and zzso and trans zzso of zzso zzso suggesting of a role for this zzso in zzso zzso Replacement of either zzso and zzso both of which interact with the zzso affected the zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso mechanism and the zzso bond formation in zzso are zzso
