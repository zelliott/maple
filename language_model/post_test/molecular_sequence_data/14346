Recently, we showed that zzso zzso zzso motifs of basic zzso zzso zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso are capable of catalyzing degradation of zzso zzso et zzso PLoS ONE zzso zzso This observation is intriguing given the tight regulation of zzso turnover control and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso To support further zzso studies, zzso we zzso zzso binding interface of the zzso zzso zzso motif from zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso interaction interface is located in the first two zzso of zzso zzso and that only the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of binding zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso binding interface showed that zzso binding is facilitated by zzso and zzso side zzso and that at least one zzso zzso is located in proximity to the zzso zzso zzso Further studies in the context of full-length zzso factors are zzso to address the biological relevance of zzso zzso zzso
