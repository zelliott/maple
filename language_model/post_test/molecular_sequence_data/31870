zzso and zzso are two small peptides that, in complex, form a zzso zzso channel in the outer membrane of zzso zzso zzso zzso modifications on zzso and zzso are required for the formation of a functional zzso zzso The assignment of zzso zzso zzso chemical shifts in zzso allowed identifying zzso the exact position of the zzso zzso on zzso 56 side zzso This was further confirmed by site directed zzso and mass zzso Together with the previously published zzso of zzso zzso this provides the complete primary structure characterization of this outer membrane zzso
