To isolate zzso factors important in the regulation of the human zzso zzso zzso we screened a zzso zzso zzso library, constructed from zzso human zzso zzso with a probe containing regulatory sequences in the upstream region of the zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso to zzso and referred to as the zzso I footprint A zzso We isolated a zzso zzso that zzso a basic zzso acid domain and a zzso zzso domain and used the zzso amplification and cloning of 3' zzso technique to isolate the 3' half of the zzso zzso generating a zzso full-length zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso which we call zzso we defined the zzso promoter sequences bound by zzso in zzso I zzso zzso as zzso and, using gel shift zzso defined zzso as the minimal sequence required for binding of zzso in zzso zzso that bind to the zzso binding site are found in both zzso and zzso zzso lines in similar zzso although the level of zzso zzso increases after zzso zzso in several mature zzso zzso The zzso protein is nearly identical to a recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binds specifically to regulatory sequences in both the zzso zzso promoter and the human gamma zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that introduction of an expression zzso containing the zzso zzso into resting T cells zzso zzso zzso zzso gene plasmids that contain the A zzso this effect requires the presence of an intact zzso binding zzso One or more copies of the A region also zzso zzso responsiveness on a zzso promoter in T zzso zzso appears to play an important role in the expression of zzso by T zzso
