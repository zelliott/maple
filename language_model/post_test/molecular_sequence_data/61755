In zzso virus, initiation of zzso core assembly begins with recognition of the zzso signal of the viral zzso zzso by zzso zzso This nucleation event drives the recruitment of additional zzso proteins to fully zzso the zzso generating an zzso zzso zzso The zzso signal of the zzso virus zzso zzso has previously been localized to a zzso region of the zzso within the coding region of the zzso zzso and the zzso activity of the zzso was previously mapped to a central region of the zzso zzso It is unknown how zzso protein binding to zzso signal leads to ordered zzso of zzso protein and zzso core zzso To address this question, we have developed a mobility shift zzso to study this zzso We have characterized a 32 zzso acid zzso capable of recognizing the zzso virus zzso signal zzso Using this zzso we were able to observe a zzso change in the zzso induced by zzso protein zzso zzso is tight zzso zzso 12 zzso and results in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that although almost every predicted secondary structure within the zzso signal is required for efficient protein zzso the identities of the bases within the zzso and hairpin turns of the zzso do not need to be zzso In contrast, two zzso zzso are essential for zzso From these data, we have developed a model in which the zzso signal zzso adopts a highly folded structure and this folding process directs early events in zzso zzso
