A consequence of the zzso reaction is to expose the inner zzso membrane zzso which is a requirement for the zzso ability to zzso bind to and then penetrate the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso However, the proteins on the zzso responsible for binding and presumably penetrating the zzso have not been zzso This issue can be resolved if direct information is made available on the composition of the zzso For this purpose, we devised a methodology in order to obtain a zzso head fraction consisting solely of the zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso On the exposed zzso surface of this zzso we defined an electron dense protein layer that we termed the zzso zzso coat zzso which was visible on zzso and zzso zzso of several zzso zzso High salt extraction removed the zzso zzso with the removal of a prominent 38 zzso zzso which we termed zzso zzso raised against this zzso confirmed its presence in the zzso of intact, zzso and zzso zzso By zzso of a bovine zzso zzso library and sequencing the resulting zzso we identified zzso as the equivalent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and zzso required for binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso protein with zzso ability, whose precise zzso in zzso was zzso The zzso of zzso at the level of the zzso with zzso zzso and the retention of zzso after zzso passage through the zzso support its involvement in secondary zzso zzso This study provides a novel approach to obtain direct information on the peripheral and integral protein composition of the zzso for identifying other candidates for zzso zzso
