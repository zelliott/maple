The locust zzso zzso system was used to assess the ability of a variety of peptides to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso were three orders of magnitude less potent than zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated high zzso Perhaps the most significant finding was the zzso between the high binding capacity of the zzso analogue zzso and its relatively low zzso zzso This observation argues for a crucial role for the zzso zzso in zzso the zzso zzso Several other zzso peptides were tested for their effect on zzso zzso zzso caused zzso at doses several orders of magnitude higher than zzso The zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso In addition, zzso and catch relaxing zzso caused zzso zzso at low zzso The zzso had no effect when applied alone but zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of the zzso is not zzso The data argue for the presence of several binding sites on the zzso zzso
