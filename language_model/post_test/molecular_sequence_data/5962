To study the biological role of alpha 3 beta 1 zzso in cell zzso migration, and in the deposition of zzso zzso we zzso expressed the human alpha 3 zzso zzso in the alpha 4, alpha 5 zzso deficient zzso cell line zzso The expression of alpha 3 beta 1 zzso enhanced cell zzso on zzso (also known as zzso but not on zzso Using zzso zzso proteins that span the entire length of the zzso zzso we located cell adhesive activity to the zzso domain of zzso These results suggest that the alpha 3 beta 1 zzso functions as an zzso zzso interacting with the zzso domain of zzso On the other hand, the expression of alpha 3 beta 1 zzso did not zzso the ability to migrate on zzso zzso the expression of alpha 3 beta 1 dramatically increased the deposition of zzso and zzso into the zzso zzso This was accompanied by increased binding activity of the 29 zzso zzso domain of zzso Thus, similar to alpha 5 beta 1 zzso alpha 3 beta 1 zzso can play an important role in modulating the assembly of zzso zzso However, unlike zzso deposition supported by alpha 5 beta 1, alpha 3 beta 1 supported zzso deposition into zzso zzso was not inhibited by zzso binding to the zzso containing cell zzso domain of zzso demonstrating that the two processes are mechanistically zzso The role of alpha 3 beta 1 in zzso zzso assembly potentially implicates this zzso in the assembly and/or recognition of zzso zzso zzso an observation consistent with its apparent role in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
