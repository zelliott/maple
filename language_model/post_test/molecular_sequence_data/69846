zzso zzso zzso zzso is a genetic disease characterized by systemic zzso deposition particularly in the peripheral nervous zzso These deposits are composed mainly of a zzso form of the serum protein zzso zzso having a zzso for zzso substitution at position zzso Met zzso The factors involved in the formation of these deposits are zzso The existence of animal models for zzso should allow zzso of these zzso As one approach to the development of animal models for zzso in zzso we have constructed zzso zzso zzso carrying the full length human zzso for either zzso or zzso Met 30 under the control of the zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso zzso After zzso of the packaging cell line, zzso 2, viral stocks were used to zzso a rat zzso cell line, zzso mouse zzso cell line, zzso and mouse primary zzso zzso cells efficiently zzso both zzso and zzso Met 30 as assessed by zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso appeared not to release these proteins under the conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein as assessed by zzso These genetically modified cells can be grafted into animals for in zzso study of zzso as well as be used in culture to investigate factors that might regulate the rate of zzso zzso
