The zzso sequence of zzso that encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso consisted of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso It had an open reading frame for a protein consisting of zzso zzso acid zzso The number of the zzso acid zzso is the same as that of the rat zzso However, the zzso zzso has one zzso more than mouse zzso and one zzso less than human, zzso zzso and guinea pig zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso was highly similar to those of mouse and rat zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso acid zzso were identical between the zzso and mouse zzso and between the zzso and rat zzso zzso The zzso was slightly less between the zzso zzso and the human zzso pig zzso rabbit zzso or guinea pig zzso zzso It has been proposed that the mouse and rat zzso lack an zzso acid zzso corresponding to the 25th zzso of the zzso of other zzso However, a detailed comparison of the zzso acid sequences as well as the underlying zzso sequences by inclusion of the zzso ones revealed that the zzso zzso does not lack the 25th, but the 27th zzso
