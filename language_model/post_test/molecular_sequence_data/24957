We reported previously on the complete sequence of zzso E virus zzso zzso 4, isolated from patients with sporadic cases of acute zzso infection in zzso At least eight zzso zzso have now been described worldwide, and further zzso await zzso Current zzso for the detection of zzso zzso are based on zzso from zzso 1 and 2 only and may be inadequate for the reliable detection of other zzso Because zzso 1 and 4 predominate in China, we wished to investigate the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 4 zzso Four overlapping regions of open reading frame 2 zzso zzso zzso acids zzso 1 to zzso zzso zzso 67 to zzso zzso zzso 288 to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and the entire zzso product were expressed in zzso coli as fusion zzso zzso zzso based on each of the five zzso zzso were evaluated with zzso from patients with sporadic cases of acute zzso zzso Individual zzso derived from zzso zzso 4 detected more cases of acute zzso E than a commercial zzso Some serum samples, which were positive for zzso zzso G only by zzso based on zzso zzso 4, were positive for zzso zzso by reverse zzso zzso zzso from the N zzso of zzso had the greatest zzso with zzso from patients with acute zzso zzso These data indicate that the N zzso of zzso may provide zzso which are highly zzso with zzso zzso and that zzso based on zzso 1 and 2 alone may be inadequate for the detection of zzso infection in China, where sporadic cases of zzso infection are caused predominantly by zzso zzso 4 and zzso
