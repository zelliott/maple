We have reported previously that the zzso motif in the C zzso is essential for export of zzso zzso and zzso II type 1 receptors zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Here, we further demonstrate that zzso of the zzso motif similarly abolished the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso motif plays a general role in zzso export of G zzso receptors zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso indicating that the zzso function cannot be fully zzso by other zzso zzso The structural analysis revealed that the zzso zzso in the zzso motif is buried in the zzso zzso and possibly interacts with zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso whereas the zzso motif is exposed to the zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso markedly disrupted cell surface transport of the zzso It is noteworthy that the Val and zzso zzso are highly zzso among the zzso carrying the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso exhibited a stronger interaction with zzso zzso and was more zzso rescued by physical and chemical treatments than the zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso is probably involved in folding of zzso and zzso possibly through interaction with other zzso zzso in neighboring zzso These data also provide the first evidence zzso crucial roles of the C zzso possibly through modulating multiple events in zzso trafficking of zzso
