Although zzso zzso has been regarded as an excellent vaccine zzso there are 2 major drawbacks to using this zzso zzso zzso vaccines induce a relatively weak zzso response against zzso zzso and zzso zzso immunity to Ad is highly prevalent among the general zzso To overcome these obstacles, we constructed an zzso malaria vaccine by inserting a B cell zzso derived from a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso to as the zzso zzso into the zzso proteins of zzso a zzso Ad expressing zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso as its zzso Multiple zzso with the zzso Ad induced a substantially increased level of protection against subsequent malaria challenge in mice when compared with that of unmodified zzso Increased protection correlated with zzso zzso responses against the zzso zzso expressed in the zzso Furthermore, replacement of zzso region 1 zzso of the Ad zzso proteins with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the modified Ad by zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Overall, this study demonstrates that the zzso Ad vastly improves upon Ad as a promising malaria vaccine platform zzso
