zzso finding zzso have developed in their ability to use zzso efficient methods to detect patterns in biological zzso However the zzso zzso of the output still suffers from some limitations, which makes it difficult to assess the biological significance of the motifs zzso Previous work has highlighted the existence of zzso bias of motifs in the DNA zzso which might indicate not only that the pattern is important, but also provide hints of the positions where these patterns occur zzso 

We propose to integrate position uniformity tests and zzso tests to improve the accuracy of the zzso of zzso Using artificial data, we have compared three different statistical tests zzso zzso and a zzso zzso to assess whether a given motif occurs zzso in the promoter region of a zzso Using the test that performed better in this zzso we proceeded to study the zzso distribution of several well known zzso zzso in the promoter sequences of different organisms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli and several zzso zzso The results show that position conservation is relevant for the zzso zzso 

We conclude that many biologically relevant motifs appear zzso distributed in the promoter region of zzso and therefore, that zzso is a good indicator of biological relevance and can be used to complement zzso tests commonly zzso In this article we present the results obtained for the zzso zzso data zzso
