An intense zzso of muscle zzso mainly due to the action of zzso zzso zzso has been reported to occur during the processing of zzso zzso This gives rise to an important generation of free zzso acids and peptides of small size that contribute directly or indirectly to flavor characteristics of the final zzso The nature and properties of the free zzso acids generated during zzso zzso have been well zzso However, little is known about the identity of peptides generated during the processing of zzso zzso In the present paper, we describe the isolation (by ethanol zzso followed by size exclusion and reverse phase zzso and identification (by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a Spanish zzso ham of the following four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is the first time that these zzso fragments have been reported in zzso ham at the end of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the four peptides originated from muscle zzso indicating an extensive zzso of this protein during zzso Some of the zzso sites corresponding to these fragments in zzso were reproduced by other authors through the incubation of this zzso protein in the presence of zzso D zzso zzso thus supporting a relevant action of this zzso during the processing of zzso zzso
