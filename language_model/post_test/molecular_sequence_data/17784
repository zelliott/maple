The world of nature provides a never-ending set of fascinating problems for the zzso Many of the most intriguing problems, however, concern compounds available in only truly minute zzso One solution is to focus on zzso zzso In so doing one can isolate compounds with novel structures or zzso activities from almost any zzso including zzso zzso insects, or even the zzso zzso plants, as exemplified in several recent studies in our laboratory involving activities ranging from zzso and zzso activity to zzso and zzso Moreover, newer zzso techniques, especially fast atom zzso mass zzso and tandem mass zzso enhance one's ability to study compounds present in minute zzso including those of importance to the host zzso such as zzso in insects or marine zzso
