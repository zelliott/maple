The full set of consensus sequences at the zzso zzso site is recognized during zzso of zzso in extracts depleted of zzso zzso High zzso of zzso zzso proteins or zzso zzso alone promote the zzso of specific zzso zzso bypassing the requirement for zzso zzso in formation of the U2 zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso in the zzso that increase the sequence zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso site region can facilitate zzso This provides additional strong evidence that zzso zzso is not essential for zzso Thus, the consensus sequence at the zzso zzso site is probably recognized twice during zzso of most zzso however, some zzso could potentially be processed in the absence of interactions with zzso zzso in regions of the nucleus containing high zzso of zzso zzso
