zzso is a new emerging disease in zzso zzso zzso Field zzso of zzso a putative major zzso agent of zzso were isolated and genetically zzso zzso zzso of two field zzso zzso and zzso from pigs showing typical zzso was zzso The zzso sequence zzso with other zzso zzso was ranging from zzso to zzso in complete viral zzso zzso The highly zzso zzso motif of replication origin was identical to that of other zzso zzso To determine the genetic zzso of zzso zzso the zzso tree based on the complete zzso of zzso zzso were zzso Two zzso field zzso were closely related to Canadian zzso of zzso zzso isolated from field may have an origin of North America and is possibly originated from zzso of breeding zzso The result indicates that although the zzso of zzso is relatively stable in general, minor genetic variations exist among zzso zzso from the different geographic zzso These differences of viral zzso might have an important implication for genetic characteristics of zzso zzso Three major zzso zzso of zzso protein showed variations in zzso acid zzso Also, the zzso of zzso acid sequence in zzso zzso existed between two Korean zzso zzso
