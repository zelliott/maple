zzso zzso zzso is a category A toxin that has been classified within seven zzso designated zzso Recently, it has been discovered that sequence zzso occurs in zzso produced by zzso A zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso A1 and zzso which have significantly different zzso zzso We have therefore made efforts to understand at the molecular level the diversity and its effects on the biological actions of the zzso including zzso zzso zzso recognition, and zzso We provide the results of these studies, including the analysis of two newly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and their comparison to A1 and zzso Using sequence analysis, available functional data, molecular zzso and comparison of models with the crystal structures of zzso and the light chain of zzso we conclude that these sequence differences within zzso will impact development of zzso zzso and small zzso zzso and suggest zzso in binding affinity and zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso In particular, sequence variation in zzso zzso and zzso will likely effect zzso and zzso zzso recognition, zzso
