The gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned by zzso of zzso zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso from a zzso zzso that includes the entire coding region gives a deduced zzso acid sequence that has nine differences (out of a total of zzso zzso from the previously published zzso acid sequence that was determined zzso The zzso usage in zzso is as expected for a zzso zzso zzso zzso The upstream region contains a zzso zzso sequence that might comprise a zzso zzso The zzso gene appears to be present in a single copy within the zzso zzso zzso and has been localized to zzso zzso
