The zzso zzso is specifically expressed in female and male germ zzso Previous studies identified a negative regulatory element zzso upstream of the zzso promoter that suppresses zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used gel shift zzso to detect proteins in nuclear extracts of zzso zzso cells that bind to the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso One protein was found to bind to a region of the zzso which was shown by zzso zzso to be required for suppression of zzso zzso This factor was present in nuclear extracts of several zzso cell lines and zzso but not in male germ cells in which zzso is zzso suggesting that it is a zzso cell zzso of zzso zzso The binding site of the candidate zzso within the zzso zzso consists of sequences related to putative zzso identified in two other male germ zzso genes zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso bound and could be zzso zzso to these zzso 2 and zzso zzso 2 gene sequences as a protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 30 zzso The zzso binding site is also zzso in two other germ zzso genes zzso zzso zzso c and heat zzso protein zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso may be generally involved in suppressing zzso of germ zzso genes in zzso zzso
