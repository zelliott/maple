The zzso zzso acid and certain closely related zzso compounds are potent competitive zzso of the type I zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the absence of zzso data for zzso the structural zzso of steroid binding were identified by zzso construction in zzso of genes zzso zzso zzso containing segments of zzso and the related type III zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the gene zzso zzso followed by kinetic zzso of the zzso zzso Replacement of four zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by their zzso from zzso yields an zzso zzso that is susceptible to competitive zzso by zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure of the complex of zzso and the zzso zzso determined at zzso A resolution by X-ray zzso reveals the inhibitor bound deep within the zzso binding site and in close proximity to the zzso of zzso an essential zzso zzso The aromatic zzso of zzso provides a critical zzso surface which interacts with zzso zzso of the zzso The remaining three zzso act in concert both to maintain the appropriate orientation of zzso 146 and via additional interactions with the bound zzso The substitution of zzso by zzso eliminates a critical hydrogen bond interaction which zzso a surface loop zzso 137 to zzso of zzso zzso which must move in order for zzso to bind to the zzso Only two hydrogen bonds are observed in the zzso complex, involving the zzso of the zzso and both zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso both of which are also involved in hydrogen bonds with zzso in the zzso zzso In the zzso transfer reaction zzso by zzso zzso of zzso serves as a general base in the abstraction of a zzso from the zzso of zzso as the first chemical step in zzso The structure of the zzso complex suggests that zzso of the zzso of bound zzso by this mechanism could produce an zzso zzso analogous to that seen with zzso but one which is incorrectly positioned to attack the zzso zzso of zzso accounting for the observed failure of zzso to zzso zzso
