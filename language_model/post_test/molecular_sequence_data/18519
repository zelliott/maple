zzso restrictive zzso zzso caused by a single gene zzso is the least common of the inherited zzso Only a few zzso zzso have been zzso Most zzso causing zzso are located in zzso protein genes which also cause zzso zzso zzso Other genes associated with zzso include the zzso and familial zzso zzso In the present study we describe familial zzso with severe heart failure triggered by a de zzso zzso in zzso zzso the huge muscle filament protein zzso 

Family members underwent physical examination, zzso and zzso zzso zzso The family comprised 6 affected individuals aged zzso zzso zzso to candidate zzso was performed, followed by gene zzso zzso zzso analysis excluded 18 candidate genes but showed segregation with a common zzso surrounding the zzso zzso zzso analysis identified a de zzso zzso within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulting in the replacement of zzso by zzso zzso affects a highly zzso region in the protein within a zzso domain, belonging to the zzso junction region of zzso No other zzso zzso was identified in zzso genes by whole zzso zzso 

Our study shows, for the first time, that zzso in zzso can cause restrictive zzso The giant filament zzso is considered to be a zzso of a resting tension of the zzso and this report provides genetic evidence of its crucial role in zzso zzso
