More than 80 type zzso restriction zzso with different recognition zzso are now zzso In contrast, only a limited number of zzso zzso zzso are currently zzso To overcome this zzso a novel genetic screening method was devised to convert type zzso restriction zzso into zzso zzso zzso The genetic screen consisted of four steps: zzso random zzso to create a zzso library, each bearing an zzso zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso of plasmids containing the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso gene by zzso to the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso transformation of the zzso DNA into a zzso host and screening for zzso zzso activity in total cell culture or cell extracts of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso using this genetic zzso In addition, zzso zzso was carried out to isolate zzso zzso zzso with minimal zzso DNA zzso zzso The equivalent zzso acid zzso were introduced into zzso and zzso restriction zzso with similar recognition sequence and significant zzso acid sequence identity and their zzso zzso were successfully zzso This work provides strong evidence that some type zzso restriction zzso carry two separate active zzso When one of the active sites is zzso the type zzso restriction zzso may zzso only one zzso
