We describe a zzso method for domain replacement that does not require restriction site zzso We illustrate the technique in which the first zzso growth factor zzso domain of factor IX zzso is replaced by the zzso domain of protein zzso The method employs four zzso zzso Two are external zzso zzso primer A and inverse primer zzso and contain sequences zzso the zzso zzso zzso The other two zzso zzso primer C and inverse primer zzso direct the zzso amplification of the zzso domain of protein C, and they are hybrid zzso that contain sequences of protein C gene at the 3' end and of zzso gene at the zzso zzso Thus the amplified zzso of zzso domain of protein C zzso zzso is flanked by zzso gene sequences on both zzso When this zzso is mixed with zzso zzso and subjected to one cycle of zzso two products are zzso one containing zzso zzso linked to zzso zzso sequence upstream and the other containing zzso zzso linked to zzso zzso sequence downstream of its zzso zzso The first product is amplified using zzso A and D, and the second product is amplified using zzso B and zzso Both products contain overlapping zzso which allow zzso upon zzso The zzso product is amplified by zzso using zzso A and zzso The final product contains zzso zzso in which its zzso sequence has been replaced by the zzso zzso
