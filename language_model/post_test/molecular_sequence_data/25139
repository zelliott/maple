zzso zzso of the zzso of the canine kidney zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso activity and yields an 83 zzso zzso from Ala 267 to the zzso To test the proposal that E1 to zzso zzso transition is blocked in this modified zzso we have made a detailed comparison of its zzso with that of the native zzso by zzso While zzso of alpha is dependent on zzso and prevented by zzso that of the 83 zzso zzso is modestly zzso by zzso and only this zzso but not the zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso which zzso zzso by zzso activates zzso zzso of the 83 zzso zzso by zzso and zzso the zzso of this zzso While there is a zzso zzso of alpha by zzso the 83 zzso zzso is not zzso by zzso with or without zzso In its sensitivity to zzso and zzso to zzso the zzso is similar to the zzso of the native zzso however, the spontaneous decomposition rate of the zzso is orders of magnitude lower than that of the native zzso zzso has no effect on the spontaneous decomposition of the zzso but at high zzso zzso zzso zzso 350 zzso the zzso sensitivity of the zzso is zzso The zzso like the native zzso is zzso zzso and sensitive to zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso an zzso exchange activity that is zzso by zzso The zzso part of this exchange, unlike that of the native zzso is activated by zzso Our findings establish that zzso the zzso process and its control by zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by the zzso domain of the zzso and zzso the often repeated assumption that the primary role of this domain is in the regulation of zzso transitions is not zzso
