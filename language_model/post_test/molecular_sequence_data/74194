Chemical protein synthesis and zzso protein zzso were used to determine the X-ray structure of the snow flea zzso protein zzso Crystal formation from a zzso solution containing equal amounts of the chemically zzso proteins zzso and zzso occurred much more readily than for zzso zzso More facile crystal formation also occurred from a zzso mixture of zzso and zzso a chemical protein analogue that contains an additional zzso zzso at one zzso and thus differs slightly from the true zzso Multiple wavelength anomalous zzso zzso phasing from zzso zzso was then used to determine the X-ray structure of the zzso protein zzso The resulting model was used to solve by molecular replacement the X-ray structure of zzso to a resolution of zzso zzso The zzso zzso is made up of six zzso left-handed zzso zzso stacked in two sets of three, to form a compact zzso structure with one zzso face and one zzso zzso This is a novel experimental protein structure and closely resembles a structural model proposed for zzso These results illustrate the utility of total chemical synthesis combined with zzso zzso and X-ray zzso for determining the unknown structure of a zzso
