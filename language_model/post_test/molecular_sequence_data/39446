zzso is a T cell zzso activated by zzso zzso of the zzso interaction has zzso effects in animal models of T cell zzso In order to better understand the interaction between zzso and zzso we have determined the crystal structure of zzso zzso and of the human zzso complex at zzso and zzso A, zzso These structures show that zzso is an unusually small member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso The arrangement of the zzso zzso forming the functional zzso is zzso and differs from that of other members by a 15 degrees rotation of each zzso with respect to the zzso zzso resulting in an open zzso zzso changes of the zzso zzso of zzso suggest this interface lacks a single zzso zzso and that instead, binding energy is dispersed over at least two distinct zzso These structures demonstrate the structural plasticity of zzso members and their interactions with zzso
