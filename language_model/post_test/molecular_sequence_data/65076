zzso of zzso zzso that demonstrate resistance to zzso zzso have been described zzso however, the prevalence and clinical significance of zzso resistance are not completely zzso In this study we assessed the zzso zzso of 128 zzso zzso zzso that caused invasive infection in 82 stem cell transplant patients before and after the use of zzso in our institution zzso period, 1991 to zzso The zzso for 10 zzso obtained from seven patients were high, zzso or 1 zzso The average zzso zzso increased after institutional use of the drug began in zzso The majority of the zzso for which zzso were high (6 of 10) and one isolate for which the zzso was low zzso zzso demonstrated an unusual zzso appearing as predominantly white zzso For all seven zzso zzso zzso zzso were high zzso or zzso 2 zzso and minimal effective zzso of zzso were high zzso or 4 zzso For two of the seven zzso zzso zzso B zzso were high zzso or 2 zzso The zzso appeared white due to slow zzso however, after prolonged zzso the zzso zzso with no difference in zzso color or zzso zzso compared with typical zzso zzso amplified zzso zzso patterns of these zzso were distinct compared with those of other zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes confirmed that all were zzso zzso however, the zzso zzso b gene sequences of all the zzso zzso were zzso These data suggest the potential presence of a genetically unique, poorly zzso zzso of zzso zzso that demonstrates decreased zzso to several zzso
