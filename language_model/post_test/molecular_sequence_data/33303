In the present study, we examined the characteristics of zzso the regulation of the gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso activity of the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 60 zzso The protein presents the zzso family signature, the zzso zzso essential for zzso activity and the zzso targeting signal zzso The high level of zzso transcript observed in the presence of zzso zzso sources suggests that in zzso zzso the primary regulation of carbon flux into the zzso cycle zzso was at the level of the zzso zzso The gene zzso protein level, and zzso activity of zzso were highly induced by zzso in the presence of zzso and by zzso in the presence of zzso In the presence of zzso the gene zzso protein level, and zzso activity of zzso were mildly zzso by zzso Our results suggested that zzso zzso zzso from both zzso sources zzso and nitrogen sources (from zzso and zzso zzso to produce zzso The regulation of zzso by carbon and nitrogen sources was reinforced by the presence of regulatory motifs zzso and zzso found in the promoter region of the zzso
