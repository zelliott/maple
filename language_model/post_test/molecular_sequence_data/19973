Cotton fibers zzso rapidly after initiation of zzso eventually leading to the deposit of a large amount of zzso To reveal features of cotton fiber cells at the fast zzso and the secondary cell wall synthesis zzso we compared the respective zzso and zzso zzso Comparative analysis of zzso by zzso array identified zzso genes that were zzso regulated during fiber zzso Principal component analysis zzso using expressed genes as variables divided fiber samples into four groups, which are diagnostic of zzso zzso Similar grouping results are also found if we use zzso or polar zzso as variables for zzso of developing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso metabolism are highly active during fiber zzso whereas cellulose zzso is zzso and many other zzso pathways are zzso at the secondary cell wall synthesis zzso zzso and zzso profiles and zzso activities are consistent in demonstrating a specialization process of cotton fiber development toward cellulose zzso These data demonstrate that cotton fiber cell at a certain stage has its own unique feature, and zzso stages of cotton fiber cells can be distinguished by their transcript and zzso zzso During the secondary cell wall synthesis stage, zzso pathways are zzso into cellulose zzso
