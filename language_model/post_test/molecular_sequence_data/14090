A single set of zzso zzso was designed from known zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This set of zzso selectively zzso a zzso DNA zzso within the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso and zzso but does not amplify other avian zzso or other zzso The detection limit of the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was approximately 100 mycoplasma zzso zzso zzso zzso units per zzso zzso The zzso product was differentiated by restriction zzso length zzso with the restriction zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso results from field samples suggest that this technique could be a useful and rapid diagnostic test for the detection of these three zzso poultry zzso
