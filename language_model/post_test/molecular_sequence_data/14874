zzso relationships within sponge classes are highly zzso The low zzso signal observed with some current molecular data can be attributed to the use of few zzso usually zzso such as the nuclear zzso genes and the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we conducted a zzso search for a new molecular zzso We sought a marker that zzso is likely to have no zzso zzso zzso under a fast evolutionary zzso zzso is part of a continuous zzso zzso and zzso is flanked by zzso zzso Our search suggested the nuclear zzso as a potential suitable zzso We next demonstrated that this marker can indeed be used for solving zzso relationships within zzso Specifically, we successfully amplified the zzso gene from DNA samples of representatives from all four sponge classes as well as from several zzso zzso We also amplified the zzso zzso and the zzso gene for these zzso Finally, we analyzed the zzso performance of zzso to solve sponge relationships compared to and in combination with the nuclear zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso marker seems to be superior to the zzso zzso zzso Our work thus indicates that the zzso marker is a relevant marker which can complement and corroborate the zzso zzso observed with nuclear zzso zzso This marker is also expected to contribute to resolving evolutionary relationships of other apparently zzso animal zzso such as zzso
