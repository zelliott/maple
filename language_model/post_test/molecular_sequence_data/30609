In zzso DNA packaging activity in a defined system derived from zzso zzso 29 depends upon the chemical integrity of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso rendered the zzso inactive for DNA zzso A similar treatment on isolated zzso abolished the zzso activity of the native zzso but the general shape and size of the zzso was not changed as revealed by electron zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso had a smaller zzso zzso while zzso acid analysis after dialysis of the zzso zzso confirmed the loss of 16 and 19 zzso acids from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Low angle X-ray scattering revealed that zzso was followed by a small decrease in the radius of zzso and a reorganization of the zzso domain of the zzso inner part of the zzso zzso of the zzso sites in the primary sequence allowed us to propose the location of the zzso domain in the zzso zzso
