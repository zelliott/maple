Here, we describe methods to prepare a zzso expression zzso zzso zzso fused to the zzso of human DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso for use in studying the dynamics of zzso zzso in living zzso In previous studies, this zzso was zzso into zzso cells, a zzso zzso cell line that remains relatively flat during zzso After selection for stable integration, cells were cloned by serial dilution in zzso and used to grow a stable cell line expressing zzso zzso this cell line was termed zzso Using zzso methods with conventional and patterned zzso zzso cells were used to demonstrate the rapid dynamics of zzso zzso exchange in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso These rapid dynamics are dependent on zzso activity since zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso slows dynamics zzso The methods zzso in these studies are described zzso
