We tested 154 peptides spanning the entire length of core zzso of zzso for the ability to stimulate an zzso zzso T helper zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso lines and T cells, in fresh zzso from 23 patients with lupus zzso In contrast to normal T cells, lupus T cells responded strongly to certain zzso zzso irrespective of the patient's disease zzso zzso peptides in zzso regions zzso zzso (and overlapping zzso zzso and zzso (and overlapping zzso were zzso recognized by zzso T cells from the patients with zzso zzso these same peptides overlap with major zzso for the zzso cells that induce zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We localized 2 other zzso zzso for human lupus T cells in zzso and zzso All the zzso zzso have multiple zzso binding zzso and the zzso are located in zzso regions recognized by lupus zzso suggesting a basis for their zzso Native zzso and their peptides zzso zzso and zzso induced a stronger zzso response, whereas others, particularly, zzso favored an zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso The major zzso may reveal the mechanism of zzso zzso expansion and lead to zzso therapy of human zzso
