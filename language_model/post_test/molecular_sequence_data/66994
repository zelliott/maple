zzso zzso 2 zzso is a ubiquitous zzso essential for the viability of zzso zzso In the present work we analyzed the zzso zzso zzso in a search for the genes coding for all zzso alpha and beta zzso We found four alpha zzso and four beta zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that all zzso zzso genes are expressed in zzso zzso leaves and zzso The level of expression of these genes is very similar, except for the one that codes for an alpha zzso harboring a putative zzso destination zzso zzso which shows a slightly higher expression level in all zzso Using transgenic plants and zzso we have also characterized the zzso zzso of all proteins zzso by zzso zzso Our results show that all alpha zzso are localized in the nucleus, with the exception of zzso which is only found in the zzso On the other hand, beta zzso have a more diverse distribution, with some of them zzso both to the nucleus and to the zzso while others are exclusively located in one of these zzso zzso no zzso zzso was found in the zzso Finally, by directly measuring its activity, we have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso have active zzso that can be regulated by external addition of zzso This study represents a complete survey of the zzso gene family in zzso and the first step for future studies on zzso cellular function in this zzso
