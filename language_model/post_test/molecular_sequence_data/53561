The zzso domain V of the basement membrane zzso zzso was previously shown to play a major role in zzso zzso and cell zzso A zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso from zzso has now been shown to be zzso identical to mouse zzso domain zzso It consists of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso zzso but lacks the zzso module and a link region found in zzso zzso zzso production of zzso zzso domain V in zzso cells yielded a zzso protein which was folded into a linear array of three zzso LG zzso Unlike the mouse counterpart, domain V from zzso was not modified by zzso and zzso zzso due to the absence of the link zzso It showed moderate affinities for zzso and zzso but did not bind to chick zzso or to various zzso basement membrane zzso A single zzso sequence in zzso of zzso domain V was also incapable of zzso cell zzso zzso of a zzso form of zzso zzso 450 zzso in one zzso cell line could be demonstrated by zzso with zzso against zzso domain zzso A strong expression was also found by in zzso zzso and zzso at various stages of embryonic development and expression was localized to several basement membrane zzso This indicates, as for zzso species, a distinct role of zzso during zzso zzso
