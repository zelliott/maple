zzso zzso experiments were performed with zzso zzso of zzso zzso The addition of the toxin to the zzso phase bathing zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the formation of transient zzso channels with two states at small zzso zzso One is a zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso in zzso M zzso of the open state, which had a single-channel zzso of zzso zzso in zzso M zzso and a mean lifetime of 30 zzso zzso formed of pure lipids were rather inactive targets for this zzso zzso with different zzso suggested that the zzso channel was highly zzso at neutral zzso The mobility sequence of the zzso in the channel was similar if not identical to their mobility sequence in the zzso zzso The single-channel data were consistent with a zzso zzso channel with an estimated minimal diameter of about 1 zzso The zzso properties of zzso zzso were compared with those of zzso zzso Both toxins share common features, zzso probably to form pores in zzso zzso zzso Both types of zzso channels have similar properties but different zzso
