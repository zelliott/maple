The zzso zzso protein family plays an important role in zzso and alternative zzso zzso These proteins regulate AS in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are often alternatively zzso and these AS events may be important for the regulation of AS events of other zzso In this study, we analyzed AS events of zzso proteins in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found three sets of AS events zzso between zzso and zzso These zzso AS events were found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Each member of these zzso has at least one zzso recognition motif zzso and at least one zzso in the zzso zzso We found that the zzso AS events occurred in these zzso and, in each case, the zzso AS events resulted in mature zzso zzso proteins with incomplete zzso To search for the evolutionary origin of these AS events, we analyzed zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso in addition to those in zzso and zzso We found moss zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and these zzso have long zzso at the same location of the zzso AS sites in zzso and zzso Such long zzso are quite specific for alternatively spliced zzso concerning the zzso zzso protein zzso The long zzso found in the moss zzso protein genes strongly suggested that zzso AS events in moss zzso protein genes might be similar to those in zzso and zzso We traced the evolutionary origin of the zzso AS events to 400 zzso when plants first invaded zzso These events are likely important in the regulation of whole AS events and likely contribute to the complicated zzso described by zzso The complicated zzso created by regulated AS events might have provided plants tolerance against droughts or temperature shifts and given them the ability to live on zzso
