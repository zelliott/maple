The zzso cell division cycle gene zzso was isolated by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the 48 zzso zzso gene product, as deduced from DNA sequence data, includes the three consensus zzso motifs involved in zzso zzso binding and zzso activity, a target site for zzso protein zzso and a zzso domain related to zzso zzso A zzso zzso hybrid protein was located at the plasma membrane by indirect zzso zzso experiments indicate that the zzso gene product is essential for zzso zzso
