The zzso zzso zzso is known as a blood zzso zzso Through limited zzso of zzso receptors it can also control growth and functions in various cell types, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A number of previous studies indicated that zzso zzso the release of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso cells, suggesting another important role for the zzso beyond zzso In the present report, we provide evidence that this effect is not zzso by any zzso or zzso mechanism involving zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity did not affect the zzso release zzso Instead the zzso activity solely resided in a high molecular weight protein fraction that could be isolated in trace amounts even from apparently zzso zzso and zzso zzso High molecular weight material contained zzso peptides as revealed by mass zzso but was devoid of zzso zzso zzso zzso from the high molecular weight fraction by fast protein liquid zzso zzso intact zzso and zzso failed to trigger any zzso Our findings may force a revision of the notion that zzso itself is a direct zzso release signal for zzso In addition, they could be relevant for the study of other cellular activities and their assignment to this zzso
