The zzso propagation and zzso zzso of the zzso acids have been measured in zzso peptides in 40 volume percent zzso zzso zzso to determine if this zzso zzso zzso affects all zzso zzso The zzso in zzso zzso are compared with revised values of the zzso parameters of zzso peptides in zzso Revision of the zzso in water is the result of redefining the capping statistical weights and evaluating the zzso nucleation constant with zzso explicitly included in the zzso zzso The propagation zzso of all zzso acids increase in zzso zzso relative to water, but the increases are highly zzso In water, all zzso and zzso zzso acids are zzso zzso In zzso zzso the propagation zzso of the zzso zzso acids increase zzso leaving charged and neutral zzso zzso zzso acids as zzso zzso zzso and zzso are strong zzso breakers in both zzso Free energy differences for zzso propagation zzso delta zzso between zzso and other zzso zzso acids are twice as large in water as predicted from zzso zzso zzso but delta delta G values in zzso zzso are close to those predicted from zzso zzso This dependence of delta delta G on the zzso points to a specific role of water in determining the relative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso toward a common value in zzso zzso suggesting that differential zzso by water contributes to the diversity of zzso values shown by the zzso zzso
