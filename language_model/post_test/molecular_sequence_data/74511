The microbial community diversity and composition of zzso zzso Lake were studied using zzso and zzso zzso The water column and sediments were sampled monthly for a zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of bacterial and zzso zzso zzso genes showed an increase in diversity with depth for both zzso zzso samples zzso the highest zzso diversity, and the bacteria exhibited less seasonal zzso than the zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso microbial zzso were performed to compare summer and fall zzso In both seasons, the zzso samples appeared to be dominated by zzso zzso zzso High numbers of zzso and zzso zzso bacteria, as well as zzso zzso were also found, whereas the numbers of zzso were low or zzso were zzso The bacterial community composition of summer and fall samples was also assessed by constructing zzso zzso gene clone zzso A total of 508 sequences represented an estimated zzso unique operational zzso units, most of which were from the zzso and the summer samples were more diverse than the fall samples zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso For both seasons, the zzso sequences were dominated by zzso and the zzso and zzso libraries were dominated by members of the zzso group, followed by the zzso zzso zzso the zzso sediments contained sequences related to zzso members of the zzso and the zzso zzso Community overlap and zzso zzso however, not only demonstrated that there was a high degree of spatial turnover but also suggested that there was a degree of zzso zzso due to differences in the members and structures of the zzso
