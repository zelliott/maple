Biological nitrogen fixation is zzso by zzso a zzso zzso consisting of the zzso protein and the zzso zzso Two genes are involved in the formation of active zzso zzso zzso encodes the structural zzso while zzso specifies a stabilizing and zzso function by yet unknown zzso Our studies were directed to clarify whether the zzso exerts its function through physical zzso interaction with zzso To accomplish this, we used the zzso zzso zzso The simultaneous expression of the zzso binding zzso fusion and zzso zzso zzso fusion resulted in the successful zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso reporter genes in the zzso system zzso The system was also used to evidence the potential for in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results obtained suggest that zzso and zzso form zzso and also associate in between to form higher order complexes, which may be needed to exert the effect of zzso on zzso protein stability and zzso
