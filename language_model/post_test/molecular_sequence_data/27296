Human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically target the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso can result in zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso however, zzso in the zzso gag region, the zzso for the zzso zzso might also lead to zzso zzso We analyzed gag and pol sequence data from the following 313 zzso zzso 160 zzso patients, 93 patients failing zzso treatment that included a zzso (with no major zzso zzso and 60 patients failing zzso treatment that included a zzso (with major zzso zzso Additional sequences from 13 patients were included for zzso zzso We assessed positive selection pressure on the zzso region using a test for the overall influence of positive selection and a total of five tests to identify positively selected single zzso We found that positive selection pressure was the driving evolutionary force for the gag region in all three patient zzso An increase in positive selection was observed in gag zzso site regions zzso only after the acquisition of major zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acids in gag zzso sites under positive selection pressure could function as zzso zzso for major zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gag zzso did not appear to zzso zzso resistance, but zzso in the gag zzso sites could substitute for minor zzso resistance zzso in the zzso zzso
