We have recently identified a novel protein family, zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso 2, zzso Among zzso family zzso zzso is most highly and widely expressed in various regions of the zzso nervous system, although its expression is also found in some zzso zzso and cell types at low zzso We have previously suggested that zzso are involved in the suppression of zzso progression in zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso mechanisms regulating the cell zzso expression of zzso First, zzso analysis of the zzso status revealed zzso of the zzso island surrounding zzso zzso 1 in a zzso cell line, zzso zzso which expresses low but zzso levels of zzso while zzso levels of the zzso zzso island in either zzso or neural zzso are very zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells with a zzso agent, zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso Then, we analyzed the promoter activity of 7 zzso region surrounding zzso zzso 1 in zzso and zzso zzso zzso we found a basic promoter region and a zzso zzso region which contains zzso zzso zzso element 1 zzso like element zzso zzso of zzso recovered the zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso Furthermore, proteins in nuclear extract from zzso cells bound to the zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso determines zzso expression of zzso while zzso of the zzso island suppresses zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso
