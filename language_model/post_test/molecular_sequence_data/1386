zzso W is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso In this report, we have isolated the zzso for zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence shares zzso identity with human zzso and includes the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso found in all members of this zzso In addition to the zzso form of zzso we have isolated an alternatively spliced form of the zzso that lacks a complete zzso zzso An zzso zzso protection zzso and a Western zzso analysis showed that zzso is mainly restricted to the zzso T cell and natural killer cell zzso In addition, we confirmed that, like its human zzso zzso is localized mainly to the zzso zzso and its expression is zzso upon zzso We also characterized the zzso locus using bacterial artificial zzso zzso The gene consists of 10 coding zzso and 9 zzso spanning zzso zzso To zzso the zzso role of this zzso we generated mice deficient in zzso Our data establish that zzso is not required for zzso zzso target cell death in zzso In addition, zzso zzso does not alter the zzso of zzso zzso to suicide or zzso after zzso Thus, zzso does not have a unique role in target cell zzso or zzso cell survival in zzso
