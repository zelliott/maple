zzso are a group of low molecular mass and zzso zzso zzso zzso found in most living zzso They play an important role in maintaining zzso metal zzso eliminating metal zzso and protecting against zzso zzso zzso Analysis of complete rice zzso sequences revealed zzso genes zzso putative zzso zzso indicating that zzso constitute a small gene family in zzso zzso profiling revealed that each member of the zzso gene family differs not only in sequence but also in their tissue expression patterns, suggesting that these zzso may have different functions they perform in specific zzso On the basis of zzso structural and zzso analysis, the zzso family was classified as two classes and class I was subdivided into four zzso Additionally, in this paper we also present a complete overview of this family, describing the gene structure, zzso zzso upstream regulatory element, and zzso organization of each member in order to provide valuable insight into this zzso gene zzso
