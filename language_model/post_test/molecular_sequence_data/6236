In this study, we have established that zzso the zzso coli zzso of the zzso signal recognition particle zzso zzso is a zzso protein which displays intrinsic zzso zzso zzso was found to influence the zzso sensitivity of zzso indicative of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the 4th zzso consensus element displayed reduced zzso and zzso which correlated with a reduced ability to interact with zzso zzso of the zzso proteins had a stronger zzso effect on protein zzso than zzso of zzso zzso These observations suggest that in zzso coli zzso is important for proper functioning of zzso in zzso
