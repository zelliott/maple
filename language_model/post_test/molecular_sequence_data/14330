Here we introduce a zzso cost-effective method of generating molecular DNA zzso in just under 15 minutes without the need for expensive, time-consuming zzso zzso As an example, we zzso zzso six variable strands zzso zzso with a common strand sequence zzso zzso in a single pool using zzso DNA zzso to produce 101 zzso targets (10 zzso zzso species were then filtered out by passing the crude reaction through a zzso column zzso zzso We then compared full-length product yield of crude and zzso samples using zzso zzso the results of which clearly show our method yields three-quarters that of the crude sample zzso higher than by zzso And while we substantially reduced the amount of zzso product with our zzso process, higher purity and yield, with an increase in number of stands per reaction zzso could be achieved with further zzso Moreover, for large-scale zzso we envision this method to be fully automated with the use of zzso such as the zzso zzso here, potentially thousands of samples could be zzso zzso and zzso in either a 96, zzso or zzso platform in just zzso
