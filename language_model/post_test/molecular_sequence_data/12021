To investigate C zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from 35 zzso patients zzso zzso and their 37 zzso positive partners zzso zzso were differentiated into zzso by zzso with restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis of the zzso amplified zzso zzso In order to investigate whether different strains within the frequently prevalent zzso F were zzso two pairs of zzso F zzso zzso 4) were further zzso by zzso DNA zzso with arbitrary primer zzso zzso 

zzso C zzso zzso were found in 31 of the 35 pairs, zzso zzso zzso D, and G being most zzso In the remaining four pairs different zzso zzso D, zzso F or zzso were found between the index and the contact zzso By zzso analysis the strains of zzso F were found to be identical between the index and the contact patients, but were different between the two pairs in all zzso zzso 

A majority of zzso partners, once traced positive for C zzso infections, are infected with identical zzso zzso strains of zzso F found in partners as found by DNA zzso confirms the sexual transmission of C zzso
