The zzso are the largest family of naturally occurring circular zzso The mechanism by which the zzso of these zzso proteins are linked seamlessly with a zzso bond to form a circular backbone is zzso Here we report zzso zzso sequences from the plant zzso zzso and compare them with those from an zzso distinct species, zzso zzso Individual members of this zzso family zzso one to three mature zzso zzso These zzso are preceded by zzso repeat regions zzso that are zzso within a plant species but not between zzso We have structurally characterized peptides corresponding to these zzso and show that, despite them having no sequence zzso they form a structurally zzso zzso zzso This structural conservation suggests a vital role for the zzso in the in zzso zzso processing, or zzso of zzso zzso from the precursor zzso
