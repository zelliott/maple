zzso is a severe disease characterized by brain zzso The main zzso gene of zzso is zzso zzso or deletion of zzso leads to proliferation and migration zzso of zzso in brain zzso However, little is known about its biological function in embryonic zzso In this article, we identified the expression patterns of zzso zzso gene and investigated its function in embryonic zzso We demonstrated that zzso consisted of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso genes were zzso in evolution both in protein sequences and zzso zzso The expression patterns of zzso zzso and zzso showed that both transcripts were zzso expressed at all embryonic zzso stages and in adult zzso zzso At the protein level, the zzso products mainly exist in brain tissue and in zzso at early stages as shown by western zzso zzso The zzso zzso data showed that zzso proteins were distributed all over the zzso from zzso stage to 5 day zzso zzso of zzso protein expression through zzso zzso zzso resulted in many zzso deficiencies in zzso including brain zzso circulation zzso and body zzso Taken together, our study suggested that zzso zzso plays a very important role in embryonic zzso
