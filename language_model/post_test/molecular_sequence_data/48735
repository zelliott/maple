zzso is an essential bacterial zzso zzso in zzso zzso performing one of the key membrane steps of zzso synthesis catalyzing the transfer of zzso zzso zzso from its donor zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have solved the crystal structure of the complex between zzso zzso zzso and zzso and compared it with the previously solved complex from zzso zzso The structure reveals a large-scale zzso change in the relative zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso which has the effect of widening the zzso binding site and zzso the zzso zzso These results suggest new opportunities to design potent zzso of zzso zzso
