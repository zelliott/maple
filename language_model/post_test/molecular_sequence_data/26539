Several cell surface molecules have zzso C virus zzso binding properties and may serve as receptors zzso viral entry into zzso The large zzso loop zzso of zzso has been shown to bind the zzso envelope protein zzso with several critical zzso for the zzso zzso It was zzso that variation in the zzso zzso sequence may modify zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso negative patients with spontaneous viral clearance zzso zzso zzso zzso positive cases, who are affected chronically zzso zzso and patients at high risk of zzso infection, exposed but zzso patients zzso were zzso zzso DNA was extracted from whole blood samples and four zzso of the zzso zzso gene were amplified by zzso and zzso The zzso derived from zzso zzso was zzso following zzso extraction from peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso who are zzso positive, zzso negative, and exposed zzso were zzso for four DNA sections zzso B, C, and zzso zzso zzso patients, from all the patient zzso were zzso and compared for the C section alone (which encompasses the important binding region of the zzso for envelope zzso including 21 zzso zzso zzso negative, 15 zzso zzso zzso positive and 26 zzso exposed zzso and no sequence differences were zzso The entire zzso sequence from zzso was obtained in 23 zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and 7 zzso In 7 of the 23 cases, the zzso were confirmed with the zzso sequence (4 zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso No sequence variation was found in any of the patients studied by either method, including gene sections zzso the zzso most important for zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is a zzso that is highly zzso No differences in zzso sequence influencing zzso to, or outcome of zzso infection or evidence of zzso of the gene were zzso
