We have investigated the mechanism by which zzso adhere to and zzso zzso We show that these cells express beta 1 and beta 3 zzso which are involved in attachment to zzso bone zzso zzso zzso to zzso and bone zzso is zzso by alpha v beta 3, while a beta 1 zzso is responsible for attachment to zzso Both the rapid attachment by zzso to intact bone particles and their subsequent zzso are blocked by a zzso zzso directed to the alpha v beta 3 complex but not by an zzso against beta 1 zzso zzso of zzso to bone is also inhibited with soluble zzso zzso peptides derived from both zzso and bone zzso or a zzso zzso zzso against zzso We conclude that both zzso adherence to bone and subsequent zzso of its zzso are dependent on interactions between the bone zzso proteins zzso and/or bone zzso and the zzso alpha v beta zzso Moreover, zzso which constitutes zzso of its organic zzso is minimally involved in binding of chicken zzso to zzso
