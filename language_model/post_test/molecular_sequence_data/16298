A mouse zzso zzso was isolated from an embryonic zzso library using a zzso zzso gene zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso contains zzso sequence zzso along the entire zzso as well as a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso A structural comparison suggests a common ancestral origin of mouse zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso during zzso was analyzed by Northern zzso and in zzso zzso zzso transcripts are localized in the zzso lining of the zzso beginning at 14 days' zzso The expression of zzso in the zzso continues into adulthood, but cannot be detected in any other zzso The zzso gene is the first zzso gene expressed in cells derived from the embryonic zzso
