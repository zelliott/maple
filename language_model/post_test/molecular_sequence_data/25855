DNA sequence analysis of the zzso P region of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus confirmed the specific amplification of zzso zzso of viral DNA from this region of the zzso The zzso region included an open reading frame, translated in a zzso direction, which would potentially zzso a zzso zzso The amplified DNA was contained within this open reading frame, resulting in zzso zzso of a domain within the zzso zzso studies revealed the presence of a zzso of viral zzso species corresponding to a zzso zzso transcript carrying tandem repeats of about zzso zzso This indicated that the duplicated DNA was transcribed in the same orientation as the zzso zzso We predict that transcripts zzso from the opposite DNA strand also consist of a zzso of related zzso which would be translated to produce a family of zzso proteins with multiple internal zzso
