The zzso folate zzso zzso zzso mediates uphill folate transport into zzso in zzso small zzso coupled to the inwardly directed zzso zzso zzso folate zzso is due to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This study addresses the functional role of zzso charged zzso acid zzso within zzso zzso zzso with a detailed analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso lost function at pH zzso as assessed by transient zzso in folate zzso zzso zzso At pH zzso function was preserved only for zzso Loss of function for zzso at pH zzso was due to an zzso decrease in the zzso zzso influx zzso the zzso influx zzso was identical to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the intrinsic functionality of zzso zzso influx at pH zzso or zzso was zzso in cells preloaded with zzso zzso or zzso Replacement of zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso resulted in a zzso similar to zzso However, there was greater preservation of activity zzso 38% of zzso for the similarly charged zzso at pH zzso All zzso substitution zzso were zzso accessible at the plasma membrane at a level comparable to zzso These observations suggest that the zzso zzso plays an important role in the coupled flows of zzso and folate zzso by zzso zzso appears to have a profound effect on the maximum rate of zzso consistent with zzso of a zzso step in the zzso transport zzso
