A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso has been identified from a zzso rabbit zzso cell zzso using gene transfer and the nude mouse zzso zzso A full-length zzso has been isolated and zzso zzso has potent zzso activity in nude mice zzso zzso weeks), but does not induce focus formation or zzso independent zzso The zzso resulted from the fusion of zzso zzso (a rabbit zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a member of the zzso family which we named zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso potential resides in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso is zzso identical overall to zzso with identity increasing to zzso over a 100 zzso acid region of the zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso has zzso exchange activity for zzso providing evidence that this zzso is associated with zzso The linkage between the Ral zzso and zzso by a zzso in the zzso gene family zzso being a known zzso for zzso will open the way for the characterization of this zzso and provide an important tool to understand its biological zzso
