The current study aimed to provide further evidence on the status of species zzso zzso resistance, and zzso capacity within the members of zzso zzso zzso Group in zzso zzso and Khuzestan provinces of zzso zzso the internal transcribed zzso 2 zzso of zzso DNA gene led to identification of two members of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a new zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso as a world zzso Furthermore, we identified and compared partial sequences of zzso I and II and the whole zzso I region of zzso zzso zzso sodium channel zzso gene in populations of zzso Group and other main old world zzso zzso The zzso and zzso sequences in members of zzso Group and other zzso species were used for construction of zzso tree, which demonstrated the evolutionary zzso among Western and Eastern zzso zzso within the zzso zzso A zzso zzso chain reaction zzso for detection of zzso species revealed the infection of zzso zzso within zzso zzso collected from zzso district in zzso zzso The data from this study led to the introduction of a new zzso within the zzso Group, identification and definition of the status of zzso resistance related to zzso and zzso in their zzso zzso detection of zzso infection, and further evidence on genetic zzso within these zzso The overall results may suggest zzso the role zzso zzso in malaria transmission, which would be useful for zzso and evaluation of malaria control programs in Western zzso zzso
