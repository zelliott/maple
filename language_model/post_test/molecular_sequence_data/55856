Recent advances in molecular biology have allowed the study of the candidate genes for essential zzso To identify the genes responsible for zzso blood pressure in the spontaneously zzso rat strain, the rat model of genetic hypertension, we performed a zzso analysis between the zzso and blood pressure in a set of male zzso progeny obtained from zzso and zzso rats, a reference zzso zzso Our investigation revealed that a locus on the zzso 4 zzso with the blood pressure in zzso especially at zzso Y zzso The degree of zzso with all values of blood pressure without sodium loading was moderate but zzso We propose that zzso Y locus on zzso 4 is a new candidate for the zzso effect in original zzso
