zzso a tumor zzso and a zzso factor, has been shown to zzso activate the expression of a number of important genes involved in the regulation of cell growth, DNA damage, zzso and zzso In a computer search for other potential zzso target zzso we identified a perfect zzso binding site in the promoter of the human type IV zzso (also called zzso zzso or zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso This zzso binding site was found to specifically bind to zzso protein in a gel shift zzso zzso zzso with zzso reporters driven by the promoter or zzso of the type IV zzso gene revealed that zzso zzso of the promoter activity is zzso binding site dependent in zzso cells but not in zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso commonly found in human zzso zzso zzso expression driven by the type IV zzso promoter as well as by a zzso zzso zzso element in the zzso zzso expression of the zzso type IV zzso is also under the control of zzso Treatment of zzso cells, a zzso zzso zzso zzso line, with a common zzso zzso zzso induced zzso DNA binding and zzso activities in a zzso zzso zzso of type IV zzso expression followed the zzso zzso zzso No induction of type IV zzso expression can be detected under the same experimental conditions in zzso zzso zzso All these in zzso and in zzso zzso strongly suggest that the type IV zzso gene is a zzso target gene and that its expression is subject to zzso zzso Our finding links zzso to a member of the zzso zzso a family of genes implicated in zzso zzso wound healing, zzso arthritis, and tumor cell zzso zzso may regulate these processes by zzso expression of type IV zzso
