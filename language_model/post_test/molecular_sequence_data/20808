zzso zzso which largely relies on the creation of new zzso is an essential feature of plant adaptation and zzso and has led to the evolution of large gene zzso A typical example is provided by the diversification of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso We describe here a zzso zzso and zzso sequence that, via selective and local zzso acid replacement, led to the evolution of a novel zzso zzso in zzso This zzso involves a cascade of six successive zzso by two partially redundant zzso zzso leading to the formation of zzso a major zzso constituent and zzso player in zzso zzso This example shows how positive zzso selection can favor structured clusters of zzso zzso that are needed for the transition of zzso to new zzso
