We report results of experiments in which we demonstrated the existence of a zzso I promoter within the zzso DNA zzso upstream from the zzso initiation site in Chinese zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter was achieved by the same protein factors, C and D, that zzso zzso of the gene promoter, and these factors bound zzso to the zzso zzso promoter in a zzso complex, just as they did to the gene zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso promoter, which was transcribed in zzso nearly as efficiently as the gene promoter, the mouse zzso promoter was far less zzso this low activity was attributable to the fact that the mouse zzso promoter bound factor D zzso It is striking that the active zzso zzso promoter violated the otherwise universal rule that zzso zzso zzso I promoters all have a G zzso at position zzso zzso comparisons also revealed a great similarity between the zzso and mouse zzso promoter regions, yet there was much less similarity between the zzso zzso There was also only limited zzso between the zzso and gene promoter regions, but despite this the two kinds of initiation regions were organized similarly, both consisting of an essential core promoter domain and a zzso domain that extended upstream to approximately zzso zzso zzso considerations argue strongly that the presence of zzso DNA zzso promoters offers a significant selective zzso
