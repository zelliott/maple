Type II fatty acid synthesis zzso zzso is an essential process for bacteria survival, and zzso carrier protein zzso zzso is a key zzso in zzso II pathway, which is responsible for transferring the zzso group from zzso to the zzso by forming zzso In this work, we described the zzso characterization and zzso zzso of a new zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and the gene sequence of zzso was deposited in the zzso database zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of zzso showed that the zzso value for zzso was zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso unfolding processes for zzso were zzso investigated by circular zzso spectral zzso Moreover, a natural product, zzso was discovered to demonstrate zzso activity against zzso with zzso value at zzso zzso Further zzso zzso results indicated that zzso zzso zzso in an uncompetitive zzso To our knowledge, this is the zzso reported zzso inhibitor to zzso This current work is hoped to supply useful information for better understanding the zzso features of zzso zzso strain, and zzso might be used as a potential lead compound in the discovery of the zzso agents using zzso as zzso
