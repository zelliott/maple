Three zzso have been isolated to zzso from the zzso of the latex of the rubber tree, zzso zzso clone zzso zzso and named zzso zzso and zzso The three zzso share the same zzso acid sequence zzso zzso but the masses of the three forms were determined to be zzso zzso and zzso respectively, indicating that zzso modifications of the protein have occurred during latex zzso One zzso could be removed by reducing agents, and was determined to be zzso while the other zzso could not be removed by reducing agents and has not been zzso The zzso of the inhibitor proteins were blocked by an zzso Ala, but the complete zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso zzso by zzso degradation of fragments from zzso C zzso and mass zzso confirmed that the three zzso were derived from a single zzso The zzso acid sequence of the protein differed at two positions from the sequence deduced from a zzso reported in zzso The gene coding for the inhibitor is zzso and is a member of the potato inhibitor I family of zzso zzso The inhibitor strongly inhibited zzso A, zzso inhibited zzso and did not inhibit zzso The zzso acid zzso at the zzso site zzso and zzso were determined to be zzso and zzso respectively, zzso rarely reported at the zzso site in potato inhibitor I family zzso zzso of zzso acid sequences revealed that the zzso zzso shared from zzso to zzso identity zzso zzso to zzso of the potato inhibitor I zzso The properties of the zzso suggest that they may play a defensive role in the latex against pathogens and/or zzso
