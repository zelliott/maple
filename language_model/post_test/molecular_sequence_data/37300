We describe the generation of zzso of 12 open reading frames zzso discovered during the systematic sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso These zzso are located on zzso IV zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or on zzso XIV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were generated using the zzso short zzso zzso zzso strategy in zzso strain zzso zzso analysis, following zzso of the zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso are essential genes for zzso zzso growth in rich zzso The zzso of the two genes was confirmed by gene zzso zzso The protein zzso by zzso zzso is now known to be involved in transport of zzso from the zzso to the plasma zzso Basic zzso analyses were performed on zzso zzso from both mating types of 10 zzso zzso One zzso zzso revealed a slow growth rate on zzso medium at 15 degrees zzso For each of the individual zzso a disruption cassette and the corresponding zzso gene were cloned into appropriate zzso
