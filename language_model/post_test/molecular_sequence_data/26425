zzso regulation of zzso expression appears to be essential for the proper growth and development of zzso zzso One aspect of this regulation is at the level of zzso from the zzso zzso In order to characterize the promoter for the chicken zzso zzso we have isolated and zzso zzso DNA containing the first zzso of the chicken zzso zzso The zzso promoter is structurally similar to the promoters of the so-called zzso zzso lacking the zzso and zzso elements found in some cellular zzso but containing a zzso box near the zzso start zzso There are multiple zzso start sites for the zzso zzso which map near putative binding sites for the zzso factors zzso and zzso The zzso promoter was functionally characterized by its ability to support expression of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter is a relatively weak promoter, zzso less active than the promoter within the zzso necrosis virus long terminal repeat zzso We have defined the zzso promoter by analysis of a series of zzso deletion zzso of the zzso promoter fused to the zzso zzso zzso A DNA zzso containing 97 zzso of zzso zzso sequence and 72 zzso of 3' zzso sequence is sufficient for zzso promoter zzso zzso of the zzso promoter with a zzso zzso expressing the zzso protein resulted in a decrease in expression from the minimal zzso zzso These results indicate that expression of the zzso zzso is tightly regulated both at the level of zzso promoter activity and by zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso
