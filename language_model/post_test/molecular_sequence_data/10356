zzso elements are zzso that have been replicating and evolving in zzso zzso since before the zzso zzso zzso zzso shares the young zzso zzso only with its sister zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we compared the zzso zzso in these recently zzso species and found that it evolved rapidly into closely related but distinct zzso the zzso zzso (or zzso characterized here from zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso originally described in zzso zzso In addition to other differences, these zzso are distinguished by a cluster of zzso acid replacement zzso in zzso zzso Both rat species contain the zzso zzso but the zzso zzso is restricted to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso arose prior to the divergence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso amplified after their zzso The total number of zzso elements in zzso zzso zzso is about the same as the sum of the zzso and zzso elements in zzso zzso The possibility that zzso amplification is in some way limited so that the two zzso compete for zzso zzso as well as the implications of the other distinguishing characteristic of the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso
