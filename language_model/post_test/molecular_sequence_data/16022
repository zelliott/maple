The complete primary structure of the largest zzso zzso zzso zzso is predicted from mouse zzso and zzso zzso revealing a protein of molecular weight zzso zzso A central zzso domain structurally typical of all intermediate filament proteins is present, but anomalies are noted which may place constraints on the mechanism of zzso assembly into zzso The zzso portion of the protein is extremely long zzso zzso zzso by comparison to zzso intermediate filament components and has a remarkably zzso highly charged composition zzso and zzso at zzso zzso Its most remarkable feature is a tandem repeat of a 6 zzso acid sequence containing the motif zzso that extends for more than half the length of the zzso The zzso motif appears 48 times and since it is now known that the zzso zzso is a target for in zzso zzso the massive zzso zzso of zzso is zzso zzso of mouse and human zzso reveals that otherwise zzso proteins have been subjected to evolutionary zzso within their zzso repeat zzso although the zzso motif has been zzso
