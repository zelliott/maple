In the zzso zzso zzso as in many zzso zzso zzso plays a major role in zzso in zzso Recently, zzso peptides zzso have been characterized in zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is structurally related to zzso zzso has been isolated from the brain of the Japanese zzso zzso The putative zzso was zzso from an acid extract of zzso brain by affinity zzso with zzso against synthetic zzso and zzso on a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was subsequently cloned by zzso chain zzso The zzso consists of 619 zzso zzso a zzso of 117 zzso zzso zzso comparison of the isolated zzso and the zzso revealed that zzso zzso contains 20 zzso acids and is identical to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with synthetic zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso the release of two forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the effect of zzso was less pronounced than the marked increase in zzso release in response to zzso zzso The ability of zzso to stimulate zzso release appears to be specific, since zzso failed to stimulate growth hormone release from the zzso in organ zzso In contrast, rat and human zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso was zzso with chicken zzso in stimulating zzso release in the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso were significantly increased 1 h after zzso injection of zzso zzso of zzso in female zzso in freshwater but not in zzso These results suggest that zzso is zzso involved in the control of zzso zzso in zzso
