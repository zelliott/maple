This study focuses on the structure and expression of the zzso zzso gene in the chicken zzso Using an anchored and zzso zzso strategy, combined with circular zzso the full length sequence of the chicken zzso zzso was zzso The zzso and derived zzso acid sequences zzso to the structure of the zzso gene zzso However, unlike most zzso species, there does not appear to be frequent gene conversion between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso A single specific zzso signal of zzso zzso was detected by Southern analysis of chicken zzso DNA, indicating only a single gene copy in the chicken zzso Northern analysis of zzso zzso revealed a single band at approximately zzso zzso Using the same probe for in zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to be predominantly localized in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso nucleus and, when compared to the distribution of zzso containing zzso zzso in the same region, with far fewer zzso expressing the zzso gene in the lateral zzso Only few and scattered zzso expressing the zzso gene were found in the zzso and external zzso of the zzso nucleus in which many zzso contain zzso zzso as demonstrated in consecutive zzso In all zzso investigated, the intensity of zzso and zzso zzso signals per cell was approximately zzso No specific zzso for zzso was found in the bed nucleus of the zzso zzso nor the nucleus zzso Using zzso detection of zzso and in zzso zzso for zzso expressing zzso some zzso were found to contain both zzso and zzso gene products in the zzso nucleus but not in the zzso zzso
