Several zzso regulatory proteins that respond to changes in oxygen tension or the presence of zzso agents have now been zzso The zzso protein zzso the expression of numerous genes during zzso growth, both as a zzso zzso and as a zzso zzso protein responds to cellular exposure to zzso to stimulate zzso of several defense zzso zzso protein is triggered by zzso or zzso oxide to activate a zzso zzso for zzso defense and zzso zzso Each of these proteins has been zzso and characterized for DNA binding and zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso and zzso all seem to respond directly to zzso signals generated in the cell, and their in zzso properties support this view: zzso has an zzso zzso center essential for DNA zzso zzso may be activated via zzso of a key zzso zzso and zzso zzso depends on zzso zzso zzso Basic methods for genetic and zzso analysis in these systems are zzso with emphasis on detailed methods for zzso that illustrate general approaches for all the zzso
