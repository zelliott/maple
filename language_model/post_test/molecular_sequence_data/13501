zzso zzso a zzso found in cooked meat, has been shown to induce zzso zzso tumors in zzso Our laboratory recently observed that a high fat diet enhances the zzso and severity of zzso zzso zzso cancer in zzso In the current study, reverse zzso followed by zzso chain reaction amplification was used to determine whether zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso tumors classified zzso as benign or zzso and to evaluate whether dietary fat intake influences the expression of these zzso Of 23 total zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso 57% and zzso had increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Increased expression of these genes appeared to be consistently present in tumors displaying zzso In contrast, to the other three zzso zzso zzso levels were infrequently zzso The percentage of dietary fat did not appear to influence the expression of zzso zzso or zzso in either tumors or zzso zzso from control zzso However, the levels of zzso zzso were zzso and zzso higher in the control zzso zzso and benign zzso tumors respectively in rats fed the high-fat diet than in rats fed the low-fat diet, suggesting a slight effect of dietary fat zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso These results suggest that increased expression of zzso zzso and especially zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso cancer in zzso
