zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that lacks zzso yet contains an alternative zzso the zzso involved in zzso zzso Pathways between the two zzso differ zzso in zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso with electrons donated to an zzso which produces zzso zzso is generated exclusively by zzso zzso in zzso as opposed to zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso are found in zzso and zzso zzso but not in typical zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicate that zzso have a single zzso origin from an zzso zzso The absence of a zzso in zzso zzso zzso such zzso leaving the zzso history of this zzso zzso Although zzso reconstructions of a few proteins indicate that zzso zzso share a common origin with zzso others do zzso Here we describe a novel zzso zzso module of respiratory complex I that is coupled to the central zzso zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso complex that seems to function independently of zzso zzso analyses of zzso complex zzso proteins zzso and zzso reveal that neither has a common origin with zzso zzso These studies argue against a vertical origin of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso
