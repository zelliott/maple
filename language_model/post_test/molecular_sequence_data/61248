Seven independent laboratory zzso were derived from seven distinct zzso zzso virus zzso zzso after exposure to increasing zzso of zzso zzso and were found to be resistant to this zzso Single base changes resulting in zzso acid zzso were observed in the zzso sequence of the DNA zzso gene of each zzso zzso The zzso were found to occur within the domain II zzso zzso zzso for strains zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and domain III zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso of DNA zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso exhibited a zzso characterized by slow growth, the strains showing a marked delay in zzso zzso plaque formation compared with the zzso zzso from which they were zzso These results may have implications for successful isolation and characterization of zzso strains from clinical samples containing mixed viral zzso
