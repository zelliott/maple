zzso peptides have been isolated from a wide range of zzso Some of these peptides act on microbial zzso zzso their barrier zzso With the increasing development of zzso resistance by bacteria, these zzso zzso which have a new mode of action, have attracted interest as zzso zzso To date, however, few effective zzso approaches have been developed for designing and screening peptides that act selectively on microbial zzso In zzso display techniques are powerful tools to select biologically functional peptides from zzso zzso Here, we used the zzso display system to form zzso complexes in zzso from zzso zzso a zzso library, as well as immobilized model zzso to select specific sequences that recognize bacterial zzso This combination of zzso display and immobilized model zzso was effective as an in zzso zzso screening system and enabled us to identify motif sequences zzso zzso that selectively recognized the bacterial zzso zzso to host zzso it was not possible to enrich any sequence expected to show zzso activity using another in zzso system, zzso zzso zzso The synthetic peptides designed from these enriched motifs acted selectively on the bacterial model membrane and showed zzso zzso Moreover, the motif sequence zzso selectivity onto native peptides lacking zzso and decreased zzso cell toxicity of native peptides without decreasing their zzso zzso
