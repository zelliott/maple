zzso of human zzso virus zzso envelope proteins into zzso leukemia virus zzso particles was studied in a transient zzso packaging cell zzso We report here that zzso zzso envelope protein can zzso zzso zzso albeit at low zzso Complete or partial removal of the zzso zzso tail resulted in an zzso or reduction of zzso zzso implicating a role of the zzso envelope zzso tail in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso retention signal present in the zzso envelope zzso tail did not result in a higher relative zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, a zzso envelope zzso containing an zzso zzso envelope zzso domain fused to a truncated zzso envelope zzso showed an enhanced zzso specific zzso as a result of an increased incorporation of zzso envelope proteins into zzso zzso
