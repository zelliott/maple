We have examined the effects of prolonged zzso deprivation on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing either zzso a zzso zzso zzso or zzso an zzso zzso zzso Both of these zzso can zzso to zzso via zzso and zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso site consists of zzso base pairs, zzso suppression of zzso requires zzso at an zzso zzso zzso the zzso site itself contains only zzso base pairs, and zzso suppression of zzso occurs principally at zzso zzso Thus, by examining the zzso spectrum of zzso and zzso zzso that occurred in the presence and in the absence of zzso it was possible to determine the effects of zzso zzso on zzso at zzso zzso zzso sites as well as on zzso sites zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we determined the DNA sequences of over zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that arose during growth in liquid medium that contained zzso included both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The relative frequency of such zzso zzso was greatly reduced among the zzso zzso that were isolated after zzso days of zzso zzso on zzso zzso Moreover, DNA sequence analysis revealed striking differences in the distribution of particular zzso at the zzso locus in zzso arising after prolonged zzso zzso as compared to those arising after growth in the presence of zzso
