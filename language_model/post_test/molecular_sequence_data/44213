The very recently found zzso zzso zzso domain of 100 zzso zzso termed the fork head domain, emerged from a sequence comparison of the rat zzso zzso factor zzso alpha and the zzso gene fork head of zzso We previously isolated a new member of this family, the zzso fork zzso zzso zzso which is expressed in developing zzso Here we describe the isolation of the mouse zzso and human zzso zzso zzso genes and the determination of the gene and protein structures of zzso We found that the zzso gene has no zzso and that the identity of the zzso acid sequences of mouse and human zzso proteins is zzso We also investigated the zzso activity of the mouse and human zzso proteins and found that both proteins act as positive zzso
