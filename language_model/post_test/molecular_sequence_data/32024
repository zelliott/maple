The zzso hypothesis regarding the composition of microbial zzso in indoor environments is that zzso zzso are structured by outdoor air with a moderate contribution by surface growth, whereas indoor bacterial zzso represent a mixture of bacteria entered from outdoor air, shed by building zzso and grown on zzso To test the zzso aspect of this hypothesis, we sampled zzso from three surface types likely to support growth and therefore possible contributors of zzso to indoor zzso drains in kitchens and bathrooms, sills beneath zzso windows, and skin of human zzso zzso was done in zzso units of a zzso complex without reported mold problems, and sequences were analyzed using both zzso and the new zzso approach to zzso to the same zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso profile similar to that of outdoor air from the same zzso and zzso clustered by surface zzso zzso zzso typical of indoor air, such as zzso and zzso were abundant on zzso as were a diverse set of zzso of likely outdoor zzso zzso supported more zzso zzso than the other surfaces and contained zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso Most surprising was the composition detected on residents' zzso In addition to harboring zzso a known human zzso skin also possessed a surprising richness of zzso zzso including plant pathogens such as zzso zzso zzso Overall, zzso richness across indoor surfaces was high, but based on known zzso most of these zzso were unlikely to be growing on zzso We conclude that while some zzso zzso growth on typical household surfaces does occur, particularly on drains and skin, all residential surfaces appear - to varying degrees - to be passive collectors of airborne zzso of putative outdoor origin, a view of the origins of the indoor zzso quite different from zzso
