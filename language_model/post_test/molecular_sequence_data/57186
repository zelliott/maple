In human liver, we previously identified one zzso of zzso zzso activity that expresses high affinity zzso acid binding zzso with minimal 3 zzso zzso (3 zzso activity for zzso zzso This protein may assist in the rapid zzso transport of zzso acids from the zzso to the zzso pole of the zzso We now report the zzso cloning and bacterial expression of this novel, zzso zzso A zzso pair zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso library using a rat zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso oxidized zzso trans zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with minimal 3 zzso activity for zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso acid zzso zzso as determined by displacement of the fluorescent probe, zzso zzso were higher than those previously reported for the native protein (1 zzso versus 10 zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso was found with the human zzso zzso bovine zzso F zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso that zzso is also a member of the recently identified, zzso zzso gene zzso Future studies will define the zzso significance of this novel, zzso protein in zzso acid transport and zzso zzso
