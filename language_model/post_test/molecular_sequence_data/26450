A synthetic zzso zzso zzso bound by an zzso linkage to the zzso zzso zzso support through zzso zzso was used as starting compound to assemble the zzso coli rec A promoter DNA zzso from synthetic zzso by means of T4 DNA zzso The zzso assembly of the designed DNA was performed by two ways: zzso zzso of two pairs of zzso (2 zzso or simultaneous zzso of four zzso zzso Both ways gave equal results with some preference in the zzso zzso The reliability of zzso coli promoter DNA zzso assembly was demonstrated by cloning it in a zzso zzso and sequencing the cloned DNA by the zzso zzso zzso
