The zzso zzso of zzso zzso consists of an zzso zzso backbone with zzso and zzso zzso We have studied two zzso in the zzso zzso of this zzso A particulate zzso preparation contained zzso and zzso activities with pH zzso of zzso and less than zzso and optimum incubation temperatures of 25 degrees and 37 degrees C zzso zzso zzso served as an zzso for zzso zzso but zzso did zzso zzso served as an zzso for zzso zzso but zzso zzso did zzso These observations suggest that zzso is added before zzso and after zzso This hypothesis was supported by studies of zzso zzso in which a zzso preparation was incubated with various combinations of zzso zzso With zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso no evidence for a zzso zzso was zzso However, zzso zzso was detected only if zzso and zzso were zzso a finding consistent with a pool of zzso zzso which is only transferred following zzso The order of addition zzso is zzso zzso zzso and zzso
