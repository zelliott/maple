zzso zzso in zzso requires the participation of a large number of zzso assembly zzso The highly zzso zzso zzso protein zzso has an essential but unknown function in zzso zzso processing and zzso zzso In zzso zzso the malfunction of a zzso zzso protein zzso was suppressed by the addition of zzso zzso This suggests the participation of zzso in a zzso reaction during zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso binds to a zzso zzso motif also found in zzso zzso and zzso the incorporation of zzso protein zzso during the formation of zzso Here, we present the X-ray structure of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso in its free form zzso A zzso and bound to the zzso analog zzso zzso zzso A zzso and the zzso and general zzso inhibitor zzso zzso A zzso The structure reveals a fold which is very similar to the zzso core fold of the zzso zzso but contains a novel extension of this common core zzso zzso and zzso bind to zzso at a zzso binding site that is zzso equivalent to the zzso site in other zzso zzso zzso our structures together with previous genetic data suggest that zzso is a genuine zzso zzso
