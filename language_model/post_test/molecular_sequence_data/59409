A new zzso zzso from zzso zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso showed different kinetic and stability characteristics when compared to a commercially available batch of zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso the new zzso zzso was isolated and DNA sequence analysis of the coding region showed zzso identity to the sequence of a zzso zzso gene previously zzso However, the similarity of the zzso sequences zzso and downstream of the open reading frame was much less, showing only zzso and 50% identity zzso Despite the low degree of similarity between the zzso region of the new gene and the previously published one, the new zzso zzso was likewise induced by calcium zzso In addition, we showed that this induction occurred on the zzso zzso Observations concerning the effect of zzso and the levels of zzso zzso zzso upon calcium zzso induction suggested that the enhancement of zzso zzso zzso by calcium zzso was accompanied by a zzso shift from zzso to the zzso zzso zzso
