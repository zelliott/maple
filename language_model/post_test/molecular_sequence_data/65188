New artificial zzso zzso of short zzso with peptides containing alternating zzso and zzso were zzso and characterized in terms of their zzso activity and specificity of zzso zzso The zzso efficiently cleave different zzso within zzso zzso Depending on the sequence and length of the zzso the zzso display either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso bonds was observed for zzso zzso The zzso function as true zzso exhibiting reaction turnover up to 175 for 24 zzso Our data show that in the zzso the zzso plays the role of a factor which provides an zzso zzso of the zzso via zzso zzso and that it is the zzso zzso itself which is responsible for zzso affinity and zzso
