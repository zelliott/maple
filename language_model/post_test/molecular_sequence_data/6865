zzso acid replacements and the determination of resulting structural changes are a useful tool to recognize zzso zzso in biologically active peptides such as zzso Y and zzso zzso In this paper the secondary structures of one zzso zzso zzso and its double zzso acid analog have been determined by means of zzso zzso and CD zzso under equivalent zzso The chemical shifts zzso and C alpha zzso and the analysis of nuclear zzso effects show a split of the continuous zzso for the zzso zzso into two zzso at the position of double zzso acid zzso zzso exchange rates correlate with water zzso in the zzso face and confirm the zzso zzso structure in the zzso zzso as well as in its double zzso acid zzso A significantly accelerated hydrogen isotope exchange rate is observed for the zzso backbone zzso zzso an increased flexibility at that zzso These results show that the incorporation of an adjacent pair of zzso acids only causes a local change in structure and flexibility, which makes the double D replacement interesting as a tool for specific zzso modifications to search for zzso zzso in biologically active zzso
