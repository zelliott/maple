A single zzso chain containing two zzso zzso zzso sequences from zzso coli was constructed to determine if a repeat sequence fusion protein could be expressed in an active zzso The possibility that zzso interactions could play a significant role for this zzso is suggested by the results of Hall and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA, 86, zzso who observed a substantial decrease in the yield of active zzso when folded in the presence of a large zzso zzso The fusion protein zzso zzso was efficiently expressed in zzso coli cells and has an activity which is twice that of the zzso zzso in the standard zzso The zzso zzso of the fusion protein for the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are essentially unchanged from those of the zzso zzso The zzso in zzso unfolding reaction of the fusion protein at low zzso was found to be fully zzso and follow a three state model, suggesting that the two zzso unfold zzso At higher protein zzso the unfolding transition broadened and shifted to a higher zzso zzso zzso zzso results are consistent with the formation of zzso at the higher protein zzso even in the absence of zzso
