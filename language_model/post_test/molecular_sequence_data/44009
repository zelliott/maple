The construction, synthesis and expression of a genetically engineered zzso zzso fusion protein is zzso In order to target zzso necrosis factor zzso to tumor cells, zzso zzso techniques were used to construct an zzso fusion protein containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of human zzso was linked to the 3' end of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso containing the zzso the zzso and the hinge region to form the fused zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso into a zzso cell line producing the zzso zzso of the same zzso allowed the zzso zzso the zzso fusion protein zzso The zzso was zzso by affinity zzso Our data showed that zzso retained the zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso activity as measured by zzso Western zzso flow zzso analysis, zzso and zzso zzso using the human colon cancer cell line zzso zzso the zzso fusion protein zzso may prove useful in targeting the biological effects of zzso to tumor cells, and in this way stimulate the immune destruction of tumor zzso
