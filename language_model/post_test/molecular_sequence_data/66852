At the end of each zzso stage, insects perform the zzso zzso an innate behavior necessary for shedding the old zzso zzso triggering hormones zzso initiate these behaviors through direct actions on the zzso Here, we identify the zzso zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso which encodes two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso precisely with acquisition of zzso sensitivity to zzso and behavioral zzso zzso occurs in diverse networks of zzso producing both zzso and zzso zzso which appear to be downstream signals for behavior zzso These peptides include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone, zzso zzso hormones zzso 41 and 30, zzso hormone, zzso zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso and short zzso zzso In particular, cells zzso in abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which together elicit the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in abdominal zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose joint actions initiate the zzso motor zzso zzso also is expressed in brain zzso cells, whose release of zzso increases zzso in zzso zzso These findings provide insights into how zzso centrally patterned behaviors can be orchestrated via recruitment of zzso zzso zzso
