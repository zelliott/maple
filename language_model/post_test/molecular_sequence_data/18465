Since human and pig eyes have remarkably anatomical and zzso zzso zzso models have been broadly used for functional studies and therapeutic zzso Recently, a zzso relaxation of retinal zzso suggested that zzso signaling may be used to improve retinal blood flow in zzso impaired vision, and a further molecular characterization of zzso receptors would be zzso However, none of the zzso type zzso from pigs has been yet zzso Among the 19 zzso that compose the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso are capable of forming zzso zzso These zzso receptors are particularly interesting because their pharmacological and kinetic properties are notably different from receptors composed by other zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of the zzso from the pig and the functional expression of zzso channels in zzso zzso The most notable difference found in the pig zzso zzso was the absence of a stretch of 17 zzso acids near the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the rat and the zzso This sequence has a higher zzso match with the transcript zzso 2 of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso injected with zzso from the zzso generated currents when exposed to zzso that shared all the characteristics of other zzso zzso in zzso including its zzso by zzso This study will help to increase the knowledge of the zzso of the zzso further the understanding of this important neurotransmitter zzso family and will shed some light in the evolution of these genes among zzso
