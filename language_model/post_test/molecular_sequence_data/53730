A zzso of zzso X receptors zzso named zzso was cloned from the budding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso and a previously identified zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso formed a complex to bind zzso zzso acid response element zzso zzso zzso were carried out using a reporter gene containing a zzso upstream of zzso Two zzso zzso genes were constructed by placing zzso and zzso zzso fragments zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso downstream of the human zzso alpha and zzso alpha zzso zzso the zzso coding zzso zzso Each zzso zzso was zzso to a zzso zzso In case the zzso were zzso with all three zzso and treated with zzso acid zzso the reporter gene was activated in the zzso zzso The result suggests that the zzso complex functions as an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was detected in a zzso cell type, called zzso in the developing zzso zzso As this cell type has been shown to express zzso zzso it seems possible that the zzso complex mediates zzso signaling in this cell type to induce the expression of genes involved in the zzso of the developing zzso
