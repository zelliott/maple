zzso is a zzso domain zzso factor implicated in the development of the nervous system, zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the present study, we collected sequence of zzso zzso from 18 zzso species and 24 zzso zzso The reconstruction of zzso zzso and sequence analysis showed that this gene underwent notable zzso during zzso For those zzso species investigated, we analyzed the gene structure and regulatory elements of zzso We found that the zzso domain of zzso zzso was highly zzso zzso retained some specific zzso acids in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso also developed another potential zzso verified by a human expressed sequence tag zzso Comparative zzso analyses of the regulatory elements revealed a replacement of the ancestral zzso box by zzso in the zzso zzso and an evolutionary tendency for zzso box reduction in zzso in zzso We zzso identified the region of the effective promoter of human zzso which could drive the expression of zzso reporter in the chicken zzso In the zzso both the coding region and regulatory elements of zzso have some special features, such as the unique extended zzso zzso by the third zzso and absence of both zzso islands and zzso elements in the regulatory zzso Our gene mapping data showed that in human, zzso was hosted in one zzso which is a fusion product of two zzso zzso in zzso zzso This unique zzso environment of human zzso probably subjects its expression to the regulation at zzso zzso We deduce that the great zzso differences found in both zzso gene sequence and its regulatory elements might be significant for the fine regulation of its zzso expression and roles of zzso thus orchestrating its function in different zzso and zzso
