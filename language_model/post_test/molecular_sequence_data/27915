The DNA of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 55 has been shown to be associated with two proteins called zzso and zzso of molecular mass 11 zzso and 17 zzso zzso et zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The most abundant of these zzso protein zzso can protect DNA against zzso zzso In the present paper we report the zzso structure of protein zzso and its effect on zzso of DNA in zzso The zzso structure was determined from automated sequence analysis of the protein and from structural data provided by peptides derived from zzso of the protein at zzso acid and zzso zzso The zzso sequence of protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso 55 is closely related to that of the protein zzso zzso called zzso isolated from zzso zzso strain zzso among the nine zzso observed between the two proteins seven are zzso zzso of DNA in zzso is zzso by protein zzso at low zzso ratio but is inhibited at a ratio higher than zzso zzso which is the one determined in the bacterial zzso zzso
