The cellular response to low tissue oxygen zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso factor zzso Under hypoxic conditions, zzso activates zzso of critical zzso genes by recruitment of the general zzso zzso through interactions with its zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso interaction has been linked to zzso of tumor zzso To delineate the structural basis for this interaction, we have determined the solution structure of the complex between the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso alpha and the zzso zzso zzso motif of zzso response element binding protein zzso binding protein zzso Despite the overall similarity of the zzso structure to that of the zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso differences occur in the packing of zzso that can account for differences in zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso and remains relatively extended upon zzso wrapping almost entirely around the zzso domain in a groove through much of its zzso Three short zzso are formed upon zzso stabilized by zzso zzso The zzso side chain, which functions as a hypoxic switch, is located on the second of these zzso and is buried in the molecular zzso The third zzso of the zzso alpha zzso zzso in a deep zzso groove in zzso providing extensive zzso zzso interactions that contribute to the stability of the zzso The structure of this complex provides new insights into the mechanism through which zzso alpha recruits zzso in response to zzso
