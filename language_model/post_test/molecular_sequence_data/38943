In zzso the zzso expressed zzso and zzso genes are required for successful execution of the nuclear division cycles of early zzso In zzso zzso genes zzso similar zzso zzso and zzso zzso are components of a cell cycle checkpoint that delays zzso by zzso zzso of zzso We have identified zzso in a gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Like zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso but is required zzso for completing the embryonic nuclear zzso The arrest zzso of zzso zzso as well as genetic interactions between zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggest that zzso is functioning in the same regulatory zzso as these zzso These findings imply that zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is required for proper regulation of the early zzso cycles of zzso
