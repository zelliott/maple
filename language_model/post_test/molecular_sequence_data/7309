zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso A virus zzso isolated from persistently infected zzso cells have numerous zzso from cell zzso zzso zzso To determine which zzso in one zzso virus, zzso determine enhanced replication in zzso cells, a series of zzso viruses was rescued from infectious zzso in which zzso zzso segments were placed within the background of a related zzso virus, zzso zzso viruses containing the zzso region of zzso produced replication zzso in zzso cells that were larger than zzso but not as large as zzso zzso zzso viral replication required zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that these proteins remain closely associated during zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso proteins had no independent effect, but acted zzso with zzso in zzso proteins to enhance replication and render the virus capable of conventional plaque zzso zzso effects correlated with viral replication capacity and were not the result of any single zzso Full expression of the zzso zzso required zzso within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest novel interactions between the zzso and zzso proteins during zzso replication and provide useful new infectious zzso zzso
