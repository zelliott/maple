The zzso domain of zzso zzso was shown to inhibit protein synthesis of zzso zzso Its target, as revealed through in zzso and in zzso experiments, was not zzso as in the case of zzso but the transfer zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso which contain a modified base, zzso at the zzso position of each zzso The zzso zzso domain zzso these zzso just on the 3' side of this zzso Tight correlation was observed between the toxicity of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso of this group, zzso that these zzso are the primary targets of zzso zzso
