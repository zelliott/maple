zzso control zzso and metamorphosis in insects via a zzso complex of two nuclear zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso We used zzso resonance energy transfer zzso to study the zzso of the natural zzso element from the zzso gene zzso in complex with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso data revealed zzso of the zzso distance of the zzso zzso For the zzso zzso zzso A distance obtained for the zzso DNA a bend of about zzso zzso zzso degrees was zzso Nearly the same value zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained for the DNA zzso with the zzso zzso The respective bend angles estimated using zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso degrees and zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso Thus, the zzso data suggest for the first time that the zzso defines the architecture of the zzso zzso due to the significant deformation of the zzso This suggestion has been further reinforced using gel zzso experiments, which, in conjunction with high-resolution zzso I zzso indicate that the main contribution to the observed bend is given by the zzso itself, while binding of the zzso zzso brings on a slight additional change of the zzso zzso
