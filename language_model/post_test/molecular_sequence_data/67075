The plant zzso zzso zinc finger is one of 14 known zzso zzso zzso zzso have been found in more than 400 zzso proteins and are characterized by a zzso zzso motif that spans zzso zzso The precise function of zzso zzso is currently zzso however, the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso tumor zzso have been shown recently to bind zzso zzso We have recently identified a novel zzso zzso zzso as a binding partner for the abundant and ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zinc fingers, zzso and zzso and functions to bridge zzso to the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso but not zzso binds several zzso zzso but most strongly to zzso Surprisingly, a zzso region that follows the zzso is necessary for zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso region binds specifically to zzso when fused to zzso zzso zzso or as an isolated zzso demonstrating that it is sufficient for specific zzso zzso By exchanging the zzso regions between different zzso fingers we show that this region is a strong zzso of zzso binding zzso These findings establish the zzso zzso region as a zzso module and suggest that the zzso zzso function zzso of zzso signaling triggered by the interaction between zzso regions and zzso
