The zzso genes zzso zzso and twin of zzso zzso are upstream regulators in the retinal determination gene network zzso which instructs the formation of the adult eye zzso in zzso Most animals possess a singleton zzso zzso but the dependence of eye development on zzso is widely zzso A rare exception is given by the zzso eyes of zzso which develop independently of zzso and zzso To obtain insight into the origin of differential zzso and adult eye regulation, we studied the function of toy and zzso in the red flour zzso zzso zzso We find that single and zzso zzso of toy and zzso affect zzso eye development strongly but adult eye development only mildly in this primitive zzso zzso zzso zzso however, was provoked when zzso and toy were zzso in combination with the early retinal gene zzso zzso We propose that these data reflect a role of zzso during regional zzso in the developing head and that the subsequent maintenance and growth of the adult eye zzso is regulated partly by redundant and partly by specific functions of toy, zzso and zzso in zzso The results from embryonic zzso and comparative protein sequence analysis lead us further to conclude that zzso represents an ancestral state of redundant control by zzso and zzso
