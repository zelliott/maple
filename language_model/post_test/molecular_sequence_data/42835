The zzso alcohol zzso gene produce of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and compared with the parental zzso zzso The zzso alcohol zzso activity had pH zzso and zzso specificity similar to those of the parental zzso but exhibited somewhat increased and decreased zzso values for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also markedly less stable than the zzso from parental zzso to temperatures as low as 50 degrees zzso zzso analysis of a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso clone revealed a zzso zzso at position zzso and a zzso zzso at position zzso These would result in zzso 103 of each protein zzso being changed from an zzso to a zzso and zzso zzso being changed from an zzso to a zzso Whether one or both of these changes in primary sequence is responsible for the altered zzso affinities and stability is not yet zzso
