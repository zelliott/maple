As part of the European Scientists zzso zzso program, a zzso region zzso zzso located on zzso 4 around the zzso gene was zzso Analysis of the sequence and comparison to public databases predicts 103 genes in this area, which represents a gene density of one gene per zzso zzso Almost half of the genes show no significant zzso to known database zzso In addition, the first 45 zzso of the zzso which covers 11 zzso is similar to a region on zzso 2, as far as coding sequences are zzso This observation indicates that ancient zzso of large pieces of DNA have occurred in zzso
