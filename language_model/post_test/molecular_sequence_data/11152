We have used a zzso zzso system to identify proteins which bind to the zzso portion of the type 1 zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso but not the insulin zzso zzso This analysis identified zzso and zzso zzso zzso also binds to the zzso but not the zzso in zzso and zzso complexes are present in insect cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso of the zzso in the zzso system and in zzso The interaction of zzso with the zzso requires zzso activity and maps to the zzso of the zzso but does not depend on zzso zzso in this or the zzso zzso Instead, the binding maps to zzso zzso 1283 and requires zzso of this zzso zzso proteins are zzso proteins which have been shown to interact directly with components of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that they participate in growth zzso Our findings suggest that zzso proteins may play a role in zzso signal zzso and may contribute to the differences in zzso and zzso zzso zzso
