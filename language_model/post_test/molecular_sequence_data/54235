zzso zzso and degradation reactions of cellulose zzso zzso were studied in the presence or absence of alcohols zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso under zzso at zzso In the presence of zzso zzso time, 10 zzso the reducing ends were converted into zzso when the temperature of the zzso was zzso without the addition of any zzso A temperature of zzso is close to that required for the initiation of zzso zzso zzso Although the conversion was only around zzso in the range of zzso the zzso increased above zzso where the zzso expansion of cellulose zzso is reported to become zzso Finally, all reducing ends were converted into zzso at zzso Such zzso zzso likely arose from the lower zzso of the reducing ends in the zzso region due to their lower accessibility to zzso although the zzso in the zzso region was similar to that of zzso zzso that have a lower zzso ratio did not react with the reducing ends, suggesting that the zzso of the alcohol was critical for the zzso reaction to zzso The zzso cellulose samples were found to be significantly stabilized against zzso zzso The results of neat cellulose zzso indicated that two competitive zzso zzso zzso and degradation, formed a zzso substance at the reducing ends while the internal zzso units in the cellulose were comparatively zzso
