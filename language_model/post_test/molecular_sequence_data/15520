A neural zzso human natural zzso zzso is involved in synaptic zzso The key zzso zzso is a zzso zzso a type II membrane protein zzso an zzso zzso tail, zzso domain, stem region, and zzso zzso zzso Previously, we reported that zzso has two zzso differing in only the presence or absence of the zzso 13 zzso acids zzso in the zzso tail, but the functional distinction of these two zzso has not been zzso zzso we show that when expressed in zzso cells, short form zzso zzso exhibited significantly higher zzso activity than the longer form zzso despite their comparable specific activities in zzso In addition, zzso was strictly localized in zzso apparatus, whereas zzso was mainly localized in zzso but partly in the zzso zzso We demonstrated that the small zzso zzso recognized a zzso motif in the zzso tail near zzso that was important for zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso more strongly than zzso Finally, the attachment of zzso to another zzso zzso zzso had similar effects, such as reduced activity and zzso within zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso can control zzso transport through zzso binding zzso
