zzso are major components of primary plant cell walls and the seed zzso of zzso Despite progress in the structural zzso of zzso only very few zzso participating in or regulating their synthesis have been zzso A first candidate gene involved in the synthesis of zzso zzso I is zzso a putative plant zzso to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso studies with a promoter zzso construct and reverse zzso zzso data show that zzso is expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lines were identified using a reverse zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso seeds by various zzso methods and chemical analysis of the zzso revealed a strong reduction of zzso I in the zzso and a decrease of its molecular zzso In addition, scanning electron zzso of the seed surface indicated a distorted zzso zzso illustrating not only a structural but also a zzso role for zzso or zzso metabolism in proper zzso zzso
