The zzso protein zzso zzso the location of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso at zzso sites in zzso In this report we focus on the mechanism of interaction between zzso and zzso We show that neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso are required for association with zzso The zzso protein binds and zzso the zzso zzso core of zzso zzso also associates with zzso novel and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and in zzso and zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso demonstrates that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which zzso zzso activity, exposes the zzso domain of zzso allowing zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso experiments have identified two zzso zzso at positions 39 and 40 that are essential for zzso zzso zzso of zzso Likewise, the same zzso in the full-length zzso protein reduced zzso of zzso Thus zzso associates with multiple zzso zzso through a mechanism involving zzso interactions at the zzso core where binding of the zzso protein zzso zzso activity through displacement of the zzso
