A simple method is described for the application onto zzso columns of very crude or alternatively poorly soluble zzso samples prior to their zzso zzso The procedure involves the batch zzso of the crude zzso mixture from a dilute solution onto an appropriate zzso zzso zzso removal of the zzso by rotary evaporation or zzso and then zzso the zzso zzso material into guard column cartridges of suitable zzso The zzso products can then be zzso either by zzso or zzso zzso methods through the zzso coupled in tandem with zzso zzso zzso zzso This method has been successfully zzso for the routine zzso zzso of polar and zzso zzso prepared by solid phase zzso synthesis zzso methods as well as zzso derivatives and zzso used as part of zzso zzso
