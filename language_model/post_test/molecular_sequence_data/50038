zzso G proteins mediate cell growth and differentiation by zzso cell surface receptors to zzso zzso zzso The zzso alpha zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso are expressed specifically in zzso cells and their expression is highly regulated during differentiation of normal and zzso zzso In this study, we examined the zzso of zzso and its role in zzso and zzso zzso We observed a zzso intact cell zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso We also showed that peptides derived from the two zzso were zzso in zzso using zzso brain zzso Furthermore, we identified the putative zzso site and showed that zzso or deletion of this zzso zzso site inhibited zzso C zzso zzso The behavior of double zzso with the zzso active zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the putative zzso site suggests that the zzso site of zzso is essential for zzso zzso of zzso but not for direct interaction of the zzso with zzso
