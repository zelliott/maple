zzso zzso zzso zzso recently isolated from the zzso of the green zzso snake zzso zzso is a 38 zzso acid zzso containing a 17 zzso acid zzso ring structure similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was reported to be present in human plasma and zzso zzso and to be elevated in human zzso heart zzso Although previously named zzso it remains unknown if zzso is zzso or if is it present in canine zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Studies were performed in zzso in zzso dogs (N zzso 6) using intravenous infusion of synthetic zzso at 10 and 50 zzso zzso a sensitive and specific zzso for zzso the presence of zzso zzso was assessed in the canine plasma and urine before, zzso and following the administration of zzso synthetic zzso Additionally, we performed zzso studies using the indirect zzso method with zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso (N zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were also zzso 

We report that zzso is markedly zzso and zzso which, like zzso and zzso is associated with the increase in urinary and plasma zzso zzso zzso is also detected in canine zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

These studies establish that zzso is a potent zzso and zzso zzso with zzso actions linked to zzso and that zzso may play a zzso role in the regulation of sodium zzso
