zzso protein design is a reverse procedure of protein folding and structure zzso where constructing structures from zzso related proteins has been demonstrated to be the most reliable method for protein zzso structure zzso Following this spirit, we developed a novel method to design new protein sequences based on zzso related protein zzso For a given target structure, a set of proteins having similar fold are identified from the zzso library by structural zzso A structural profile is then constructed from the protein templates and used to guide the zzso search of zzso acid sequence space, where zzso packing is zzso by zzso based zzso zzso angle, and secondary structure zzso The method was tested on a zzso folding experiment based on a large set of 87 protein structures covering different fold classes, which showed that the zzso design significantly enhances the zzso and biological functionality of the designed sequences compared to the traditional zzso force field zzso Without using zzso zzso the designed sequences can be folded with an average zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso As a case study, the method is extended to redesign all 243 structurally resolved proteins in the zzso bacteria zzso zzso which is the second leading cause of death from infectious zzso On a smaller scale, five sequences were randomly selected from the design pool and subjected to experimental zzso The results showed that all the designed proteins are soluble with distinct secondary structure and three have well ordered zzso structure, as demonstrated by circular zzso and zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate a new avenue in zzso protein design that uses knowledge of evolutionary conservation from protein structural families to engineer new protein molecules of improved fold stability and biological zzso
