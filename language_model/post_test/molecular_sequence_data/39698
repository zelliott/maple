Twelve strains of zzso bacteria zzso identified as zzso zzso were isolated from industrial activated sludge wastewater treatment zzso zzso zzso gene sequences analysis showed that these strains were all closely related to zzso zzso zzso Six of them, however, had a zzso zzso gene similarity of only zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso suggesting the presence of a new zzso The name zzso zzso zzso is proposed for this new zzso The zzso properties of these six zzso supported the description of a new zzso The zzso zzso zzso strains produced thin filaments zzso zzso zzso they did not grow on the media supporting the growth of zzso zzso zzso and could be cultivated at higher temperature (up to zzso degrees zzso zzso data on zzso zzso were obtained by zzso on pure zzso Two new zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso and zzso targeting both zzso species, were zzso The presence of zzso zzso was investigated in 114 activated sludge zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso of the zzso samples and FISH analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso was present in zzso of zzso The remaining zzso zzso filaments were positive with probe zzso but could not all be identified as zzso zzso zzso suggesting the presence of more zzso zzso zzso within this zzso
