Like all members of the zzso neurotransmitter zzso family, the rat zzso acid zzso zzso is sorted and targeted to specialized zzso of the cell zzso Here we identify two zzso signals in the zzso zzso of zzso that cooperate to drive surface zzso This conclusion is based on the following zzso Upon deletion of the last 37 zzso zzso the resulting zzso remained trapped in the zzso zzso The presence of 10 additional zzso zzso zzso to support the interaction with the coat protein complex II component zzso surface expression of zzso reached 50% of the wild type zzso Additional extensions up to the position zzso zzso did not further enhance surface zzso Thus the last three zzso acids zzso comprise a second zzso zzso The sequence zzso is reminiscent of a type II zzso zzso accordingly substituting zzso for zzso zzso the effect of this zzso Neither the zzso motif nor the last 10 zzso rescued the protein from zzso retention when grafted onto zzso and zzso the zzso motif was zzso for targeting of zzso to the growth cone of zzso zzso zzso We therefore conclude that the two segments act in a zzso manner such that the zzso motif zzso supports zzso zzso export of the protein and the zzso zzso motif places zzso under the control of the zzso
