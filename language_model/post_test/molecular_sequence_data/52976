The structures of two zzso zzso zzso with zzso soluble zzso zzso have been determined by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of each inhibitor make extensive zzso contacts in the soluble zzso zzso active site, and each zzso zzso oxygen accepts hydrogen bonds from the zzso zzso groups of zzso and zzso These hydrogen bond interactions suggest that zzso and/or zzso are general acid zzso that facilitate zzso ring opening in the first step of the zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso among all zzso zzso and zzso is zzso among the soluble zzso zzso In one zzso complex, the zzso zzso oxygen additionally interacts with zzso If a comparable interaction occurs in zzso then zzso may provide zzso stabilization of partial negative charge on the zzso zzso The zzso side chain of zzso accepts a hydrogen bond from one of the zzso zzso groups in each zzso zzso Because zzso is the zzso zzso its interaction with the partial positive charge on the zzso zzso group mimics its approach toward the partial positive charge on the zzso carbon of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mimic features encountered in the reaction coordinate of zzso ring zzso and a zzso mechanism is proposed for zzso zzso zzso
