The zzso zzso acid zzso is a natural product zzso produced in zzso zzso by the zzso zzso acid zzso This zzso is highly unusual since it has no requirement for a zzso prosthetic zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso has been cloned and a highly efficient zzso source of the zzso zzso Two different crystal forms, zzso and zzso have been zzso The zzso form displays symmetry consistent with space group zzso and zzso parameters a zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, gamma zzso 120 zzso The Matthews zzso zzso of zzso A3 zzso zzso to two zzso each of approximate weight zzso zzso in the zzso unit with zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso to high resolution and experimental zzso are being sought to determine the zzso
