A zzso zzso containing a zzso DNA insert from zzso coli K-12 that zzso the ability to zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library constructed in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso A small zzso fragment, designated zzso zzso was zzso and found to contain an zzso of zzso zzso zzso a protein of 368 zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso carries a typical zzso signal zzso of 21 zzso acid zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein is similar to that of zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Based on these sequence similarities, we propose that the zzso gene is a member of zzso zzso family zzso The apparent molecular mass of the zzso when expressed in zzso coli, is approximately 40 zzso and the zzso activity is found mainly in the zzso zzso The zzso is zzso active at pH 7 and a temperature of 40 degrees zzso
