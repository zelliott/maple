Almost 50 % of all zzso zzso zzso are resistant to zzso which reduces the efficacy of zzso regimens, but does not make them completely zzso This zzso between in zzso zzso resistance and treatment outcome may partially be explained by changes in oxygen pressure in the gastric environment, as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso become zzso zzso under low oxygen conditions in zzso In zzso zzso the zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso which are required for the zzso of zzso and zzso of these genes results in zzso zzso Here the role of zzso zzso in these genes on the zzso of zzso resistance under low oxygen conditions is zzso Clinical zzso zzso zzso containing zzso resulting in a truncated zzso and/or zzso protein were selected and incubated under zzso conditions, and the effect of these conditions on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and cell viability were zzso While zzso had no effect on zzso zzso and zzso resistance, all zzso lost their zzso resistance when cultured under zzso zzso This loss of zzso resistance also occurred in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso Thus, zzso that activate zzso under low oxygen tension are not specifically induced by low oxygen conditions, but are already present under zzso zzso As there were no significant differences in cell viability between the clinical zzso it is likely that neither the zzso nor the zzso gene zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso
