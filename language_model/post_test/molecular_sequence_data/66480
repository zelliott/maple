zzso of zzso genes during cereal grain zzso and zzso growth is regulated zzso by sugar in zzso and positively by zzso zzso in zzso through the sugar response complex zzso and the zzso response complex zzso zzso We analyzed two zzso zzso zzso containing only zzso and zzso containing overlapped zzso and zzso zzso was zzso but zzso in both rice zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso response element zzso in the zzso promoter impaired its zzso response but enhanced sugar sensitivity, and zzso of zzso in the zzso promoter rendered it zzso but zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso was induced by zzso in zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso became zzso in zzso knockout zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso interaction zzso the sugar sensitivity of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso became zzso indicating that zzso affects sugar zzso zzso promoters active in zzso contain zzso whereas those active in zzso may or may not contain zzso confirming that the zzso and zzso zzso interaction prevents sugar feedback repression of zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso interaction affects sugar feedback control in balanced energy production during zzso growth and provide insight into the control mechanisms of zzso regulation of zzso expression by sugar and zzso signaling zzso
