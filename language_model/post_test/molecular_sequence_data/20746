zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been associated with worldwide zzso zzso Some species of these zzso are able to zzso humans and domestic animals, causing serious economic losses and public health zzso zzso useful and highly specific methods are required to detect and zzso monitor such zzso In the present paper, we describe the development of a zzso zzso method for the simultaneous detection of zzso and zzso species directly from zzso zzso with no previous viral isolation or DNA zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was developed based on the evaluation and combination of published primer sets, and was applied to the detection of the target zzso The method showed high sensitivity, and the specificity was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso samples collected during bovine zzso or contagious zzso outbreaks were submitted to zzso zzso zzso and confirmed its zzso 

These results suggest that the presented multiplex zzso provides a highly robust and sensitive method to detect zzso and zzso directly from clinical zzso The method can be used for viral identification and monitoring, especially in areas where zzso and zzso zzso
