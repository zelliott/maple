A zzso zzso zzso for a new class of zzso zzso has been isolated from a zzso library of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by expression zzso The zzso library was constructed in a zzso II zzso and screened using a zzso zzso obtaining a positive zzso The clone consisted of a zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso open reading frame, which zzso for a zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The protein was zzso in zzso coli, zzso to zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso had zzso and zzso zzso at zzso and 517 zzso zzso zzso existed as a zzso in solution and could be expressed either alone or as a fusion protein in zzso zzso zzso labeling experiments carried out with zzso and zzso demonstrated the usefulness of zzso as a reporter in the zzso zzso of zzso
