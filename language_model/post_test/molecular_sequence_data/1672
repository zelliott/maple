It was observed that a group of unusually stable DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were directed to zzso sequences zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso triplex formation, resulting in high binding affinity and zzso The zzso results zzso and zzso showed that the short zzso triplex zzso could be formed in zzso conditions zzso zzso as zzso length zzso zzso 2, and further extending to neutral pH as zzso zzso zzso This hairpin strategy for recognition of a zzso strand has a substantial binding advantage over either the conventional linear analog or simple zzso zzso zzso stability of zzso with zzso is not only zzso as expected for zzso involving zzso zzso zzso but also sensitive to the zzso The triplex zzso was formed in the zzso buffers of pH zzso but already zzso above pH zzso in the buffer of zzso zzso or zzso By contrast, the nature of a buffer had no major influence on stability of a hairpin zzso Here we provide a simple triplex system, and the data presented here may be useful in defining the experimental conditions necessary to stabilize triplex zzso
