Until the mid-1990s, the only zzso known to zzso bees of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso A second species, zzso zzso was first identified in 1996 from Asian honey zzso it is zzso that this zzso was transmitted from the Asian honey zzso zzso zzso to the European honey zzso zzso zzso Currently, zzso zzso is found on all zzso and has often been associated with honey bee colony collapse and other reports of high bee zzso zzso of Africanized zzso collected in 1979, preserved in alcohol, were analyzed by light zzso to count spores and were subjected to DNA zzso after which duplex zzso was zzso All molecular analyses zzso indicated that the zzso were infected with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso products were zzso and matched to sequences reported in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso pattern of the wings of these males was compared to those of the current population living in the same area and with the pattern of zzso collected in 1968 from zzso zzso SP, Brazil, from a location close to where African swarms first escaped in zzso The zzso results indicated that the population collected in 1979 was significantly different from the current living population, confirming its zzso Considering that the use of molecular tools for identifying zzso species is relatively recent, it is possible that previous reports of infections (which used only light zzso without zzso zzso wrongly identified zzso zzso as zzso zzso Although we can conclude that zzso zzso has been affecting Africanized zzso in Brazil for at least 34 years, the impact of this pathogen remains zzso
