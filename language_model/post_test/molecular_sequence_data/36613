The cloning of five DNA segments carrying at least seven genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that participate in zzso A zzso zzso was described zzso These DNA fragments were used to screen a zzso library of zzso DNA in order to examine if these zzso genes are clustered in zzso zzso One zzso clone zzso was zzso which zzso to all the zzso zzso analysis, using zzso blocked at various steps and zzso plasmids zzso from zzso showed that three additional genes zzso zzso and zzso are present in zzso A gene zzso zzso to the antibiotic, which was independently cloned in zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso was also found to be linked to the cluster of zzso zzso Thus, at least ten zzso genes and a self-defense gene are clustered in a zzso region of about 27 zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso gene which zzso in the zzso step of zzso A zzso was found to have zzso with a zzso resistance gene zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies using a zzso extract of the zzso zzso and its parent strain showed that the zzso zzso by zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Thus the zzso reaction is suggested to occur via the zzso of the target zzso zzso DNA regions zzso to zzso genes were found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both producers of zzso group zzso
