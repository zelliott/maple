We used zzso DNA techniques to map a panel of six zzso zzso zzso to regions of the human factor IX zzso zzso maps to 17 zzso acids at the zzso zzso of the heavy chain of zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso is defined to 36 zzso acids of the first zzso domain of human factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all map to a region of the heavy chain containing zzso acids 180 through zzso suggesting an zzso zzso zzso has been reported to interfere with binding of factor zzso to factor zzso
