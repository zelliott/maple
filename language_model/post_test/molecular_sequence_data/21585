About one-third of the carbon dioxide zzso released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity has been absorbed by the zzso where it partitions into the constituent zzso of zzso zzso This leads to ocean zzso one of the major threats to marine zzso and particularly to zzso organisms such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso are abundant zzso that are responsible for a large part of modern oceanic zzso zzso Culture experiments investigating the zzso response of zzso zzso to increased zzso have yielded contradictory results between and even within zzso Here we zzso the zzso mass of dominant zzso in the present ocean and over the past zzso thousand years, and found a marked pattern of decreasing zzso with increasing partial pressure of zzso and zzso decreasing zzso of zzso Our analyses revealed that zzso zzso species and zzso are distributed in the ocean according to zzso zzso A substantial impact on the marine carbon cycle might be expected upon zzso of this correlation to predicted ocean zzso in the zzso However, our discovery of a heavily zzso zzso zzso zzso in modern waters with low pH highlights the complexity of zzso responses to environmental forcing zzso
