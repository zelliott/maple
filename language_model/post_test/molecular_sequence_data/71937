We obtained 16 zzso sequences ( approximately zzso zzso each) of the first zzso of the zzso zzso gene for zzso zzso 4 zzso from 10 species of zzso Using these new sequences and five published sequences from zzso we constructed a zzso tree of the zzso species under study and showed that the rate of zzso substitution in the first zzso of zzso is very low, about zzso zzso zzso substitution per site per year, which is about half of the silent rate in zzso of zzso The ratios of substitution rates in this zzso zzso and zzso are approximately zzso where ITS is the nuclear zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso genes and zzso is the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso A segment zzso zzso in the first zzso of zzso in zzso species that is absent in wheat was considered as a zzso sequence and used to estimate the neutral rate (the rate of zzso in zzso to be zzso zzso zzso substitution per site per year, which is about three times higher than the substitution rate in the rest of the first zzso of zzso We estimated that the dates of divergence are zzso million years zzso for the zzso split, zzso zzso for the zzso split, zzso zzso for the zzso split, and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso
