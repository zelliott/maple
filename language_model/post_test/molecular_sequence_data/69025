The variation in zzso composition in soybean seeds is explained by different combinations of five genes controlling the zzso of zzso zzso as zzso The function of these genes is zzso and zzso zzso of over 1000 soybeans were classified into eight zzso types, and the frequency of zzso was different between the cultivated zzso max zzso zzso and the wild soybean zzso zzso zzso & zzso The zzso zzso type predominated in zzso zzso zzso of test zzso but was only found in zzso of zzso zzso Four unidentified zzso zzso were detected in the seeds of the zzso type zzso The mode of inheritance of zzso types is explained by a combination of zzso dominant and zzso acting zzso The combined chemical and genetic data show that the directed manipulation of soybean zzso composition is a possibility for the zzso
