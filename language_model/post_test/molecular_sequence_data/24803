The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso F1 zzso zzso which codes for the zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The precursor form of zzso has a molecular weight of zzso and is composed of a signal zzso a family 9 zzso domain, a family zzso zzso module zzso and a zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso were zzso zzso consisted of the zzso domain and the zzso zzso consisted of the zzso domain zzso zzso showed strong activity toward zzso zzso and barley zzso and low activity toward zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso values were 235 zzso and zzso zzso respectively, for zzso By contrast, zzso which was devoid of the zzso showed negligible activity toward zzso zzso about zzso of the activity of zzso supporting the previously proposed idea that family zzso zzso participate in the zzso function of the zzso zzso analysis using an zzso raised against zzso confirmed that zzso is a component of the zzso zzso zzso
