Although bats are important reservoirs of diverse viruses that can cause human epidemics, little is known about the presence of zzso in these flying zzso Among zzso bats of 18 species zzso three novel zzso zzso 1, 2, and 3) were identified from zzso specimens of 12 bats from five species and four zzso Two complete zzso each from the three zzso were zzso zzso analysis showed that they fell into three distinct clusters in the zzso family, with low zzso to known zzso especially in leader and 2A zzso Moreover, group 1 and 2 viruses are more closely related to each other than to group 3 zzso which exhibit zzso features distinct from those of the former two virus zzso In particular, the group 3 virus zzso contains the shortest leader protein within zzso a putative type I internal zzso entry site zzso in the zzso region instead of the type IV zzso found in group 1 and 2 zzso one instead of two zzso motifs in zzso an zzso substitution in the zzso motif in zzso zzso and a zzso zzso motif in zzso zzso Group 1 and 2 viruses are unique among zzso in having zzso instead of the zzso motif in zzso These findings suggest that the three zzso belong to two novel zzso in the zzso zzso This report describes the discovery and complete zzso analysis of three zzso in zzso and their presence in diverse bat zzso suggests the ability to cross the species zzso
