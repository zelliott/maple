A recently discovered zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso acid and zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso is a member of the zzso signature family, which is widespread in nature and contains a novel zzso zzso zzso Here we report the expression in zzso coli, zzso and characterization of both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was stable, exhibited a pH optimum of zzso and was able to zzso both zzso of zzso with little zzso The zzso zzso showed no significant change in kinetic zzso zzso was found to be the best zzso with changes in chain length or replacement of the zzso group producing greatly decreased values of zzso As with another member of this family, fatty acid zzso zzso zzso has the uncommon ability to zzso zzso and zzso at similar zzso zzso is even more unusual in that it will only zzso zzso and zzso with little zzso zzso zzso and larger zzso and zzso and larger zzso are not zzso suggesting that the zzso active site is very zzso zzso zzso of each zzso in the putative zzso zzso to zzso resulted in total loss of activity for zzso and zzso while zzso exhibited a zzso decrease in zzso and significant increases in zzso zzso Overall, the zzso data are similar to those of fatty acid zzso zzso and support the suggestion that there are two distinct zzso within the zzso signature zzso
