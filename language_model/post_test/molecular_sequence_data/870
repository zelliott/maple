The molecular basis of the interaction of zzso restriction zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso at their zzso recognition sequence is investigated using a range of zzso zzso zzso I protection analysis with the zzso reveals the protection of a zzso zzso region encompassing the zzso recognition zzso The zzso in contrast, protects a larger zzso zzso zzso contacts two adjacent zzso zzso and the single zzso zzso in both the strands within the recognition sequence zzso zzso by zzso zzso protection, interference and missing zzso interference zzso In contrast, zzso zzso does not show elaborate zzso zzso zzso interference analysis also showed the differential interaction of zzso and zzso with zzso groups of three adjacent bases on both strands within the recognition zzso The single zzso zzso within the sequence is zzso zzso to the zzso zzso consistent with zzso base zzso The zzso on the other hand does not show any major DNA zzso The results demonstrate that the differences in the molecular interaction pattern of the two proteins at the same recognition sequence reflect the contrasting chemistry of DNA zzso and zzso zzso by these two dissimilar zzso working in combination as constituents of a cellular defense zzso
