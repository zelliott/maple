A novel zzso strain, zzso was isolated from a salt field near zzso on the Yellow Sea in zzso zzso were zzso rods and bore zzso zzso in terminal zzso The optimum pH and temperature for growth of this zzso were pH 7 and 25 degrees C, zzso The main respiratory zzso was zzso and the major cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso Analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence data revealed that the isolate formed an evolutionary lineage distinct from other zzso zzso zzso of sequence similarity between the isolate and other zzso species ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso values between strain zzso and a zzso closely related strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso were less than 24 zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence comparison and zzso zzso a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is also proposed that zzso zzso be transferred to the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso based on its zzso zzso gene sequences and other zzso zzso
