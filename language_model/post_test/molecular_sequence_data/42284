zzso human zzso C zzso expressed in human kidney zzso cells, has a higher zzso activity than plasma zzso while its in zzso circulatory zzso is essentially zzso compared to that of the natural zzso In seeking to zzso the molecular basis for the improved efficacy of the zzso zzso drug, we focused on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso C is a heavily zzso modified zzso zzso with four zzso zzso zzso composition analysis of zzso revealed a zzso higher zzso content and a zzso lower zzso acid content compared to plasma zzso In addition, we found that zzso contains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in its zzso zzso while plasma zzso is devoid of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso were released by zzso and separated into 25 zzso by zzso zzso zzso The most abundant zzso were structurally characterized by zzso composition and linkage analysis, in conjunction with zzso zzso at 600 zzso The structure of the major neutral zzso in zzso was determined to be: zzso see zzso Two representatives of the zzso zzso in zzso are: zzso see zzso and zzso see zzso Thus, many of the zzso zzso in zzso were found to terminate in zzso beta zzso beta zzso in zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso and/or in zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso Since the latter zzso was first zzso zzso Chao, zzso and Van zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso observed in the zzso zzso of zzso derived from human kidney zzso cells, we propose to label the zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso terminal zzso the zzso zzso The zzso zzso may contribute to the higher zzso activity of zzso as compared to plasma zzso
