The zzso protein from zzso zzso has a zzso zzso fold that evolved from an ancestral zzso zzso The sequence zzso responsible for this dramatic structural evolution are zzso Here we use analysis of sequence alignments to show that zzso a small side chain in the zzso zzso zzso interface of zzso zzso was a much larger zzso side chain at a previous point in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a zzso reduction in zzso affinity relative to the wild type as well as a large increase in zzso zzso stability zzso zzso zzso 10 degrees zzso apparently due to partial filling of the zzso zzso from within the same zzso An additional zzso in the zzso zzso zzso almost completely zzso zzso zzso while maintaining the high zzso zzso The secondary structure content of the zzso versions of zzso zzso is similar to that of the zzso zzso and the zzso structure of the zzso appears relatively well zzso These results zzso support a model in which the zzso zzso interface of zzso zzso was created by altered volume zzso within a limited branch of the zzso lineage and zzso suggest the possibility that the evolution of the zzso zzso from an zzso zzso proceeded through an zzso zzso zzso
