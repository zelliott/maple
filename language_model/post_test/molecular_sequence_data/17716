The effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on acquisition of an active avoidance task following their zzso administration to mice were zzso Neither free zzso zzso zzso nor zzso zzso zzso altered acquisition of the avoidance zzso In contrast, 53, but not 16 zzso of zzso significantly impaired response zzso A zzso but not zzso zzso dose of zzso decreased locomotor activity levels measured in an open zzso Together with previous findings that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso also impair avoidance zzso these data indicate that the zzso zzso is the minimum sequence needed to zzso with acquisition of an active avoidance zzso Because the various zzso zzso do not bind to zzso zzso it is likely that their effects on avoidance acquisition represent a separate class of pharmacological agents whose effects are zzso by a zzso zzso zzso These results are important to the interpretation of behavioral studies involving peripheral administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
