The zzso deficient zzso mouse is an zzso zzso zzso characterized by zzso in the central nervous zzso The expression of the zzso basic protein zzso gene is inhibited zzso The zzso gene is duplicated zzso in zzso and zzso 3 to 7 of the upstream copy is zzso In the present studies, we determined the approximate position of the zzso boundary and the zzso sequence surrounding the 3' boundary of the inversion and found a number of sequences zzso to the switching regions of mouse zzso heavy chain gene and J regions of human T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso complementary to zzso 3 and 7, which zzso to the zzso segment, was detected by zzso protection zzso This abnormal transcript was also shown to zzso through the zzso segment to reach the zzso initiation site of the downstream zzso
