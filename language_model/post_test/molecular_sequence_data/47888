Most of the molecules known to regulate zzso asymmetry in zzso zzso are expressed on the left side of the future trunk region of the zzso Members of the protein family zzso zzso and the putative zzso zzso Dan have not before been implicated in zzso zzso In zzso these proteins have been shown to zzso members of the transforming growth factor beta zzso and zzso families of zzso zzso 

Chick zzso zzso was found to be expressed in the left head zzso and in the left flank of the zzso zzso on the left side of the head was controlled by Sonic zzso zzso acting through the zzso family member zzso in the flank, zzso was also regulated by zzso but independently of zzso Surprisingly, although no known targets of zzso are expressed zzso on the right side of the zzso at these zzso zzso of zzso on this side of the zzso led to zzso of the zzso factor zzso and reversal of the direction of heart and head zzso apparently as independent zzso zzso with the possibility that zzso may be acting on zzso expressed zzso family members such as the bone zzso proteins zzso this result was zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso maintains a delicate balance of different zzso family members involved in zzso decisions, and reveal the existence of partially overlapping molecular pathways regulating zzso asymmetry in the head and trunk of the zzso
