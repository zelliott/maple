zzso cells are a major source of zzso zzso but the possibility that vascular zzso zzso generate zzso has not been zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso have the ability to produce zzso which may contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from mouse zzso and incubated with various zzso of zzso II zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and type I zzso were detected with relative zzso zzso levels in culture medium were measured with zzso zzso levels of zzso were detected with Western zzso zzso II (10 and 100 zzso 1 zzso induced a zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was accompanied by release of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso expression and zzso release were blocked by zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso To further confirm our findings, we cloned and then zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso reverse sequencing zzso Their zzso sequences were identical to zzso zzso from mouse vascular zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso type I zzso zzso and protein expression were inhibited by zzso (10 zzso an zzso zzso zzso but not zzso (10 zzso an zzso zzso zzso suggesting a significant role of zzso zzso in regulation of zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that vascular zzso zzso are able to zzso and release zzso in response to zzso zzso
