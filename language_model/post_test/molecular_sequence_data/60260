Nuclear import of conventional nuclear zzso sequence zzso proteins initially involves recognition by the zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso binds the zzso and zzso targets the zzso protein complex to the nuclear zzso Here we examine zzso from the plant zzso zzso zzso which exhibits nuclear envelope zzso typical of zzso rather than zzso in other zzso cell zzso We show that zzso recognizes conventional zzso of two different types with high affinity zzso of zzso zzso in contrast to mouse zzso zzso which exhibits much lower affinity zzso of zzso zzso and only achieves high affinity in the presence of zzso Unlike zzso zzso is thus a high affinity zzso zzso in the absence of zzso Interestingly, zzso was also able to bind with high affinity to zzso recognized specifically by zzso and not zzso including that of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso of nuclear import in zzso indicated that in the absence of zzso zzso zzso but dependent on zzso and zzso zzso was able to mediate nuclear zzso to levels comparable with those zzso by zzso Neither zzso nor zzso was able to mediate nuclear import in the absence of the other zzso zzso novel zzso recognition and nuclear transport properties imply that plants may possess an zzso nuclear import zzso independent of zzso in addition to that zzso by zzso
