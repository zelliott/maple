The X zzso zzso controlling element locus zzso in the mouse has been shown to influence the X zzso zzso zzso maps to the central region of the X zzso which also contains the zzso zzso itself possibly implicated in the X zzso zzso Three zzso markers spanning the zzso locus have been isolated from an zzso containing zzso All three zzso markers showed complete linkage with zzso in zzso for the central span of the mouse X zzso between zzso and zzso and strong linkage zzso with zzso in all but one of the zzso mouse strains zzso In the standard zzso typing strain zzso the two zzso most closely zzso zzso fail to carry the zzso forms expected if zzso and zzso are zzso Alternative explanations for this finding are presented in the context of our search for understanding the relation between zzso and zzso
