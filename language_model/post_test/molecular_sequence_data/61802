zzso zzso underlying the production of zzso in the human and animal pathogen zzso zzso and the contribution of zzso production to the zzso of this zzso have, until now, remained zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso strains zzso and Newman produce zzso when the cells are starved for zzso We further identified and characterized a zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and situated between zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso zzso that is involved in the production of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in both zzso and Newman, eliminates the ability of these strains to produce a zzso under zzso growth conditions, while introduction of zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso the inability of the zzso to produce the zzso zzso zzso in both the zzso and Newman backgrounds, displayed a drastic growth zzso compared to the wild type, in zzso growth zzso whereas no such zzso was observed during growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a restored ability to grow under iron zzso We further showed that an zzso zzso was compromised in a zzso kidney zzso model of zzso zzso infection, illustrating the importance of zzso production to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes were present in all zzso zzso strains tested (and all zzso zzso zzso zzso but were zzso in any of the 13 zzso zzso tested, including zzso zzso
