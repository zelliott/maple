zzso zzso derivatives of zzso play critical roles in zzso apparatus of zzso algae, and higher zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso of algae is largely unknown, it is of particular interest because they have a very complicated evolutionary zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important protein that plays essential roles in zzso zzso With the availability of 18 zzso zzso zzso we performed a comprehensive comparative analysis of zzso genes and explored their distribution, structure, evolution, origins, and zzso 

zzso 60 putative zzso genes were identified and classified into two major zzso zzso and zzso according to their domain zzso Genes in the zzso zzso were found in 10 green algae and 1 red zzso but absent in other zzso In the zzso tree, zzso genes of green algae and higher plants share a common zzso and are of zzso origin, whereas that of red algae is of zzso The zzso of zzso genes were widespread only in green algae, while zzso zzso were seen in most of zzso zzso analysis on zzso genes supported the hypothesis that zzso is an ancient gene originated before the formation of extant zzso zzso The zzso gene is more closely related to zzso in evolution than to zzso The two zzso genes were isolated from the green zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression profiles of zzso genes were observed under high light stress of different zzso 

Green algae received a zzso zzso zzso from host zzso Although red algae inherited the zzso from zzso during primary zzso it remains unclear in zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a common feature in green algae and higher zzso The zzso of zzso is most likely due to gene zzso before divergence of green algae and higher zzso zzso domain structures and expression analyses in green zzso zzso zzso indicate that various zzso genes are in different manners response to zzso The knowledge of evolution of zzso genes in zzso zzso provided information of gene cloning and functional investigation of zzso genes in algae in the zzso
