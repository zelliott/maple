We have isolated and analyzed the structure of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso Six overlapping DNA fragments containing the entire zzso gene were identified in a rat zzso zzso zzso is a unique gene composed of 20 zzso that together span over 54 zzso zzso zzso gene analysis demonstrated that 2 zzso of zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso expression on a zzso zzso gene in zzso We show that zzso the first zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of the zzso zzso gene driven by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the negative regulatory element was located within 500 zzso of the zzso of zzso 1, and this zzso zzso selectively bound nuclear proteins isolated from neural and zzso zzso zzso the effect of the negative regulatory element on zzso zzso was zzso and zzso and zzso a zzso sequence zzso was identified as the binding site for nuclear proteins within the zzso fragment, as determined by zzso and gel shift zzso We conclude that an zzso element that displays features of a zzso zzso zzso zzso
