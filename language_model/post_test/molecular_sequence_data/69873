To assess the relationship between the zzso and zzso of adult zzso patients we have selected from a group of 512 zzso patients attending zzso in France, all these of greater than 35 zzso We have zzso the entire coding sequence of their zzso zzso The complete zzso was determined in 7 of the 8 patients and clinical data regarding zzso respiratory and zzso function were carefully zzso All these patients are compound zzso seven carrying the delta zzso and one the zzso on one zzso The other zzso carried is: zzso a zzso zzso located in zzso coding for zzso region in five patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso in two patients zzso + zzso zzso an zzso zzso in one zzso These results strongly suggest less severe zzso zzso to be associated with these zzso and strengthen the hypothesis that less severe zzso are genetically zzso
