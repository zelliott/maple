The gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso zzso was zzso as a large precursor consisting of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mature proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the mature region exhibited high similarity to those of such bacterial zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identity zzso zzso and human zzso gene product zzso zzso zzso which is related to a fatal neurodegenerative zzso zzso The presumed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso et zzso (2001) Nature zzso zzso 8, zzso was found to be zzso in the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso was zzso by such zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso it has been clarified that these zzso form a zzso linkage with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed that the zzso lost both zzso activity and zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso has a unique zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as previously observed for zzso
