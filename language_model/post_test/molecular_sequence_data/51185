The zzso zzso water content, and volume of zzso films of zzso have been measured as a function of relative humidity zzso These data are used with the zzso formula to determine the optical zzso of zzso parallel and perpendicular to the zzso zzso The analysis reveals a drop in the optical zzso of approximately zzso between 80 and zzso zzso indicating a phase zzso
