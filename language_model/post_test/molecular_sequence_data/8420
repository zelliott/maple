T cells play a critical role in the development of zzso arthritis zzso zzso with zzso zzso type II collagen zzso results in chronic inflammation with progressive damage to the zzso The expression of specific zzso Class II alpha beta zzso including zzso is critical to induction of zzso The alpha chains of zzso and zzso are identical in zzso The zzso and zzso beta chains differ by only four zzso acid zzso 85, 86, 88, and zzso However, mice of the zzso zzso are not susceptible to zzso To examine the impact of these structural differences in zzso molecules on T cell zzso recognition, we studied presentation of zzso peptides and zzso zzso by zzso obtained from zzso and zzso zzso We also assessed presentation of zzso zzso basic protein zzso and zzso peptides by these zzso zzso zzso zzso presented both peptides and proteins to our T cell zzso In contrast, zzso obtained from zzso mice presented zzso but were defective in the processing and/or presentation of protein zzso We then altered pairs of the zzso in zzso to those found in zzso using zzso zzso and zzso these zzso into M zzso B zzso All zzso were able to present zzso but those expressing zzso were unable to present protein zzso The use of zzso expressing hybrid molecules zzso 85 and 86 from zzso 88 and 89 from zzso or vice zzso allowed us to zzso the region responsible for this zzso to zzso 85 and 86 of the beta zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso versus zzso and zzso in zzso at these sites severely compromised the capacity for protein zzso Resistance to zzso in zzso zzso mice may be a reflection of the limited repertoire of zzso to which these mice can respond relative to susceptible zzso zzso
