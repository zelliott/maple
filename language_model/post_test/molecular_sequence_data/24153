zzso zzso cell zzso zzso are zzso ordered in the zzso tract according to their retinal zzso In zzso zzso zzso and boxer zzso zzso some zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso tract but zzso the zzso zzso zzso cloning reveals that zzso and box zzso zzso and zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso Both genes are required for HS zzso as shown by zzso and zzso analysis, and are expressed zzso and then zzso likely playing zzso zzso zzso in box can be rescued by zzso of zzso zzso double zzso show synthetic zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso function requires HS in zzso however, tract sorting does not require zzso function, since it is normal in zzso zzso zzso This genetic evidence that zzso zzso zzso function is required for zzso tract sorting provides clues to begin understanding the underlying molecular zzso
