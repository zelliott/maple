A zzso study was carried out on two bacterial zzso zzso and zzso isolated from a tidal flat of the Yellow Sea, zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence studies showed that these strains belonged to the family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso shared zzso % sequence similarity and were related most closely to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % sequence zzso zzso Members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the next closest relatives of the new zzso with sequence similarities zzso 91 zzso The two zzso were zzso strictly zzso gliding zzso They grew in the presence of zzso % zzso at pH zzso and at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso shared a number of zzso and zzso properties with zzso zzso zzso zzso but they differed from this strain in the zzso of zzso and in the production of zzso and zzso zzso Both strains possessed zzso : zzso summed feature 4 zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso and zzso : zzso as major cellular fatty zzso The major respiratory zzso was zzso 7 zzso The zzso contents of the zzso DNA of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso data and zzso zzso it is proposed that the two zzso represent a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso zzso descriptions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also zzso
