In this study, 75 zzso toxin zzso zzso coli zzso strains originating from foods zzso zzso zzso and drinking water zzso zzso 2) were analyzed for their zzso zzso as well as for further zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A broad spectrum of zzso genes was zzso zzso strains zzso contained zzso or zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Seven strains zzso zzso zzso or zzso and 15 strains zzso carried both zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso the most abundant accessory zzso markers in zzso food zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only four strains were zzso zzso three of these belonged to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and contained a typical zzso zzso coli zzso zzso The results of this study show that a number of zzso strains that occur in foods appear to be zzso for humans, based on their zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and detection of additional zzso factors in zzso strains may help to better assess the risk of such strains for causing human zzso
