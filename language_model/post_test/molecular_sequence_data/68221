zzso zzso zzso zzso was incorporated into zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso at a zzso ratio of zzso zzso of the incorporated zzso resulted in the formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similar zzso formation was observed by zzso of bovine zzso zzso with Western zzso using zzso zzso In the zzso state, zzso zzso zzso into very small zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with 500 zzso zzso failed to cause these fragments to separate from zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing of these fragments showed that zzso zzso the 267 zzso and zzso bonds of zzso The time course of zzso formation indicated that zzso zzso the zzso bond first to produce zzso and zzso fragments and subsequently the zzso bond in the zzso zzso to produce the zzso zzso Neither zzso activity, the reduced CO difference spectrum, nor the zzso spectrum of zzso zzso differed from those of zzso zzso Heat treatment at 50 degrees C for 20 zzso did not cause any decrease in activity of zzso zzso when the zzso zzso was zzso This high stability toward heat treatment was not observed in the zzso zzso zzso diffusion experiments on zzso showed that the size of the zzso holding the zzso was not changed significantly after zzso On the basis of these results, zzso is concluded to be deeply embedded in the zzso zzso
