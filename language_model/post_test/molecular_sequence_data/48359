The zzso zzso is composed of 17 species which have been isolated from various zzso Of particular interest are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as these have been associated with human cases of zzso the probable transmission routes being through the zzso of contaminated drinking water and zzso To date, only limited studies of zzso traits in this zzso have been zzso The present study used 60 zzso strains isolated from different sources, representing 16 of the 17 species of the zzso to investigate their ability to adhere to and invade the human zzso cell line zzso In addition, the presence of five putative zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was screened for in these strains by zzso All zzso species except zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso to zzso cells, and most species zzso were zzso The most invasive species were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All invasive strains were positive for zzso zzso a putative invasion zzso Other putative zzso genes were present in other species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso No zzso genes were detected in strains which showed little or no invasion of zzso zzso These results indicate that many zzso species are potential pathogens of humans and zzso
