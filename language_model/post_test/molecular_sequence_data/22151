The zzso gene encodes zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and is known to be involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using degenerative zzso a zzso of zzso gene was cloned and zzso from the zzso producer, zzso zzso zzso results showed zzso was expressed in a zzso culture, zzso culture and the early stages of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso labeling of zzso A by zzso zzso revealed that this zzso does not play a role in providing precursors such as zzso for the zzso zzso under these zzso zzso Using a zzso method, zzso was disrupted by zzso of an zzso resistance gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso results revealed that the resulting zzso zzso zzso produced comparable levels of zzso to that observed for zzso This result is consistent with the hypothesis that zzso metabolism in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is not zzso by zzso and that zzso is probably produced through direct zzso of the zzso zzso group of zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were both able to grow in minimal medium with zzso or zzso as the sole carbon source, contrasting previous observations for zzso zzso which demonstrated zzso is required for growth on zzso In conclusion, loss of the zzso zzso zzso neither affects zzso zzso in a minimal zzso nor zzso metabolism in an zzso zzso and its role remains an zzso
