In this work, the interaction between a synthetic analog of zzso lipids and cholesterol was studied using zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained zzso chains attached via two zzso bonds to the zzso carbon of the zzso zzso The preliminary studies showed that zzso formed with the pure zzso have a zzso zzso here, a hypothesis that zzso cholesterol to zzso could zzso a higher rigidity on the films was zzso To check this proposal, two-dimensional zzso of cholesterol and zzso in zzso films was studied using surface pressure and surface potential zzso as well as Brewster angle zzso and zzso infrared reflection zzso zzso The stability of the zzso films was evaluated based on thermodynamics of mixing of cholesterol and zzso Atomic level information concerning the orientation of molecules and the degree of zzso of polar zzso was obtained from molecular dynamics zzso
