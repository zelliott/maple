The zzso zzso domain reduces the affinity of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso by exerting an zzso function in zzso zzso We replaced this domain zzso zzso with zzso segments from other zzso zzso zzso and 4) or functionally similar regions from other sources zzso zzso zzso protein zzso II, plasma membrane zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso bound zzso with zzso of 16, zzso and 27 zzso zzso These zzso molecules were expressed in the zzso cell zzso zzso with incorporated zzso was activated in response to zzso agents zzso and zzso resulting in an alkaline shift of the zzso pH zzso of zzso zzso as was the case with the intact rat zzso In contrast, incorporation of the zzso or other zzso segments induced a zzso alkaline shift of zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicating that these segments could not function as an zzso domain in zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso but not in the zzso are important for the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso from zzso was efficiently zzso to the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso domain physically interacts with zzso of the zzso Together, these findings support the notion that the reduction of zzso affinity in zzso exchange occurs through a mechanism involving a highly zzso interaction of the zzso domain with its putative zzso in zzso
