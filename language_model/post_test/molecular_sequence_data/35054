A protein zzso containing zzso binding zzso zzso which resembles protein zzso R zzso in domain organization, was recently discovered to be a member of the zzso zzso family in zzso zzso has roles in zzso immunity through zzso protein synthesis and zzso zzso therefore, it is thought that zzso may have a similar role in fish zzso zzso In the present study, the roles of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and protein synthesis regulation were zzso zzso and zzso possess zzso zzso binding zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso however, they have zzso of differing lengths inserted between zzso zzso IV and zzso zzso has an insert domain of 73 zzso acids zzso whereas zzso has an insert sequence of only 10 zzso suggesting that zzso could be a dysfunctional zzso or could interact with different zzso Our results show that both zzso and zzso functionally interact with zzso and inhibit protein zzso although zzso possesses attenuated zzso zzso Our results also show that deletion of the insert in either zzso results in the complete zzso of zzso activity, suggesting that the insert is critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso activity appears to be independent of insert length but may depend on the presence of specific zzso acids within the insert zzso Furthermore, the effects of the zzso regulatory domain on zzso activity were zzso zzso of the zzso results in reduced zzso activity of these zzso relative to the zzso forms, indicating that the isolated zzso domain is sufficient for zzso zzso and that zzso and zzso may be regulated in a similar zzso Overall, our results show that zzso is a functional zzso in zzso and contribute to our understanding of the function of zzso in zzso
