zzso zzso zzso zzso has an zzso zzso that involves T cells that have a type 1 zzso zzso zzso is suspected to be the type 1 zzso involved in zzso pathology, and to test this notion more directly the zzso of zzso was compared in mice deficient in the zzso gene zzso knockout or zzso and control mice zzso zzso or zzso zzso The clinical course of zzso in zzso mice closely paralleled that in control mice, yet virus persisted in the zzso of zzso mice for an extended period of time, severe zzso skin zzso developed, and zzso mice were far more susceptible to zzso zzso hypersensitivity to viral zzso was present, though diminished, in knockout mice, and serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated a zzso zzso No differences existed in zzso responses to in zzso zzso stimulation in zzso vs control mice nor in T cell or zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso of infected zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso zzso did occur in in zzso zzso zzso immune zzso zzso zzso were not statistically different between any of the groups of mice zzso These observations indicate that although zzso plays an important role in the clearance of virus from the eye, the zzso of zzso zzso most likely involves additional zzso inflammatory mechanisms, or immune responses to zzso zzso
