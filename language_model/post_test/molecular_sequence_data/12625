Human zzso zzso diseases are genetically linked to particular zzso of zzso class II zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso an zzso disease of the skin, is linked to a rare zzso of zzso zzso 1 of 22 known zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso differs from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso only at three zzso zzso beta 67, 70, and zzso The disease is caused by zzso against zzso 3 zzso and T cells are thought to trigger the zzso production against this zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso binding zzso seven candidate peptides of the zzso zzso were zzso T cells from four zzso patients with active disease responded to one of these zzso peptides zzso zzso two patients also responded to zzso zzso clones specific for zzso zzso high levels of zzso 4 and 10, indicating that they may be important in triggering the production of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was presented by the zzso zzso zzso but not by other zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso demonstrated that selective presentation of zzso which carries a positive charge at the zzso position, was due to the zzso charged zzso of the zzso pocket zzso beta 70 and zzso DR beta 71 has a negative charge in zzso but a positive charge in other zzso zzso including the zzso zzso linked to zzso zzso The charge of the zzso pocket in the zzso zzso binding site therefore appears to be a critical zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso
