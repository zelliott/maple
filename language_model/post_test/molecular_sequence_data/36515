The zzso zzso protein family of zzso cells is thought to form a complex on zzso mainly by zzso zzso To investigate the structural basis of how they associate with one another, the primary sequences of the related proteins accumulated from various organisms were analyzed searching for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it is shown that all the zzso zzso proteins contain a bilateral zzso zzso on a putative zzso which consists of two periodic zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso arranged on the opposite sides of an zzso The zzso zzso zzso except for those from the zzso zzso zzso are shown to contain two kinds of zzso areas on putative zzso which can zzso bind to each other in a zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso proteins contain a zzso zzso and a zzso hook in different zzso zzso Thus, it is proposed that the zzso proteins associate with the zzso proteins via the zzso zzso or zzso zzso and associate with one another with these zzso zzso
