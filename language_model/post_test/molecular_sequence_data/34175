zzso virus zzso and Coastal Plains virus zzso were isolated from cattle in Australia and zzso has also been isolated from the biting zzso zzso zzso Complete zzso sequencing revealed that the viruses share a novel zzso structure within the family zzso each virus containing two additional putative genes between the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso genes and one between the G and viral zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted novel protein products are highly zzso at the sequence level but demonstrate clear conservation of secondary structure zzso suggesting conservation of biological zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso and zzso form an independent group within the zzso zzso Although no disease has been observed in association with these zzso zzso were detected at high prevalence in cattle and buffalo in northern Australia, indicating the need for disease monitoring and further study of this distinctive group of zzso
