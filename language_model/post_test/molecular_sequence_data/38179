zzso in the genes zzso zzso and zzso have been reported to cause combined zzso hormone zzso zzso in mice and zzso In dogs, a similar zzso has been described in the German shepherd zzso We have previously reported that the zzso gene zzso is not zzso in affected German shepherd zzso In this study, we report the isolation and mapping of the canine zzso gene zzso and we assessed the involvement of zzso in German shepherd dog zzso The canine zzso gene was found to contain three zzso zzso a 226 zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was zzso and zzso zzso with the mouse and human zzso zzso zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso zzso was mapped to canine zzso zzso Further mapping with a canine radiation hybrid panel showed zzso with the zzso DNA marker zzso zzso analysis of zzso DNA from dwarf German shepherd dogs revealed no zzso in the zzso zzso Moreover, linkage analysis of zzso revealed no zzso between the zzso locus and the zzso zzso excluding this gene as candidate for canine zzso and providing a new spontaneous model of zzso
