The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the sequences of its zzso and of two peptides obtained by zzso of the protein were zzso A DNA zzso including the zzso structural gene was cloned in zzso coli, using zzso zzso designed on the basis of the zzso sequences and a zzso usage table calculated from published sequences of nine zzso genes of the zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso analysis of the cloned DNA revealed that the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso sequence close to and upstream of the zzso gene contained a probable zzso site but no identifiable promoter zzso Three additional potential zzso frames were found upstream of and very close to the zzso zzso with consensus zzso and zzso promoter sites between the first and second of zzso It is hoped that the highly zzso expression of the zzso gene can be exploited to allow regulated expression of other genes cloned in zzso
