zzso fetal B cells zzso rearrange a restricted subset of the zzso zzso gene zzso There are striking structural similarities between elements expressed early in man and in zzso most evident on comparison of zzso zzso elements from the zzso family to human zzso elements of the zzso zzso The similarity is pronounced in two framework regions which together zzso a possible binding site that is distinct from the classical zzso zzso By comparing all known human and zzso zzso gene zzso we have demonstrated that these regions have been zzso in a zzso manner throughout the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso recognition signal is also highly zzso in a zzso manner, suggesting a mechanism by which the expression of zzso features may be zzso The evidence that such features contribute to the high zzso of zzso and zzso in the fetal zzso repertoire is zzso
