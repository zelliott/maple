zzso and T cell zzso genes are assembled from gene segments by zzso zzso to produce an almost infinitely diverse repertoire of zzso zzso zzso is initiated by zzso of zzso zzso signal sequences zzso by zzso and zzso during zzso zzso Recent evidence demonstrates that zzso can occur at zzso zzso sites within zzso genes or at other zzso outside the context of normal zzso zzso gene zzso We have characterized the ability of the zzso proteins to bind and cleave a cryptic zzso zzso located within an zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso proteins bound with sequence specificity to either the consensus zzso or the zzso The zzso proteins zzso the zzso on both the top and bottom zzso thereby bypassing the formation of the DNA hairpin intermediate observed in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso We propose that the zzso proteins may zzso an alternative mechanism for zzso DNA zzso depending on the zzso zzso These results have implications for further diversification of the zzso zzso repertoire as well as the role of the zzso proteins in zzso zzso
