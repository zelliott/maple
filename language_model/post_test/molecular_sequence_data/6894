zzso zzso zzso is a stress protein induced up to zzso within a few hours after exposure to zzso stress, and it has been shown to counteract zzso injury induced by ultraviolet light or free zzso The current study was undertaken to determine whether the zzso gene can be introduced into adult rabbit zzso zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso 

Human zzso gene was used for zzso studies to differentiate zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso construct zzso zzso was mixed with zzso and zzso into the anterior chamber, zzso zzso and zzso space of New Zealand rabbit zzso After 2 weeks, total zzso was extracted from different zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction was performed using specific human zzso zzso and amplification products were subjected to Southern zzso 

zzso with the zzso construct into rabbit zzso zzso cells in culture resulted in a functional expression of the human zzso zzso the human zzso zzso was zzso and zzso activity increased zzso Human zzso zzso was detected in the zzso after zzso of the zzso construct into the zzso zzso zzso into the zzso resulted in zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso after zzso injection of the zzso zzso human zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso and zzso zzso body, zzso and zzso Regardless of the injection site, zzso human zzso zzso was zzso in zzso outside the eye, that is, brain, liver, and zzso 

These results demonstrated a zzso functional transfer of the human zzso gene into rabbit zzso zzso in zzso This technique may be a promising means for delivering zzso gene in zzso as a protective mechanism against zzso stress that contributes to the zzso of zzso diseases such as zzso zzso injury, age-related zzso zzso and diabetic zzso
