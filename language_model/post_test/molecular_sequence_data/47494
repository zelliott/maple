zzso of mouse major zzso complex zzso class I molecules in different cell lines derived from Syrian zzso has revealed zzso presentation deficiencies of some zzso zzso products in two cell lines zzso and zzso which were overcome by transient expression of the rat zzso associated with zzso processing zzso zzso et zzso zzso Here we show that in both cell lines the zzso zzso class I cell surface expression was completely zzso zzso treatment induced zzso and zzso mouse zzso class I cell surface expression to levels similar to that in other Syrian zzso cell lines competent for zzso presentation through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of expression of accessory molecules of the zzso class I zzso can reveal differences between zzso class I zzso in zzso presentation not encountered when the expression levels are zzso In addition to the differential expression of zzso class I zzso zzso two cell lines representing competent zzso and defective zzso zzso presentation zzso for mouse class I zzso restriction elements demonstrated substantial sequence zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso cells and human zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso or zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso differed in their preference for zzso zzso zzso as shown by an in zzso zzso transport zzso Thus, zzso zzso in zzso can influence the zzso selectivity of the Syrian zzso zzso zzso
