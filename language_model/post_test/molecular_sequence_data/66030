The clinical importance of zzso zzso a ubiquitous member of the normal human zzso of the skin and zzso zzso for zzso surface infections has been recognized zzso We performed an zzso zzso test with zzso strips for three zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso analysis on 21 zzso of zzso from zzso zzso Of these, 16 zzso were identified as zzso zzso at the species level on the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The remaining five zzso were determined to be zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Eleven of the zzso zzso zzso showed high levels of resistance to all of the zzso tested, and one isolate was resistant to zzso zzso An analysis of the amplified zzso regions of the zzso genes revealed that a single zzso acid substitution in position 83 of the zzso product was sufficient to generate the zzso resistance zzso and double zzso leading to zzso acid changes in positions 83 and 87 were necessary for high-level resistance against the other zzso We conducted the first example of zzso sequence typing zzso analysis on zzso zzso The zzso analysis grouped the majority of zzso zzso zzso into a single zzso and another molecular strain typing by random amplified zzso DNA zzso patterns supported the finding, indicating that a particular lineage of zzso zzso is dominant on the human zzso zzso This type of population might be particularly adaptable to the milieu on the human zzso zzso
