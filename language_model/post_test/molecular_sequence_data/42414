We developed and characterized zzso specific for zzso and used them to locate zzso during chick zzso zzso A series of zzso demonstrated the progression of zzso zzso during development of the different zzso and zzso zzso was present in the zzso covering the entire zzso muscle cells, nervous system, neural crest cells, and zzso zzso was also present in the limb from initiation of budding through zzso The limb zzso and zzso zzso showed the strongest zzso with lower levels in the center of the zzso However, the distribution of zzso positive cells in the zzso was not zzso This zzso was not due to cell cycle specific distribution of zzso zzso as flow zzso analysis showed that zzso cells were distributed throughout the cell zzso However, the amount of zzso zzso varied most during zzso consistent with the possibility that zzso is low after M phase and increases during zzso A zzso was used to demonstrate zzso levels in the wing zzso were approximately zzso greater than in the zzso We propose that the location of zzso in the zzso is consistent with a role in zzso zzso in the limb bud it may prevent differentiation and permit limb outgrowth and subsequent expression of patterning zzso
