zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso found near zzso zzso vents and its optimal growth temperature of 100 degrees zzso Recently, a zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso zzso zzso revealed that this protein zzso as spheres of approximately 30 zzso in diameter, which we designated zzso zzso zzso particles zzso X-ray zzso analysis at zzso resolution revealed that each zzso consisted of 180 copies of the zzso protein and retained zzso zzso zzso as is often the case in zzso zzso The total molecular mass of each particle was approximately 7 zzso An examination of zzso structures suggested strong evolutionary links among zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso The similar three-dimensional structures of the various coat proteins indicate that these viral zzso might have originated and evolved from a common zzso The structure of zzso provides a previously zzso example of viral relationships across the three zzso of life zzso zzso and zzso
