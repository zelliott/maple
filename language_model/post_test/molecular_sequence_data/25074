The present study describes the first isolation and characterization of a zzso protein and gene for zzso zzso zzso the zzso that zzso the terminal step in zzso zzso For gene isolation, a zzso DNA zzso containing an open reading frame with about zzso zzso acid identity to zzso zzso was amplified from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, expression of the putative gene in zzso coli demonstrated that it zzso an zzso zzso The expressed protein zzso with zzso against the native form of zzso zzso and its zzso properties were identical to those of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Comparisons of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso revealed important differences in the zzso region, molecular mass, zzso composition and zzso Nevertheless, two zzso zzso including four zzso zzso zzso similar to those found in members of the zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso deduced zzso acid zzso
