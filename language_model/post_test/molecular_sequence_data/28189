zzso deposits, which are a common feature of Type II diabetes zzso are derived from the zzso of a putative hormone identified as zzso zzso is zzso by normal zzso beta cells and probably is zzso with zzso Although the zzso function of zzso and its role in the zzso of Type II diabetes zzso are just beginning to be zzso zzso may play an important part in the development of this most common form of diabetes zzso by opposing the action of insulin in peripheral zzso The zzso of zzso to form zzso zzso deposits may further contribute to the development of Type II diabetes zzso by destroying zzso cells and by zzso the passage of zzso and hormones to and from zzso zzso evidence indicates that the propensity of zzso to zzso and form zzso zzso deposits in only certain species zzso humans, zzso and zzso is directly associated with an zzso zzso part of the zzso positions 20 through 29 of zzso The inherent zzso of zzso in these species may be further facilitated by increased zzso production of zzso leading to a high local concentration that zzso to zzso The latter possibility is supported by studies demonstrating that zzso production by zzso beta cells is increased in zzso cats with impaired zzso zzso Although increased production of zzso may initially cause insulin resistance, prolonged overproduction of zzso may ultimately impair insulin zzso by leading to the progressive deposition of zzso zzso zzso a finding apparent in most subjects with overt zzso If, as these studies suggest, increased zzso production is linked to the development of Type II diabetes zzso further studies must address the genetic and zzso factors that influence this important zzso change in humans and some animal zzso
