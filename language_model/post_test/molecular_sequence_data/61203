The zzso zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted by zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid protein that is zzso identical to the zzso domain of zzso zzso that act on zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a larger zzso zzso acid protein that is extended at its zzso to include a single zzso zzso zzso and that zzso occupies the second position in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ten different zzso zzso sequences were found attached to zzso zzso including zzso zzso and eight zzso leaders that include two new zzso zzso of zzso derived from all six genes confirmed the essential features of zzso zzso zzso distances in the range of zzso zzso between the upstream zzso sites and the downstream trans zzso zzso zzso or zzso leaders, attached to the downstream zzso zzso zzso fragments revealed a zzso region zzso zzso zzso The zzso is removed in mature zzso from the first gene zzso and replaced primarily by zzso and to a lesser extent by zzso Our study provides new information regarding zzso and how they are zzso
