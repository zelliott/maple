We have developed zzso zzso zzso that are suitable for zzso labeling of zzso II zzso receptors and the subsequent zzso of zzso complexes through immobilized zzso or zzso One of these zzso zzso which contains a zzso zzso bridge in its zzso arm and which displays, in its zzso form, very high affinity for zzso receptors zzso approximately 1 zzso proved to be suitable for indirect affinity zzso of rat liver zzso with facilitated recovery from zzso gels by use of reducing zzso This constituted the central step of an efficient partial zzso scheme involving zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso established the identity of the zzso entity zzso weight zzso as the zzso zzso zzso ways of completing zzso to zzso and zzso of the protocols to a zzso scale are discussed, as well as the potential contribution of our new zzso to the study of the structural properties of zzso zzso
