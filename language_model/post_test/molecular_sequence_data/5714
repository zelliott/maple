Human zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso and type 2 zzso are responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso They zzso a zzso zzso that is required for viral zzso and represent a viable target for therapeutic zzso Here, we report the crystal structures of zzso and zzso zzso the latter in the presence and absence of the zzso bound transition state analog inhibitor zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso structures show a fold that is neither like zzso nor like zzso and has been seen only in the recently determined zzso zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso share high sequence zzso and have almost identical three-dimensional zzso However, structural differences are observed with the less zzso zzso zzso offering a structural basis for zzso virus zzso zzso zzso The bound inhibitor identifies the zzso hole of these zzso and defines the active site zzso
