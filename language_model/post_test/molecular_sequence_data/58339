Based on single zzso zzso previous studies suggested that zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso interact directly with many zzso antagonists, including zzso To further test this model, all three zzso have been zzso simultaneously with zzso The zzso triple zzso bound zzso and eight zzso with similar affinity zzso zzso even though the same series of compounds bound to the zzso zzso with affinities over a range of zzso These observations zzso exactly to the prediction of the binding site zzso The zzso binding affinity of all tested zzso zzso for the triple zzso seems to reflect solely van der zzso zzso which suggests a significant contribution of zzso zzso (or shape zzso to binding zzso The primary role of zzso zzso in zzso binding was consistent with the observation that simply transferring the zzso involved in polar interactions with zzso into the zzso zzso did not lead to increased binding affinity for the zzso Taken together, these results support a general principle of zzso binding in which specific polar interactions can take place only if the overall zzso zzso is compatible with the zzso of the binding zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso can provide an alternative route to reveal multiple interactions that may not be zzso by zzso zzso and represent a novel approach to examine zzso interactions in the absence of high-resolution structural zzso
