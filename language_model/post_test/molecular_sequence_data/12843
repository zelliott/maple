The differential display technique was used to identify zzso zzso expressed in human melanoma cell lines with different zzso zzso We report the isolation of nine different zzso of which four were uniquely expressed in the highly zzso human melanoma cell line zzso whereas the other five clones were uniquely expressed in the poorly zzso human melanoma cell line zzso The differences in expression identified by differential zzso display were confirmed by Northern zzso zzso DNA sequencing followed by computer search analyses indicated that of the nine zzso expressed zzso five represented novel gene zzso The other four were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso activity zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso was also identified in zzso from human melanoma zzso zzso in a comparison by differential display with pooled human zzso Northern zzso analysis confirmed zzso zzso expression in zzso melanoma cell lines and in melanoma zzso zzso while expression was absent in highly zzso cell lines and zzso zzso In the 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was apparently zzso correlated with zzso
