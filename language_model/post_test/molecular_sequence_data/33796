zzso cells in zzso zzso provide a paradigm for the stem cell mode of division, with the ability to both zzso and produce daughters that zzso The zzso factor zzso and its DNA binding partner zzso zzso of the zzso zzso stem cell regulators zzso and zzso zzso are known zzso regulators of zzso cell zzso Here, we show, using a combination of comparative zzso and DNA binding zzso that zzso expression is directly regulated by the zzso factor zzso zzso animals display similar zzso cell lineage defects to zzso zzso but have an additional zzso in which zzso cells lose their stem zzso properties and differentiate inappropriately by fusing with the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso which we show is zzso by zzso in zzso zzso Overall, our data suggest that zzso has dual roles in the zzso zzso cells, acting both to promote proliferation and prevent zzso
