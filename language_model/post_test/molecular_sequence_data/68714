The occurrence of certain long-range correlations between zzso in DNA sequences of living organisms has recently been zzso The biological origin of these correlations was zzso The correlations were proposed to be concerned with zzso structure and differences between zzso and zzso zzso We and others have reported that no consistent difference exists between zzso and zzso zzso In agreement with this, we demonstrate here that the long-range correlations are zzso equivalent to the varying ratio R between zzso and zzso (or any other zzso zzso in different regions of a DNA zzso Moreover, we show that this variation of R has simple biological zzso zzso in base composition occur along most DNA sequences and are associated with zzso simple repeats zzso differences in zzso composition zzso to the zzso acid composition in the zzso zzso zzso change of the direction of zzso (and thus also zzso and zzso differences between zzso and zzso zzso Seven biological examples are zzso
