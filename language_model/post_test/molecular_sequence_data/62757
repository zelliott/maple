zzso is a zzso zzso that is widely used to prevent and clear zzso zzso malaria and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in target organisms by specifically binding to the zzso zzso site at center P of the zzso zzso zzso The failure of zzso treatment and mortality of patients with malaria and zzso zzso pneumonia has been linked to the appearance of zzso in the zzso b zzso To better understand the molecular basis of zzso resistance, we have introduced seven of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso into the zzso b gene of zzso zzso and thus obtained zzso zzso complexes resistant to zzso by zzso In these zzso the zzso for zzso increases from 25 zzso for the zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso for some of the zzso zzso Modeling of the changes in zzso b structure and zzso binding with the zzso zzso complexes provides the first quantitative explanation for the molecular basis of zzso zzso
