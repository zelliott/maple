Factor zzso zzso zzso of complement proteins zzso zzso and factor I participate in zzso interactions critical to the progress of a zzso immune response to infections and other zzso For instance, the zzso zzso pair of zzso zzso binds to the zzso domain of zzso and its activated product, zzso during zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso share sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso of known three-dimensional structure, suggesting that zzso structures could be reliably zzso However, conflicting zzso zzso inconsistent zzso of zzso within zzso and the presence of binding partners in all zzso structures led us to determine the three-dimensional structure of zzso by zzso zzso The solution structure reveals that each zzso within zzso contains a small zzso zzso zzso connected to a larger zzso zzso zzso The open arrangement of the zzso within zzso resembles that of first zzso within structures of tandem zzso but differs from the more compact zzso arrangement of second or third zzso zzso the two zzso pack closely together with an approximate zzso zzso symmetry that is rarely seen in module pairs and has not been observed in zzso zzso zzso between zzso and between zzso include numerous zzso and zzso contributions, suggesting that this is a zzso relevant zzso that persists in the context of the parent zzso Similar zzso were predicted in a zzso model of the zzso zzso The zzso structures also facilitated construction of a model of the single zzso of factor zzso
