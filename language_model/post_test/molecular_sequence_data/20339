An open reading frame representing zzso from a zzso zzso zzso gene of a low zzso avian influenza virus zzso zzso zzso was cloned in the zzso zzso under the control of zzso response zzso This construct was designated as zzso The zzso construct was transformed into zzso zzso for expression of zzso zzso The correct expression of zzso zzso protein was confirmed by zzso gel zzso zzso and Western zzso The level of expression of zzso zzso protein was approximately zzso of total soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein showed zzso zzso The zzso and 3-D scanning images of zzso zzso protein were observed with an atomic force microscope zzso The structural integrity of the zzso protein under zzso and zzso activity provided support that the zzso zzso protein may be suitable for development of zzso zzso vaccine for mass administration to zzso
