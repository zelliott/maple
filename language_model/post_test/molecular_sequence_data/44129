The zzso gene of zzso coli encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is zzso zzso by the global zzso regulator, zzso zzso binds at two sites zzso at zzso and zzso in the zzso promoter but the mechanism of zzso repression appears not to be due to promoter zzso This mechanism has been investigated using an zzso active zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso promoters containing altered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso I zzso with zzso zzso protein confirmed that zzso interacts at two sites in the zzso promoter, and that zzso and zzso zzso zzso can bind zzso Studies with three altered zzso zzso each containing an impaired or improved zzso indicated that both zzso are needed for efficient repression in zzso The zzso of zzso zzso with two regions zzso at zzso and zzso each overlapping one of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex indicated that zzso at zzso prevents the zzso of zzso from zzso with the DNA just upstream of the zzso zzso zzso of a second zzso zzso at the zzso site likewise prevents binding of the zzso at its alternative site, thus providing a plausible mechanism for zzso repression based on displacement of the zzso of zzso
