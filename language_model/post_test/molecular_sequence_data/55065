The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was separated by three different zzso strategies to facilitate subsequent analysis of zzso zzso components by tandem mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso degradation and zzso acid analysis: zzso zzso of the crude zzso by zzso only, zzso zzso separation of the crude zzso into 42 zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the crude zzso by size exclusion and zzso exchange zzso and zzso A total of zzso components were identified in the zzso of zzso by mass zzso and the sequence of 49 new peptides was determined de zzso by zzso degradation and tandem mass zzso 30 were zzso zzso The novel peptides were assigned to two main groups: zzso short zzso peptides and zzso zzso peptides with the inhibitor zzso knot zzso zzso revealed a limited number of substantial similarities, namely with the peptides zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso from the South American fishing zzso zzso zzso and with sequences from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results clearly indicate that the quality of the data is strongly dependent on the chosen separation zzso The combination of zzso zzso methods efficiently excludes zzso zzso and zzso zzso provides indispensable information for an zzso identification of zzso and results in the most comprehensive repertoire of peptides identified in the zzso of zzso so zzso
