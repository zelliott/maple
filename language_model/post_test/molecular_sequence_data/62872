In a zzso zzso screen, zzso finger protein 1 zzso and zzso were identified as potential binding partners of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso with a high degree of identity to zzso zzso zzso The interaction of zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso interaction trap experiments mapped the region of interaction to the basic zzso 313 zzso of zzso The zzso zzso extension of zzso was not required for the interaction with zzso Western zzso analysis and indirect zzso zzso show that zzso is present in zzso larvae, and adults, where it is found in zzso nerve ring, zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso interference experiments against zzso indicate that this gene is required for zzso development, zzso development, and for egg zzso By contrast, zzso interference against zzso gave no obvious zzso suggesting that zzso is zzso or is functionally zzso
