The role and regulation of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso is not fully zzso We cloned and determined the sequence of zzso zzso of the pig zzso gene that includes zzso zzso of the zzso promoter zzso The zzso zzso promoter sequence shares two highly zzso regions with the human and bovine zzso promoters and a mouse DNA zzso The first is a 38 zzso region between zzso and zzso whereas the second is a zzso region between zzso and zzso of the pig zzso Projected translation of the open reading frame of our sequence gave a zzso sequence identical to that determined by zzso sequencing, but with 27 additional zzso acids upstream of this sequence and is highly similar to the human, zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso Using zzso we demonstrated that zzso regulates zzso zzso expression in a zzso manner, with an early induction zzso at 3 zzso and an zzso at 24 h after zzso zzso The zzso at 24 h was not due to changes in zzso zzso zzso A similar pattern of zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso was demonstrated by the reporter activity of zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso promoter zzso The site for zzso stimulation of the zzso gene was localized to the sequence between zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso suggests a role for zzso in zzso development that may be independent of zzso
