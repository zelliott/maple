zzso of administered drugs is determined by expression and activity of many zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso X zzso zzso is a master zzso regulator of many zzso zzso including zzso and drug zzso In this study, we describe the functional analysis of four naturally occurring human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that we have recently zzso By a reporter gene zzso using the zzso zzso reporter in zzso or zzso cells, it was found that the zzso zzso failed to zzso the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso also showed varying degrees of reduction in zzso depending on the dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso activities of the zzso zzso were not significantly different from that of the zzso zzso The zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that only the zzso zzso lacked DNA zzso Furthermore, the cellular zzso of the zzso proteins was zzso All four zzso as well as the zzso zzso localized exclusively to the nucleus, regardless of the presence or absence of zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso especially zzso may influence the expression of zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso by zzso
