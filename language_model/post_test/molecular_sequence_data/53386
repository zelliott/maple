The nuclear import of proteins into the cell nucleus involves the recognition of a nuclear zzso signal zzso borne by the protein to be zzso by complex molecules called zzso that will subsequently mediate the crossing over of the nuclear zzso The most frequently encountered signal sequence is made up of short stretches of basic zzso acid zzso and is recognized by zzso alpha and/or zzso Other signal sequences have been zzso and some have been shown to mediate the association with zzso other than zzso alpha or zzso Recently, approaches have been developed that allow the zzso on a functional basis, of sequences able to specify the nuclear zzso of zzso A variety of zzso motifs of limited size which do not contain previously described signal sequences were isolated in such zzso It reveals that the spectrum of sequences that are able to target a protein to the cell nucleus may be wider than currently zzso It will probably also lead to the identification of novel target sequences for zzso and will demonstrate the implication of additional members of this family of proteins in nuclear zzso
