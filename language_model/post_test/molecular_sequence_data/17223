Human zzso is a small highly zzso zzso protein expressed on most zzso It was recently found to be expressed at zzso cell contacts and to participate in the zzso migration zzso of zzso in zzso In order to analyze the zzso relevance of zzso in zzso we searched for the mouse zzso We cloned a mouse zzso coding for a protein zzso identical in its sequence with human zzso Based on the zzso we generated zzso against this mouse zzso of zzso which detected the zzso on most zzso on zzso of various zzso and at cell contacts of cultured zzso zzso Cell zzso of zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells was completely blocked by zzso zzso The same zzso inhibited zzso of zzso in zzso independent of whether T cells or zzso cells were zzso with zzso In a zzso zzso hypersensitivity zzso reaction, zzso zzso inhibited the recruitment of in zzso T cells into inflamed skin as well as zzso zzso We conclude that mouse zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and in their recruitment to inflamed skin in zzso This establishes zzso as a valid target for interference with zzso inflammatory zzso
