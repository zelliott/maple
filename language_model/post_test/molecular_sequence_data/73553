zzso a zzso zzso from rat zzso is thought to regulate water and zzso balance in the zzso We show here, using a combination of Northern zzso Western zzso and functional zzso that zzso and its zzso zzso are not distributed in parallel within the rat zzso To investigate the possibility that there might be a second zzso zzso that serves as a zzso for zzso we zzso tissue extracts for the ability to stimulate zzso zzso synthesis in a zzso cell zzso zzso extracts display a peak of biological activity that is not present in colon and that does not zzso with zzso or zzso The activity zzso with a novel zzso zzso that has high zzso with zzso a zzso initially zzso from human and zzso zzso A rat zzso zzso clone was found to zzso a zzso whose zzso zzso to our zzso zzso Northern blots with zzso generated from this clone reveal that zzso zzso is strongly expressed in zzso small zzso but virtually absent from zzso corroborating our zzso zzso Taken together, these studies demonstrate an zzso origin for zzso and show that within the zzso its distribution is complementary to that of zzso
