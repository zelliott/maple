The complete zzso sequence of a pepper zzso virus isolate from California zzso zzso has been determined from cloned viral zzso The zzso C zzso zzso is zzso zzso excluding the zzso tail and contains a long open reading frame starting at zzso zzso and potentially zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso C zzso zzso with those of other zzso members of the zzso group, including tobacco etch virus zzso tobacco vein zzso virus zzso plum pox virus zzso and potato virus Y zzso allowed zzso of putative protein zzso zzso A similar analysis was used to determine the position of zzso viral zzso regions along the viral zzso zzso These analyses confirm previous work indicating that zzso organization is zzso among members of the zzso zzso The zzso of one zzso C gene product, the nuclear inclusion body protein a zzso zzso was analyzed by expressing zzso zzso deletion clones in bacteria and zzso for appearance of zzso coat zzso a zzso product of the zzso zzso Comparative sequence analyses of the putative zzso zzso with those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso served to identify regions of the zzso zzso which have zzso within the zzso as well as highly zzso protein features which may play an important functional role in the zzso life zzso
