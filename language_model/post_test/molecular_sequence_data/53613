Polar zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are likely to act individually and even zzso in recognizing cocaine and zzso We initially evaluated the effects of zzso substitution zzso that remove the polar side chains from zzso in each of the 12 putative zzso zzso on the recognition of zzso and the cocaine analog zzso Eleven combination zzso with multiple zzso in zzso zzso 4, 5, 7, or 11 were then selected as candidates for more detailed evaluation based on zzso effects on zzso and cocaine analog zzso An evaluation of Gibbs free energy changes displayed by single and combined TM zzso zzso and zzso reveals three categories of potential interactions among zzso 1) independent, zzso interactions (five influenced zzso and two influenced zzso zzso 2) synergistic influences zzso for zzso and four for zzso and 3) zzso of influences on zzso recognition (four zzso or on zzso affinity zzso Combined zzso in zzso 4 and 5 yield the largest zzso values for zzso zzso zzso 4 and 11 zzso provide the largest zzso for zzso zzso zzso between zzso lying in zzso zzso 4 and 5 support current zzso structural models that suggest the juxtaposition of these two zzso These data also support contributions of TM 4 and 11 zzso to a polar pocket important for cocaine zzso These candidate interactive zzso polar zzso provide larger target sites for compounds that could zzso specific zzso functions than those provided by single zzso zzso
