zzso virus nuclear zzso 2 zzso a protein involved in cell zzso interferes with the cellular response to type I zzso zzso We investigated the function of zzso expressed zzso in the context of the zzso response in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso led to the zzso zzso of both zzso or zzso zzso genes zzso genes which contain within their promoters either the zzso response element zzso or the gamma zzso zzso site zzso In search of a molecular mechanism for the zzso induction of zzso we observed an zzso synthesis of zzso zzso at low levels and the zzso of low amounts of zzso A zzso zzso promoter responded to zzso zzso and a sequence closely resembling a zzso binding site was zzso as a potential target of zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of the zzso promoter occurred in zzso zzso zzso cells, indicating that other zzso genes were not required for the induction of zzso zzso
