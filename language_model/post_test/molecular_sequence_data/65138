zzso in the zzso domain of serum zzso protein zzso interfere with the ability of the protein to initiate complement fixation through the zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso in the innate immune response leads to zzso to zzso Studies have been undertaken to define the region of zzso that interacts with zzso and to determine how the naturally occurring zzso affect this zzso zzso and modified zzso and synthetic peptides that represent segments of the zzso domain of zzso have been used to demonstrate that zzso bind on the zzso side of the hinge region formed by an interruption in the zzso repeat pattern of the zzso zzso The binding sites for zzso and for zzso and zzso overlap but are not zzso The two most common naturally occurring zzso in zzso result in substitution of zzso zzso acids for zzso zzso in zzso triplets on the zzso side of the zzso zzso zzso analysis and differential scanning zzso demonstrate that the triple zzso structure of the zzso domain is largely intact in the zzso zzso but it is more easily unfolded than in zzso zzso Thus, the effect of the zzso is to destabilize the zzso domain, indirectly zzso the binding sites for zzso In addition, at least one of the zzso has a further effect on the ability of zzso to activate zzso
