zzso organization, and molecular analysis of four unrelated satellite DNA components in zzso species are zzso zzso repeated DNA elements were cloned from zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso The lengths of the repeat zzso are 365 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similar repeats were detected by dot zzso Southern zzso and by DNA sequencing in other species of the zzso zzso in zzso species, and in species of the tribes zzso and zzso All four satellite zzso are differently distributed in the zzso groups mentioned zzso zzso the longer elements are built up in a complex pattern of either shorter zzso arranged in tandem zzso or by zzso inserted into an original zzso element zzso zzso representatives, 190 zzso similar to zzso elements occur in zzso zzso In zzso species, zzso repeats are only 180 zzso in zzso No similarity was found among the sequences zzso zzso and zzso or with sequences of other repetitive DNA elements of the zzso but zzso shows sequence similarity to an A zzso specific repetitive DNA of zzso zzso
