zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso consists of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso interacts directly with both zzso and zzso The binding site for zzso is contained in the zzso third of zzso while the binding site for zzso was mapped to the zzso third of the zzso Here we show that human zzso possesses two separate zzso binding zzso in the middle third zzso acids zzso zzso to zzso and zzso third zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso The zzso acid sequence of the middle portion of zzso is well zzso between zzso and zzso We show that zzso of zzso zzso acid stretches in the middle domain abolish or reduce zzso binding as well as zzso zzso In addition, a separate and zzso zzso binding domain exists in the zzso third zzso zzso to zzso of zzso which is not present in zzso The zzso two-thirds region zzso zzso to zzso of zzso containing both zzso binding sites, is required for stimulating zzso Neither one of the zzso binding zzso alone activates zzso In contrast to zzso human zzso a translation inhibitor with zzso to zzso binds zzso only through the zzso zzso region, which is zzso to the middle domain of zzso
