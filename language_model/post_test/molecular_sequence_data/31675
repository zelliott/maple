zzso protein has been proposed as a zzso secondary zzso The protein is involved in the transport of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids into the zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso is found in a variety of bacteria, though the zzso role of the protein is zzso zzso In this work, we carried out a functional and structural analysis to determine which zzso acids are critical for the transport properties of zzso We created a set of 15 zzso zzso zzso in which single zzso zzso acids were replaced by zzso zzso Our work demonstrated that strains carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had a zzso zzso for zzso transport zzso In contrast, strains carrying the single point zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed transport capacities indistinguishable from those of strains harboring a zzso zzso The strain carrying the zzso zzso exhibited mixed zzso zzso We also demonstrated that those zzso zzso with severely impaired transport capacity showed a dominant negative zzso zzso zzso data and in zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso modeling support the idea that zzso forms a zzso complex, closely resembling the zzso region of the zzso cassette zzso zzso zzso mapping of the zzso single point zzso on the protein surface allowed us to explain the observed zzso differences in transport zzso
