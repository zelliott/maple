Total chemical synthesis was used to prepare the mirror image zzso form of the zzso protein vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso display against zzso was used to screen designed libraries based on a unique small protein scaffold in order to identify a high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso forms of the protein zzso showed zzso zzso specificity in surface zzso resonance binding zzso The zzso zzso bound only to zzso whereas the zzso zzso bound only to zzso The zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso inhibited the binding of natural zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was used to determine the high resolution X-ray structure of the zzso complex consisting of zzso zzso + zzso form of zzso zzso of a zzso mixture of these synthetic proteins in appropriate zzso gave a zzso protein complex of more than 73 zzso containing six synthetic protein zzso The structure of the complex was determined to a resolution of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the interaction between the zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso showed that the binding interface comprised a contact surface area of approximately 800 zzso in zzso with our design zzso and that the zzso zzso binds to the same region of zzso that interacts with zzso zzso
