zzso zzso zzso express on their surfaces one of a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso surface zzso which comprise the majority of proteins detected by surface zzso While these zzso proteins may be zzso proteins important in the host immune response to zzso zzso the ability to switch expression from one zzso to another may provide a means for the zzso to avoid the host immune zzso The first zzso zzso zzso (from the A6 clone of the zzso zzso originally termed zzso contains zzso copies of a 65 zzso acid zzso We have now used the repeat as a probe to isolate from a zzso zzso library two genes related to zzso (called zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene revealed nearly two complete copies of the 195 zzso repeat and substantial zzso and translated zzso acid similarity in the coding regions zzso and 3' to the zzso The zzso zzso while still zzso showed greater divergence from zzso than zzso in the zzso coding region and contained nearly four copies of a 201 zzso repeat that was zzso identical to the 195 zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that gene zzso followed by divergence has played a key role in the generation of the zzso gene zzso
