Recent progress has begun to define the interactions and signaling pathways that are triggered during positive zzso To identify and further examine zzso that can mediate positive selection, we searched a zzso to find peptides that have minimal zzso with the viral zzso zzso that activates a defined zzso transgenic zzso We identified four peptides that could bind the restriction element zzso and induce proliferation of zzso transgenic zzso at high zzso Two of the four peptides zzso and zzso were able to positively select the zzso zzso in fetal zzso organ culture but were unable to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso demonstrated that these peptides were presented by zzso molecules on zzso zzso cell zzso We also examined whether the selecting zzso altered T cell responsiveness in zzso zzso T cells lost their ability to respond to the positively selecting zzso zzso whereas zzso T cells only retained their ability to respond to high zzso of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso that mediate positive selection can zzso zzso the zzso threshold of T cells and alter the functional repertoire of T zzso
