E6 zzso from human zzso type 16 zzso and zzso zzso type 1 zzso bind to zzso rich peptides (called charged zzso zzso or signature zzso found on target cellular zzso zzso and zzso both bind the product of the zzso gene called zzso on a charged zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that together with zzso interacts with zzso to target zzso zzso Although both zzso and zzso bind the zzso zzso of zzso only zzso acts as an adapter to then bring zzso to zzso In order to determine how E6 proteins function as zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso and were shown to form a zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected that retained interactions with zzso yet were defective for interaction with zzso Such zzso zzso were typically within the zzso of zzso Through the use of zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso was shown to be necessary and sufficient for the degradation of zzso in the presence of zzso However, the interaction of zzso with zzso was zzso While zzso interacts only with the zzso motif of zzso an intact zzso motif is not necessary either for interaction of zzso with zzso or for zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso that fail to bind the zzso motif of zzso can support zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso may have multiple modes of interaction with zzso and that assembly of zzso containing complexes for targeted degradation by zzso may occur in more than one zzso These results have implications for potential targeting of the interaction of zzso and zzso in the therapy of zzso zzso
