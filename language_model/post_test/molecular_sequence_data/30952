The zzso zzso is rearranged at its 3' end in the human zzso leukemia line zzso 78 as a result of a zzso between the long arms of zzso 8 and zzso The zzso sequence at the zzso shows that the rearranged zzso of zzso is truncated 24 zzso before the first zzso zzso The 3' truncated zzso lacks a 61 zzso zzso sequence that has been reported to mediate selective zzso zzso We show that the zzso results in prolonged stability of zzso zzso the half life of the zzso zzso in zzso 78, as well as in zzso zzso cells zzso with the truncated zzso of zzso is increased by at least zzso Our results document yet another mechanism by which zzso may be rendered zzso and zzso the importance of zzso stability in the regulation of zzso zzso
