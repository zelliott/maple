The zzso zzso zzso contains two tandem zzso zzso and zzso which zzso two zzso of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso The sequences of zzso and zzso are highly similar to each other and to that of zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Drug resistance profiling and drug binding experiments showed that the presence of both zzso and zzso is required for proper transport zzso zzso and zzso directly interact and combine to form a functional zzso They likely form a zzso in zzso to the zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that the zzso zzso zzso in the first zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso zzso However, the two zzso are zzso since zzso zzso is required for zzso binding while zzso zzso is zzso Our studies support a model in which functional zzso in zzso are relegated to at least two sets that participate in distinct steps of the active drug transport zzso
