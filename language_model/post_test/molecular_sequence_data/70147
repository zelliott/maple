Two forms of zzso zzso were zzso from spinach zzso The major zzso form accounts for 85 to zzso of the total leaf activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis units zzso gram fresh zzso Both zzso forms appear to be zzso composed of zzso to zzso zzso with the minor zzso form being slightly larger than the zzso zzso The specific activities zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso form at pH zzso 30 degrees C, were as zzso zzso zzso 16; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso reaction were as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 10 zzso where A zzso zzso B zzso zzso P zzso total zzso at 5 zzso zzso and Q zzso zzso The kinetic zzso for zzso were similar to those of the zzso synthesis zzso The kinetic zzso of the minor zzso form were similar to those of the major form with two zzso zzso The zzso activity was 120 units zzso zzso zzso yielding a zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio close to 2 zzso to about unity for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso was greater zzso and zzso zzso for zzso synthesis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso over an extended range of zzso and zzso zzso product zzso studies (by initial zzso methods and by reaction progress curve zzso dead end zzso studies (with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso comparisons (for zzso and zzso support a random zzso zzso kinetic mechanism in which zzso and zzso bind in a highly synergistic zzso zzso binding studies indicated the presence of one zzso site per zzso zzso zzso profiles of zzso and zzso peptides were essentially the same for both zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was identical to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
