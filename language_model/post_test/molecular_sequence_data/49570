Until now, only a small amount of information is available about tomato zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso of tomato zzso zzso zzso e 2, was zzso from tomato extract by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso of two different zzso of the zzso zzso e zzso and zzso e zzso was cloned into the bacterial expression zzso zzso The zzso proteins were zzso by zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of both the zzso and the natural proteins was investigated with zzso of patients with adverse reactions to zzso zzso to natural zzso e 2 was completely inhibited by the pineapple stem zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso did not bind zzso of tomato allergic zzso zzso we concluded that the zzso zzso of the natural protein mainly depends on the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of both zzso of the zzso contain four possible zzso zzso By application of zzso mass zzso the zzso zzso structure of the natural zzso was identified as zzso zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso zzso Natural zzso e 2, but not the zzso protein was able to trigger zzso release from passively zzso zzso of patients with zzso to zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso structures can be important for the biological activity of zzso
