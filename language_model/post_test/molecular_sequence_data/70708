The zzso zzso zzso zzso signals primarily through the zzso G protein zzso thereby decreasing zzso zzso zzso To study the signal zzso properties of the rabbit zzso zzso five zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the novel zzso zzso zzso which lacks the zzso zzso The ability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso expression of a zzso reporter gene under the control of a promoter containing zzso response elements zzso was zzso Each zzso zzso induced zzso increase in zzso zzso activity with zzso ranging from zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso with Ala, or zzso with Ala or zzso in the zzso zzso zzso resulted in a loss of zzso increases in zzso activity, whereas substitution of zzso with zzso had no effect on signal zzso These zzso correlate with the zzso of zzso generation by direct zzso zzso Signal zzso was insensitive to zzso of cells with zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso zzso is activated by the zzso zzso zzso measurement of second zzso levels confirmed that there was no increase in zzso levels zzso by the zzso zzso zzso however, there was a modest increase in zzso zzso zzso blockade of the reporter activity with zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso zzso is zzso in part by a zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso signals through a novel zzso response element binding zzso zzso
