The sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso protein zzso zzso termed zzso is zzso The protein consists of two distinct zzso the zzso zzso domain is approximately zzso identical to either zzso or the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso while the zzso region is rich in zzso and zzso zzso of the gene zzso zzso reduces cell growth on several carbon sources, and lowers cell density in the stationary zzso zzso in which zzso gene has been deleted show altered zzso from zzso cells in the stationary phase in the absence of an essential zzso acid and a reduced rate of protein synthesis in the exponential zzso They are hypersensitive to the protein synthesis zzso zzso and zzso implicating zzso in the regulation of zzso
