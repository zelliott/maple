We examined the antiseptic zzso and distribution of zzso genes zzso and zzso in 98 zzso of zzso zzso zzso obtained in zzso Seventy-one strains were resistant to zzso The zzso and zzso genes were detected in 10 and 20 zzso zzso The remaining 41 strains without zzso and zzso were divided into two groups that exhibited low-level zzso zzso zzso and high-level zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso DNA cloning and sequencing suggested that zzso gene zzso was responsible for the high-level resistance to zzso Our results indicated that four or more zzso genes exist in zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso zzso strains without zzso and zzso are widely spread in zzso
