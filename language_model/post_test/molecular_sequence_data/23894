zzso zzso after mass zzso zzso can be zzso into liquid surfaces with preservation of their native zzso zzso of biological activity is strongly favored in zzso surfaces but not in zzso zzso solid zzso zzso efficiency for zzso zzso zzso was found to be some four times higher for a zzso liquid surface than for a fluorinated zzso zzso zzso zzso into liquid surfaces is also shown to allow zzso protein zzso zzso zzso identification of the zzso material using zzso and zzso protein identification by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was successfully isolated from different zzso including an zzso partially zzso batch of the protein and a partial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be used directly to record zzso zzso on the zzso compounds provided they were fortified in advance with traditional zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso Various proteins were zzso and detected zzso using these types of liquid zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso onto fluorinated zzso zzso surfaces was found to occur with a limited amount of zzso and trapped zzso zzso could be zzso from the surface by laser zzso zzso data is shown for a new approach to protein identification that combines zzso and bottom-up approaches by utilizing protein zzso zzso from a protein mixture, followed by zzso zzso of the landed material and detection of characteristic zzso fragments by zzso
