zzso of the zzso system play a key role in the maintenance of outer membrane integrity and cell zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso the seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso the proteins of this complex, are clustered in a zzso region of zzso zzso Analysis of polar zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso and zzso fusion zzso with a zzso zzso gene revealed that the genes are arranged in two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We were also able to find a transcript that was initiated at the zzso promoter and covered the two zzso in a single zzso On the basis of the zzso protein level, we zzso that this transcript contributed only about 10 to zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso extension analysis identified the zzso zzso zzso promoter within the zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso regions exhibited some similarity to those of zzso zzso The zzso start point of zzso was located 91 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso and the zzso region also exhibited zzso zzso recognition zzso The expression from both promoters in rich and minimal media was zzso and was very little influenced by the growth phase or zzso zzso In addition, analyses of the zzso activities of different zzso fusion zzso revealed that translation of zzso and zzso genes was dependent on the translation of their corresponding upstream genes zzso and zzso zzso
