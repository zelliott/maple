zzso zzso and zzso zzso are amongst the most important causes of outbreaks of zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso In this study, we report for the first time an outbreak of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso unit in zzso zzso zzso enteric zzso from zzso blood cultures were zzso zzso zzso was assessed by disc diffusion testing, and the presence of the zzso gene was established by zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso were typed by zzso gel zzso zzso Identification by zzso profiling was followed by zzso sequencing of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso Environmental sampling was done and control measures were zzso zzso were initially misidentified based on their zzso characteristics and zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso were resistant to multiple zzso except for zzso and zzso and were found to zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated the zzso outbreak of a single strain, infecting 17 zzso with a case fatality rate of zzso The same strain was isolated from a milk zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences permitted no definitive zzso zzso the strains in the zzso zzso complex with similarities of zzso The data describe an outbreak of a novel zzso zzso zzso strain in an African zzso unit that can easily be misidentified zzso These data highlight the need for constant surveillance of bacteria zzso zzso zzso as well as improvements in hygiene measures in developing zzso
