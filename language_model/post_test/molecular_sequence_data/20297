The presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its receptors zzso zzso and zzso was studied in the zzso zzso zzso gastrointestinal and respiratory zzso The expression and distribution of this zzso was investigated using zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that several zzso of this zzso zzso an zzso zzso for zzso Performing in zzso zzso and zzso we found a wide distribution of zzso and its zzso in zzso stomach, liver, and zzso zzso receptors possess a specific distribution in both gastrointestinal and respiratory zzso Further, we analyzed the conservation of zzso zzso acid sequence demonstrating that this zzso in the zzso is very similar to that of other zzso Our findings suggest that also in zzso an effective zzso system is present and that it could be implicated in some essential zzso functions as a result of its high conservation amongst zzso
