Although zzso II zzso zzso zzso activity in the human left cardiac zzso is minimally inhibited by zzso I zzso I) converting zzso zzso over zzso of this activity is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Stewart, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 66, zzso We now report the identification and characterization of the major zzso zzso neutral zzso zzso from left zzso zzso of the human zzso A zzso zzso from human cardiac zzso yielded a zzso protein with an Mr of 30,000 by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso Based upon its zzso zzso the major human cardiac zzso zzso zzso appears to be a novel member of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Human heart zzso was completely inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso soybean zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso It was partially inhibited by zzso zzso zzso but was not inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Also, human heart zzso was not inhibited by zzso of the other three classes of zzso Human heart zzso has a high specificity for the conversion of zzso I to zzso II and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 198 zzso zzso Human heart zzso did not degrade several zzso hormones, including zzso II, zzso and zzso zzso zzso nor did it form zzso II from zzso The high zzso specificity of human heart zzso for zzso I zzso it from other zzso zzso zzso including zzso I converting zzso zzso zzso zzso G, and other known zzso
