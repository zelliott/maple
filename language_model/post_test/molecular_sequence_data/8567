The utility of the zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso for detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was examined and compared with that of zzso zzso zzso pairs consisting of zzso zzso amplified zzso to zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso genes of these zzso This method had a lower detection limit of 50 target cells in a background of zzso zzso Its specificity for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso seemed zzso The zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with some closely related species but did not reveal amplification products in tests with more zzso related zzso The zzso for zzso zzso did not seem to zzso with oral zzso This zzso technique was sensitive, zzso and easy to zzso zzso amplification may prove valuable for the detection of some zzso pathogens in crude zzso zzso
