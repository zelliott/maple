The crystal structure of the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was solved in the presence of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the absence of zzso metals, this zzso bound 1 and 4 zzso zzso of zinc and zzso zzso The structure reveals a novel, zzso zzso zzso site and a second zzso zzso site that is found in the zzso zzso pocket within the active zzso The data resolve the apparent paradox between the zinc requirement for zzso activity and its strong zzso effect when added in zzso zzso They provide a rationale as to why this zzso in contrast to commercially available zzso does not require the addition of metal zzso for full zzso activity, suggesting it as an ideal target to maximize the efficiency of industrial processes like zzso of zzso
