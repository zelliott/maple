zzso a member of the zzso family of response regulators, activates zzso of the zzso coli zzso gene for the sugar zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso binds with different affinities to adjacent regions in the zzso promoter, termed the zzso zzso region from zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso region from zzso to zzso zzso zzso by zzso is zzso by the zzso gene zzso protein zzso zzso complex and depends on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso zzso in the zzso region had little effect on promoter activity, zzso zzso in successive zzso blocks throughout this region were examined for their effects on promoter zzso and zzso zzso Changes in three of four blocks within the W region substantially impaired the ability of zzso to bind to this region, to drive expression of a zzso reporter, and to support zzso in zzso zzso These W region zzso promoters were strongly zzso by zzso Changes in several parts of the S region impaired zzso binding to both the S and W regions and decreased promoter activity in zzso and in zzso Thus, binding of zzso to the W region is crucial for zzso zzso and depends on occupancy of the S zzso None of these zzso eliminated promoter zzso The orientation of zzso sites was assessed by the affinity zzso zzso The iron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso attached to engineered zzso zzso near the zzso region in zzso zzso zzso generated by the iron zzso attached at position zzso resulted in DNA strand zzso in two clusters of sites located in the middle of the S and W zzso These results are consistent with the binding of two zzso of zzso Each zzso binds to an zzso repeat of zzso sites with the consensus sequence zzso where R is A or G, and each is separated by 6 zzso It is likely that members of the zzso family bind to zzso targets, in contrast to the binding of zzso family response regulators to zzso zzso
