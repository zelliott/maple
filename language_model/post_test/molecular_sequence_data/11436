The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso has been zzso and zzso The coding sequence of the zzso is zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein of zzso zzso The gene was expressed under control of the zzso promoter in zzso The resulting expression zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso coli zzso alpha and zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells indicating the presence of active zzso and zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso In addition to the full-length zzso the zzso zzso contained 31 and zzso forms of the zzso that zzso with zzso major zzso zzso one was truncated at the zzso and C zzso and the other at only the C zzso Despite the presence of sufficient zzso for zzso zzso activity was not zzso in the crude extract or in the final zzso zzso zzso Although the majority of the zzso appears to be full zzso it is possible that the zzso domain has been zzso by one of more zzso which would zzso the ability to zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso yielded zzso and zzso values similar to those of related zzso The zzso zzso zzso has Ki values for zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are significantly lower than the closely related zzso zzso or zzso major zzso or than human zzso
