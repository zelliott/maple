zzso curves, CD zzso and zzso results of the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrate that the zzso transitions of these zzso at low salt concentration involve a hairpin zzso At high salt zzso zzso than zzso M zzso only a duplex to zzso transition appears to zzso The temperature and zzso regions of the transitions are very sequence zzso zzso AT sequences have a lower duplex stability and a greater tendency to form zzso than sequences containing more zzso AT base zzso Of the two zzso zzso zzso is significantly less stable than zzso Both zzso have CD zzso that are very similar to the unusual CD spectrum of zzso The zzso zzso of these two zzso are also quite similar, but at low temperature, small intensity differences in two backbone modes and three zzso zzso are zzso The hairpin to duplex transition for the AT zzso was examined by zzso zzso zzso The transition is faster than transitions for zzso zzso containing terminal zzso base zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that the transition is second order and has a relatively low zzso zzso The reaction rate increases with increasing zzso zzso These results are consistent with a three-step mechanism for the hairpin to duplex zzso zzso fraying of the hairpin zzso terminal base pairs, zzso a zzso zzso step involving formation of a zzso intermediate from two hairpin zzso with open terminal base pairs, and zzso zzso migration and formation in the intermediate to give the zzso
