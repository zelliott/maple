We earlier identified the zzso gene which encodes a putative zzso structurally related to zzso zzso zzso This finding was the result of a search for zzso the expression of which is induced by zzso in a zzso cell line, zzso In the current study, we zzso the expressed sequence tag database with the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso to search for partial zzso clones zzso to zzso We used one of the partial zzso clones to screen a mouse brain zzso library and identified a novel zzso mouse zzso zzso a protein consisting of 582 zzso acids and carrying zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of mouse zzso revealed zzso similarity to mouse zzso We also cloned a human zzso of this gene from a zzso library of the human T cell line, zzso zzso protein was found highly zzso between human and mouse (over zzso zzso thereby suggesting a fundamental role of this zzso across zzso On Northern zzso analysis of various mouse zzso zzso zzso was detected in brain, zzso kidney and skeletal muscle, but was scarce in zzso Level of expression of zzso zzso was enhanced by zzso in zzso cells, zzso cells, and zzso mouse zzso zzso In addition, we determined the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso genes in human and zzso The zzso gene was mapped to mouse zzso 15, region zzso and human zzso zzso while the zzso gene is located in mouse zzso 17, region zzso and human zzso zzso
