In the zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso envelope zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso that zzso the zzso incorporation into zzso and zzso fusion zzso zzso Conner, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Anderson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso envelope tail zzso zzso In the same zzso zzso zzso By zzso methods zzso zzso a corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to form a zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso and zzso indicate that the zzso zzso is membrane zzso This zzso and the fusion zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested for their effect on the zzso for zzso phase transition temperature of zzso zzso zzso the external fusion zzso and the internal zzso peptides of zzso zzso exert opposite effects on membrane zzso The fusion zzso lowers zzso while the membrane zzso zzso raises zzso These effects on zzso correlate with the ability of these peptides to induce zzso mixing in large zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso When added zzso to zzso zzso the zzso fusion zzso promotes zzso mixing while the zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso These finding indicate a possible mechanism by which the zzso domain in zzso zzso may affect the formation of membrane fusion zzso
