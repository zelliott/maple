zzso is one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins which interact with the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and are thought to contribute to the specificity and regulation of its diverse zzso zzso expression of which is zzso in response to zzso stress, has been suggested to act as a zzso binding zzso or zzso proteins and delivering them to zzso In order to give further insights into the functions of zzso and the regulation of zzso by zzso zzso we have determined the crystal structure of human zzso to zzso zzso resolution using a combination of molecular replacement and single wavelength anomalous zzso The structure shows the human zzso zzso to have a very zzso overall zzso In addition to the zzso J domain, zzso contains nine zzso zzso repeat zzso divided into three zzso of three motifs zzso The J domain is attached to the zzso end via a flexible zzso and the structure shows the zzso zzso zzso zzso motif to be situated on the very edge of the zzso zzso 100 zzso from the putative binding site for unfolded protein zzso The zzso that comprise the surface surrounding the zzso motif are highly zzso in zzso from other organisms but more varied between the human zzso zzso supporting the view that their regulation of different zzso functions is facilitated by differences in zzso
