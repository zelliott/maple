zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso the translation of its own zzso zzso by binding to an operator located upstream of the initiation zzso The crystal structure of the complex between the core of zzso and the essential domain of the operator shows that the zzso uses the recognition mode of the zzso zzso loop to initiate zzso The final positioning of the operator, upon which the control mechanism is based, relies on a characteristic zzso motif adapted to the zzso zzso The finding of other zzso operators that have this zzso motif leads to a zzso of this regulatory mechanism to a subset of zzso zzso
