zzso zzso by zzso zzso in response to environmental cues is dependent on the zzso zzso protein harboring two sensory zzso zzso and a zzso domain, zzso The closest known and previously characterized zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso potential sensor and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here, we made use of zzso replacement zzso of the zzso zzso domain zzso previously demonstrated to be essential for zzso in zzso to determine whether zzso is a potential sensory zzso Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in a zzso zzso for zzso One zzso the zzso protein with the zzso zzso zzso transmitted a constant zzso bias as it rendered zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso correlated with increased interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso under zzso growth conditions, resulting in increased zzso activity and reduced zzso biomass zzso We zzso demonstrate that zzso is a zzso zzso None of the zzso protein zzso analyzed led to a loss of the zzso prosthetic zzso The zzso zzso domain was identified as the zzso domain of zzso with zzso zzso zzso requiring the zzso zzso The findings suggest that zzso plays a role in zzso sensing of zzso conditions and together with zzso forms a regulatory network that zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso pool to enable zzso
