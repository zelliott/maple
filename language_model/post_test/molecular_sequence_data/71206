A rat zzso zzso P was zzso from liver zzso with a procedure including an affinity zzso step with 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments were generated, zzso and the zzso was cloned from a rat liver zzso zzso The structure shows high zzso and zzso zzso sequence identity at the zzso and zzso acid levels with the previously described human putative zzso zzso zzso The cloned rat zzso was functionally expressed in zzso coli and also in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis, using an zzso generated against the zzso zzso and Northern zzso zzso showed ubiquitous expression of the protein in different zzso with the highest expression level in the zzso
