This paper describes the zzso sequences of three spontaneous zzso in a zzso gene of zzso T4 zzso They are zzso of the zzso and variable arms of the zzso zzso One is a zzso direct repeat of the zzso zzso The remaining two have zzso structures, with each containing zzso zzso and direct repeats of the zzso zzso One of the latter zzso is frequent and was present in multiple zzso All three zzso are zzso and several zzso of each were zzso Most of the zzso had the zzso zzso zzso however, one had imprecisely removed the duplicated zzso leaving four new zzso compared to the zzso zzso These zzso represent significant genetic events with regard to their high rates and their gross structural zzso As to their origin, the zzso can be described as the zzso of zzso zzso of DNA at regions of potential secondary structure and subsequent DNA zzso The secondary structure contains four zzso stems that emerge from duplex zzso These stems zzso the zzso and variable arm regions of the zzso zzso The zzso sites mimic the known zzso of T4 zzso zzso an zzso previously noted for its ability to resolve zzso DNA zzso
