The concept of small interfering zzso zzso has been extended to include not only short zzso zzso of zzso but also zzso zzso zzso of the same zzso since such zzso zzso zzso were recently found to be able to inhibit gene expression as zzso We made comprehensive comparison of double- and zzso zzso functions in zzso interference zzso targeting multiple sites and different zzso measuring zzso effects at different zzso and in different cell lines, and examining response zzso Duplex zzso were found to be more potent than zzso zzso zzso This was verified by the observation that zzso zzso zzso which were inefficient in some cases when used alone, could be rescued from inefficiency by zzso zzso with the sense zzso This result suggests that the structural character of zzso molecules might be a more important zzso of zzso efficiency than the cellular persistence of zzso
