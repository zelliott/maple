By differential screening of a zzso library of zzso rice zzso zzso clones were zzso corresponding to zzso zzso By sequence analysis two of these clones were found to be zzso zzso zzso The zzso corresponding to a third zzso clone zzso displayed an expression pattern similar to the expression pattern of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso by a zzso zzso The zzso clone zzso was isolated and the zzso structure was determined by comparing the zzso sequences of the zzso and the zzso zzso The gene contains two zzso zzso start sites were determined by zzso mapping and primer zzso The start site obtained by both methods is located 87 zzso upstream of the translation start site and 23 zzso downstream of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso region motifs can be found that are zzso to sequences in promoters that are zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame present in zzso codes for a protein (15 zzso that contains a putative zzso transit zzso and does not show any significant zzso to protein sequences in the zzso protein zzso
