zzso zzso zzso of the neural cell zzso zzso zzso contain a novel sequence block termed zzso domain 1 zzso which is inserted within the zzso coding zzso Here, we report a characterization of the zzso organization of zzso and its pattern of expression within cellular zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protection analyses and sequence analysis of an zzso human zzso clone containing zzso sequences indicated that zzso is comprised of three discrete zzso of 15, 48, and 42 zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso was present in a small proportion of zzso from both brain and muscle cells, the entire zzso sequence occurred predominantly in zzso from differentiated zzso zzso In addition, zzso raised to a zzso zzso zzso sequence was found to stain the cell surface of human skeletal zzso in culture, whereas zzso zzso and neural cells were zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences thus arise collectively in zzso zzso and zzso zzso as a result of muscle zzso and zzso regulated alternative zzso zzso zzso In addition, the occurrence of brain and muscle zzso containing only zzso indicate that alternative zzso may occur within the zzso region itself to generate further zzso
