zzso 1 zzso where zzso is an zzso of the three gene products zzso zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso and regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso and a zzso (an zzso of the three proteins zzso zzso and zzso domain in the zzso half and a zzso domain in the zzso zzso In this study we examined the role of the zzso region in the regulation of zzso activity of zzso Limited zzso of zzso resulted in the production of the zzso zzso core fragments with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso The zzso zzso with deleted zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the two zzso zzso replaced with zzso zzso had zzso higher zzso activities in zzso compared with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso bound to the zzso domain but not to the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso activity of the zzso core zzso of zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso zzso domain zzso regulates the zzso activity of zzso by direct interaction with the zzso zzso zzso In addition, expression of the zzso zzso in cultured cells induced zzso zzso of zzso zzso an event distinct from the pattern of zzso organization induced by expression of the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso domain plays a role in the function of zzso in zzso
