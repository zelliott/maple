We paper describe a mass zzso approach generally zzso for the rapid identification and characterization of proteins isolated by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso The highly sensitive zzso mass zzso employing a zzso of flight mass zzso was used for the direct identification of proteins from the zzso mixture generated from only one high resolution zzso gel without high performance liquid zzso zzso separation or zzso zzso Due to the high sensitivity and high mass accuracy of the instrument zzso this technique proved to be a powerful tool for the identification of proteins from zzso amounts of zzso We applied the technique for the investigation of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso This cell line has been used as a model to assign zzso proteins by zzso analysis of normal and zzso zzso From the nuclear fraction of these cells, 36 protein spots were zzso from only one zzso zzso zzso Blue zzso stained zzso after zzso zzso by zzso assisted laser zzso zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso In combination with database searches, of 33 proteins were successfully identified by zzso of up to eight peptides per zzso Three proteins were new proteins not listed in any of the available zzso Some of the identified proteins are known to be involved in zzso zzso the others were common proteins in the zzso zzso The given technique and the protein data are the basis for construction of a database to compare normal and zzso cells and, further, to enable fast screening of drug impact in zzso zzso
