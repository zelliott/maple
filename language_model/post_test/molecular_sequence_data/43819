zzso acid sequences of the smallest zzso of human and bovine zzso c zzso were deduced from zzso sequence of zzso zzso clones isolated by screening the corresponding zzso zzso Both proteins were composed of 56 zzso zzso They were zzso zzso to each other in the coding zzso sequences and zzso zzso in the zzso acid zzso Southern zzso analysis with human DNA suggested the presence of a single gene coding for the zzso Northern zzso of human zzso from different zzso confirmed the existence of a single species of transcript among the zzso but the human gene is highly expressed in zzso active zzso like heart and skeletal zzso
