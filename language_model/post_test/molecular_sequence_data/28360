zzso analysis of the gene zzso the major zzso zzso zzso was performed on 27 human and animal zzso strains of zzso 3 in order to examine genetic variation within strains of identical zzso Comparisons of the deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso showed overall sequence identities of zzso or zzso A higher degree of overall zzso sequence similarity was observed among strains from the same animal species when compared to strains from different animal species, suggesting that there are zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences demonstrated that zzso acid sequence divergence among zzso 3 strains from different species was located primarily in previously established zzso zzso regions where genetic variation was identified among strains of different zzso These regions were highly zzso among zzso 3 strains derived from the same zzso The varying zzso of three zzso zzso zzso with the 27 strains was consistent with the occurrence of zzso variation among zzso 3 zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso correlated with the zzso acid sequence found in two zzso regions zzso and zzso A zzso predicted zzso tree suggests that zzso strains from different animal species belonging to zzso 3 are more closely related to each other than to zzso strains of different zzso
