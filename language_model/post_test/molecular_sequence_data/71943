The presence of zzso zzso avian influenza virus zzso which is associated with zzso markets zzso in the Northeast United States, was first detected in 1994 and, despite efforts to eradicate the virus, surveillance of these markets has resulted in numerous zzso of zzso zzso from several states from 1994 through zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes from representative zzso zzso from the zzso and elsewhere were zzso and the sequences were compared zzso The zzso gene of most zzso zzso examined appeared to have been the result of a single introduction of the zzso zzso Evidence for evolutionary changes were observed with three zzso zzso The first isolate from 1994 had the zzso acid zzso at the zzso position of the zzso zzso site, which is the most commonly observed zzso acid at this site for North American zzso zzso In January 1995 a new zzso with a zzso at the zzso position was zzso and this zzso eventually became the zzso virus zzso A third viral zzso detected in November 1996, had an zzso deletion within the putative zzso binding zzso This viral zzso appeared to be the zzso zzso although zzso with zzso at the zzso position without the deletion were still observed in viruses from the last sampling zzso Evidence for zzso of multiple viral genes was zzso The combination of possible zzso evolution of the virus and zzso with different influenza virus genes makes it difficult to determine the risk of zzso of this group of zzso zzso
