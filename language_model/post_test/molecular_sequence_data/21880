A rod zzso zzso zzso zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that had been fed with green algae belonging to the zzso zzso The novel strain was able to degrade zzso a zzso extracted from green algae zzso zzso The zzso position of strain zzso was investigated by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso was dark orange, zzso zzso and grew zzso at 25 zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso with an zzso metabolism using oxygen as the electron zzso zzso could not be used as the electron zzso zzso zzso had a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the sequence of the zzso zzso gene placed the novel strain in the family zzso zzso zzso within a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The closest zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso sharing zzso and zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso and differential zzso characteristics demonstrated that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
