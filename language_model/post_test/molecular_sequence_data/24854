We have recently reported an in zzso precursor zzso zzso that is able to catalyze zzso on its own zzso zzso This zzso zzso is susceptible to zzso P zzso generating the zzso zzso and mature zzso The zzso zzso is also capable of zzso the zzso in zzso thus acting as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report its structural characterization that reveals the essential zzso zzso The zzso consists of three zzso connected by two junction zzso The chemical probing analyses show that a zzso region zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso of the zzso is responsible for the recognition of the zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso of the zzso adjacent to the zzso region, forms base pairs with the zzso 3' zzso Our demonstration shows that simple zzso motifs can recognize both the zzso acid and zzso zzso thus zzso the 3' zzso of zzso in zzso
