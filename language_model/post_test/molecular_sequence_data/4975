The DNA zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso DNA zzso contains a long open reading frame of zzso bases that encodes zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the DNA zzso contained a putative zzso zzso activity and two zzso intervening sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pol zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pol zzso which are located in the middle of regions zzso among zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso The mature form of the DNA zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity was confirmed, and although zzso DNA zzso optimum temperature (75 degrees zzso and zzso frequency zzso zzso zzso were similar to those of a DNA zzso from zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso the zzso DNA zzso exhibited an extension rate zzso to 130 zzso 5 times higher and a zzso zzso of sequential zzso zzso 10 to 15 times higher than those of zzso DNA zzso These characteristics enabled the zzso DNA zzso to perform a more accurate zzso in a shorter reaction zzso
