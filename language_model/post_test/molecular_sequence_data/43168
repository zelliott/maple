zzso DNA is a significant component of zzso zzso We have developed a strategy to efficiently and accurately sequence repetitive DNA in the zzso zzso zzso using integrated artificial zzso and automated fluorescent zzso zzso and assembly tools represent important components of this strategy and facilitate sequence assembly in complex zzso We have applied the strategy to several zzso assembly gaps resulting from repetitive DNA and have accurately recovered the sequences of these zzso Analysis of these regions revealed six novel zzso repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Each of these elements represents a zzso DNA family in zzso zzso containing at least zzso copies per zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located on all (or zzso of the six zzso zzso whereas zzso is predominantly located on zzso zzso These elements are almost exclusively zzso between predicted genes or within the predicted zzso of these zzso with the exception of a single zzso element, which is located within a predicted zzso zzso zzso and zzso are flanked by short sequence zzso resembling the target site zzso of zzso We have established a zzso database zzso zzso to track and zzso these zzso repetitive elements that contains detailed information on individual element copies and provides links to appropriate zzso zzso This set of tools may be used to zzso track, and study repetitive DNA in model organisms and zzso
