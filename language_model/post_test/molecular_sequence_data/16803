To understand how plant cell changes gene expression during cell division and after termination of cell division, we analyzed the change of gene expression during the growth of tobacco zzso cell lines using a zzso zzso which contained about 9,200 expression sequence tag fragments and corresponded to about 7,000 zzso We found that log phase cells predominantly expressed zzso zzso gene zzso In addition, many genes for basic zzso and translation zzso as well as zzso zzso were zzso at the log zzso About half of the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso were predominantly expressed at the dividing phase as zzso In contrast, stationary phase cells expressed genes for many zzso zzso signal zzso zzso and zzso zzso Several hundreds of genes showed differential expression after incubation of stationary phase cells with medium containing either salicylic acid or zzso zzso These findings suggested that zzso cells at the stationary phase express genes for zzso zzso zzso
