The crystal structure of the zzso of a zzso beta zzso of human zzso was refined at zzso A zzso The zzso zzso was constructed by replacing an zzso module zzso of the zzso with that of the zzso simulating an zzso zzso The implanted module zzso retained the native zzso structure, while module zzso was disturbed around the site where a new type of zzso was recently zzso Some of the zzso were found in alternative zzso that avoid zzso hindrance at the zzso zzso The zzso are modestly rigid in their backbone structures by using zzso to compensate for interface zzso
