Class I molecules are zzso zzso zzso by the zzso They carry zzso zzso peptides to the cell surface, displaying them to enable immune surveillance of cellular zzso zzso are delivered to class I molecules by the zzso associated with zzso processing zzso zzso association is known to occur before exposure of class I molecules to the zzso zzso zzso zzso II, but there is limited information regarding the location or timing of zzso binding within the earlier regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A reported association of newly zzso class I molecules with the zzso zzso zzso raises the possibility of persistence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso known to be recognized by this zzso To explore these matters, we determined the structure of the zzso on the subset of newly zzso class I molecules awaiting the loading of zzso We zzso zzso zzso zzso class I molecules in zzso cells, which lack one of the TAP zzso causing the great majority of the molecules to be retained for prolonged periods in an early zzso zzso awaiting zzso zzso zzso molecules zzso with zzso were isolated, the zzso specifically released and structurally analyzed by a variety of zzso Within the chosen window of zzso time, most zzso molecules from parental zzso cells carried mature zzso of the zzso zzso with one to two zzso acid zzso In zzso cells, such chains were in the minority, the majority consisting of the precursor forms zzso and zzso No zzso forms were zzso nor were the later processing zzso zzso or zzso Thus, most zzso molecules in zzso cells are retained in an early compartment of the zzso pathway, before the point of first access to the zzso zzso I, which trims alpha 1-2 linked zzso zzso but beyond the point where the alpha zzso zzso zzso is finally removed by the zzso zzso zzso Thus, structural analysis of zzso on class I molecules within a defined zzso window has established a zzso measure of the timing of zzso zzso
