The moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produces zzso and zzso as main compatible zzso at external zzso of zzso to zzso M zzso The routes for the zzso of these zzso and their regulation were zzso The zzso contains two genes potentially zzso zzso zzso and two genes for the small zzso of a zzso zzso but only one gene for the large zzso However, the expression of these genes was not salt dependent, nor were the corresponding zzso activities zzso in cell extracts of cells grown at different zzso In contrast, zzso zzso activity was readily zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity was strictly salt dependent and reached a maximum at zzso M zzso zzso zzso the production of active zzso by about zzso Two potential genes zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The expression of zzso but not of zzso was increased up to fourfold in cells adapted to high salt, indicating that zzso is the zzso zzso involved in the synthesis of the zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso was zzso twofold by the presence of zzso zzso zzso exerted an even more pronounced effect on the zzso activity of zzso zzso in the absence of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was decreased by as much as zzso These data demonstrate for the first time a regulatory role of a component of common salt, zzso in the zzso of compatible zzso
