Five zzso of zzso receptors have to date been identified, but to date little is known about the different structural requirements for binding and biological activity at these zzso In this study, the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso selectivity for the zzso zzso was zzso zzso modified zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso and their interaction with zzso and zzso zzso receptors was zzso This study provides further evidence for an important role of zzso 12 zzso with respect to zzso for binding and activity at the zzso zzso Although the influence of zzso zzso acids on binding and activity at zzso was less zzso some of them were nevertheless observed to be beneficial for the interaction with this zzso zzso
