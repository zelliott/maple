The zzso zzso gene for the zzso zzso delta zzso was isolated and characterized by high-resolution mapping and DNA zzso zzso 13 zzso it comprises nine zzso and displays an zzso pattern comparable, but not zzso to that seen in members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the second zzso domain thought to line the zzso channel and zzso among different zzso zzso zzso is interrupted by an zzso The zzso region of the delta gene displays features characteristic of a zzso island and lacks zzso promoter elements such as zzso and zzso consensus sequences in proximity to the zzso initiation zzso The human delta zzso gene was localized on the short arm of zzso zzso
