zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso leaf cell walls by sequential zzso with zzso The structure of the two main zzso zzso and zzso was investigated by zzso degradation with specific zzso followed by analysis of the resulting fragments by high performance zzso exchange zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso zzso zzso The results show that zzso zzso zzso is composed of a zzso backbone zzso with zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated by treatment with an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso of the pool of zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso cell wall contains a zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments previously zzso in various plants, a second group of zzso fragments was zzso The primary structure of the major zzso was determined by a combination of sugar analysis, zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This fragment, termed zzso contains a novel zzso side chain linked to zzso of the second zzso unit from the zzso end of the zzso zzso
