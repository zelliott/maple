zzso of zzso turnover has emerged as an important control point in zzso and zzso zzso We have studied a zzso tumor in which zzso of zzso expression results from the zzso stabilization of the normally short-lived zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 3' untranslated region of the zzso gene to a zzso reporter gene demonstrated that zzso stabilization is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso rather than by an zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso similar zzso of the zzso and zzso 3' untranslated regions to zzso yielded zzso that turned over rapidly in all cells, including the tumor zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso turnover signals are recognized zzso in trans within the same zzso
