In the zzso zzso and zzso zzso induce de zzso synthesis of zzso stress zzso known as zzso Because plant hormones play critical roles in the induction of zzso zzso we have explored the effect of zzso acid zzso on the synthesis of zzso the major wild tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso plants versus zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are deficient in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited a zzso higher synthesis of zzso than zzso plants when zzso with either zzso or zzso acid or when infected by zzso zzso The same trend was observed for the expression of the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of zzso plants with zzso an inhibitor of the upstream zzso pathway, zzso the behavior of zzso and zzso zzso while the application of zzso zzso reversed the enhanced synthesis of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the production of zzso we observed the induction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso plants, the induction of zzso zzso coincided with a decrease in zzso content and with the zzso of zzso zzso products such as zzso acid and zzso acid, suggesting a negative regulation exerted by zzso on zzso zzso zzso our data indicate that zzso is not required per zzso for the induction of zzso synthesis but is essentially implicated in a zzso checkpoint to fine-tune the amplification of zzso synthesis in challenged zzso
