zzso sequence can be obtained through zzso degradation, mass zzso or zzso zzso High resolution X-ray zzso can also be used to derive protein sequence information, but faces the difficulty in distinguishing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 is a new type 1 zzso protein zzso isolated from the seeds of zzso zzso Besides zzso zzso activity, zzso 1 also demonstrates activities including zzso tumor zzso proliferation and inducing tumor zzso zzso 

The crystal structure of zzso 1 was determined at zzso A zzso Its zzso sequence was derived from this high resolution structure using the following criteria: 1) high resolution electron zzso 2) comparison of electron density between two molecules that exist in the same zzso 3) evaluation of the chemical environment of zzso to break down the sequence assignment ambiguity in zzso pairs zzso zzso and zzso 4) comparison with sequences of the zzso zzso Using the criteria 1 and 2, zzso of the zzso can be zzso By incorporating with criterion 3, zzso of the zzso were zzso suggesting the effectiveness of chemical environment evaluation in breaking down zzso zzso In total, zzso of the zzso 1 sequence was assigned with high confidence using this improved X-ray sequencing zzso Two zzso zzso linked respectively to the zzso zzso and zzso can be identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso define the active site of zzso 1 as an zzso zzso 

X-ray sequencing method can be effective to derive sequence information of zzso The evaluation of the chemical environment of zzso is a useful method to break down the assignment ambiguity in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequence and the crystal structure confirm that zzso 1 is a new type 1 zzso
