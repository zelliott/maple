zzso members of the zzso family, including West Nile zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are growing global threats for which there are no specific zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the viral zzso precursor within the host cell, a process that is required for viral zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso zzso both in a zzso form and in complex with the zzso inhibitor zzso We show that zzso binds in a zzso fashion in which the productive zzso of the zzso is fully formed, providing evidence for an zzso zzso mechanism of zzso and allowing us to zzso the distinct zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We also show that the zzso zzso of zzso can adopt two very distinct zzso and that this is likely to be a general feature of zzso zzso providing further opportunities for zzso Finally, by comparing the zzso zzso with the more zzso related zzso C virus, we provide insights into the evolution of the zzso zzso Our work should zzso the design of zzso zzso to treat a range of zzso zzso
