Three genes cloned from zzso zzso zzso define a new zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso are related to fish zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcripts are expressed predominantly in liver and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in a zzso system zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso forming zzso zzso and zzso acids and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso acid were remarkably similar to human zzso and rat zzso zzso acids and their corresponding zzso products, the zzso zzso were detected in zzso liver and zzso indicating metabolism of zzso acid by zzso zzso in zzso zzso of these products in zzso zzso were higher than those in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso itself suppressed expression of zzso but not zzso In rat zzso zzso similarly depressed the levels of zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso appear to be derived from a common ancestral zzso likely a fatty acid zzso
