zzso zzso 4 zzso is a protein zzso zzso that has been implicated in zzso organization at zzso zzso of zzso with high apparent molecular masses zzso and 600 zzso were zzso from zzso skeletal muscle and zzso to near zzso zzso acid sequences derived from a protein component present in both complexes were zzso to identify a human zzso The zzso putative zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso 453 zzso zzso had a molecular mass of zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso of zzso with zzso expressed in bacteria and human zzso zzso formed a complex of 450 zzso with zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso detection of zzso at zzso suggests that it may target zzso to this zzso Native 450 zzso and 600 zzso zzso complexes are zzso but can be activated by basic zzso suggesting that zzso may also regulate the activity of zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso
