zzso maps of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the gray, zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated from analyses of the available whole zzso sequence for this zzso zzso of their content and organization confirmed a number of previous conclusions based on characterization of complementary zzso zzso zzso zzso heavy and light chains and limited zzso analysis, including zzso the predominance of a single zzso heavy chain variable region zzso zzso and clan, zzso the presence of a single zzso zzso zzso zzso the apparent absence of an zzso and zzso the general organization and V gene complexity of the zzso and zzso light chain zzso In addition, several unexpected discoveries were made including the presence of a partial V to D, zzso zzso segment, the first zzso zzso V gene to be found in a zzso In addition was the presence of a larger number of zzso zzso than had been previously zzso With this report, zzso maps of the major zzso complex, zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been completed for zzso zzso the only zzso zzso species for which this has been accomplished, strengthening the utility of this species as a model zzso
