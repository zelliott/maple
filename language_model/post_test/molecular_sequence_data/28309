zzso tests, performed by zzso into zzso zzso zzso show that a DNA zzso containing the zzso of the early zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso enhances zzso of a reporter gene when located, in the zzso orientation, upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso I zzso zzso further reveal that the zzso zzso contains at least two binding sites zzso sequence elements 1 and 2 zzso 1 and zzso zzso for nuclear factors extracted from sea zzso zzso which actively transcribe the early zzso gene zzso Interestingly, zzso 1 is highly zzso to a zzso element previously identified in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1983) zzso zzso zzso 11, zzso Finally, a cloned zzso containing the zzso 1 sequence competes efficiently in zzso zzso with the zzso zzso to prevent enhancement of zzso of the reporter zzso From these results, we conclude that zzso 1 and perhaps zzso 2 in the zzso zzso are upstream zzso elements that are recognized by zzso factors common to zzso and sea zzso
