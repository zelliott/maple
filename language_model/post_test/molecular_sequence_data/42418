An zzso fraction with zzso activities for the zzso of the zzso acid containing zzso zzso zzso was partially zzso and characterized from the zzso zzso The crude cell zzso was subjected to zzso zzso ammonium zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso The zzso zzso shows an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso exchange reaction dependent on all zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso in zzso when incubated together with zzso acid, all zzso zzso acids in their zzso form, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The yield of zzso zzso is higher when zzso instead of zzso is used, indicating that zzso of zzso is not carried out by the zzso
