The promoter region zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso storage protein gene zzso was studied in transgenic tobacco by successive zzso as well as internal deletions fused to the reporter gene zzso zzso The expression in the two main zzso of the seed, the zzso and the zzso was shown to be zzso zzso This zzso regulation within the seed was found to affect the zzso expression during seed zzso The region between zzso to zzso which has a large effect on quantitative zzso was shown to zzso four elements regulating zzso and one regulating zzso zzso This region also displayed zzso zzso zzso of eight zzso from position zzso to position zzso totally abolished the activity of the zzso zzso This deletion disrupted a zzso element with similarity to an zzso element zzso overlapping with an zzso demonstrating its crucial importance for quantitative zzso An internal deletion of the region zzso to zzso resulted in increased activity in both leaves and zzso and a decreased activity in the zzso Within this region, a zzso element similar to the zzso element, found in other storage protein zzso was zzso This suggest that the zzso element is important for zzso seed specificity by serving both as an zzso and a zzso zzso
