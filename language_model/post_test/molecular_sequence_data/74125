The zzso zzso of class II G zzso receptors plays an important role in zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso domain of these receptors has been substantially advanced with the solution of nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of this region of receptors for zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso and gastric zzso zzso However, the orientation of the zzso zzso relative to the zzso core and how the zzso gets activated upon zzso binding remain zzso In this work, we have used zzso labeling to identify a critical spatial approximation between zzso five of zzso and a zzso within the proposed third zzso loop of the zzso zzso This was achieved by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequencing of labeled zzso and zzso zzso zzso This constraint has been used to refine our evolving molecular model of zzso zzso at the intact zzso which for the first time includes refined zzso bundle and loop regions and reflects a zzso groove within the zzso zzso zzso that directs the zzso zzso of the zzso toward the zzso zzso This model is fully consistent with the zzso zzso mechanism for class II G zzso zzso zzso where zzso binding promotes the interaction of a portion of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso body to activate zzso
