zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are essential members of the zzso zzso family that maintain cellular zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso play a critical role in zzso zzso across all zzso of life and have been used extensively as prototypes for the study of protein adaptation and the relationship of protein dynamics and stability to zzso To date, kinetic studies of zzso zzso have not been zzso In order to broaden understanding of zzso adaptation, the kinetic parameters of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso were examined and the crystal structure of this zzso zzso was determined at zzso A zzso As expected, the overall structure and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso AK are similar to those of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso AK zzso zzso is much closer to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than the more closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso properties of zzso zzso AK are quite close to those of the zzso AK and suggests that zzso zzso experiences temperature ranges in which excellent zzso function over a broad temperature range zzso zzso has been retained for the success of the zzso Even transient loss of AK function is lethal and as a consequence AK must be robust and be well adapted to the environment of the host zzso
