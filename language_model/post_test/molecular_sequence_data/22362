The most zzso studied zzso strains initially attach to cells when the zzso of their protruding spikes bind cell surface zzso zzso zzso strains that cause disease in humans do not bind this zzso The structure of the zzso acid binding head (the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso strain zzso has been reported, and zzso zzso have been mapped onto its zzso We report here a zzso resolution crystal structure of the equivalent domain from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso which causes zzso in zzso Although the zzso and zzso zzso zzso differ zzso they share the same zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the region that zzso to the zzso zzso acid binding site make it unlikely that zzso zzso binds an alternative zzso zzso in this zzso In the zzso a surface zzso on each zzso zzso core binds zzso zzso from a neighboring zzso This zzso may function as a zzso binding site during zzso zzso We also report an escape zzso analysis, which allows the mapping of zzso zzso zzso recognized by human zzso zzso onto the surface of the zzso zzso The distribution of escape zzso on the zzso zzso core indicates that zzso zzso that recognize zzso of human zzso strains may bind a zzso of the spike that differs from those observed to zzso
