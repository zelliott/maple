A novel protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso virus zzso zzso gene clone 5 zzso was zzso it shared sequence similarity with a subset of protein zzso zzso that regulate zzso protein zzso The zzso region of zzso was expressed as a fusion protein and was shown to zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso thus proving that zzso possessed zzso zzso A unique zzso region distinguished zzso from other closely related protein zzso zzso Another feature that distinguished zzso from related zzso was that zzso was expressed predominantly in the adult brain, heart, and skeletal zzso In addition, in zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso revealed high levels of expression and a wide distribution in the central and peripheral nervous zzso Some specific areas of abundant zzso expression included the zzso bulb, zzso layers of the cerebral cortex, and zzso and spinal zzso zzso was induced in zzso cells upon nerve growth factor and insulin treatment in a manner characteristic of an zzso zzso suggesting a possible role in the signal zzso zzso
