The zzso surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso are anchored to the cell surface via a zzso zzso zzso All zzso proteins are zzso with a zzso signal zzso which is replaced by a zzso in a rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal sequences are extraordinarily zzso They contain either 23 or 17 zzso zzso a difference that zzso the two major zzso classes, and consist of a zzso sequence followed by a more zzso zzso The omega zzso acid, to which zzso is zzso is either zzso zzso or zzso the zzso zzso acid is always zzso and the zzso zzso acid is almost always zzso In order to determine whether this high conservation is necessary for zzso zzso we introduced several zzso into the signal zzso Surprisingly, changing the most zzso zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso and zzso had no zzso effect on the efficiency of zzso or on protein zzso Several more extensive changes also had no zzso impact on zzso zzso the entire 23 zzso signal sequence or the 15 zzso zzso region generated proteins that were not zzso Instead of being zzso these truncated proteins accumulated in the zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso the zzso signal sequence with a proven zzso zzso domain reduced expression by about zzso and resulted not in cell surface expression but in zzso close to the zzso pocket and in zzso zzso These results indicate that the high conservation of the zzso zzso signal sequence is not necessary for efficient expression and zzso zzso Instead, the zzso anchor is essential for surface expression of zzso However, because the zzso is a major zzso factor, it is possible that small changes in the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso in our experiments, might have influenced the evolution of zzso zzso signal zzso
