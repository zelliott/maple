zzso zzso are organized by structural and functional zzso including zzso zzso start and termination sites, open reading zzso regulatory zzso regions, untranslated regions and zzso zzso Here, we zzso integrate zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding locations and zzso transcript zzso zzso sequences and translation into proteins to determine the organizational structure of the zzso coli K-12 zzso zzso zzso of the organizational elements provides an zzso zzso zzso unit architecture, including alternative zzso start sites, zzso untranslated region, boundaries and open reading frames of each zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso units were identified, representing an increase of zzso over current zzso This comprehensive zzso unit architecture allows for the zzso of zzso uses of alternative zzso factors at the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso unit architecture provides a foundation on which to construct zzso zzso and zzso regulatory zzso
