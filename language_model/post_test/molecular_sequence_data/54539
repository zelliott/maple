zzso zzso zzso zzso play an important role in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we zzso isolated the full-length zzso zzso DNA and zzso region of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso in zzso and the deduced protein consisted of zzso zzso zzso containing all highly zzso sequence motifs that are present among all zzso zzso Moreover, two zzso were detected in the zzso zzso We also zzso investigated the expression profiles of plant zzso under the treatments of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso virus Y zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the expression patterns of zzso in zzso zzso under the treatments of salicylic acid zzso and zzso acid zzso were also been zzso The results indicated that the zzso zzso zzso could be induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the expression level of zzso exhibited no remarkable difference under the treatments of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further investigation suggested several potential zzso elements were found in the zzso sequence of zzso which might be responsible for the enhanced response to zzso
