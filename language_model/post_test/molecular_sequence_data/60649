zzso mediate adhesive interactions between cells and the zzso zzso and play a role in cell migration, zzso zzso zzso organization, and signal zzso We have identified an interaction between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso This interaction was first isolated in a zzso zzso screen and confirmed by zzso and in in zzso binding zzso using zzso expressed zzso zzso studies performed in zzso zzso expressing both native and zzso zzso demonstrate zzso with zzso zzso in focal zzso zzso of the fourth of four zzso zzso in zzso results in loss of interaction with zzso zzso in zzso and in the zzso system, and less prominent zzso in focal zzso This zzso is also required for zzso zzso of zzso growth zzso zzso signaling by the human zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or expression of zzso lacking this zzso alters the zzso of zzso and zzso suggesting that the interaction of zzso with zzso could be important for cell growth zzso We also discuss the possible role zzso might play in zzso zzso
