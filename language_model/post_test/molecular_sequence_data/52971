zzso zzso at the surface of mouse melanoma zzso cells is clustered and organized with signal zzso molecules zzso zzso A, and focal zzso zzso zzso to form a membrane unit zzso from zzso which are enriched in cholesterol and zzso but do not contain zzso or the above three signal zzso The zzso membrane units are involved in zzso cell zzso coupled with zzso of zzso zzso A, and zzso and are termed the zzso signaling zzso or the zzso zzso zzso In order to assess the essential components that display zzso function, zzso with properties similar to those of zzso were zzso using zzso zzso and zzso with or without other zzso zzso The zzso membrane thus prepared displayed zzso zzso to plates coated with zzso or zzso zzso resulting in enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This response in zzso membrane depends on zzso concentration and was not observed when zzso was absent or replaced with other zzso zzso or zzso or with zzso The zzso zzso zzso response was enhanced when cholesterol and zzso were zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso are essential for zzso function, a small quantity of cholesterol and zzso may act as an auxiliary factor to stabilize zzso zzso function in terms of zzso zzso and signaling was blocked in the presence of zzso or its analogue but not zzso zzso or zzso Such zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and other zzso compounds is the same as zzso of original zzso zzso Thus, functional organization of the zzso membrane closely simulates that of zzso in zzso cells, which is based on clustered zzso organized with zzso as the essential zzso
