The zzso gene in zzso band zzso exhibits a number of properties consistent with a role as an zzso and its expression is activated in most zzso leukemia patients with, as well as in a minority of patients without, zzso zzso A zzso zzso of this zzso zzso acts as its zzso at least in some tissue culture zzso We established real-time quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso for these zzso zzso to compare their expression levels in a zzso reliable zzso zzso was zzso to highly variable zzso in all patients with, as well as in zzso of patients without, zzso zzso In some of these samples, zzso was also transcribed at elevated levels compared to those of healthy zzso However, although the induction of zzso was comparable to, or higher than, that of zzso in three of five samples with a normal zzso zzso this was true for only two of 13 patients with a zzso zzso We further provide preliminary evidence that the zzso zzso may be useful for disease monitoring in patients zzso zzso
