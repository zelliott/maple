zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that supports zzso attachment to zzso surfaces at sites of vascular zzso The zzso absence of the zzso results in a bleeding disorder associated with zzso zzso a condition linking the expression of the complex to zzso zzso To understand better the expression of the zzso zzso complex, studies were undertaken to define the essential genetic elements supporting the expression of the zzso of the complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha promoter activity was evaluated by zzso of human zzso cells with reporter plasmids coding for the zzso zzso Studies were initiated with a zzso extending zzso zzso zzso to the zzso start site and lead to the identification of zzso zzso retaining full promoter activity in human zzso zzso In cells of zzso zzso human zzso and zzso cells, the zzso zzso alpha promoter activity was no greater than background levels obtained with zzso zzso zzso shift zzso and zzso zzso studies defined essential zzso and zzso binding motifs 93 and 150 zzso upstream of the zzso start site, a finding which further zzso these elements as important zzso of zzso gene zzso The results define essential zzso elements responsible for the expression of zzso zzso alpha and provide insights into molecular events coinciding with the release of normal zzso into the zzso
