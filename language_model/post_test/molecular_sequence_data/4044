As part of an ongoing effort to generate human and zzso zzso zzso against poorly zzso zzso zzso we have merged the rapidly expanding disciplines of parallel zzso synthesis and zzso technology with zzso to produce a rapid and generic approach to improve the zzso of zzso zzso The process involves three zzso An array of zzso zzso materials containing a carrier protein (at various zzso is prepared in parallel in one zzso The array is then screened in mice to determine the most effective zzso at enhancing the zzso of the zzso versus zzso zzso Finally, the most efficient zzso is prepared containing the critical zzso zzso and is used for zzso zzso The strategy was successful for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analogue zzso When zzso within the zzso array member most efficient at zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was significantly more zzso that when administered as a free zzso
