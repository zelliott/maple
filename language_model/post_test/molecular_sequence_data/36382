An efficient method for generating full-length DNA sequences from apparently unsuccessful zzso chain reactions zzso has been zzso In cases where zzso background interferes with detection of the zzso product, a second amplification is performed using a zzso set of zzso The internal zzso of DNA amplified in this reaction is then zzso to a membrane and used to zzso the desired DNA from the initial zzso This DNA is zzso and used as the template for a third round of zzso The zzso of the original zzso from the initial reaction enables the final zzso to generate full-length zzso This technique was used to clone a full-length gene segment 8 from a zzso influenza zzso zzso virus after initial zzso attempts had zzso
