We describe a method for zzso zzso C virus zzso in zzso This competitive zzso combines reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction and is based on zzso of the target zzso with known amounts of synthetic zzso zzso We tested serum samples from 104 zzso C virus carriers (9 zzso blood donors and 95 patients with type C chronic liver disease) to determine the relationship between the zzso level of zzso C virus and various stages of the carrier zzso The amount of circulating zzso C virus zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso C virus zzso zzso transformed copy numbers of zzso per zzso of zzso was lower in zzso blood donors zzso zzso zzso and in patients with chronic persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso than in patients with chronic active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso C virus zzso was significantly lower in carriers younger than 40 zzso old and correlated positively with the zzso transformed serum zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that age and zzso of zzso C virus zzso correlated independently with the stages of liver zzso These results showed that the zzso level of zzso C virus is higher in advanced liver disease and that zzso of viral replication may play an important role in liver injury and progression of liver zzso This competitive zzso is useful in evaluating the state of viral replication in zzso C virus zzso
