The aim of this study was to develop a simple and specific method for the rapid detection and identification of zzso zzso The method was based on zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso identification was proven on seven zzso zzso zzso while 16 strains belonging to different zzso acid bacteria species were tested zzso The zzso zzso was capable of detecting 100 zzso of zzso zzso DNA, and it was also efficient on single colonies of the zzso Furthermore, the same bacterial strains were used for the specificity evaluation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso zzso nor DNA zzso experiments could differentiate zzso zzso from zzso zzso due to the identity of the zzso zzso gene of the two species, indicating high zzso zzso This was further confirmed by the comparative sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso It was thus clearly demonstrated that zzso zzso recently described as a novel zzso species, is zzso identical to zzso zzso
