In order to clarify the biological activities of zzso G, and zzso A and its zzso zzso zzso G, the zzso effects of zzso derivatives of these compounds zzso zzso and zzso on zzso and viral DNA zzso were zzso DNA zzso alpha zzso from calf zzso was zzso inhibited by zzso and zzso but strongly by zzso the Ki value being zzso zzso On the other hand, rat DNA zzso beta was not affected by these zzso DNA zzso gamma zzso from bovine zzso was very zzso inhibited by zzso and zzso but not by zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso virus zzso zzso was strongly inhibited by all three zzso the Ki values ranging from zzso to zzso zzso Human zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso was also strongly inhibited by these three zzso the Ki value of zzso being slightly smaller than that of zzso or zzso Analysis of products zzso on zzso primed zzso zzso DNA by DNA zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso or zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso revealed that zzso and zzso were incorporated into DNA and caused chain termination mainly at sites one or two zzso beyond the zzso bases on the zzso
