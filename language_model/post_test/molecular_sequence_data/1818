zzso syndrome zzso is a zzso disorder with characteristic physical, cognitive and zzso traits caused by a zzso of approximately zzso zzso on zzso zzso In total, 24 genes have been described within the deleted region to zzso We have isolated and zzso a novel human zzso zzso mapping to the zzso critical region thought to zzso genes important for the cognitive aspects of the zzso zzso is the third member of the novel zzso family of genes clustered on zzso The zzso protein contains two putative zzso regions zzso and an unusual zzso zzso zzso domain, thought to have arisen as a consequence of the random zzso of a zzso element generating a functional fusion zzso The retention of a number of zzso zzso motifs within the protein suggests that the zzso region may still have some degree of zzso functionality that could influence the stability of the region in a mechanism similar to that proposed for zzso zzso type zzso zzso is highly zzso in zzso and the mouse zzso zzso has also been isolated and maps to the zzso zzso region on mouse zzso zzso zzso mapping studies using zzso cell hybrids show that some zzso patients are zzso for this zzso suggesting that it could play a role in the zzso of the zzso
