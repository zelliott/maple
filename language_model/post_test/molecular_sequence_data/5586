The zzso zzso cell host range zzso zzso of the highly zzso zzso type 12 zzso zzso has a zzso deletion in the early region zzso zzso gene that removes the zzso half of zzso region 2 and the zzso half of the zzso so-called zzso that seems to play a pivotal role in the zzso of the zzso Despite its zzso in zzso and transforming primary zzso cells, we found that the zzso zzso protein of zzso retains the ability to bind zzso zzso and zzso in nuclear extract binding zzso with zzso zzso fusion proteins and Western zzso zzso Like zzso zzso the zzso protein was able to zzso zzso from zzso zzso complexes, as judged from gel shift experiments with zzso zzso and zzso proteins from zzso experiments with an zzso expression zzso or from infection with the respective zzso Moreover, in transient expression zzso the zzso and zzso products of zzso zzso and zzso were shown to zzso the zzso zzso promoter containing zzso and zzso respectively, in a comparable zzso The same results were obtained from zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso promoter of zzso type 5 or the human zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that efficient infection by zzso and the correlated zzso zzso of the infected cells, including the induction of cell zzso mechanisms zzso zzso zzso can be zzso from the transformation properties of the zzso
