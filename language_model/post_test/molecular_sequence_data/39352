We have investigated the propensity to form zzso zzso of a variety of fragments and zzso of the zzso protein under the influence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To better identify zzso zzso we compare the zzso propensity of zzso fragments containing the sequence of putative hotspots with that of zzso zzso with that same sequence zzso We also investigate the effects of biologically occurring modifications such as zzso and zzso We found that zzso zzso to 335 are essential for in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to 311 facilitate in zzso zzso but are not sufficient to mimic the in zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, the propensity of the zzso sequence to form zzso is highly decreased by chemical modifications of zzso 310 that are commonly found in zzso
