zzso is a large zzso protein that couples zzso to zzso zzso Here, we report the structure of the zzso zzso domain of zzso the core of which is a zzso bundle linked to a zzso zzso responsible for zzso The zzso structure of the bundle reveals a zzso zzso zzso patch surrounded by positively charged zzso We have mapped the zzso site to this surface and shown that zzso 1 on the opposite side of the bundle zzso regulates zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso reveals an zzso zzso with zzso zzso clustered on the zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso binding and indicates that the zzso zzso itself contributes to zzso We have used these structures together with small angle X-ray scattering to derive a model of the entire zzso zzso zzso provides direct evidence for binding of the zzso to zzso and indicates that it binds to three zzso along the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
