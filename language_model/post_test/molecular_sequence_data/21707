Polar bears zzso zzso are among those species most susceptible to the rapidly changing arctic climate, and their survival is of global zzso Despite this, little is known about polar bear species zzso Future conservation strategies would significantly benefit from an understanding of basic evolutionary information, such as the timing and conditions of their initial divergence from brown bears zzso or their response to previous environmental zzso 

We used a zzso explicit zzso model to estimate the dynamics of 242 brown bear and polar bear zzso sampled throughout the last zzso years and across their present and past geographic zzso Our results show that the present distribution of these zzso was shaped by a combination of regional stability and zzso long-distance zzso from zzso zzso In addition, zzso between polar bears and brown bears may have occurred multiple times throughout the Late zzso 

The reconstructed zzso history of brown and polar bears has two striking zzso First, it is punctuated by dramatic and discrete zzso zzso zzso Second, opportunistic mating between these two species as their ranges overlapped has left a strong genetic zzso In particular, a likely genetic exchange with extinct Irish brown bears forms the origin of the modern polar bear zzso This suggests that zzso zzso not only may be more common than previously considered but may be a mechanism by which species deal with marginal zzso during periods of environmental zzso
