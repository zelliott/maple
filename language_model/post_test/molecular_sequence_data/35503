zzso required for normal development and fertility of males and zzso have vital roles in the zzso zzso brain, cardiovascular system, smooth muscle and zzso zzso function via the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso To zzso and zzso zzso activity in zzso we generated the transgenic zzso zzso expressing a zzso reporter gene under the control of activated zzso zzso In zzso imaging of zzso zzso activity revealed several strongly expressing zzso in the male mouse as expected and also in certain female zzso In males the zzso zzso seminal zzso and bone zzso all showed high zzso zzso In zzso strong activity was seen in the zzso zzso zzso tissue and zzso zzso In both sexes zzso expression and activity was also found in zzso zzso the eye (and associated zzso zzso zzso zzso and, notably, regions of the zzso zzso protein expression was found in the same cell layers as zzso zzso zzso Additionally, mouse zzso expression and activity correlated well with zzso expression in human zzso The zzso zzso reduced zzso signal in all zzso Our model demonstrates that zzso can act in these zzso directly via zzso rather than exclusively via zzso zzso to zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Additionally, it visually demonstrates the fundamental importance of zzso zzso outside the normal role in the zzso zzso This model represents an important tool for zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso and for characterization of known and novel zzso or zzso zzso
