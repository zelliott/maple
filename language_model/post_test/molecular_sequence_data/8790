B zzso and zzso are considered to be derived from separate lineages and to have specialized zzso However, some zzso B zzso can generate descendants with zzso properties and zzso B cells are described in certain zzso In this report, we demonstrate that normal zzso cells can be isolated by zzso mouse zzso zzso or their zzso media with zzso zzso B zzso zzso vascular cells were isolated that simultaneously displayed typical B cell zzso surface zzso surface zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso markers and contained rearranged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of these zzso cells in a zzso manner, indicating that functional zzso was zzso The adherent zzso cells also displayed zzso and zzso and were sensitive to zzso radiation, consistent with having a B cell zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso lines of zzso cells can be zzso for months in zzso The ability to derive these zzso cells from normal sources suggests that certain B zzso and zzso share a closer lineage relationship than is predicted by current models of zzso zzso zzso these zzso cells may represent a primitive B zzso lineage that possesses greater flexibility to adapt to infectious agents than dedicated zzso or zzso cells and may be prone to zzso zzso
