Two types of zzso each zzso a different zzso of striped bass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso were cloned by screening a striped bass zzso zzso zzso The zzso used for screening the library were cloned zzso fragments, generated by zzso amplification of zzso zzso obtained from two zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso beta and zzso beta are zzso zzso and 580 bases long, zzso peptides of zzso 120 and 147 zzso acids zzso zzso bass zzso beta and zzso beta share a sequence identity of zzso at the zzso acid level, and zzso at the zzso acid zzso A cluster analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso beta is more closely related to zzso zzso than to zzso Administration of zzso hormone analogue zzso to juvenile striped resulted in zzso two- and fivefold increases in the expression of the zzso zzso beta and zzso beta zzso These results suggest that each of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso and further corroborate the functional duality of zzso zzso
