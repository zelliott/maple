The DNA sequence of a zzso zzso zzso located in the internal and terminal zzso repeat sequences of the zzso virus zzso determined in this study closes a gap between the previously described genes for the zzso and zzso zzso The novel sequence contains no zzso zzso open reading zzso Northern zzso and zzso analyses revealed a viral zzso transcript of zzso zzso which is spliced by the removal of two small zzso close to its zzso end and which presumably represents the zzso of the downstream open reading frame zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the transcribed region, an imperfect set of three directly repeated sequences was zzso Each of them contains a complementary pair of the zzso zzso protein recognition motif zzso spaced by zzso zzso In zzso studies confirmed that the DNA zzso zzso includes a functional origin of viral DNA zzso
