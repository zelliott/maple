zzso I is an zzso zzso zzso type II membrane zzso that zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso To identify sequence motifs responsible for zzso zzso we prepared a protein zzso by transferring the zzso and zzso domain of zzso I to the zzso domain of zzso The zzso hybrid was zzso in zzso 1 cells as an zzso protein that displayed zzso activity, excluding the possibility that the zzso zzso zzso interfere with folding of the zzso zzso zzso After substitution of the zzso in position 7, 8, or 9 relative to the zzso by zzso the zzso zzso were transported to the cell surface indicating that the zzso sequence functions as an zzso zzso Cell surface expression was also observed after substitution of zzso or zzso but not zzso in zzso by either zzso or zzso Thus the side chain structure, including its positive charge, appears to be essential for signal zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso suggests that the zzso sequence mediates zzso zzso through zzso retrograde zzso zzso I remained localized in the zzso after zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in contrast to comparable zzso zzso zzso zzso was also observed with an zzso zzso consisting of the zzso and zzso domain of zzso and the zzso I zzso zzso zzso targeting information must therefore be provided by sequence motifs contained within the zzso I zzso zzso This structural information appears to direct zzso zzso by retention rather than by zzso as concluded from zzso zzso being the major zzso released from the zzso zzso
