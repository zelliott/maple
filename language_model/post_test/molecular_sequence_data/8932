zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins are predominately zzso and are involved in zzso and zzso gene regulatory functions as well as DNA zzso zzso proteins influence a wide gamut of biological zzso including the regulation of zzso rhythm, zzso and progression of zzso Additionally, zzso zzso proteins associate with the architectural long zzso zzso zzso zzso to form zzso zzso bodies that alter gene expression via the nuclear retention of zzso Here we describe the crystal structure of the zzso of the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso These proteins form an extensively intertwined zzso consistent with the observation that the different zzso proteins are typically zzso from zzso cells, and suggesting that they act as zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a right-handed zzso zzso that positions two of four zzso recognition motif zzso in an unprecedented arrangement on either side of a zzso zzso This zzso is supported by a zzso interaction involving the zzso domain, which is characteristic of the zzso zzso By examining various zzso and zzso in cell culture, we find that zzso proteins require an additional zzso zzso emanating from either end of the zzso for zzso zzso body zzso These results suggest that zzso may potentially form through zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso
