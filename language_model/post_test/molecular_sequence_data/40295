zzso interactions dictate many processes crucial to protein function including zzso zzso interactions with other zzso and zzso zzso Here we examine the effect of surface zzso on zzso zzso zzso of designed zzso proteins by incorporation of zzso or zzso acid enables systematic examination of the effects of zzso volume and zzso on zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we find that fluorinated side chains exert zzso drag on neighboring water zzso slowing water motion at the protein zzso
