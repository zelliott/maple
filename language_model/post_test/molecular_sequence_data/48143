At synaptic zzso specialized zzso structures occur in both zzso and zzso zzso Most zzso zzso contain zzso membrane structures, often referred to as active zones, which function in zzso zzso and zzso The components of those active zones and how they are formed are largely zzso We report here that a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso (for zzso gene causes a diffused zzso of several zzso proteins and of a zzso membrane associated green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the active zones of zzso zzso were significantly zzso whereas the total number of zzso per zzso and the number of zzso at the prominent active zones were comparable to those in zzso zzso zzso transmission is partially impaired in zzso zzso zzso encodes a member of the zzso (for zzso zzso family of proteins which interact with zzso (for zzso common zzso zzso zzso proteins with zzso zzso activity zzso zzso protein is localized at zzso zzso independently of the presence of zzso and functions cell zzso We propose that zzso regulates the differentiation of zzso zzso in particular the formation of the active zone, by acting as an zzso anchor for zzso zzso at synaptic zzso
