Four gelatin zzso zzso were partially zzso from culture media of zzso zzso zzso by sequential zzso on columns of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso The molecular mass of each of these zzso estimated by relative mobility on zzso zzso was 50 zzso zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso zzso approximately 160 zzso zzso zzso and zzso 300 zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso also differed with respect to charge zzso zzso profile and zzso zzso zzso pools zzso and zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso pool zzso was also inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso pool zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso was not inhibited by either of these zzso The detailed zzso specificity of these zzso was checked by using zzso zzso synthetic peptides and native zzso zzso zzso was very active in degrading zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso third component of complement zzso serum zzso zzso and zzso is directly zzso to zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso and complement zzso component were also zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides insulin B chain, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso Based on zzso analysis zzso showed preferential zzso at zzso or neutral zzso zzso zzso was active towards zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso position and zzso synthetic peptides zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso
