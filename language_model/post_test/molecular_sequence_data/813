zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso through establishment of an zzso replication zzso This process is zzso by bacterial zzso zzso into the host cell via the zzso type IV zzso zzso Most of the zzso identified so far are unique to zzso zzso however, some of the zzso are zzso to zzso zzso We performed a distribution analysis of many known zzso zzso zzso and found that several of them, mostly zzso zzso zzso are present in different zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that it was most likely acquired from a zzso zzso early during zzso zzso The zzso protein was found to zzso into host cells using a zzso zzso domain absent in its zzso zzso zzso was found to complement the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and this zzso depended on evolutionary zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, unlike the zzso zzso that zzso to the zzso zzso zzso was found to be targeted mainly to host cell zzso zzso our results demonstrate the remarkable adaptations of a zzso protein to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
