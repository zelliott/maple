Despite being zzso in the zzso without a leader zzso the soluble zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Channel 4, or zzso a structural zzso of zzso zzso zzso into zzso to form an integral membrane protein with zzso channel zzso A predicted zzso domain zzso near the zzso of zzso could mediate membrane zzso and contribute to zzso zzso with minimal reorganization of the soluble protein zzso We tested this idea by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and cholesterol, recording zzso channels with a maximum zzso of approximately 15 zzso in zzso under both zzso and reducing zzso The channels zzso poorly between zzso and zzso incompatible with the current zzso zzso and their zzso was modified by the trans zzso or zzso zzso potential, as previously observed for zzso We then zzso a truncated version of the zzso limited to the first 61 zzso containing the predicted zzso This included a single trans zzso zzso in the putative zzso zzso at the external entrance to the zzso The truncated protein formed zzso channels with a reduced zzso but they retained their zzso sensitivity, and could still be blocked or zzso by trans (not zzso zzso zzso zzso We suggest that zzso containing the putative zzso are essential components of the zzso zzso However, the pore is inherently zzso and any zzso selectivity in zzso (and other membrane zzso may be attributable to other regions of the zzso including the channel zzso
