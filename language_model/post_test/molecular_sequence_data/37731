The ability of organisms to acquire zzso to normally lethal high temperatures is an ancient and zzso zzso zzso However, knowledge of cellular factors essential to this response is zzso Acquisition of zzso is likely to be of particular importance to plants that experience daily temperature fluctuations and are unable to escape to more favorable zzso We developed a screen, based on zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso that are unable to acquire zzso to zzso stress and have defined four separate genetic zzso zzso required for this zzso zzso was found to have a zzso in the heat shock protein 101 zzso zzso converting a zzso zzso zzso in the second zzso domain to a zzso zzso a zzso that is predicted to compromise zzso zzso zzso In addition to exhibiting a zzso zzso as zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also unable to acquire zzso and zzso seeds had greatly reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso plants by transformation with zzso zzso zzso DNA restored zzso plants to the zzso zzso The hot zzso are the first zzso defective in zzso that have been isolated in a higher zzso and zzso represents the first zzso in an zzso in any higher zzso The zzso of zzso also provides direct evidence that zzso which is required for zzso in bacteria and zzso is also essential for zzso in a complex zzso
