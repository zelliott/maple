Using a quantitative zzso zzso method, we have identified a third zzso zzso zzso zzso variable zzso region zzso V beta 9, that engenders recognition of zzso gene zzso V beta zzso T cells are zzso deleted from the periphery of mice that carry the zzso zzso and the fine specificity of V beta zzso zzso suggests that V beta zzso V beta zzso and V beta zzso zzso receptors may recognize a similar zzso zzso zzso of these three protein sequences identifies two zzso that may be important in determining this recognition zzso
