Among zzso zzso are defined as zzso adapted to live and thrive in diverse extreme saline zzso These zzso zzso constitute the source of a number of zzso with great zzso zzso The interest to use zzso from zzso in industrial applications is their resistance to organic zzso and extreme zzso zzso zzso zzso is a moderately zzso zzso isolated previously from a saline habitat in South Spain, showing zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso designated zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso is a protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso and high identity to class C zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso The temperature for its zzso activity was zzso and the pH optimum determined at zzso was zzso showing optimal activity without sodium zzso while maintaining zzso activity in a wide range of zzso zzso This zzso exhibited high activity against zzso length zzso chain zzso although it also zzso olive oil and fish zzso The fish oil zzso using zzso results in an enrichment of free zzso acid zzso but not zzso acid zzso relative to its levels present in fish zzso For improving the stability and to be used in industrial processes zzso was immobilized in different zzso The immobilized derivatives zzso zzso were highly selective towards the release of zzso versus zzso The zzso is also active towards different zzso and zzso zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso zzso showed that the zzso had remarkable activity and stability in all organic zzso zzso 

In this study we isolated, zzso zzso characterized and immobilized a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso which constitutes an zzso with excellent properties to be used in the food industry, in the enrichment in omega-3 zzso
