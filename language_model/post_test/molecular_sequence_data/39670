Large zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels regulate important zzso processes such as neurotransmitter release and vascular zzso zzso channels possess a zzso sensor mainly represented by the zzso zzso zzso Changes in membrane potential zzso the zzso zzso producing a zzso change that leads to channel zzso By zzso fluorescent labeling of zzso in the zzso region and by using zzso clamp zzso we have resolved the zzso changes the channel zzso during zzso The zzso dependence of these zzso changes zzso as changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso always preceded the channel zzso curves, as expected for protein zzso associated to the movement of the zzso zzso Extremely slow zzso changes were revealed by fluorescent labeling of position 202, zzso by a mutual interaction of the zzso with the adjacent zzso zzso
