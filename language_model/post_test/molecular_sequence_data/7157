zzso results from the zzso of multiple genetic zzso that disrupt the control mechanisms of normal growth and zzso The use of zzso mouse strains that develop leukemia has greatly facilitated the identification of genes that contribute to the zzso transformation of zzso zzso zzso mice develop zzso leukemia as a result of the expression of an zzso zzso leukemia virus that acts as an zzso zzso to alter the expression of cellular zzso We report the isolation of a new zzso zzso that serves as a site of viral integration in zzso of the tumors arising in zzso zzso zzso was mapped to a distinct location on zzso mouse zzso 11, suggesting that it represents a novel zzso Analysis of zzso cell hybrids segregating human zzso allowed zzso of zzso to human zzso zzso in a region known to contain zzso found in human zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that a zzso probe detected a zzso zzso present in all zzso tumors, whereas tumors containing zzso at the zzso locus expressed an additional truncated zzso A zzso zzso clone that zzso a novel member of the zzso gene family was zzso The zzso of zzso is most closely related to those of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso functions in a similar fashion by cooperative binding to a distinct subset of zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that altered expression of the zzso gene zzso may be one of the events that lead to tumor formation in zzso zzso
