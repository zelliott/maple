DNA sequencing and zzso disruption experiments indicate that the genes zzso and zzso which code for the two zzso specific zzso branching zzso of zzso zzso zzso each form part of larger duplicated zzso consisting of at least four genes in the order zzso The sequences of the zzso proteins are zzso identical zzso zzso to that of an zzso that converts zzso into zzso in zzso a zzso related zzso and the zzso proteins show zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of each zzso have zzso specific effects on the nature of zzso deposits, as assessed by electron zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso from it, is a gene zzso that encodes a protein resembling zzso zzso from zzso zzso and a zzso in zzso zzso These three proteins form a distinctive zzso compared with zzso zzso from most other bacteria, which more closely resemble the zzso from zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and separated from the zzso gene by two very small zzso is a gene zzso zzso a probable zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that most of these gene products participate in the zzso modulated zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso forms of zzso both metabolically active zzso zzso generated by zzso zzso and metabolically zzso but zzso significant zzso
