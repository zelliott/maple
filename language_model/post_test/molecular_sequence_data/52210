The zzso pair human tumor necrosis factor zzso alpha promoter region was fused to the zzso zzso reporter gene and studied in a transient zzso system in three zzso producing cell lines, the zzso zzso cell line, the zzso 144 T cell line, and the zzso B cell zzso This full length promoter construct can be induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso in each of these cell zzso Analysis of a series of zzso showed several zzso of zzso and zzso induced activity suggesting the presence of several positive and negative regulatory zzso A zzso responsive element was localized to a region between zzso and zzso zzso relative to the zzso start zzso Within this region, single zzso and zzso consensus sequences were zzso These zzso and zzso sites were each modified with a double point zzso A modest zzso reduction in zzso promoter activity was observed with the zzso site zzso However, zzso of the zzso site markedly diminished both the zzso and zzso promoter zzso Also zzso of the zzso promoter construct with an zzso expression zzso resulted in zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso
