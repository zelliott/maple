zzso regularly zzso short zzso repeats zzso of approximately 10,000 base pairs zzso in zzso were shown to occur in the Japanese zzso zzso strain, zzso The locus was composed of the putative zzso with 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a leader region, 13 zzso consensus sequence repeats (each 32 zzso zzso These were in turn separated by 12 non repetitive unique zzso regions of similar zzso In addition, a leader region, a zzso zzso a leader region, and zzso were also zzso All seven putative open reading frames carry their zzso binding zzso zzso consensus sequences at the zzso and zzso regions and putative intrinsic zzso zzso zzso regions also zzso A possible long overlap of 170 zzso in length occurred between the zzso and zzso zzso Positive reverse zzso zzso signals of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso A putative secondary structure of the zzso consensus repeats was zzso Following this, zzso results of the zzso zzso zzso isolate were subsequently compared with those from the zzso zzso zzso zzso
