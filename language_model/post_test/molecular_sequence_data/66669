The zzso zzso zzso is one of the most infectious human zzso and the highly virulent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and less virulent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are most commonly associated with significant disease in humans and zzso Here we report the complete zzso sequence and zzso for a zzso type B strain zzso isolated from a dead beaver found near Red Rock, zzso in zzso A comparison of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso highlighted genetic differences that may zzso different zzso zzso and the evolutionary relationship between type A and type B zzso Despite extensive DNA sequence identity, the most significant difference between type A and type B zzso is the striking amount of zzso zzso that exists between the zzso All but two zzso can be attributed to zzso zzso occurring between two prominent zzso zzso zzso and zzso Numerous zzso have been found in the zzso and are likely contributors to the difference in zzso between the zzso In contrast, no zzso have been observed between the zzso zzso and the zzso of the type B live vaccine strain zzso and only zzso zzso have been found within zzso sequences whose zzso are intact in zzso zzso differences between the two strains likely include the zzso attenuating zzso
