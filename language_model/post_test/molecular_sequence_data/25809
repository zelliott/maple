Mice bearing the zzso zzso have five zzso genes and zzso express the zzso zzso To understand the structure and evolution of the five zzso genes of the zzso zzso we have determined zzso sequences of the zzso end region of these zzso A zzso hybrid nature was confirmed for three of five zzso genes as predicted previously by restriction zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso regions of these three hybrid genes showed close similarity to that of the C4 zzso while the 3' side of the ninth zzso of the three hybrid genes showed close similarity to that of the zzso zzso In contrast, the regions between the first zzso and the middle of the ninth zzso of the three hybrid genes showed a mosaic structure of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the boundaries of the zzso and zzso sequences were quite different among the three hybrid zzso The pattern of zzso sequence diversity in this region among the five zzso sequences could be mainly explained not by point zzso but by gene zzso or unequal zzso These results suggest that multiple genetic zzso events between two zzso sequences played an important role in the generation and diversification of the extra copies of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso
