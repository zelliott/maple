A zzso zzso and zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a tidal flat in zzso Republic of zzso A zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso formed a lineage within the zzso zzso and exhibited highest sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso The major fatty acids of strain zzso were zzso and summed feature 3 zzso zzso and/or zzso The major respiratory zzso was zzso The major polar lipids were zzso and five unidentified polar zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of zzso zzso is also zzso
