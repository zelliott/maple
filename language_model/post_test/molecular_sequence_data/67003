The sequence of the zzso factor zzso of canine zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the predicted zzso zzso zzso acid sequence with other zzso zzso reveals a core region of similarity with divergent zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso infected cell protein 4 promoter region identified a region containing nine copies of a 52 zzso repeat that showed significant zzso of zzso by zzso This region contained an imperfect zzso zzso the binding site for zzso zzso virus 1 zzso with an imperfect zzso binding site immediately zzso The infectious zzso virus zzso was also shown to zzso zzso through this region of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA failed to yield infectious virus in canine kidney cell zzso zzso of zzso DNA and an zzso expression zzso resulted in virus zzso indicating a potential essential role for zzso in zzso zzso
