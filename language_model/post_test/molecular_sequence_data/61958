zzso are potent regulators of cell zzso cell zzso and zzso and are important therapeutic agents in zzso and zzso The gene regulatory activity of zzso zzso is zzso primarily by zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso from zzso precursors in a broad range of zzso and act as zzso for nuclear zzso acid zzso The zzso of zzso acid zzso is an important mechanism of controlling zzso levels in cell and zzso We have previously identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso named zzso and zzso which were shown to be responsible for zzso of zzso both in the zzso and the zzso In this report, we describe the zzso molecular zzso and zzso characterization of a third member of the zzso family, named zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso convert zzso to polar zzso zzso similar to those generated by zzso and zzso Competition studies with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso acid demonstrated that zzso was the preferred zzso for zzso Although zzso shares extensive sequence similarity with zzso and zzso its zzso activity appears distinct from those of other zzso family zzso Specifically, zzso can also recognize and metabolize zzso and is much less sensitive than the other zzso family members to the zzso effects of zzso zzso is not widely expressed in the adult but is zzso by zzso in zzso transformed human zzso cell zzso This third zzso member may play a specific role in zzso both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso
