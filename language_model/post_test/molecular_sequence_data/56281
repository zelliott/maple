To investigate a possible role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso we designed two zzso zzso zzso called zzso and zzso In these zzso derivatives the natural zzso domain of zzso was replaced by the zzso zzso domain of the zzso virus zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso Chick zzso zzso chronically infected with zzso expressing zzso zzso or zzso are zzso zzso with each construction results in sustained growth in low serum and development of colonies from single cells in zzso with similar zzso In contrast to zzso zzso and zzso zzso additional zzso zzso related to in zzso transformation including a condensed cell zzso and ability to develop highly zzso fast growing colonies in zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso can transform chick zzso zzso and activate cellular functions which influence cell zzso and invasive potential in zzso These findings are consistent with the notion that cellular transformation by zzso is zzso by zzso zzso
