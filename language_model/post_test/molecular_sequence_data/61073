Previous studies showed that zzso and 3- and zzso are oxidized by some bacteria to yield their corresponding zzso which were not subsequently zzso In this study, a zzso zzso was isolated, which grew on each of these three zzso as its sole zzso zzso and energy zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequencing and scanning electron zzso the isolate was found to belong to the zzso zzso and assigned the strain designation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were more readily zzso than zzso zzso and growth on these three compounds resulted in the release of 57, 62, and zzso of the zzso carbon as zzso zzso The zzso ring was also zzso and between 44 and zzso of the sulfur from the consumed zzso was found as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso grew on zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, but it could not grow on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso or 3- or zzso In addition, it did not zzso the latter three compounds to their zzso
