The cells of the second heart field zzso contribute to the zzso tract and right zzso as well as to parts of the left zzso and zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso factor family, is expressed early in this cardiac zzso population and functions near the top of a zzso zzso essential for heart zzso zzso is required for the survival and migration of zzso cells into the early developing heart at the inflow and zzso zzso Despite this important role for zzso in early heart formation, the zzso regulation of zzso has remained largely zzso zzso to identify zzso factors that regulate zzso expression in zzso we screened the zzso zzso sequences from the mouse zzso locus for zzso activity in transgenic mouse zzso Here, we report the identification of an zzso from the mouse zzso gene that is sufficient to direct expression to the zzso and its zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains three consensus zzso zzso factor binding sites that are efficiently and specifically bound by zzso zzso zzso zzso the activity of the zzso is dependent on these three zzso binding sites in transgenic mouse zzso Thus, these studies demonstrate that zzso is a direct zzso target of zzso zzso factors in the zzso and establish a zzso zzso upstream of zzso in the zzso
