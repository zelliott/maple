zzso genes are regulators of zzso zzso and play important roles in controlling the expression patterns of cell zzso molecules zzso To identify proteins that bind to a regulatory element common to the genes for two neural zzso zzso and zzso we screened a mouse zzso expression library with a zzso of the sequence zzso and found a new zzso zzso which we have called zzso The zzso zzso by zzso is zzso identical to that of zzso and both genes are related to genes at the Bar locus of zzso zzso zzso and zzso also zzso an identical stretch of 17 zzso downstream of the zzso otherwise, they share no appreciable zzso In zzso zzso zzso activity of an zzso promoter construct containing the zzso motif but zzso activity when this sequence was zzso zzso studies showed that expression of zzso and zzso overlap in the nervous system, particularly in the zzso spinal cord, and zzso root zzso zzso was also prominently expressed in the floor plate and in zzso zzso During zzso development, zzso and zzso showed complementary patterns of expression: whereas zzso appeared in the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso was observed in the zzso lining of these zzso zzso expression of zzso was observed in small groups of cells undergoing tissue zzso such as zzso cells within zzso surrounding the eye and zzso groove and in the first zzso pouch, lung zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso The zzso data, combined with zzso dual function as zzso and zzso suggest that zzso may zzso control the expression of zzso and other target genes during embryonic zzso
