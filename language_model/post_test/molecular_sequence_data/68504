A large body of evidence indicates that the genetic program of aging has zzso with the sexual mode of reproduction zzso zzso and Barton, zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso changes in target cell sensitivity to zzso hormones can be considered part of this evolutionary zzso Here we describe a novel regulatory element in the rat zzso zzso zzso gene promoter associated with its zzso expression in the zzso This element consists of two (19 and 25 base zzso zzso sites, one specifically binding an zzso Factor zzso and the other an Associated Factor zzso Both deletion and point zzso of the zzso site result in about a zzso decline in the zzso promoter zzso Unlike zzso which is relatively tissue specific, zzso appears to be zzso The ubiquitous and zzso zzso nature of zzso suggests a fundamental role of this novel zzso factor in programmed gene zzso
