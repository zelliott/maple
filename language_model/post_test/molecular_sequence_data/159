zzso engineered zzso have an extraordinary capacity to accumulate zzso zzso We have investigated in tobacco zzso zzso the possible consequences of such additional products on several parameters of plant development and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed that express abundantly either bacterial zzso alkaline zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or a green fluorescent protein zzso In leaves, the zzso and zzso zzso proteins are the major zzso and accumulate to higher levels than zzso Nevertheless, these engineered zzso sinks do not cause a measurable difference in growth rate or zzso zzso The total zzso acid content of transgenic leaves is also not significantly affected, showing that plant cells have a limited protein zzso zzso zzso products are made at the expense of resident zzso zzso which constitutes the major leaf zzso acid store, is the most clearly and strongly zzso plant zzso This reduction is even more dramatic under conditions of limited nitrogen supply, whereas zzso proteins accumulate to even higher relative zzso These changes are regulated zzso since transcript levels of resident zzso genes are not zzso Our results show that plants are able to produce massive amounts of zzso proteins in zzso without profound zzso zzso and that zzso acting as a nitrogen zzso is a key player in maintaining zzso and limiting zzso zzso
