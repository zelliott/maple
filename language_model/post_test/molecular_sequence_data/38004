To better understand a role of the zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso transmission and disease zzso we determined the zzso zzso within several groups of zzso zzso of DNA from each subject was achieved with zzso chain reaction, using the zzso specific primer pair, which zzso the 32 zzso zzso The zzso zzso coding sequences of zzso were examined to see the possible effects of zzso zzso All of the 339 healthy, zzso individuals had no zzso in the zzso zzso All of the 115 zzso patients including 11 long-term zzso zzso and 18 zzso spouses were also wild zzso No variation in the zzso zzso coding sequence was found in 5 zzso and 5 zzso zzso In conclusion, the 32 zzso deletion zzso is rarely present in zzso Our data suggest that factors other than the zzso coding sequences may also play a role in the resistance to zzso zzso
