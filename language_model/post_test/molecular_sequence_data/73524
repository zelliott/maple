The zzso complex zzso containing zzso which is essential for zzso zzso I zzso transcription, has been analyzed in zzso zzso It was zzso based on association of component zzso with zzso zzso To enable this analysis, a strain of zzso zzso was created where the only functional zzso coding sequences were those of zzso zzso zzso I zzso components were zzso from this strain and the zzso zzso were subsequently zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso An assessment of the activity of this candidate zzso complex was undertaken zzso This zzso zzso zzso complex displays two activities in zzso zzso initiation of an zzso zzso zzso gene promoter zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso it both blocks an incorrect zzso start site at zzso and directs initiation at the correct site for zzso zzso zzso zzso This complex is essential for accurate initiation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis is zzso when this zzso zzso complex is combined with a zzso fraction zzso of zzso
