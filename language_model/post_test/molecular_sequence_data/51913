The zzso or zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso expresses its zzso zzso zzso zzso over zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso cells that harbor plasmids with zzso zzso are zzso zzso It was found that the zzso zzso is zzso and such cells eventually switch to the zzso zzso zzso especially when the zzso gene was cloned on zzso zzso zzso It seemed that the zzso gene cloned on zzso plasmids was toxic to zzso coli host cells and, during prolonged zzso plasmids with an zzso zzso zzso mostly carrying zzso sequence zzso such as zzso zzso and gamma zzso were zzso The instability of the zzso gene was particularly enhanced when the zzso zzso in the middle of zzso protein was replaced by zzso suggesting enhanced toxicity of the altered zzso Since the zzso gene was zzso maintained throughout zzso 100 cell zzso when its expression was zzso most probably it is the gene product rather than the zzso sequence itself that is responsible for the instability of zzso gene on zzso zzso To improve the stability of the zzso zzso the previously reported zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance, zzso zzso on zzso and zzso host bacteria, and has multiple cloning sites within the coding region of synthetic zzso zzso When zzso DNA was prepared from zzso and zzso cells grown in zzso medium with zzso and zzso less than zzso plasmids failed to enforce zzso on zzso and zzso cells in zzso medium with zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
