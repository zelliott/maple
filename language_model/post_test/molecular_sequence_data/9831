B cells are susceptible to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that blocking the interactions between zzso function associated zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso completely suppresses zzso B cell zzso zzso to zzso and zzso partially suppress B cell zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso have no zzso Also, B cells from zzso mice are resistant to zzso T zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso interactions are crucial for zzso zzso B cell zzso and may contribute to the maintenance of B cell zzso in zzso
