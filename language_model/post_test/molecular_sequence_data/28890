For this study, we isolated zzso zzso from wastewater by a series of steps beginning with zzso separation and cell zzso After Gram zzso and three standard microbial tests, the zzso zzso sequences of a total of 23 out of 37 putative zzso zzso zzso were verified by zzso Eleven zzso zzso zzso were zzso and fell into four zzso zzso those with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso Most zzso zzso zzso were of the zzso zzso type, which has been shown to be associated with advanced diseases based on zzso of zzso zzso from gastric cancer zzso These results demonstrated that zzso zzso survives in water and may be a potential source of zzso zzso transmission, especially where water is not adequately zzso
