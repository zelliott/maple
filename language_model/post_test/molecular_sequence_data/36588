zzso zzso zzso is induced in adult rabbits by treatment with alcohol, zzso and a variety of other agents, as shown earlier in this laboratory, but it is not known whether the highly zzso zzso zzso is similarly zzso In this study, the effects of zzso on zzso expression were examined in zzso zzso in which zzso is not zzso Treatment of the animals with zzso on days 8 through 11 after birth caused a zzso increase in the content of total zzso in liver zzso In contrast, the zzso content of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was not zzso zzso analysis revealed a significant increase in the level of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The rates of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso were similarly increased from zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, to zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, by zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are not increased by zzso treatment and that zzso zzso is not zzso in either zzso or zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
