The insect zzso is the primary site for food zzso as well as for zzso pathogen infection into the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this critical insect organ are targets for zzso vaccines, zzso zzso and zzso zzso We used zzso proteins of the African malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso to select zzso human zzso fragments zzso from a zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso selection method on zzso zzso we selected an unusual truncated zzso zzso consisting of a zzso only, which binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso This clone binds a spectrum of zzso zzso from the zzso and other zzso zzso as well as various zzso zzso but binding was reduced when these zzso were zzso zzso We also observed that this clone zzso binds the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso binding by our selected zzso was limited by competition with increasing zzso of certain soluble zzso most dramatically by zzso and zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso zzso of this zzso is a zzso zzso This paper describes a zzso selection of zzso fragments on zzso zzso tissue and it also describes a method for zzso selection on zzso zzso zzso These selection methods resulted in the isolation of a novel, zzso zzso human zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso
