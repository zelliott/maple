In zzso zzso zzso is essential for viability and plays an important role in zzso and organization of cell zzso zzso of the zzso anchor zzso is zzso by the zzso complex zzso The zzso zzso gene is thought to zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso little is known about the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study, the zzso gene was identified as the zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso an opportunistic zzso zzso By replacement of the zzso gene with a zzso zzso we obtained the zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso exhibited a significant increased cell zzso instead of zzso or conditional lethal zzso associated to the zzso zzso of zzso they could survive at temperatures from 30 degrees C to 50 degrees zzso The analysis of the zzso showed that a completely blocking of the zzso anchor synthesis in zzso zzso led to cell wall zzso abnormal zzso growth, rapid zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that the zzso exhibited a reduced zzso in zzso zzso The zzso anchor was not essential for zzso but required for the cell wall integrity, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
