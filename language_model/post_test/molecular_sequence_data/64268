zzso molecular interactions between human zzso and zzso zzso is important for the future success of zzso zzso Here we describe the analysis of pig zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso generated from pig lung zzso contained an open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso protein with six potential zzso zzso zzso The mature protein sequence was zzso identical to human zzso with conservation of five out of six zzso critical for binding of the human protein to its zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis identified zzso transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso in cultured pig zzso cells and zzso was detected in pig zzso zzso zzso liver and heart by zzso The gene structure and zzso expression of pig zzso were zzso similar to those of its human and mouse zzso However, unlike human zzso expression of pig zzso on cultured zzso cells was not zzso by treatment with the inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso Pig zzso expressed on stable zzso supported firm zzso of cells expressing human zzso This conservation of function across the species barrier suggests that pig zzso plays a role in the cellular interactions associated with zzso zzso
