The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso Several important zzso in the active site either become zzso or adopt very different zzso compared to their zzso zzso These include the zzso A motif zzso that is essential for zzso recognition, a loop zzso that seems to control the communication between the zzso and zzso binding sites, the motif 2 loop zzso that binds zzso and the zzso domain that is likely to bind zzso These zzso structural changes are supported by zzso experiments, which also suggest highly cooperative zzso A dynamic and cooperative active site is most likely necessary for the proper functioning of the zzso zzso and suggests a novel mechanism for improving charging zzso
