The evolutionary origin of the zzso zzso zzso factor gene zzso zzso has long been enigmatic zzso to the failure in detecting zzso in other species and the unusual zzso zzso of the zzso paired domain zzso Based on the discovery of zzso zzso in representatives of zzso zzso we show that the origin of zzso predated zzso diversification and that the zzso experienced similar but independent zzso modifications in the lineages to sea urchins and zzso zzso conservation patterns further raise the possibility of zzso functionality in the zzso zzso of strongly modified zzso zzso Finally, we note that the evolutionary histories of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso which have been considered functional zzso are not zzso Taken together, these findings identify zzso zzso as the zzso member of an ancient zzso gene zzso and recommend abandoning its zzso as zzso zzso
