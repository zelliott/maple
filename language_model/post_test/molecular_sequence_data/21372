zzso of the zzso zzso is linked to the development of zzso plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's zzso While previous studies commonly show the zzso is largely zzso in solution, we show that zzso can adopt a zzso partially folded zzso In this structure zzso zzso zzso the central zzso region of the zzso forms a zzso zzso from zzso to zzso and the zzso and zzso collapse against the zzso due to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been predicted to be crucial zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the structure presented here presents a new target for investigation of early events in zzso zzso
