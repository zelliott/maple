The human zzso Large 1 zzso protein uses two of its three zzso zzso to interact with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso The zzso complex zzso the cell cycle progression from the zzso to the S phase, regulates zzso cell migration and zzso and is required for polarization of the zzso zzso However, the molecular details of how zzso recognizes zzso is not zzso In this study, we performed zzso and zzso zzso to investigate the interactions between zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso In addition, we determined the crystal structures of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso each in complex with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Our zzso zzso and structural results revealed structural elements and zzso on zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and on zzso crucial for their mutual zzso In particular, our results show that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso play important roles in contributing to the binding affinities between zzso zzso and zzso through interacting with the zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The results provide new insights into the binding mode of a defined zzso segment of zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso
