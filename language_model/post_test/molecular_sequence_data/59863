The zzso giant protein zzso zzso and zzso are composed predominantly of zzso and zzso zzso We report the crystal structures of two zzso zzso zzso fragments, one from zzso and a larger zzso from zzso zzso containing an additional zzso zzso zzso The structure of the longer zzso shows that the zzso domain contacts the protein zzso domain on the opposite side from the zzso zzso zzso exposing potential zzso binding zzso Together, the structures reveal the cooperative interactions between the zzso region and the zzso from the zzso domain involved in protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso loop, and explain the differences between the observed zzso mechanism and the one found in the structure of zzso zzso zzso
