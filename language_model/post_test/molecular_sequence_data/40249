zzso zzso sensors zzso probe membrane potential by zzso the zzso of zzso proteins to the movement of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence resonance energy zzso these two components zzso zzso changes into zzso changes, providing a signal for imaging electrical activity in genetically targeted zzso To improve zzso signals, we systematically varied the optical properties, membrane targeting zzso and linkages of fluorescent proteins to zzso the zzso zzso change zzso and zzso zzso The best results were obtained with zzso fluorescent protein zzso zzso with a zzso motif and zzso with a truncated zzso zzso With 100 zzso steps in zzso cells, this probe produced zzso zzso zzso (4 zzso zzso which was zzso greater than that obtained with the original zzso zzso zzso We also obtained a fivefold greater zzso ratio, which was zzso of a theoretical zzso We designate this zzso construct as zzso zzso With the aid of a theoretical analysis, we estimated that zzso zzso places its zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso performed well in cultured zzso zzso where single action zzso produced clear zzso changes in a single zzso This improved probe should help investigators image zzso in genetically targeted zzso
