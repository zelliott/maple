Studies are presented characterizing zzso zzso a protein expressed to high levels by zzso and belonging to a family of zzso zzso termed zzso zzso filaments originally were identified in zzso as essential for budding but have become increasingly associated with processes in higher zzso cells involving active membrane movement such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso proof of an in zzso function for zzso in higher zzso is limited to the characterization of the zzso zzso termed zzso We present studies identifying zzso zzso as a protein zzso zzso in the presence of known zzso zzso The zzso of zzso revealed it to be part of a zzso complex containing a protein involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was localized in zzso to areas surrounding zzso zzso The relevance of zzso to normal zzso function was established with the characterization of zzso from a zzso zzso As compared with zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and release stored zzso in the presence of zzso levels of zzso These results provide new insights into the mechanisms regulating zzso zzso and identify zzso zzso as a protein family contributing to membrane trafficking within the zzso and zzso
