A molecular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was derived using two nuclear sequences zzso zzso of the growth hormone zzso gene and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and one zzso gene zzso zzso A combined analysis produced a highly derived and zzso zzso hypothesis that differed from traditional zzso primarily in the placement of two zzso zzso traditionally included within the zzso zzso with guinea pigs and its relatives, is placed sister to the family zzso and closely aligned with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso within the zzso renders the familial zzso zzso Our data further support the zzso separation of the families zzso and zzso Both the molecular and traditional zzso interpretations are assessed in testing an ecological constraints hypothesis regarding social zzso Whereas traditional zzso is consistent with an environmental constraints explanation for social behavior, the molecular data suggest that zzso effects may be a more important factor in the evolution of social behavior in this zzso Although zzso rate zzso was identified in all three molecular data sets, no significant support was obtained for the zzso rate zzso However, both nuclear genes displayed patterns in accordance with the generation time zzso
