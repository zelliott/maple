A promoter with the potential to adopt a 50 zzso zzso zzso spanning from zzso to zzso has been constructed in the zzso zzso zzso resistance gene zzso by forming an zzso repeat from zzso zzso Compared to a control promoter, the sequence of this zzso promoter differs only by a 22 zzso zzso between zzso and zzso upstream from the usual location of promoter zzso The zzso is zzso in a zzso manner, and zzso from this promoter in zzso by zzso zzso decreases as the negative zzso density of the zzso DNA zzso In contrast, zzso from the control promoter increases with negative zzso Thus, DNA secondary structure in the zzso region can affect zzso zzso The zzso promoter zzso also influences expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso This apparently results when zzso of the zzso reduces the zzso of the zzso zzso to a level that is below the optimum for expression from the zzso promoter, illustrating one mechanism for how DNA secondary structure may effect zzso zzso from both promoters in zzso does not differ from controls, suggesting that this zzso is not generated to a significant extent zzso most probably as a result of the slow zzso of zzso
