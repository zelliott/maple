zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and zzso Its primary structure has been determined and correlated with the zzso structure recently established for this class from another zzso The protein is found to represent a constant class within a complex family of multiple zzso zzso segments that occur in different species correlate with zzso zzso in the same manner as in the case of the constant class of alcohol zzso zzso III zzso of another protein family, but distinct from the pattern of the corresponding variable zzso zzso in both these protein families, overall zzso and segment zzso behave similarly, with at least one zzso form in each case, class III in the case of alcohol zzso and at least class 2 in the case of zzso zzso
