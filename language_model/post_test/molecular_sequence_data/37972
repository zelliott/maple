zzso zzso G zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses to the zzso zzso complex of zzso zzso were examined by zzso zzso zzso using adult zzso patients and zzso and zzso zzso Twenty-five zzso from subjects with adult zzso zzso zzso and 25 zzso from healthy subjects zzso zzso were used for the zzso zzso and zzso plaque samples from 10 sites were collected from each patient at the time of clinical zzso The level of zzso zzso in the plaque samples was determined using a DNA zzso zzso significant positive associations between the percentage of sites positive for zzso zzso and measures of disease severity zzso pocket depth, mean attachment loss, and percentage of sites that bled on zzso were zzso The diseased group had significantly higher specific zzso responses to the zzso complex than did the control group, and the responses were significantly associated with mean probing depths and percentage of sites positive for zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso responses to the zzso complex revealed that the zzso distribution for both the diseased and control groups was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso response to the complex was positively correlated with mean probing depth, whereas the zzso response was zzso correlated with this measure of disease zzso zzso analysis of the zzso complex showed that zzso from healthy subjects and those with low levels of disease, with high zzso and low zzso responses, reacted with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, zzso from diseased subjects with low zzso and high zzso responses reacted only with the zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso mapping of the zzso zzso localized a major zzso recognized by zzso zzso in zzso from subjects with high zzso and low zzso responses to the zzso complex which was not recognized by zzso from diseased subjects with low zzso and high zzso zzso
