A general approach that combines mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility zzso and zzso for zzso zzso is zzso zzso as zzso Using this approach, zzso product zzso are dispersed in two dimensions, specifically zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the resulting zzso data display greatly zzso zzso mass zzso zzso acid sequence analysis, and determination of zzso protein zzso Also, this approach zzso some of the inherent limitations of zzso zzso zzso the limitations in dynamic range for zzso zzso zzso zzso to the number of fragmentation channels available to large zzso systems as well as the resulting spectral zzso For large peptides such as zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso + zzso zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso zzso yields zzso acid sequence coverage of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, whereas the hybrid zzso approach yields zzso acid sequence zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso For large zzso such as zzso zzso zzso the zzso acid sequence coverage increases from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso approach allows for greater depth of information by allowing the assignment and study of internal zzso zzso Lastly, analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso and single point zzso of human iron sulfur cluster U zzso zzso zzso demonstrates the ability of zzso to rapidly identify the presence and sites of zzso
