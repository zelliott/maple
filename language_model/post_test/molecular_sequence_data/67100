zzso cervical high-risk human zzso zzso infection is correlated with an increased risk of developing a high-grade cervical zzso zzso A zzso method was developed for detection and zzso of high-risk zzso DNA was zzso amplified by zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA was then zzso using DNA zzso zzso The current study evaluated the technical efficacy of zzso zzso DNA zzso for high-risk zzso zzso on 57 zzso and zzso cervical zzso The approach was evaluated for a broad range of zzso zzso high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells of high-grade zzso zzso zzso was also detected in six zzso zzso cells of zzso significance zzso zzso among them only one cervical zzso was found zzso associated with no zzso zzso The zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso detected 36 infections with a single high-risk zzso type and 5 multiple infections with several high-risk zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of the zzso DNA zzso zzso This approach could improve clinical management of patients with cervical zzso zzso
