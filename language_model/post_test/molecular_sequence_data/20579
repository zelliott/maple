We determined the complete zzso sequences of three plasmids that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso gel zzso United Kingdom zzso zzso A, C, and zzso of the internationally prevalent zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was a fusion of type zzso and zzso zzso and zzso the following 10 zzso resistance genes zzso resistance to eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belonged to zzso group zzso and carried seven zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all as in zzso It also carried zzso zzso zzso resistance, and was highly related to zzso a zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belonged to zzso group zzso and carried only two resistance zzso zzso and zzso It probably arose by the zzso of zzso and zzso elements into a zzso zzso We conclude that zzso United Kingdom zzso of the successful zzso coli zzso clone have acquired different plasmids zzso zzso zzso on separate occasions, zzso the zzso and zzso genes on zzso and zzso represent separate escape events, and zzso zzso plasmids harboring zzso have played a crucial role in the global spread of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
