It is generally assumed that new genes would arise by gene zzso mechanisms, because the signals for regulation and transcript processing would be unlikely to evolve in parallel with a new gene zzso We have identified here a transcript in the house mouse zzso zzso that has arisen within the past zzso million years in a large zzso zzso The region is present in many zzso including humans, allowing us to exclude the involvement of gene duplication, zzso zzso or other zzso zzso which are typically found for other cases of newly evolved zzso The gene has three zzso shows alternative zzso and is specifically expressed in zzso cells of the zzso The transcript is restricted to species within the zzso zzso and its emergence zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso regulatory region of the zzso A recent selective sweep is associated with the transcript region in zzso zzso zzso zzso A knockout in the laboratory strain zzso results in reduced zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso Our results show that cryptic signals for transcript regulation and processing exist in zzso regions and can become the basis for the evolution of a new functional zzso
