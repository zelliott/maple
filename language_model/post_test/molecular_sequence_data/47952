zzso regulation can occur at the level of initiation and zzso zzso We report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in the zzso cell line zzso harbors a paused zzso zzso II zzso zzso at a position between 45 and 89 zzso downstream of the zzso initiation zzso zzso an zzso of zzso B, activated zzso zzso gene zzso by increasing the zzso of pol zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso but not initiation and pausing of pol zzso A rearranged copy of the zzso zzso gene was introduced into zzso cells using an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was regulated by zzso and zzso like the zzso gene and established a paused pol II, whereas a construct with a deletion of the zzso zzso and the C region did not establish a paused pol zzso Two distinct functions can therefore be assigned to the deleted DNA zzso loading of pol II to its pause site and induction of zzso zzso upon zzso zzso It had been proposed that zzso zzso of zzso genes is connected to zzso The pause site of pol II described in this work resides upstream of the previously defined zzso boundary of zzso activity at zzso zzso zzso The possible role of pausing of pol II for zzso zzso is zzso
