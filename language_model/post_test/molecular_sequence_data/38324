Human zzso 6 zzso and zzso are closely related zzso that zzso a number of genes with no known counterparts in other zzso The product of one such gene is the zzso zzso zzso which is a major zzso component and a target for zzso zzso A zzso zzso clone from zzso was identified which contains a large open reading frame capable of zzso a predicted primary zzso product of zzso zzso acids (54 zzso with 13 zzso zzso and 9 potential zzso zzso zzso This putative zzso which we have termed zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and contained a single potential zzso domain located near its zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence with that of the viral zzso revealed that the gene zzso zzso contains eight zzso spanning almost 6 zzso of the viral zzso at the right zzso end of the zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso from zzso cells revealed that the zzso insert zzso to a single major zzso species of zzso zzso zzso raised against a zzso zzso form of zzso recognized a protein of roughly 65 zzso in zzso density zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso F reduced this zzso to a putative precursor of approximately 50 zzso zzso zzso also neutralized the zzso of zzso while matched zzso serum did not do zzso Finally, analysis of the zzso properties of zzso zzso revealed a specific interaction with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and not with closely related molecules such as zzso and zzso zzso At least two zzso of the protein were found to contribute to zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso zzso may contribute to viral attachment to cell surface zzso
