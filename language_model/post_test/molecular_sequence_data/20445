The zzso zzso zzso family of zzso is comprised of seven members, zzso zzso and the zzso 1 and zzso zzso was the last of the conventional zzso zzso to be identified, and in comparison to its siblings, much less is known about its molecular regulation and even less regarding its functional zzso The loss of zzso from zzso zzso has contributed significantly to this deficit in knowledge, but recent discoveries have narrowed the zzso There are many differences between zzso and the other zzso zzso including alternative zzso zzso regulation, zzso control mechanisms, tissue distribution, and zzso zzso The goal of this review is to outline recent advances in our knowledge of the genetic regulation, the molecular mechanisms governing its activity, and the functional significance of zzso in human physiology and zzso
