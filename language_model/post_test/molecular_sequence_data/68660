zzso peptides derived from the zzso zzso are zzso with zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso synthesis are zzso regulated during zzso We had previously found that chronic ethanol zzso resulted in decreased levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the current study investigated the effect of ethanol zzso on zzso zzso zzso A zzso probe was constructed from a zzso product amplified from mouse zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of the zzso product revealed that the sequence of the mouse zzso gene used to zzso the probe is highly zzso with high sequence similarity to corresponding regions of the gene in other zzso zzso In zzso zzso using the zzso probe showed a widespread distribution of zzso zzso in mouse zzso In dehydrated mice, zzso zzso was significantly increased in the zzso and nearly all other brain areas zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso was also significantly increased in zzso zzso and in most brain zzso In the same mice, measurement of zzso zzso zzso confirmed a significant zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso regulated in certain zzso
