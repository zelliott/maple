zzso zzso zzso from the extremely zzso zzso zzso was zzso over zzso to apparent zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso zzso had an apparent molecular mass of 35 zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso was zzso The zzso was found to be absolutely dependent on the presence of zzso or zzso zzso for zzso The ability of zzso to activate the zzso decreased in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not activate the zzso The dependence of activity on salt concentration showed a zzso zzso For zzso activity, 1 M zzso and zzso M zzso were zzso A detailed kinetic analysis revealed that zzso and zzso both affected the zzso rather than the zzso for zzso and zzso At the optimal salt concentration and at 65 degrees C, the zzso was zzso zzso (1 U zzso 1 zzso the zzso for zzso was 50 zzso and the zzso for zzso was 100 zzso At 90 degrees C, the temperature optimum of the zzso the zzso was about zzso higher than at 65 degrees zzso zzso as well as activity of zzso was dramatically increased in the presence of zzso zzso M being required for optimal zzso The efficiency of zzso in protecting zzso from heat zzso at 90 degrees C decreased in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso mechanism of zzso was determined to be of the zzso zzso The properties of the zzso from zzso zzso are compared with those of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
