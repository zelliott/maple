zzso tuberculosis heat shock protein zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates as the dominant protein in the zzso stationary phase of tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso zzso displays several characteristics of small heat shock proteins zzso its expression is increased in response to stress, it protects against protein zzso in zzso and it contains the core zzso domain found in all zzso In this study we characterized the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso in several different zzso and compared the results to those obtained with zzso human zzso a well characterized member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso to apparent zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity was enhanced by zzso zzso stabilized zzso zzso zzso against zzso by zzso and no effect was observed with zzso a zzso analog of zzso Increased expression of zzso zzso zzso resulted in protection against zzso killing in zzso coli at 48 degrees zzso While the sequence similarity between human zzso and zzso zzso zzso is only zzso these results suggest that the functional similarities between these proteins containing the core zzso domain are much zzso
