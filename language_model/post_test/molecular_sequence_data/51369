The effect of vitamin A zzso on zzso zzso of membrane zzso was studied in rat liver in order to evaluate the suggested role of zzso in protein zzso First, zzso of newly zzso zzso from rough zzso zzso of vitamin A deficient liver were compared with that of zzso zzso zzso were metabolically zzso with zzso released from the zzso with zzso zzso zzso by reversed phase zzso and zzso exchange zzso and were reduced with sodium zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso showed that the zzso carried mainly four zzso species, zzso zzso zzso and zzso in identical relative amounts in the vitamin A deficient and the control zzso In particular, no increase in the proportion of short chain zzso was noted in vitamin A deficient zzso Second, the number of zzso zzso was estimated in zzso IV zzso zzso a major zzso constituent of the zzso plasma zzso comparing the newly zzso zzso from rough zzso zzso and the mature form of zzso IV from the plasma zzso No evidence was obtained that zzso zzso caused incomplete zzso of this membrane zzso From these data, the suggested role of zzso as a zzso involved in the synthesis of zzso zzso of zzso must be zzso
