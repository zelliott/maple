The zzso of the influenza A virus is composed of eight different segments of zzso zzso These eight segments are incorporated into budding zzso in an zzso ratio through a mechanism that is not fully zzso Two different models have been proposed for packaging the viral zzso into newly assembling virus zzso the zzso model and the zzso zzso In the last few years, increasing evidence from many different laboratories that supports the zzso model has been zzso In particular, different groups have shown that some large viral zzso regions within the coding sequences at both the zzso and 3' ends of almost every segment are sufficient for packaging foreign zzso zzso If the packaging regions are crucial for the viability of the virus, we would expect them to be zzso Using large-scale analysis of influenza A virus zzso we developed a method of identifying zzso zzso regions whose conservation cannot be explained by population structure or zzso acid zzso Interestingly, the zzso sequences are located within the regions identified as important for efficient zzso By utilizing influenza virus reverse zzso we have rescued zzso viruses containing synonymous zzso within these highly zzso zzso Packaging of viral zzso in these viruses was analyzed by reverse zzso using a universal primer and quantitative zzso for individual zzso zzso this approach, we have identified regions in the zzso gene segments that, if zzso result in reductions of more than zzso in the packaging of that particular zzso viral zzso zzso in the level of packaging of a zzso viral zzso frequently resulted in reductions of other viral zzso as well, and the results form a pattern of hierarchy of segment zzso This work provides further evidence for a selective packaging mechanism for influenza A zzso demonstrating that these highly zzso regions are important for efficient zzso
