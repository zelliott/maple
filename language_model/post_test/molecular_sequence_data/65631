Liver cancer is the third most deadly zzso in the zzso Unfortunately, there is no effective zzso One of the major problems is that most zzso are diagnosed in the later stage, when surgical zzso is not zzso Thus, accurate early diagnosis would significantly improve the clinical outcome of liver zzso Currently, there are no effective molecular zzso to recognize zzso that are specific for liver zzso The objective of our current study is to identify liver cancer zzso molecular zzso that could be used for liver cancer recognition and zzso We applied a newly developed zzso zzso Evolution of zzso by zzso zzso method for the generation of molecular zzso for specific recognition of liver cancer zzso The zzso uses whole live cells as targets to select zzso zzso zzso for cell zzso In generating zzso for liver cancer recognition, two liver cell lines were zzso a liver cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso Both cell lines were originally derived from zzso zzso Through multiple rounds of selection using zzso as a control, we have identified a panel of zzso that specifically recognize the cancer cell line zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso We have also demonstrated that some of the selective zzso could specifically bind liver cancer cells in a mouse zzso There are two major new results zzso with our reported zzso zzso in addition to the generation of zzso specifically for liver zzso The first one is that our current study demonstrates that zzso zzso selection can select specific zzso for multiple cell lines, even for two cell lines with minor differences zzso cell is derived from zzso by chemical zzso and the second result is that zzso can be used for adhesive cells and thus open the door for solid tumor selection and zzso The newly generated zzso zzso hold great promise as molecular zzso for cancer early diagnosis and basic mechanism zzso
