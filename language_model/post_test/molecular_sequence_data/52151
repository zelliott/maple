A zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was isolated in a search for zzso that affect patterned zzso replication in zzso The zzso zzso had a dramatic effect on cell zzso during the first few hours of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso cells were produced as a result of zzso zzso Despite gross abnormalities in early zzso mature zzso colonies after 2 to 4 days were zzso indistinguishable from zzso zzso and zzso zzso colonies displayed a cell size distribution very similar to that of zzso zzso These results suggested the involvement of a protective factor produced during colony growth that compensated for the zzso zzso The action of a zzso substance that stimulates growth of zzso zzso was shown by spotting dilute zzso cultures next to established zzso zzso zzso of zzso during colony development was zzso by growing colonies containing zzso zzso on zzso indicator zzso When zzso colonies were zzso next to established zzso a zzso factor was seen to inhibit zzso zzso during the earliest stages of colony zzso These results show that a basic zzso function, DNA zzso I, is subject to zzso control by the changing conditions which the bacteria create as they zzso on zzso
