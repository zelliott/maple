zzso within the zzso zzso zzso are linked by zzso sequences of variable length and unknown zzso Recently, the crystal structure was reported of a portion of the zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from module 1 of the zzso zzso zzso B zzso as a zzso with the adjacent zzso zzso On the basis of this structure, the zzso zzso region between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in fully reducing zzso has been proposed to occupy a position on the periphery of the zzso zzso complex, as in zzso fatty acid zzso We report here the expression and characterization of the same region of the zzso B zzso module 1 zzso zzso without the adjacent zzso domain zzso zzso zzso as well as the corresponding section of the zzso zzso The zzso fold autonomously and are well zzso However, zzso gel zzso and zzso analysis independently show that zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso further demonstrates that zzso zzso is compatible with the formation of a zzso zzso Our data also strongly indicate that the zzso zzso associates with the upstream zzso zzso Both of these findings are incompatible with the proposed model for zzso zzso architecture, suggesting that it is premature to allocate the zzso regions to a position in the zzso based on the solved structure of animal fatty acid zzso
