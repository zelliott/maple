zzso zzso are a family of small, highly zzso and ubiquitous proteins that are involved in protecting organisms against toxic zzso oxygen species zzso In this study, a typical zzso 2 gene was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso sequence of zzso was composed of 407 zzso containing a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso that encodes a predicted protein of 105 zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso zzso profile of zzso as determined by a quantitative real-time zzso zzso analysis was higher in brain than in other zzso with its highest transcript occurring on the zzso zzso adult and zzso by such zzso stresses as 4 zzso 16 zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mercury zzso zzso However, zzso was slightly zzso when exposed to 42 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein showed that the zzso zzso had insulin zzso zzso activity and could protect DNA from zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso functions as an zzso that plays an important role in response to zzso zzso
