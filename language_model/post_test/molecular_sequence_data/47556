zzso peptides belong to a class of zzso zzso peptides characterized by a zzso zzso along the long zzso zzso According to the prevailing theory regarding the mechanism of action of zzso zzso this zzso zzso causes the zzso zzso of the peptides in zzso thus zzso the zzso core and, zzso enhancing membrane zzso To assess the role of the zzso zzso upon the zzso activity, two of these zzso peptides and several zzso were zzso The zzso zzso which is part of the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso cholesterol zzso forms stable zzso in zzso while the zzso zzso zzso zzso remains predominantly zzso in zzso The zzso peptides were designed through zzso acid permutations, to be either zzso zzso or to retain an zzso orientation relative to the zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion was monitored by zzso experiments, using fluorescent zzso the extent of zzso association, the zzso of zzso peptides and their orientation in zzso were studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the properties of the zzso and zzso peptides shows that the zzso zzso which determines the orientation of zzso peptides in lipids and their zzso activity, further influences the secondary structure and zzso binding capacity of these zzso
