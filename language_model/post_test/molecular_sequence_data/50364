A model of zzso bound to bovine zzso factor 4 zzso was completed using a zzso designed zzso zzso and the zzso coordinates of the native bovine zzso factor 4 zzso The zzso had a chain length of at least eight zzso units with the major repeating zzso unit consisting of zzso acid zzso zzso Each zzso unit carried a zzso zzso The structure of zzso was solved to zzso A resolution with R zzso zzso Each zzso of zzso contains an zzso lying across 3 strands of zzso zzso Each zzso has four zzso which have been implicated in zzso zzso These zzso zzso are predominantly on one side of the zzso and are zzso zzso zzso calculations performed on the zzso zzso show a ring of strong, positive charge which runs zzso across the zzso Included in this ring of density is zzso which has been shown by zzso to have a large zzso shift when zzso binds to zzso Our model of zzso bound to zzso has the zzso zzso perpendicular to the zzso wrapped about the zzso along the ring of positive charge, and salt linked to all four zzso on the zzso of each zzso
