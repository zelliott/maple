zzso complexes promote zzso of natural and synthetic zzso with unprecedented zzso the only zzso site is the second zzso bond upstream from a zzso or a zzso side chain, that is, the bond involving the zzso group of the zzso that precedes this side zzso We investigate this zzso with four zzso peptides as zzso neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso and synthetic peptides termed zzso zzso zzso zzso in which a Met is oxidized to zzso and zzso zzso While maintaining zzso properties, these zzso are suitable for quantitative study since their coordination to zzso zzso can be determined (by zzso zzso and the zzso fragments can be separated (by zzso zzso and identified (by zzso mass zzso The only zzso bonds zzso were the zzso bond in zzso zzso zzso bond in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso bonds in zzso We explain this consistent zzso of zzso by studying the modes of zzso coordination to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso solution, the rapid attachment of the zzso complex to the zzso side chain is followed by the interaction of the zzso zzso with the zzso backbone upstream from the zzso In the zzso active complex, zzso is coordinated to zzso zzso as a zzso zzso - via sulfur atom in the zzso side chain and the first zzso nitrogen upstream from this anchor - so that the zzso complex approaches the zzso zzso zzso Because the increased acidity favors this zzso active complex, the rate of zzso guided by either zzso or zzso anchor increased as pH was lowered from zzso to zzso The unwanted additional zzso of the first zzso bond upstream from the anchor is suppressed if pH is kept above zzso Four zzso complexes cleave zzso with the same zzso but at somewhat different zzso zzso in which zzso zzso carries zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso are more zzso than those containing zzso zzso such as zzso or a zzso zzso such as zzso When both zzso and zzso zzso are present in the same zzso as in zzso 1 zzso equivalent of the zzso complex distributes itself evenly at both anchors and provides partial zzso whereas 2 zzso zzso of the promoter completely cleave the second zzso bond upstream from each of the zzso The results of this study bode well for growing use of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
