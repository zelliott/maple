The zzso zzso protein is zzso by an zzso of zzso zzso which is expressed predominantly in zzso cell lines of the zzso zzso We have isolated zzso zzso clones encompassing the entire coding region of zzso zzso The predicted translation product of the zzso zzso is an 820 zzso acid protein with zzso overall similarity to zzso and human zzso zzso and zzso similarity to the chicken zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is related to other members of the protein zzso zzso family of zzso although it is structurally distinct from both the zzso type, and the zzso family of zzso zzso A comparison of the predicted protein sequence of zzso zzso human and chicken zzso proteins highlights several zzso of possible functional significance in the zzso
