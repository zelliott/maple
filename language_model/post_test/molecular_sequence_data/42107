We have previously shown that the receptors zzso the zzso and systemic zzso effects of zzso zzso are of two distinct zzso zzso zzso Here, we evaluate the effect of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso effects of zzso in the rat zzso zzso induced zzso increases in zzso pressure in the isolated zzso kidney of the zzso The ETA zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso zzso (10 zzso lowered the zzso rise in zzso pressure by 57% and zzso respectively, at 3 zzso zzso M zzso By comparison, the zzso zzso was fully antagonized zzso zzso by zzso zzso (10 zzso In the zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso increase in mean zzso pressure, which was attenuated by zzso zzso The initial zzso response to zzso was completely blocked by zzso zzso as were the reduction in zzso blood flow and increase in zzso vascular resistance induced by zzso These results suggest that both the ETA and a zzso zzso zzso play an important role in zzso the zzso effects of zzso in the rat zzso
