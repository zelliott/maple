We investigated the impact of promoter zzso on zzso protein expression in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

50 patients zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso and benign liver tumors zzso were studied for zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated by protein zzso test and direct sequencing of zzso zzso The protein expression was evaluated by zzso and Western zzso zzso 

The zzso promoter was zzso in zzso of zzso liver tissue zzso All zzso samples and ten patients with liver zzso zzso exhibited zzso promoter zzso The degree of zzso was significantly higher in samples from zzso compared to the zzso liver tissue samples zzso zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso protein expression was significantly reduced in zzso samples compared to that of the corresponding zzso liver tissue zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso gene seems to be of significance in zzso and results in reduced protein expression in zzso Interestingly, zzso promoter zzso is also present in the vast majority of zzso liver tissue whose zzso function remains zzso
