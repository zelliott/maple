zzso declines and zzso of zzso have been attributed to the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso especially one globally emerging zzso lineage zzso We used zzso zzso that target the zzso internal transcribed zzso region zzso of zzso to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of zzso in South Korea, where zzso is widely distributed but is not known to cause morbidity or mortality in wild zzso We isolated Korean zzso strains from native zzso with low infection loads and compared them to known worldwide zzso strains using 19 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso prevalence ranged between zzso and zzso in 11 of 17 native Korean species, and zzso in the introduced zzso zzso zzso Based on ITS sequence variation, 47 of the 50 identified Korean zzso formed a group closely associated with a native Brazilian zzso zzso separated from the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of three Korean zzso zzso revealed strong divergence from both zzso and the native Brazilian zzso zzso Thus, the ITS region resolves zzso that diverge from zzso but otherwise generates ambiguous zzso Our results point to the presence of highly diversified endemic strains of zzso across Asian zzso zzso The rarity of zzso zzso suggests that either this lineage was introduced into Korea only recently or zzso has been zzso by native zzso zzso Our results highlight the need to consider possible complex interactions among native zzso zzso zzso and their associated zzso hosts when assessing the spread and impact of zzso on worldwide zzso zzso
