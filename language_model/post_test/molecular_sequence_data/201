Type I zzso systems zzso are associated with the zzso of zzso bacteria and the zzso of zzso molecular zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is part of a zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli as inclusion bodies can be efficiently zzso in zzso and can form active zzso as shown by zzso swelling zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso sequence alignments identify zzso as a zzso zzso and point to a zzso structural framework among such proteins despite their marginal sequence zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso of zzso proteins can be correlated with their involvement in zzso zzso zzso or Major zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results establish a first set of zzso relationships for a bacterial zzso protein likely to be exclusively involved in zzso and may contribute towards a more accurate zzso of zzso Factor zzso family zzso
