The zzso family of zzso exhibit zzso expression in a host of zzso Though the molecular function of the zzso protein in both normal and zzso cells has remained uncertain, it has been zzso to play a role in gene zzso on the basis of zzso acid zzso with known zzso factors such as zzso zzso & zzso zzso We report here the direct testing of full-length zzso and its zzso partner, Max, on the zzso activity of reporter genes bearing zzso binding zzso Such reporter zzso display an zzso level of activity in transient zzso which is dependent on the presence of the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso results in modest zzso of reporter gene zzso Similar zzso of max results in a repression of reporter gene activity, an effect which is reversed by zzso with zzso Max repression is dependent on an intact DNA binding region, while zzso zzso depends on both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest a model in which Max zzso can act as as zzso and zzso zzso as zzso of potential target zzso
