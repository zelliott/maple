We report the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in dilute and zzso solutions as a function of temperature, zzso strength and the nature of zzso We have examined the zzso dependence as a function of molecular weight using samples obtained by zzso We have also prepared samples lacking zzso zzso and compared their zzso with that of the native zzso In both cases, we observed that, after heating a zzso solution for the first time above the zzso transition temperature, a different ordered state was obtained on zzso This state had a lower molecular weight and intrinsic zzso but identical chemical structure and local zzso A role for the side chain in the stabilization of breaks in the backbone is zzso Nevertheless, a unique curve is obtained for the specific zzso as a function of the overlap zzso zzso for different zzso zzso of both the native and heated zzso However, different zzso are obtained for normal and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso is characterized by a lower zzso zzso
