zzso zzso type II is an zzso highly zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso presumably serving regulatory functions, was prepared from human zzso and the zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso zzso was zzso The deduced zzso sequence was employed for the synthesis of a mixture of zzso as a zzso probe to screen a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso library for clones zzso zzso zzso A full-length clone consisting of zzso zzso was isolated and the sequence of both strands zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the largest open reading frame encodes 215 zzso acid zzso predicting a maximum Mr of zzso The zzso sequence of the human beta zzso shows a similarity of zzso to that of zzso zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence a similarity of zzso and zzso to that of zzso zzso and bovine zzso zzso No further protein sequence currently known exhibits any notable zzso Using a zzso restriction zzso of the zzso clone representing zzso of the coding region, a zzso zzso transcript was detected by Northern zzso in total zzso prepared from human zzso cells and zzso as well as from bovine heart suggesting a single transcript of the zzso gene and also demonstrating high similarity also between the human and bovine zzso zzso The same restriction zzso was used as the probe to indicate in Southern zzso that the corresponding zzso DNA contains at least one zzso of roughly zzso zzso in length and presumably is a single copy zzso
