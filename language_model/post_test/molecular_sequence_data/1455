zzso zzso zzso zzso is found in the nucleus immediately after zzso zzso expression of zzso fused to yellow fluorescent protein zzso in zzso cells confirmed the nuclear zzso of zzso in the absence of other viral zzso zzso has four putative nuclear zzso signals zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso whereas deletion of zzso did not, so zzso zzso is critical for nuclear zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were all capable of transporting the majority of zzso to the zzso Finally, a zzso zzso with the sequence zzso directed all of zzso into the nucleus, suggesting that zzso of the zzso motif makes the nuclear zzso more zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is also capable of shuttling between the nucleus and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that this property is attributed to a zzso nuclear export sequence zzso consisting of zzso acids zzso This zzso zzso caused transport of zzso to the zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso between the nucleus and zzso
