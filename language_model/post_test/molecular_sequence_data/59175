In this study we report the zzso zzso and characterization of zzso v 9 zzso zzso from barley zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of Kentucky bluegrass zzso zzso group 9 zzso zzso were identified in a zzso library of barley zzso expressed zzso The zzso v 9 zzso clone zzso contained an open reading frame zzso 313 zzso acids which included a putative zzso signal zzso and one zzso zzso for zzso The zzso corresponding to clone zzso was produced abundantly in zzso during the late stages of zzso zzso The protein zzso by clone zzso was zzso as a fusion protein in the zzso coli expression zzso zzso zzso using zzso to this zzso zzso zzso v 9, showed that zzso v 9 protein accumulated during zzso development and was produced zzso at zzso zzso Using these zzso we also provide evidence that zzso v 9 protein localized to the zzso zzso of mature zzso Southern blots suggested that zzso v 9 zzso exist as multiple zzso in zzso zzso comparisons showed that the zzso v 9 zzso clones were also zzso to group 5 zzso of Timothy grass zzso zzso zzso and canary grass zzso zzso zzso and the group 9 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
