The complete zzso of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso and many of its zzso has been determined by several zzso The zzso contains zzso predicted open reading frames zzso However, a function had been clearly assigned for only six of these zzso in the viral zzso zzso and structural zzso The others are zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso Here, we try to provide a zzso insight on those zzso suggesting that a number of them are remotely related to structural proteins of zzso and other viruses infecting zzso zzso Surprisingly, several of the zzso exhibit considerable similarity with other zzso zzso These observations may provide clues on the evolution and zzso dynamics of the zzso
