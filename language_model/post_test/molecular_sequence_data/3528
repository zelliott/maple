A zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was found to possess a light, zzso zzso zzso domain sharing high zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for phototropism in higher zzso zzso three-dimensional modeling suggests that zzso binds zzso in a similar pocket as zzso zzso zzso indeed exhibits the same zzso features and zzso zzso as zzso with the zzso formation of a zzso zzso assigned to an zzso zzso zzso zzso By means of zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments, we measured the quantum yield of formation for zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso change, zzso zzso 135 zzso with respect to the parent zzso The formation of zzso is accompanied by a considerable volume contraction, zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso is formed from the zzso of a zzso transient species, zzso within 2 zzso In both zzso and free zzso this transient has an zzso content of approximately 200 zzso and its formation is accompanied by a small contraction, zzso approximately zzso zzso supporting the assignment of zzso to the zzso zzso state, as suggested by zzso zzso These are the first studies indicating that zzso zzso receptors may exist also in zzso besides zzso a steadily growing family in zzso
