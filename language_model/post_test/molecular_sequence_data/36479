zzso of parallel zzso zzso and zzso zzso were studied in solution by CD zzso A cooperative change in the CD zzso is observed in zzso zzso solutions at decreased water activity zzso zzso This distinctive change is supposed to stem from a cooperative zzso transition of parallel double zzso from a zzso form with zzso sugar zzso to a zzso form designated as zzso The free energy difference between zzso and zzso zzso of the parallel zzso is close to that for zzso zzso with the zzso sequence zzso zzso of a parallel zzso is dependent on its zzso
