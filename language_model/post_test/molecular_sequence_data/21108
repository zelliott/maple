zzso is a major zzso of human zzso zzso zzso probably via binding of its zzso repeat array to a DNA sequence motif associated with zzso However, our view of zzso regulation, in terms of motifs defined and hotspots zzso has a strong bias toward the zzso A zzso particularly common in zzso We show that population diversity can reveal a second class of hotspots specifically activated by zzso zzso common in Africans but rare in zzso These zzso hotspots nevertheless share very similar properties with their counterparts activated by the A zzso The specificity of hotspot zzso is such that individuals with differing zzso zzso even within the same population, can use substantially if not completely different sets of zzso Each zzso hotspot is activated by a distinct spectrum of zzso zzso despite the fact that all are predicted to bind the same sequence zzso This differential zzso points to complex interactions between the zzso array and hotspots and identifies features of the array that might be important in controlling hotspot zzso
