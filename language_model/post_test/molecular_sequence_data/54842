The zzso immune response to zzso C virus zzso can result in the selection of characteristic zzso zzso that enable the virus to escape this zzso The ability of the virus to mutate at these sites is dependent on the incoming virus, the fitness cost incurred by the zzso and the benefit to the virus in escaping the zzso Studies examining viral adaptation in chronic zzso infection have shown that these characteristic immune escape zzso can be observed at the population level as human zzso zzso zzso viral zzso We examined 63 individuals with chronic zzso infection who were infected from a single zzso zzso zzso zzso Our aim was to determine the extent to which the zzso immune pressure affects zzso diversity and the ways in which the sequence of the incoming virus, including zzso escape zzso can influence subsequent zzso in recipients and infection zzso 

zzso sequences from these individuals revealed 29 significant associations between specific zzso types within the new hosts and variations within their zzso which likely represent new viral zzso These associations did not overlap with previously reported adaptations for zzso zzso and zzso and possibly reflected a combination of constraint due to the incoming virus and genetic distance between the zzso However, these sites accounted for only a portion of the sites in which viral diversity was observed in the new zzso Furthermore, zzso viral adaptations in the incoming zzso virus likely influenced the outcomes in the new zzso
