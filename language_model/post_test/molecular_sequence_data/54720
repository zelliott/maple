A series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, 3, and zzso were zzso based on the zzso and zzso linkage zzso of zzso The formation of zzso zzso zzso was monitored in order to determine the influence of zzso segments on phase transition properties as well as the sensitivity to changes in salt and zzso The zzso transition profiles of the proteins fused with only one or two zzso blocks zzso zzso 1 or 2) were similar to that of the counterpart zzso In contrast, zzso proteins that contain 3 and 4 zzso blocks displayed a zzso profile and no transition, zzso Upon increasing the salt concentration and zzso a zzso phase transition from a soluble zzso to an zzso zzso was zzso The effects of zzso segments on the stimuli sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso were interpreted in terms of their structural and molecular zzso
