The zzso and protein sequences of the zzso zzso of the alpha zzso chain of human basement membrane collagen have been zzso By repeated primer extension with synthetic zzso and zzso from either zzso cells or human zzso overlapping clones were obtained which cover zzso zzso The derived protein sequence allows for the first time a comparison and alignment of both alpha chains of type IV collagen from the N zzso This alignment reveals an additional 43 zzso acid zzso in the alpha zzso chain as compared to the alpha zzso zzso 21 of these additional zzso form a zzso loop within the triple zzso which is unique among all known zzso
