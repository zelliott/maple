Both the zzso zzso zzso alone and its symbiotic zzso complex are known to be highly zzso to zzso The nature of the zzso activity of zzso bacteria was investigated for its potential application as an insect control zzso It was found that in the zzso broth of zzso zzso strain zzso at least two zzso toxin A and toxin B, independently contributed to the oral zzso activity against Southern corn zzso zzso toxin A and toxin B exhibited single bands on native zzso gel zzso and two peptides of 208 and 63 zzso on zzso gel zzso The native molecular weight of both the toxin A and toxin B was determined to be approximately 860 zzso suggesting that they are zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing and Western analysis using zzso zzso to each toxin demonstrated that the two toxins were distinct but zzso The oral potency zzso of toxin A and toxin B against Southern corn zzso larvae was determined to be similar to that observed with highly potent zzso toxins against zzso zzso In addition, it was found that the two peptides present in toxin B could be processed in zzso from a zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso processing was shown to enhance zzso zzso
