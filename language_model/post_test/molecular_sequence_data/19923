Current zzso approaches to the study of complex microbial zzso provide a glimpse into the community metabolism and occasionally allow zzso zzso for the most abundant zzso However, little information is gained for the members of the community present at low zzso especially those representing zzso zzso which include the bulk of the diversity present in most zzso Here we used zzso directed cell separation by zzso in zzso zzso and flow zzso followed by amplification and sequencing of a fraction of the zzso DNA of several bacterial cells that belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly allowed, for the first time, a look into the evolution and potential metabolism of a soil representative from this group of organisms for which there are no species in stable laboratory zzso zzso reconstruction from targeted cells of zzso organisms isolated directly from the environment represents a powerful approach to access any specific members of a community and an alternative way to assess the community's zzso zzso
