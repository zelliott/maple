zzso zzso type 1 zzso is zzso by zzso an essential gene in zzso zzso The zzso zzso is required for zzso repression and appears to function zzso to the zzso protein zzso Previously, we characterized a zzso zzso that zzso zzso repression but does not interfere with the function of zzso in zzso zzso We proposed that the zzso zzso zzso is defective in its interaction with a regulatory zzso that directs participation of zzso in the zzso repression zzso Here, we present evidence that zzso a protein required for zzso repression, is one such regulatory zzso We show that zzso is physically associated with zzso zzso interacts with zzso strongly and specifically in the zzso system, and zzso and zzso fusion proteins zzso from cell zzso Moreover, zzso of a zzso fusion protein suppresses the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This and other genetic evidence indicate that the two proteins function together in regulating zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a regulatory zzso of zzso that targets its activity to proteins in the zzso repression regulatory zzso
