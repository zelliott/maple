Certain neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals are caused by small zzso infectious particles called zzso Limited zzso and zzso extraction of the zzso containing zzso generate prion rods that are composed of a zzso having an apparent molecular mass of 27 to 30 zzso This zzso termed prion protein zzso zzso has a ragged N zzso that begins at about zzso 90, but retains zzso zzso Moreover, the findings in a patient having an inherited prion disease of a truncated zzso with its C zzso at zzso 145 suggest that the zzso 90 to 145 may be of particular importance in the zzso of prion zzso To determine the three-dimensional organization of prion rods and to identify the core region involved in zzso formation, we recorded X-ray zzso patterns from rods zzso from zzso Syrian zzso zzso brains which contain zzso zzso and from synthetic zzso zzso Three peptides were studied corresponding to zzso 113 to 120 zzso zzso an zzso composed of zzso and zzso 109 to 122 zzso the first predicted zzso region of zzso and 90 to 145 (a 56 zzso zzso containing both zzso and the second predicted zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso carried out in parallel with the X-ray zzso revealed that all the samples formed linear zzso which were approximately 60 to approximately 200 A zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso and dried preparations of prion rods gave X-ray patterns that indicated a zzso zzso in which the hydrogen bond distance was zzso A and the zzso distance was zzso zzso For the three zzso zzso the zzso zzso varied widely, zzso to the zzso of the zzso involved in the formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A for zzso zzso A for zzso zzso zzso A from zzso and dried zzso and zzso A for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso distance of zzso zzso was thus within the observed range for the zzso and suggests that the zzso core of zzso is closely modeled by the zzso zzso zzso
