The i locus of the zzso fish contains the zzso gene whose product is the key zzso required for zzso zzso The zzso zzso at this zzso also zzso as zzso zzso causes zzso zzso in zzso zzso Its zzso zzso is very weak, characterized mainly by small and varying sized zzso in zzso Cloning and sequencing analyses of the zzso gene for the i zzso zzso revealed the presence of a zzso extra DNA zzso in the zzso untranslated region, this being zzso a zzso zzso element of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family which had previously been identified as a cause of another zzso zzso zzso Its zzso point was 85 zzso upstream of the main zzso initiation site and 50 zzso downstream of the zzso motif that has been suggested to be essential for the promoter function of the zzso zzso The zzso level of the zzso gene was decreased in zzso fish, compared with zzso zzso The zzso is thus a likely cause of the weak zzso zzso The zzso element zzso in a zzso fashion, and its zzso is mostly imprecise, leaving some zzso and/or removing excess zzso The i zzso zzso strain can thus be expected to serve as a source from which various other zzso in the promoter region can be zzso
