In zzso zzso peptides mediate a broad range of zzso functions through binding to three highly zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Selective zzso of these receptors presents opportunities for the development of novel zzso To ascertain if zzso monkey could serve as a surrogate animal model for the development of zzso of zzso zzso function, we undertook a search for additional zzso family members and studied the expression profiles of the three known zzso zzso We found no evidence for additional zzso family members in zzso suggesting that the expression of the previously described zzso zzso 4 is limited to zzso We studied the distribution of the three receptors in a broad array of human and zzso monkey zzso Based on the similarity between the human and the zzso expression profiles, we conclude that the zzso monkey may be a suitable animal model to evaluate the clinical efficacy and potential side effects of zzso zzso zzso
