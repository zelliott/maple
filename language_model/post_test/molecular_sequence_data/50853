zzso gene zzso is induced by zzso acid zzso in cultured zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso fusion genes showed that zzso zzso responsive zzso elements are located between zzso and zzso zzso upstream from the zzso end of the zzso zzso This region has zzso zzso In contrast, an artificial zzso response element zzso zzso control to a zzso gene in both zzso and zzso zzso indicating that the zzso regulatory network is functional in both zzso These studies show that zzso receptors interact with zzso zzso factors to control zzso gene zzso
