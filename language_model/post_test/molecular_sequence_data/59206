We have cloned a zzso zzso zzso from a human fetal brain zzso library in zzso zzso the human zzso of a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso isolated from zzso zzso The derived human protein zzso shares a significant sequence identity with parts of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso both proteins which are discussed as functioning as zzso zzso A similar role of zzso is partially confirmed by the results of an zzso analysis, demonstrating the widespread distribution of the protein among different human zzso
