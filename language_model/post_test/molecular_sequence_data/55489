Novel zzso genes can arise either through zzso of pre-existing genes or de zzso zzso involving zzso of pre-existing zzso notably after gene duplication, have been extensively zzso In contrast, de zzso gene birth remains poorly zzso mainly because translation of sequences devoid of zzso or zzso zzso is expected to produce insignificant zzso rather than proteins with specific biological zzso Here we formalize an evolutionary model according to which functional genes evolve de zzso through zzso zzso generated by widespread zzso activity in zzso zzso Testing this model at the zzso scale in zzso zzso we detect translation of hundreds of short zzso open reading frames zzso located in zzso zzso These translation events seem to provide zzso potential, as suggested by their differential regulation upon stress and by signatures of retention by natural zzso In line with our model, we establish that zzso zzso zzso can be placed within an evolutionary zzso ranging from zzso sequences to zzso We identify zzso candidate zzso among zzso zzso zzso and find that de zzso gene birth from such a zzso may be more prevalent than sporadic gene zzso Our work illustrates that evolution exploits seemingly zzso sequences to generate zzso functional zzso
