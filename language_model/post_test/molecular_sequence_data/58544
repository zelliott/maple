zzso zzso is an important zzso zzso for many drugs, zzso compounds, and steroid zzso Human zzso express five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ST zzso zzso zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso ST can catalyze the zzso of steroid compounds, including zzso administered steroids such as zzso zzso We set out to characterize zzso the nature and extent of individual variation in the expression of zzso and zzso ST in the human small zzso after Northern zzso analysis had demonstrated that both zzso were expressed in that zzso zzso zzso to human zzso and zzso ST were developed, and Western zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso were zzso We then performed quantitative Western blots of zzso and zzso ST in 62 samples of human zzso zzso Large individual variations in zzso zzso and zzso ST protein levels were present in those 62 tissue zzso However, there was not a significant correlation between levels of zzso protein for the two zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso ST in the human zzso are regulated zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso ST protein levels in these samples did not differ significantly between the zzso and neither was correlated significantly with time of tissue storage, patient age, or underlying zzso zzso distribution zzso of zzso protein values were skewed for both zzso and the zzso ST frequency distribution seemed to be zzso These results represent a step toward understanding the molecular basis for individual variation in the expression and function of zzso and zzso ST in the human small zzso
