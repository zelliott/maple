zzso chicken skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane preparations contain a very active zzso or zzso zzso zzso previously thought to be a zzso marker zzso The function of the zzso has not yet been determined although its prominent activity and concentration in zzso complexes supports a possible role in the zzso zzso An essential component of the zzso has been identified as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso were specific and exhibited no zzso with other skeletal muscle proteins on zzso Using this zzso zzso we have explored other chicken zzso to determine the tissue distribution of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were found in gizzard smooth muscle, brain, heart, zzso and lung zzso The brain and smooth muscle membrane proteins were further zzso and characterized for zzso zzso zzso The brain and smooth muscle zzso exhibited properties indistinguishable from the skeletal muscle zzso zzso with regard to a series of zzso and zzso zzso terminal zzso acid zzso and the effects of zzso The zzso in all three zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor R zzso Identification of the zzso zzso in gizzard smooth muscle has allowed the investigation of the zzso membrane zzso using isolated whole smooth muscle zzso The data support an zzso for the smooth muscle cell zzso Although the zzso of the brain and skeletal muscle zzso have not been zzso determined, the nearly identical properties of all three zzso argues for an zzso of the active sites of these zzso as zzso The responsiveness of the three zzso to regulatory lipids suggests that the zzso may serve as a master switch controlling zzso zzso zzso and zzso accessibility to zzso and zzso It is also proposed that the zzso may regulate zzso accessibility to zzso zzso in a variety of zzso and, in brain, the zzso may zzso the neurotransmitter role of zzso
