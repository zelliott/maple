The zzso zzso strain zzso used in this study has in the zzso four putative zzso genes designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one putative zzso zzso gene designated zzso To zzso the roles of the zzso and the zzso zzso against zzso stress in zzso zzso we constructed gene disruption zzso in which each of the genes zzso zzso and zzso or both zzso and zzso were zzso and we characterized their growth and response to zzso zzso In zzso conditions, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso had moderate growth zzso and the zzso zzso double zzso zzso had a severe growth zzso which was characterized by zzso of doubling time and a lower final zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso which is defective in zzso zzso lost the ability to grow under zzso conditions, although it grew partially under zzso zzso The growth of these zzso however, could be substantially restored by the addition of zzso or reduced zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were more sensitive to hydrogen zzso and zzso stress than the zzso In particular, the stress sensitivity of zzso was significantly zzso On the other hand, zzso of all these genes was only zzso affected by these zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso zzso system is the major zzso zzso system and is essential to allow the zzso zzso zzso zzso to grow under zzso zzso
