zzso The influence of plant communities on symbiotic zzso zzso zzso zzso communities is difficult to study in zzso as both zzso are strongly influenced by some of the same soil and environmental conditions, and thus we have a poor understanding of the potential links in community composition and structure between host and zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized in zzso roots of zzso soil zzso zzso in both isolated plants supporting zzso for only a few months of the growing season and plants growing in mixed plant communities composed of annual and perennial zzso zzso and zzso analysis were used to compare competing models based on either communities or soil zzso zzso zzso zzso in adjacent contrasting plant community situations zzso distinct zzso communities with few zzso zzso occurring in both community zzso zzso plants zzso communities of fewer zzso zzso with lower diversity than plants in mixed zzso Host community type was more indicative than pH of zzso community zzso zzso Our results support an inherent relationship between host plant and zzso community structures, although zzso models were also statistically zzso
