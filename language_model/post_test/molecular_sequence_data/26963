The deep sea zzso depth of zzso zzso represents the largest zzso on zzso Yet relatively little is known about its microbial community's structure, function, and adaptation to the cold and deep zzso To provide further zzso insights into zzso zzso zzso we zzso a total of approximately 200 zzso of a random zzso shotgun zzso library from a microbial community residing at a depth of 4,000 m at Station zzso in the Pacific Ocean and compared it to other available zzso sequence data from surface and deep zzso Our analyses indicated that the zzso lifestyle is likely facilitated by a collection of very subtle zzso as opposed to dramatic zzso of gene content or zzso These adaptations appear to include higher zzso versatility and zzso plasticity to cope with the sparse and sporadic energy resources available, a preference for zzso and zzso zzso acids in protein zzso unique proteins not found in zzso species, and adaptations at the gene expression zzso The zzso community is also characterized by a larger average zzso size and a higher content of zzso genetic zzso such as zzso and zzso whose propagation is apparently favored by more relaxed zzso zzso selection in deeper zzso
