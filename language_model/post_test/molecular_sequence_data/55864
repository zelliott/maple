An zzso cell surface protein recognized by zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso tumor zzso The expression of the zzso protein has recently been reported to be associated with the differentiation of zzso zzso However, the primary structure of the zzso protein has not been zzso To clarify its primary structure, we carried out zzso expression cloning of the zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso protein is identical to zzso zzso zzso but at least two species of transcript exist in the tumor cells and one of these transcripts has a novel sequence at the zzso The transcript with the novel sequence at the zzso was found to be expressed during the differentiation of zzso zzso
