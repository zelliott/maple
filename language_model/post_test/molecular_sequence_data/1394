A zzso molecular structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the specific inhibitor zzso zzso in the active site was determined by zzso zzso In contrast to the previous zzso determined zzso structure, this complex adopted a closed zzso similar to that observed for the zzso zzso zzso The differences between the open and closed structures of zzso were primarily limited to the lid domain of zzso F through G, zzso zzso and C, the N zzso of zzso I, and the zzso zzso These large-scale zzso changes were generally due to the relocation of zzso structural elements toward each other with remarkably little zzso at the secondary structure zzso For example, the zzso and zzso zzso were maintained with a sharp turn between them but are placed to form the exterior ceiling of the active site in the zzso zzso zzso was closely surrounded by zzso from zzso recognition sites 1, 4, 5, and 6 to form a small, isolated zzso zzso The switch from open to closed zzso dramatically relocated zzso C to a more zzso zzso As a result, zzso binding interactions were altered, and the putative zzso zzso zzso binding site was zzso This suggests a structural mechanism zzso zzso zzso changes may coordinate zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex with the open zzso structure yields insights into the dynamics involved in zzso access, tight inhibitor zzso and coordination of zzso and zzso partner zzso
