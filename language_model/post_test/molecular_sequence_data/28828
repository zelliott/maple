In the zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso and zzso of maternal origin target the zzso zzso causing zzso in gene expression and zzso activity, both of which are important for the initiation of zzso zzso The potential direct zzso roles of zzso and zzso are, however, zzso Here we report the cloning of zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso using specific primer sets designed initially within zzso regions of human and bovine zzso zzso and subsequently within regions of identified zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso and encodes a 526 zzso acid zzso that displays greater than zzso identity with other zzso zzso zzso Northern and Western zzso analyses using zzso zzso zzso from Day 12 of pregnancy demonstrated the presence of multiple zzso zzso transcripts of approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a similar zzso protein corresponding in size to human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso In Day 12 zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso to zzso cell zzso zzso with that of zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was evaluated in zzso of different zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso along with those for other steroid hormone receptors zzso and zzso zzso and known embryonic genes associated with cell differentiation zzso zzso zzso type zzso and growth zzso zzso zzso zzso levels varied with zzso zzso zzso maximum at Day zzso zzso with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso in zzso zzso similar to that of zzso zzso whereas the expression of the zzso gene was barely zzso and appeared zzso for all zzso stages zzso zzso beta treatment of Day 12 zzso zzso in culture zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, respectively, but decreased those of zzso and had no effect on zzso D1 zzso zzso These studies taken together suggest that embryonic zzso likely mediates the zzso functions of zzso in the dynamic regulation of embryonic growth and development at zzso
