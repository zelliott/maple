zzso inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells, but the mechanism of zzso growth zzso has not yet been zzso and few zzso genes have been zzso zzso therefore, used differential display zzso to identify novel zzso genes in zzso human breast cancer zzso The human zzso zzso gene zzso which was not known to be zzso zzso was detected and cloned by complementary DNA library zzso The zzso open reading frame codes for a protein of zzso zzso acids that zzso at an apparent molecular mass of approximately 54 zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed the existence of two zzso zzso species of approximately zzso and zzso zzso in all of the human breast cancer cell lines zzso The major zzso transcript was induced rapidly zzso 6 zzso by zzso in zzso cells, and a zzso zzso induction was observed after 24 h of zzso The increase in zzso zzso zzso was completely prevented by zzso with the pure zzso zzso but not by zzso indicating that zzso is directly regulated by the zzso zzso As zzso is required for the production of zzso zzso acid, a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso might play an important role in the control of sex steroid zzso via zzso in breast cancer zzso
