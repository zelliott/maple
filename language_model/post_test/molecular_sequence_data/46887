zzso zzso are zzso proteins that zzso from the 12 fivefold zzso of the zzso and are the cell attachment zzso of the zzso They consist of three segments: an zzso tail, which is zzso attached to the zzso base, a thin zzso carrying 15 zzso acid zzso repeats, and a zzso zzso head (or zzso which recognizes the primary cell zzso Due to their exceptional stability, which allows easy distinction of native zzso from unfolded forms and folding zzso zzso zzso are a very good model system for studying folding in zzso and in zzso To understand the folding and stability of the zzso zzso the unfolding zzso of zzso 2 zzso induced by zzso and temperature has been zzso zzso starts from the zzso and a stable intermediate accumulates that has the zzso head and part of the zzso structure zzso by electron zzso The unfolded part can be zzso away using limited zzso and the precise zzso sites have been zzso The remaining structured zzso is recognized by zzso zzso that are specific for the zzso zzso head and therefore retains a native zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso zzso carry a stable zzso domain, consisting of the zzso with five zzso
