The zzso zzso protein is a zzso protein required for the zzso degradation of zzso zzso A human zzso zzso library was screened with zzso of zzso zzso corresponding to four different areas of the zzso acid zzso A putative clone zzso zzso which gave positive signals to all four probe zzso was zzso and zzso The sequence was zzso with the sequence of 160 zzso acids of the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso clone should facilitate investigation into function of the zzso zzso protein and also into genetic abnormalities underlying zzso zzso AB zzso
