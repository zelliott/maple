The cooperation of stem cell factor zzso and zzso zzso is required to induce renewal divisions in zzso zzso whereas differentiation to mature zzso requires the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso activate common signaling pathways such as the zzso of protein zzso B zzso and the subsequent zzso and zzso of zzso In contrast, only zzso activates zzso Both zzso and zzso promote zzso zzso To understand the interplay of zzso and zzso in maintaining the balance between renewal and differentiation during zzso development, we investigated differential zzso target regulation by zzso and zzso zzso profiling revealed that a subset of zzso targets was not inhibited but was activated by zzso One of these genes was zzso zzso control of zzso zzso was studied and compared with that of the zzso zzso target zzso We show that in response to zzso the allegedly zzso factor zzso associates with the allegedly zzso factor zzso in the nucleus, which is required for zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expression is controlled by the cooperation of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso family zzso Thus, zzso not only is an zzso of zzso but also zzso distinct signals to regulate gene expression in zzso
