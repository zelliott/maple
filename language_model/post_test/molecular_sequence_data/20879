Human zzso zzso and zzso types 40 and 41 zzso zzso are responsible for epidemic and endemic acute zzso in children and zzso The present study was designed to evaluate the prevalence and genetic diversity of enteric viruses in children in zzso A total of zzso zzso samples were collected during a zzso period in the region of zzso from children under 12 years old, hospitalized or presenting in zzso with symptoms of acute zzso zzso and zzso were detected by zzso methods and confirmed by zzso and sequence zzso zzso analyses were performed for zzso zzso with reference zzso zzso and zzso were characterized as a zzso agent in 28 zzso and 18 zzso of the zzso samples, zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso belonged to the zzso 3 zzso zzso 4; zzso and 1 zzso zzso 24; zzso and the enteric zzso to the zzso 40 zzso zzso 1; zzso and 41 zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first report that describes the molecular epidemiology of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Their respective detection rate was very low, far below that of zzso and zzso The genetic diversity among these two viruses is relatively limited and varies depending on the zzso
