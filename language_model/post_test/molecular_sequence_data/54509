zzso have been known for their several biological activities in zzso zzso Recently, the identification and characterization of zzso from zzso zzso zzso have been reported and functions of zzso are well zzso In this study, we have characterized four zzso zzso zzso that were discovered while analyzing zzso zzso tick zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that the four zzso zzso zzso here after named zzso zzso from zzso zzso are zzso identical to zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso genes were expressed specifically in the zzso zzso throughout life cycle stages of the ticks and were zzso by blood zzso The specific expressions were also confirmed by Western zzso zzso Furthermore, to investigate whether native zzso are zzso into the host during tick zzso the zzso of zzso raised against saliva of adult ticks to zzso zzso was tested by Western zzso The zzso are potentially zzso into the host during tick feeding as revealed by specific zzso of zzso zzso with mouse zzso to zzso zzso tick zzso zzso vaccination of mice with zzso zzso zzso that period to reach zzso was significantly delayed and the zzso weight was significantly reduced as compared to the zzso Further zzso of the biological functions of zzso are required to fully understand the pathways involved in the zzso of host immune zzso
