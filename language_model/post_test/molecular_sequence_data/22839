zzso zzso mediate critical cellular functions but relatively little is known about mechanisms controlling their zzso including expression of zzso a class II zzso implicated in the zzso of cellular differentiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels and promoter activity were all readily zzso by zzso suggesting regulation by zzso DNA zzso We validated consensus binding sites for zzso zzso factors in the zzso promoter through zzso studies and targeted zzso zzso and functional binding by zzso at these sites was confirmed with zzso zzso zzso and zzso shift zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso with a reporter driven by the zzso promoter led to high activities in zzso insect cells (which lack zzso zzso In human cells, restored expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein levels, whereas levels were decreased by zzso zzso of either zzso Finally, variable levels of zzso were in zzso with that of zzso in a number of human zzso and cancer cell zzso These studies together characterize for the first time the activity of the zzso promoter, through which zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso and which may contribute to tissue or zzso expression of zzso
