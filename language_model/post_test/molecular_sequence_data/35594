zzso zzso is a zzso zzso element commonly found in clinical zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the primary origin of transfer zzso are located close to each other and have been shown to be essential for zzso The zzso site contains a large zzso repeat (where the zzso site is zzso adjacent to a series of short direct zzso zzso does not show any of the typical zzso sequence motifs but is the zzso of a unique family of zzso zzso The present study focuses on the zzso zzso and structural analysis of zzso whose zzso structure could be predicted by protein zzso The structure consists of two zzso zzso an zzso domain sharing the zzso of the DNA binding domain of the zzso family of zzso regulators and zzso a zzso zzso domain related to the zzso family of restriction zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid sequences pointed to several zzso polar zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that were zzso to zzso zzso analysis of these zzso (in zzso DNA transfer and zzso zzso revealed the importance of these zzso for zzso activity and suggests zzso as a potential zzso zzso similarly to zzso zzso We also show that zzso binds specifically to zzso containing the zzso direct repeat zzso confirming their role in transfer zzso The results provide insights into the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso which differs radically from that of zzso zzso
