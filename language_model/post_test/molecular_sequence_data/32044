We show that the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso contain genes that, when transformed into rice, zzso resistance to rice blast zzso The genes are resistance genes (R zzso that zzso proteins with zzso site zzso and zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso By using criteria associated with rapid molecular evolution, we identified three rapidly evolving zzso families in these species as well as in rice, and transformed a randomly chosen subset of these genes into rice strains known to be sensitive to rice blast disease caused by the fungus zzso zzso The transformed strains were then tested for sensitivity or resistance to 12 diverse strains of zzso zzso A total of 15 functional blast R genes were identified among 60 zzso genes cloned from zzso zzso and zzso and 13 blast R genes were obtained from 20 zzso zzso in zzso These results show that abundant blast R genes occur not only within species but also among species, and that the R genes in the same rapidly evolving gene family can exhibit an zzso response that zzso resistance to rapidly evolving zzso zzso Neither conventional evolutionary conservation nor conventional evolutionary convergence supplies a satisfactory explanation of our zzso We suggest a unique mechanism termed zzso zzso in which R genes and pathogen zzso can follow only limited evolutionary pathways to increase zzso Our results open avenues for zzso identification that will help to zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanisms and may yield new sources of durable pathogen zzso
