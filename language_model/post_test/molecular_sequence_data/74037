zzso zzso is a human heart disease characterized by increased zzso mass, focal areas of fibrosis, zzso and zzso zzso This genetically dominant disease can be caused by zzso in any one of several zzso zzso including beta cardiac zzso heavy chain zzso zzso To determine whether point zzso in human beta zzso have direct effects on interfering with filament assembly and zzso structure, full-length zzso and zzso human beta zzso zzso were cloned and expressed in primary cultures of zzso rat zzso zzso zzso under conditions that promote zzso A zzso to zzso change at zzso acid 184 in the consensus zzso binding sequence of human beta zzso resulted in abnormal zzso zzso and disrupted both thick and thin filament structure in zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso protein appeared to zzso with zzso throughout the zzso suggesting a tight interaction of these two zzso Human beta zzso with zzso zzso assembled normally into thick filaments and did not affect zzso zzso Two zzso zzso previously described as causing human zzso zzso zzso and zzso were competent to assemble into thick filaments producing zzso with well defined I bands, A bands, and H zzso zzso and detection of zzso beta zzso and either zzso or zzso proteins in the same zzso showed these proteins are equally able to assemble into the zzso and provided no discernible differences in zzso zzso Thus, human beta zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were readily incorporated into zzso zzso and did not disrupt zzso zzso This study indicates that the zzso of zzso disarray seen in zzso patients which harbor either of these two zzso may not be directly due to the failure of the zzso zzso heavy chain protein to assemble and form normal zzso but may rather be a secondary effect possibly resulting from the chronic stress of decreased beta zzso zzso
