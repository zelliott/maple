The zzso zzso is a zzso arrested, zzso zzso stage normally formed in response to overcrowding and limited zzso The zzso gene specifies an intermediate step in a hierarchy of genes thought to specify a zzso for neural zzso of environmental zzso zzso in zzso result in zzso formation of zzso larvae even in abundant zzso This gene has been cloned by zzso zzso and it appears to zzso a new class of zzso zzso A zzso probe detects a zzso zzso zzso of low zzso and the DNA sequence indicates that the gene encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso with a putative zzso domain and a zzso protein zzso domain most closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso product appears to be a zzso zzso required for zzso of environmental signals into an appropriate zzso zzso
