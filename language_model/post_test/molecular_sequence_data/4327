The zzso of the zzso zzso egg envelope function in zzso and zzso As the zzso zzso egg transits the zzso zzso region of the zzso it is converted to a zzso egg by limited zzso of the envelope zzso zzso to zzso This conversion is caused by an zzso zzso zzso active site zzso zzso We cloned a zzso for zzso from an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid protein zzso to the zzso family of zzso previously shown to be present in zzso and fish egg zzso zzso zzso zzso and motifs present in the zzso sequence included a signal zzso zzso an zzso zzso site, and 12 aligned zzso zzso In zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso site and a zzso zzso domain were present reflecting the zzso of zzso in these species via the zzso zzso zzso However, fish envelope zzso lack these sequences since they are zzso via a different route (in the liver, transported to the zzso and assembled into the egg envelope surrounding the zzso Consensus zzso acid zzso were identified by sequence comparisons of seven zzso family members; zzso of the zzso acid zzso were zzso and zzso of the zzso were identical in at least four of the seven zzso The consensus sequence was used to make zzso function predictions for this zzso zzso family of zzso
