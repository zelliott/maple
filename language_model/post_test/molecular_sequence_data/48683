Here we have isolated seven zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso from the potato variety zzso zzso zzso library by affecting necessary modifications in the screening zzso The zzso sequences were identified with a pair of zzso complementary to the most zzso sequences identified in potato variety zzso zzso zzso Our data strongly suggest the zzso nature of potato zzso All deduced zzso acid sequences contain a putative signal zzso one zzso region at the zzso zzso and five zzso zzso regions zzso (except zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso proteins shared high level of DNA sequence identity among themselves, representing a family of proteins markedly distinct from other zzso as well as zzso zzso Two zzso sequences zzso and zzso were zzso in bacteria and zzso proteins were found accumulated in inclusion bodies, even thought they were fused with zzso Additionally, we present the first successful in zzso attempt at zzso and zzso of zzso potato zzso zzso The ratio of zzso zzso of zzso zzso was determined as zzso Unlike other zzso the zzso lacked zzso and was endowed with lower molecular weight, high specificity for zzso zzso and very low specificity for zzso suggesting that zzso is a potato zzso not described so zzso
