The zzso protein contains two zzso zzso a paired domain and a zzso zzso in zzso cause zzso syndrome zzso in humans and the mouse zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso a zzso in the zzso paired domain zzso abrogates the zzso activity of both the paired domain and the zzso suggesting that they may functionally zzso To investigate this possibility further, we have analyzed the zzso properties of additional point zzso in the zzso paired domain and zzso that occur in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the paired domain, zzso and zzso in the zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a substitution associated with zzso anomaly in the zzso gene zzso Within the paired domain, seven of 10 zzso were found to abrogate zzso by the paired zzso zzso these seven zzso also affected DNA binding by the zzso causing either a complete loss zzso and zzso a reduction zzso zzso zzso and zzso or an increase in zzso activity zzso In addition, the effect of paired domain zzso occurred at the level of zzso formation by the zzso while the zzso potential of this domain seemed unaffected in zzso where it could be zzso Furthermore, while both zzso zzso were found to abolish DNA binding by this domain, the zzso zzso also zzso DNA binding by the paired zzso The important observation that independent zzso in either domain can affect DNA binding by the other in the intact zzso protein strongly suggests that the two zzso are not functionally independent but bind DNA through cooperative zzso Modeling the zzso zzso on the three-dimensional structure of the paired domain of zzso zzso shows that these zzso cluster at the DNA zzso thus suggesting that a series of DNA contacts are essential for DNA binding by both the paired domain and the zzso of zzso
