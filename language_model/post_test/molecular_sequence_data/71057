The expression of zzso zzso by zzso strains of zzso coli is regulated at the zzso level and requires the zzso regulator zzso a member of the zzso family of regulatory zzso zzso binds at two separate sites upstream of zzso (the promoter of zzso zzso zzso which were identified in zzso with an zzso fusion protein in gel mobility and zzso I zzso zzso At each site, zzso recognizes zzso zzso sequences in two regions of the major groove and binds along one face of the DNA zzso Both binding sites are required for zzso of zzso in zzso because zzso of either site significantly reduced the level of expression from this zzso Thus, zzso regulates the expression of zzso zzso genes directly, not via a regulatory zzso Analysis of zzso interactions at each site suggests that binding sites for zzso and related zzso regulators are not easily identified because they do not bind zzso or repeated zzso A strategy to identify zzso binding sites is presented and applied to locate potential binding sites upstream of other genes that zzso can zzso including those zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso coli and the global regulator zzso of zzso zzso
