A zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso approach is applied to identify active site zzso within influenza zzso that bind the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso Combined data from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso complexes have identified binding peptides that contain the active site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The binding of these zzso was confirmed from the analysis of available X-ray crystal zzso The ability to identify peptides within the active sites of proteins and likely binding zzso provides both a rapid and relatively high zzso approach with which to screen zzso interactions by zzso mass zzso
