The crystal structure of zzso bound to a naturally occurring zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso consisting of zzso zzso 2 zzso and 3 zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso Two zzso complexes form a zzso zzso zzso Within each complex, zzso interacts extensively with zzso and D3 as well as with the zzso between the two zzso The zzso is stabilized by interactions between zzso and zzso of the adjoining complex and by a direct interaction between zzso of each zzso A positively charged canyon formed by a cluster of exposed basic zzso likely represents the zzso zzso A general model for zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso from the crystal structure, unifying a wealth of zzso zzso
