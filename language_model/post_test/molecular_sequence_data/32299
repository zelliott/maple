zzso is an extremely potent negative regulator of zzso skeletal muscle zzso A zzso analysis suggests that zzso should possess four distinct zzso although only zzso zzso have been zzso Described zzso are the rainbow trout zzso zzso and zzso genes and zzso analysis of their promoters and their quantitative expression zzso Both genes are similarly zzso contain several putative zzso response zzso and are legitimate zzso zzso based on zzso zzso However, zzso contains two zzso stop zzso within the first zzso and zzso zzso of both transcripts were expressed in a zzso zzso Complete zzso of zzso occurred only in brain, where expression is zzso whereas zzso transcripts were mostly present in zzso zzso The presence of stop zzso in the zzso open reading frame and the expression of mostly zzso transcripts indicate that this particular zzso is a zzso These results confirm our previous zzso analysis and suggest that all zzso likely possess four distinct myostatin zzso The zzso expression and differential processing of both zzso transcripts as well the zzso of zzso may reflect zzso and zzso responses to zzso and may help limit zzso influences primarily to neural zzso
