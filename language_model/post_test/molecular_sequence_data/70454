We report here a novel zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso that is most similar to the zzso zzso zzso The coding region of the human zzso gene predicts a seven zzso domain zzso of 522 zzso acids and having a relatively large zzso of 147 zzso zzso The zzso sequence has zzso zzso acid identity to zzso receptors and similar percentage identity to zzso receptors zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals an abundant zzso zzso zzso transcript in human zzso zzso zzso determined additional sites of expression in zzso zzso and small zzso These sites of zzso expression suggest a potential role for the novel zzso in signaling to zzso undergoing active cell growth and zzso At low levels, zzso message is zzso in several other zzso including zzso zzso brain, heart, zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, and zzso
