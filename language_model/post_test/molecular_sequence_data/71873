zzso zzso zzso zzso produces zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The concerted actions of these zzso largely determine the zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also produces zzso the zzso of the hypersensitive zzso We document here that zzso zzso zzso zzso general zzso of genes involved in zzso and zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso controls not only the zzso zzso and zzso but also zzso zzso and zzso production in zzso zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts are markedly affected by zzso The zzso zzso is more virulent than the zzso zzso Thus, our data for the first time establish a global regulatory role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Another novel observation is the negative effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which specifies an zzso regulator controlling zzso and zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso are higher in the zzso zzso than in the zzso zzso Moreover, by zzso I protection zzso we determined that zzso zzso protected three zzso regions within the zzso unit of zzso zzso of the protected sequences revealed the zzso consensus sequence of the zzso site as zzso Two such zzso sites occur in zzso DNA in a close proximity to each other within zzso zzso and zzso and the third zzso site within zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso sites zzso affect the expression of zzso zzso also binds the operator zzso of zzso and zzso genes and zzso expression of a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso affects zzso zzso production by two ways: zzso directly, by zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by preventing the production of a global zzso zzso Our findings support the idea that zzso affects zzso by promoter zzso zzso preventing the initiation of transcription, and by a roadblock zzso zzso by affecting the zzso of zzso
