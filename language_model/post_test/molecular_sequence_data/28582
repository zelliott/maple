In this report, we describe a simple approach to produce a large quantity of a zzso zzso zzso containing four pairs of zzso zzso A zzso zzso the toxin was zzso in frame, to the zzso zzso of zzso via a zzso sequence zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Due to the presence of zzso a soluble form of the fusion protein was expressed in a zzso sensitive to zzso pressure, in zzso zzso The fusion protein was released into the solution with low zzso strength under an zzso shock treatment, and zzso in a single step using an zzso exchange zzso zzso The zzso protein was treated in diluted zzso acid to induce zzso of the protein at the zzso zzso zzso Then, the zzso zzso was zzso by gel zzso of the zzso zzso When the biological activity of the zzso toxin was zzso it was as potent as the natural zzso Using this zzso approximately 12 zzso of pure zzso zzso can be produced from one liter of bacterial zzso More importantly, this protocol can be easily used for the production of the toxin at a larger scale with low zzso The approach outlined in this report will be suitable for the production of other zzso proteins especially those of the zzso zzso
