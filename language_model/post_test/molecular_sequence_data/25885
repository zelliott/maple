zzso gene expression experiments have shown that genes of zzso are often not transcribed in zzso or produce zzso that is zzso or zzso zzso It is however not known how correctly and efficiently zzso gene expression signals are recognized in cells of zzso Here we address this question using tobacco zzso zzso and rice zzso zzso zzso transformed with the same hybrid gene zzso zzso including the zzso protein coding sequence fused to zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter and zzso signals were used to obtain zzso transformed cell lines of tobacco and zzso In one of the zzso the zzso coding region is interrupted by a modified zzso sequence from the soybean zzso zzso Although the mean number of hybrid gene copies integrated into the rice zzso was on average zzso to zzso higher than in zzso the zzso transcript level was 3 times zzso A lower level of transcript was also observed in transient expression zzso The amount of the mature zzso was not influenced by the presence of the zzso The zzso zzso was processed in rice with high efficiency and an accuracy indistinguishable from that seen in zzso
