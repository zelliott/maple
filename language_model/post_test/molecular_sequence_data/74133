zzso zzso is a common poultry litter amendment used to decrease zzso zzso or reduce zzso zzso or zzso Although the zzso effects of zzso addition have been well zzso little attention has been given to the poultry litter microbial zzso The goal of this study was to use molecular biological methods zzso zzso gel zzso zzso community zzso and quantitative real-time zzso to characterize general, zzso and zzso microbial communities in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso According to quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso addition to the poultry litter resulted in significant reductions in both zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso by the end of the first month of the experiment (3 log and 2 zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso were below detection zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso for the entire zzso The zzso analyses revealed significant reductions in the zzso and low zzso zzso groups in the zzso litters by the end of the first month, with no bands zzso for either group after 8 zzso of zzso zzso minimal effects of zzso addition were observed in the zzso zzso The most significant shift in the microbial community (based on zzso zzso occurred in the zzso population, with a large increase in diversity and abundance within 1 zzso of zzso addition (1 dominant band on d 0 to 9 dominant bands at 4 zzso Specifically, the zzso of zzso zzso increased from 0 to 50% of the sequences in zzso clone libraries zzso zzso zzso over the course of the zzso This suggests that the addition of zzso to poultry litter potentially shifts the microbial populations from zzso dominated to dominated by zzso The ramifications of this shift in dominance are still unknown, and future work will be aimed at characterizing these zzso and zzso their role in the zzso litter zzso
