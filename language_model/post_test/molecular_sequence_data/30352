Type IV collagen is a major structural component of basement zzso Four constituent zzso have been described and characterized to different zzso Whereas the primary structure of the alpha zzso and alpha zzso chains has been completely established, only short protein sequences have been reported for the recently recognized alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso We have isolated overlapping human zzso clones whose derived zzso acid sequence is highly zzso to the alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso However, these clones code for neither alpha zzso nor alpha zzso and thus this new zzso has been designated the alpha 5 chain of type IV zzso To determine whether the gene zzso the alpha zzso chain is zzso with the zzso arranged alpha zzso and alpha zzso genes at zzso the alpha zzso cloned DNA was zzso to zzso DNA from zzso cell hybrids and to zzso zzso The results demonstrated that the alpha zzso collagen gene is located on the long arm of the X zzso Since 14 collagen genes have previously been assigned to nine zzso these data represent the first mapping of a collagen gene to the X zzso Most important, the alpha zzso gene has been zzso to bands zzso which are in the same region known to contain the locus for the zzso form of zzso zzso It is therefore possible that this severe zzso inherited zzso zzso by splitting of the zzso basement zzso could be caused by zzso in the alpha zzso collagen zzso
