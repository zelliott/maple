zzso S is a zzso zzso inhibitor that is zzso expressed during rat zzso zzso development and can be induced by zzso in the zzso A zzso for rat zzso S which included the entire coding sequence of the zzso zzso was zzso A coding region of the zzso gene was amplified by zzso chain reaction and cloned into the zzso expression zzso The zzso zzso was transformed into zzso coli, and protein expression was induced by zzso The expressed protein was zzso from zzso inclusion bodies after zzso with zzso and fast protein liquid zzso on a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso reacted with zzso to zzso S zzso from rat zzso zzso and showed an zzso zzso acid sequence identical to that of rat zzso zzso The zzso protein exhibited zzso zzso activity comparable to natural zzso This was a successful expression and zzso of a functionally and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli, an approach which will be used later towards generating zzso zzso to study the binding and functional zzso of this zzso zzso zzso
