To fully assess the role of zzso in tumor zzso zzso that can block all sources of vascular zzso growth factor zzso are zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso overlooks the contribution of host zzso zzso Other strategies, such as targeting zzso receptors directly or using zzso zzso result in zzso not only zzso but also zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor, zzso and zzso which may play a role in zzso Here we report the identification of novel zzso zzso B20 and zzso from synthetic zzso zzso libraries, which block both human and zzso zzso action in zzso Their zzso zzso completely inhibit three human tumor zzso in mice of skeletal muscle, zzso and pancreatic origins zzso zzso and zzso zzso which only zzso the zzso human zzso is approximately zzso effective at zzso zzso and zzso growth but is zzso effective at zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso tumors contain more host zzso invasion and zzso zzso than other zzso Thus, the functional contribution of zzso zzso varies greatly among tumors, and systemic blockade of both tumor and zzso zzso is sufficient for zzso the growth of tumor zzso
