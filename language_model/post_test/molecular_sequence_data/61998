We describe the characterization of the zzso DNA zzso of two multiple myeloma zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso events are present in many zzso tumors, and it is proposed that they occur early in the zzso based on the assumption that the zzso are simple zzso events zzso by errors in zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence from two patients that the zzso event can be more complex, with DNA from zzso band zzso joined to apparently already zzso hybrid zzso switch region zzso In one case, there was also evidence that a further zzso had occurred at the zzso zzso site, resulting in an inversion of 40 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This suggests that primary zzso arrangements in zzso may be more complex than previous myeloma models have suggested, but that they essentially occur through illegitimate zzso zzso
