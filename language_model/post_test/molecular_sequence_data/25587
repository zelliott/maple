zzso growth hormone zzso type zzso is an zzso zzso disease caused by deletion of both growth zzso zzso zzso Ten patients from zzso geographic origins showed differences in restriction zzso length zzso zzso in zzso regions that flanked zzso suggesting that these deletions arose from independent unequal zzso zzso zzso acid zzso samples from nine of ten patients showed that crossovers occurred within zzso zzso zzso pair zzso segments that flanked zzso A DNA sample from one patient indicated that the crossover occurred within zzso segments that flanked zzso and contained zzso repeats that are zzso zzso Although zzso repeats, which are frequent sites of zzso are adjacent to zzso they were not involved in any of the zzso events zzso These results suggest that length and degree of DNA sequence zzso are important in defining zzso sites that resulted in zzso zzso
