zzso E6 and zzso two viral zzso are expressed from a single zzso zzso In this report, we provide the evidence that the zzso zzso zzso 1 contains three zzso zzso sites zzso zzso and three 3' zzso sites zzso zzso normally used in zzso cervical cancer and its derived cell zzso The choice of two novel alternative zzso zzso zzso 221 zzso zzso and zzso 191 zzso zzso produces two novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso 226 zzso zzso and zzso 409 3' zzso is zzso selected over the other zzso sites crossing over the zzso to zzso a minimal length of the zzso in zzso zzso We identified zzso as the preferred branch point sequence zzso and an zzso at zzso 385 zzso in the zzso as a branch site to dictate the selection of the zzso 409 3' zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Introduction of point zzso into the mapped zzso led to reduced U2 binding to the zzso and thereby zzso of the second step of zzso zzso at the zzso 409 3' zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso and inefficient zzso makes little or no zzso and the resulted E6 with zzso of zzso to zzso displays zzso activity on zzso zzso Together, our data provide structural basis of the zzso zzso 1 for better understanding of how viral E6 and zzso expression is regulated by alternative zzso zzso This study zzso for the first time a mapped branch point in zzso zzso involved in viral zzso zzso
