A novel zzso strain zzso was isolated from soil using enrichment cultures with the organic zzso zzso acid as sole carbon and energy zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed zzso % sequence similarities to a poorly characterized member of the family zzso strain zzso which had been previously isolated from activated zzso Both strains showed highest gene sequence similarities (up to zzso zzso to members of the zzso zzso and zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and the zzso zzso value between these two strains was zzso zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids in both strains were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and summed feature 3 zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso iso zzso The major zzso fatty acid was zzso : zzso zzso Based on the genetic and zzso data, strains zzso and zzso represent two novel species of a new zzso within the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is assigned to zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type strain of the type species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso
