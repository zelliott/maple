To extend comparative zzso analyses of the zzso we produced zzso data by direct zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso m zzso and bottom zzso of the Sea of zzso the gateway between the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black zzso Data from small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene libraries and direct zzso of the same samples indicated that zzso and zzso followed by zzso dominated the bacterial fraction in zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso were the most abundant groups in high zzso zzso Group I zzso dominated the zzso zzso zzso although group II and III zzso were also zzso zzso were highly diverse in zzso zzso gene libraries, with group I zzso and II zzso zzso and zzso dominating zzso and zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso sequences were scarce in zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were abundant in zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso Genes involved in zzso reduction, carbon monoxide zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso Genome recruitment analyses showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were highly represented in zzso zzso zzso A comparative analysis of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and surface zzso whale zzso Peru subsurface zzso and soil zzso clustered zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and whale zzso likely because of the zzso conditions in the deep zzso water zzso The zzso zzso clustered with the soil zzso highlighting the common ecological role of both types of microbial communities in the degradation of organic matter and the completion of zzso zzso
