To clone a novel mouse zzso protein like 2 zzso zzso and to analysis its primary zzso 

With the aid of computer, the human zzso zzso was used as information probe to search mouse zzso database of zzso for mouse zzso A series of overlapping zzso were found and assembled into an zzso zzso using zzso Computer Group zzso zzso zzso The existence of the gene was then identified by zzso Northern zzso was performed to zzso zzso labeled probe with zzso of 11 different mouse zzso that had been transferred to the nylon zzso 

The novel gene was deposited in zzso under zzso No zzso Its zzso contained an intact open reading frame and a zzso zzso signal zzso followed by zzso The deduced protein was completely identical to that of human zzso and was termed zzso by Mouse Gene zzso zzso The putative protein of zzso has a calculated molecular weight of 13 700 and an zzso point of zzso It was also predicted to contain two protein zzso C zzso sites and one zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso showed that zzso was expressed as a single zzso zzso transcript, with high levels in brain, zzso zzso heart, zzso and liver, and low in zzso zzso small zzso zzso and zzso 

A novel mouse zzso gene was cloned and zzso
