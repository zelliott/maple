zzso zzso zzso zzso promoters have been classified as class II and class III on the basis of their relative location in zzso DNA as well as on the function of the protein products zzso by the messages transcribed from zzso In the present work, the efficiency of zzso of several class II and class III promoters by zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared with regard to zzso rate of initiation of zzso as determined by zzso exchange with zzso zzso complex formation between zzso and promoters in the presence of zzso and zzso competition between different promoters for zzso zzso zzso in a standard zzso zzso The results of these experiments indicated that the class II promoters at zzso and zzso zzso map units, whose promoter sequences are remarkably similar to the consensus class III promoter zzso are nearly as strong as typical class III zzso In contrast, the class II promoter at zzso zzso map units, whose promoter sequence differs from the consensus class III promoter sequence by having a zzso base pair instead of a usual zzso base pair at the zzso position, was considerably weaker than the class III zzso When the zzso base pair at this position was changed to zzso using zzso zzso the rate of initiation of zzso synthesis from the zzso promoter was similar to that of a typical class III zzso In agreement with this zzso it was observed that changing the zzso base pair at the zzso position of a strong class II promoter, at zzso zzso map units, to zzso decreased the rate of zzso synthesis from this promoter by about zzso These observations indicate that the zzso zzso at the zzso position play a critical role in determining the efficiency of promoter zzso by zzso zzso zzso The two termination sites recognized in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso have been zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of the DNA zzso sequence surrounding the termination site at zzso map units indicated that the putative zzso transcript arising from this region can be arranged into a zzso zzso structure followed by a zzso 3' zzso However, a major fraction of zzso zzso zzso molecules read through this zzso in zzso to transcribe regions of zzso DNA beyond this zzso In contrast to termination at zzso map units, termination of zzso at 100 zzso map units does not occur in response to any putative zzso structure or zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
