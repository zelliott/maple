A pepper zzso protein zzso zzso , zzso the zzso zzso zzso factor was isolated from pepper leaves zzso with an zzso strain zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is a nuclear targeting zzso which functions as a zzso zzso The full-length zzso had no zzso zzso activity, whereas the zzso region of zzso had zzso zzso The zzso transcripts were zzso expressed in the pepper zzso zzso flower and red fruit, but were not zzso in the leaf and green zzso The zzso transcripts accumulated earlier than the zzso zzso gene in the incompatible interaction of the pepper leaves with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcripts were significantly induced in the zzso zzso leaf zzso early after zzso with bacterial zzso but gradually declined zzso The zzso transcripts were zzso and confined to the zzso cells of the vascular bundle in the pepper leaf zzso in response to zzso zzso infection, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was also induced much earlier by zzso zzso and environmental zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in the transgenic zzso plants enhanced not only the resistance against infection by zzso zzso zzso tomato, but also the drought zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene functions as an zzso gene to enhance disease resistance and drought zzso
