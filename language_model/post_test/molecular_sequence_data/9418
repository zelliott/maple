Marine zzso fish have zzso and adapted to thousands of zzso and lakes formed since the last ice age, providing an exceptional opportunity to characterize zzso mechanisms underlying repeated ecological adaptation in zzso Here we develop a high-quality reference zzso assembly for zzso zzso By sequencing the zzso of zzso additional individuals from a global set of marine and freshwater zzso we identify a zzso set of zzso that are consistently associated with zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso of globally shared standing genetic variation, including zzso zzso has an important role in repeated evolution of distinct marine and freshwater zzso and in the maintenance of divergent zzso during early stages of zzso zzso Both coding and regulatory changes occur in the set of zzso underlying zzso evolution, but regulatory changes appear to predominate in this well known example of repeated zzso evolution in zzso
