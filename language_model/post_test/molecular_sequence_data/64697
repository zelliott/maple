zzso zzso and zzso zzso generated during complement zzso play a key role in zzso zzso is the most potent of the three zzso in zzso biological zzso The effects of zzso are zzso by its binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso To date, zzso has only been identified and cloned in zzso species, and its evolutionary history remains zzso To gain insights into the evolution, zzso structural zzso and functions of zzso we have cloned and characterized a zzso in rainbow trout, a zzso zzso The isolated zzso zzso a zzso protein that showed the highest sequence similarity to zzso from other zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of one continuous zzso zzso the entire open reading zzso Northern zzso analysis showed significant expression of the trout zzso zzso zzso message in zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that two zzso generated against two different areas of the zzso zzso region of zzso positively stained the same zzso populations from zzso B zzso and zzso comprised the majority of cells recognized by the zzso More importantly, these zzso inhibited zzso of zzso toward a zzso fraction zzso from zzso trout zzso Our data suggest that the split between zzso and zzso from a common ancestral zzso occurred before the emergence of zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that the overall structure of zzso as well as its role in zzso have remained zzso for zzso million zzso
