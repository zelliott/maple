zzso have exciting therapeutic potential based on their high selectivity and affinity for zzso zzso zzso The spacing between the zzso zzso in zzso is zzso leading to the zzso of zzso zzso is the only zzso containing a zzso zzso spacing and thus it is of significant interest to examine the structure of this zzso 

In the current study we show the native zzso zzso connectivity of zzso displays multiple zzso in solution whereas the non-native ribbon zzso has a single zzso zzso Despite having multiple zzso in solution the zzso form of zzso displays activity at the zzso zzso zzso contrasting with the lack of activity of the structurally zzso ribbon zzso 

These findings are opposite to the general trends observed for zzso where the native zzso have zzso structures and the ribbon zzso are generally zzso This study thus highlights the influence of the zzso connectivity of zzso on the dynamics of the three-dimensional zzso
