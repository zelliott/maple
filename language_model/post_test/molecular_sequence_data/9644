The zzso protein zzso is a member of a family of zzso factors that regulate zzso development and cell cycle zzso zzso zzso gene expression is required for correct cell pattern formation during asexual reproduction zzso and for initiation of the sexual zzso cycle in zzso zzso zzso initiation from two different promoters yields overlapping zzso zzso alpha and zzso that upon translation yield the same zzso Here we show that multiple regulatory mechanisms interact to control zzso zzso zzso expression of both transcripts and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso but not zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of both zzso are further modulated by zzso an zzso located at a zzso upstream zzso zzso zzso feedback regulation by zzso and zzso positive zzso regulation that requires the zzso product of a zzso reading frame unique to the zzso alpha zzso zzso untranslated zzso zzso in zzso alpha expression were most important for correct cell and tissue type zzso zzso requirements were as zzso zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso expression affected zzso zzso and zzso yields zzso but did not alter the zzso development of cell types or zzso zzso By contrast, the sexual cycle showed both zzso delay and quantitative reduction in the number of zzso zzso but normal zzso of tissue zzso
