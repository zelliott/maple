An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a goldfish retinal zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed zzso gene expression in both retinal zzso cells and zzso zzso This expression was reduced during zzso nerve zzso and this decreased level of gene expression lasted until the zzso of zzso These findings suggest that interactions between zzso nerve and its target, the zzso zzso are necessary for maintaining zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in both retinal and zzso zzso
