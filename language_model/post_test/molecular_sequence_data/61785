During male sexual development in zzso birds, and zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso ducts that normally form the zzso of the female zzso zzso Whereas zzso duct zzso occurs during fetal development in zzso zzso in zzso zzso this process occurs after zzso To investigate zzso in a zzso we isolated an zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and characterized its expression in the zzso and zzso during zzso The zzso zzso gene is highly zzso with the zzso zzso that have been zzso particularly within the zzso zzso mature zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is divergent and larger than that of zzso zzso It is located on zzso zzso consistent with its zzso zzso in other zzso The zzso zzso regulatory region, like zzso zzso zzso contains binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso factors but also contains a putative zzso zzso zzso expression in the developing zzso begins at the time of zzso zzso formation at 2 days post zzso and zzso duct zzso begins shortly zzso In the developing zzso zzso is localized in the zzso of the zzso cells but is lost by zzso In the developing zzso there is no zzso zzso zzso but in adults it is produced by the zzso cells of primary and secondary zzso It is not zzso in zzso zzso zzso these studies suggest that zzso expression has been zzso during zzso evolution and is intimately linked to upstream sex determination zzso
