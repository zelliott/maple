The complete zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso was zzso in 35 reference strains of the zzso zzso zzso Twelve distinct ITS sequences were zzso each of which defined a zzso a zzso consists of the strain or strains which have a particular zzso ITS sequences were identified which corresponded to zzso zzso (16 zzso four ITS zzso and zzso zzso (12 zzso one ITS zzso The other seven zzso zzso complex strains had ITS sequences which varied greatly from those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and from each zzso The zzso zzso ITS was much more variable than zzso zzso which is widely used for zzso and species zzso zzso trees based on the ITS were compatible with those based on zzso zzso but were more detailed and had longer zzso The results of ITS sequencing were consistent with the results of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for 30 of 31 strains zzso zzso testing correlated poorly with ITS zzso zzso with the same sequence were different zzso and those of the same zzso had different zzso zzso of the zzso zzso ITS should be useful for species and strain differentiation for a wide variety of bacteria and should be zzso to studies of zzso diagnosis, zzso and zzso
