zzso is involved in tumor growth, zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso stimulates zzso by binding to specific receptors zzso on the surface of vascular zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso that, like the zzso growth factor receptors zzso contain a large insert within the zzso zzso 

We report here the generation, kinetic zzso and zzso A crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso 2 zzso This protein zzso which lacks 50 central zzso of the zzso zzso insert domain zzso has comparable zzso activity to zzso containing the entire zzso The crystal structure, determined in an zzso zzso state, reveals an overall fold and zzso zzso positions similar to those observed in other zzso zzso The zzso zzso loop, zzso on zzso prior to zzso is mostly zzso however, a portion of it occupies a position zzso to zzso zzso The ends of the zzso form a zzso structure, not observed in other known zzso zzso structures, that packs near to the zzso C zzso 

The majority of the zzso zzso zzso are not necessary for zzso zzso The unique structure observed for the ends of the zzso may also occur in other zzso family members and may serve to properly orient the zzso for signal zzso This zzso zzso structure provides a target for design of selective zzso therapeutic zzso
