Twelve zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso roots of the wild rice species zzso zzso and characterized by zzso and molecular zzso Six zzso were grouped together as group A by zzso characters, and this grouping was confirmed by zzso zzso protein patterns and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that group A, represented by strain zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso except that zzso zzso zzso has a 70 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso % similarity to the type zzso zzso gene sequence analysis also showed strain zzso zzso has the highest sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but supported the distinct zzso Biological and zzso tests, protein patterns, zzso DNA zzso zzso resistance and comparison of cellular fatty acids showed differences among group A, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distinguished strain zzso zzso from closely zzso related zzso zzso Based on these data, the novel species zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
