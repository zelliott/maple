zzso other zzso and guinea pigs are missing an zzso zzso zzso which zzso the last step of zzso acid zzso We have recently isolated a zzso zzso this zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso using this zzso as a probe demonstrated that guinea pigs lack zzso for zzso zzso Nevertheless, existence of a DNA sequence related to this zzso in the zzso of this animal was shown by Southern zzso zzso The human zzso was also found to contain a sequence that is zzso with the zzso zzso however, the degree of zzso was less than those of zzso with the zzso zzso genes of animals possessing the zzso suggesting that the human zzso zzso gene has zzso more rapidly than the genes of zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis was confirmed by comparison of a partial zzso sequence of the human gene with that of the rat zzso The zzso zzso sequences in the guinea pig and human zzso may represent the remnants of the gene of the zzso that were once active but became zzso during the course of zzso
