The generation of zzso is impaired in newborns due to an immature immune system and reduced exposure to pathogens due to zzso derived zzso and zzso zzso During zzso the immune system of newborns is challenged with multiple zzso zzso zzso them, zzso are the main zzso In particular, human zzso zzso was recently shown to possess zzso zzso We were thus interested to determine if zzso to zzso are induced by breast-feeding and may be sustained into zzso 

62 zzso of healthy adult individuals who were zzso or were not zzso zzso against human zzso were investigated by a new zzso zzso zzso For zzso these zzso were tested for anti zzso virus zzso zzso by a commercial zzso 

zzso were predominantly detected in individuals who had been zzso At a zzso value of zzso the zzso identified individuals with a history of having been zzso with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso Under these conditions, 35 out of 37 zzso from healthy donors, who where zzso reacted positively but only 5 zzso of the 25 donors who were not zzso The duration of breast-feeding was of no consequence to the zzso reaction as some healthy donors were only short term zzso (5 days minimum until 6 weeks zzso but exhibited significant serum reaction against human zzso zzso 

We zzso that human zzso is an zzso The zzso is orally determined, caused by zzso and sustained into zzso
