zzso repair mediates zzso bypass of DNA damage in a series of steps that include zzso of the replication fork, zzso switching to use the other daughter strand as an undamaged template, primer extension, primer switching back to its zzso template with the primer zzso now having zzso the damage, and fork zzso to a normal zzso By both genetic and zzso criteria, zzso T4 zzso replication repair with two alternative sets of zzso one including the zzso zzso and the zzso DNA zzso and the other including the zzso zzso In each pathway, synthesis is conducted by the zzso DNA zzso Here we show that defects in zzso zzso or zzso that impair replication repair also increase zzso rates generally, but especially for zzso zzso Such zzso zzso are associated with zzso or direct repeats that are either perfect or zzso Models of zzso zzso require that the primer zzso switches to an zzso template, but one that yields zzso instead of zzso zzso We suggest that the proteins that conduct replication repair normally direct a blocked primer strand specifically to the other daughter strand with considerable zzso but that strand switching becomes zzso when these proteins are zzso impaired, thus promoting zzso zzso
