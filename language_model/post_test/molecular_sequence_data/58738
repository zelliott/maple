zzso have been constructed that allow integration by a double zzso event at the zzso locus of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These plasmids can be used either for construction of zzso strains and zzso analysis, or for construction of zzso zzso to the zzso coli zzso zzso The plasmids contain an zzso zzso marker zzso in zzso as well as an additional An marker outside of the region that can recombine into the zzso When used in conjunction with recipient strains containing a third An marker at their zzso zzso these plasmids allow easy identification of zzso issued from a marker exchange event without additional zzso zzso The existing plasmids used for zzso integration at the zzso locus have been modified zzso
