The genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the fifth and sixth zzso in the de zzso zzso zzso pathway, are fused as zzso in most zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso linked zzso fusion is present in zzso belonging to zzso together with zzso in a zzso zzso Here, we show the presence of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso while zzso in zzso zzso another zzso species belonging to zzso These results suggest that the zzso fusion event occurred in a common zzso of zzso Genome sequence database searches further revealed the presence of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso reconstruction of zzso and zzso rejected statistically the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso demonstrating that these gene zzso do not share a common evolutionary origin, despite the identical gene zzso Thus, the zzso fusion is likely to have emerged independently in these zzso zzso zzso analyses also suggested that zzso zzso arose via lateral zzso We conclude that gene fusion events occur more frequently than previously thought and that lateral gene transfer has made a marked contribution to establishment of the rearranged structure of zzso and zzso genes in zzso
