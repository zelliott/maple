The zzso proteins isolated from zzso plaques and the zzso of Alzheimer's disease are zzso zzso termed A4 protein and zzso zzso A putative A4 zzso precursor zzso termed zzso has been characterized by analysis of a human brain complementary zzso We report here the sequence of a closely related zzso zzso zzso distinguished from zzso by the presence of a zzso zzso zzso sequence which adds 57 zzso acids to, and removes one zzso from, the predicted zzso zzso The zzso predicted from this insert is very similar to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso in a limited survey, zzso zzso appears to be zzso whereas zzso zzso has a restricted pattern of expression which includes cells from zzso zzso These data may have significant implications for understanding zzso deposition in Alzheimer's zzso
