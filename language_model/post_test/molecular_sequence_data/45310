zzso sequence repeats zzso were investigated in the zzso sequences from expressed sequence tags zzso of sweet orange zzso zzso zzso zzso orange zzso zzso zzso and other citrus species and zzso A total of 37 802 citrus zzso sequences corresponding to zzso zzso were zzso resulting in the identification of zzso zzso Among them there were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 114 zzso zzso 23 zzso zzso and 40 zzso zzso zzso The estimated frequency of zzso was approximately zzso zzso which could be zzso to 1 zzso zzso in zzso zzso The maximum length of the zzso ranged from 40 to 105 zzso depending on the repeating numbers of the motif in the zzso The overall average length of zzso was zzso zzso The zzso of different zzso types zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were very similar between sweet orange and zzso zzso The zzso repeats appeared to be the most abundant zzso within sweet orange and zzso orange, followed by zzso zzso The zzso rich repeats such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in each type of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso repeats were less zzso Twenty-five primer pairs zzso zzso zzso were designed to detect the possible zzso of six citrus zzso including sweet orange and zzso zzso The zzso result with all these 25 primer pairs revealed the existence of zzso within six citrus zzso confirming that citrus zzso database could be efficiently exploited for the development of zzso zzso zzso
