The human gene that zzso the DNA repair zzso of the zzso cell zzso zzso is designated zzso and is the first human gene to be cloned that has an established role in DNA zzso zzso In this study, either an zzso zzso zzso zzso or synthetic zzso were zzso to an incomplete zzso zzso to generate two full-length zzso zzso zzso The ability of these zzso zzso to restore normal levels of sister zzso exchange zzso to zzso upon zzso was demonstrated, and the zzso grew at normal rates in selective medium that is fully toxic to zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso open reading frame zzso was transcribed from the zzso early promoter or the zzso zzso native promoter were compared in their efficiency of zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso promoter displayed fewer zzso and lower sensitivity to zzso than either zzso zzso cells or zzso containing the zzso transcribed from the native zzso
