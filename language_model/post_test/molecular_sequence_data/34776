zzso zzso for zzso secondary structure with zzso methods has become an important approach to the zzso of zzso zzso However, due to the lack of efficient zzso for accurate zzso zzso zzso computer programs capable of fast and effectively searching zzso for zzso secondary structures have not been zzso In this paper, a novel zzso structure profiling model is introduced based on the notion of a zzso graph to specify the consensus structure of an zzso zzso Tree decomposition yields a small tree zzso zzso for such zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 for stem zzso and only a slight increase for zzso Within this zzso zzso the optimal alignment of a sequence to the structure model zzso to finding a maximum valued zzso zzso and consequently can be accomplished through dynamic programming on the tree decomposition of the zzso graph in time zzso where k is a small zzso and N is the size of the zzso zzso zzso zzso show that the application of the alignment zzso to search in zzso yields the same search accuracy as methods based on a zzso model with a significant reduction in zzso zzso In zzso very accurate searches of zzso in bacteria zzso and of zzso zzso in zzso zzso can be accomplished in days, as opposed to months required by other zzso The tree decomposition based searching tool is free upon request and can be downloaded at our site h zzso zzso p zzso
