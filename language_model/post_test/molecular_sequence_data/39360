Because protein identifications rely on matches with sequence databases, zzso zzso is currently largely restricted to those species for which comprehensive sequence databases are zzso The identification of proteins derived from organisms with zzso zzso mainly depends on zzso zzso Here, we report the use of a zzso zzso chemical zzso strategy for de zzso sequence analysis using a zzso mass zzso This approach allows the determination of de zzso zzso sequences of up to 20 zzso acid zzso in zzso The protocol was applied on a zzso study of zzso zzso proteins from zzso zzso an zzso zzso with yet zzso zzso Using three different zzso search zzso we were able to identify more than 30 proteins from this zzso using zzso quantities of zzso
