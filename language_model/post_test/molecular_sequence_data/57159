Human zzso zzso zzso I and II zzso and zzso have been isolated independently and characterized in pure zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso in an zzso coli strain which lacks the bacterial zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso to virtual zzso with specific activities of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, values which are zzso higher than any previously reported for this zzso from human zzso Despite zzso zzso acid sequence identity, the zzso differed significantly in several physical and kinetic zzso zzso was more sensitive to heat zzso at 55 degrees C and more susceptible to zzso to inactive forms in the absence of zzso and zzso than was zzso The zzso were zzso on the basis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso also differed significantly in zzso values for zzso and zzso zzso pH zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was less sensitive to feedback zzso by zzso zzso and more sensitive to zzso by zzso than zzso zzso in kinetic properties between zzso and zzso are consistent with the suggestion that zzso zzso in rapidly zzso zzso
