A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso shaped zzso with polar or zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a zzso sample collected from an zzso breeding zone in the coastal region of zzso zzso The zzso grew zzso at zzso pH zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso or zzso sea zzso zzso zzso Salt was required for zzso The strain contained zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso as major fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso were the major constituents of the zzso A zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso formed a distinct evolutionary lineage within the family zzso It showed zzso sequence similarities to all zzso published species in the family zzso except zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso study, strain zzso zzso zzso zzso was considered to represent a novel zzso and species in zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso
