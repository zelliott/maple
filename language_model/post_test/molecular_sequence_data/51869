Using zzso zzso in zzso we have constructed zzso coli strains that allow the detection of the inversion of an zzso segment in the zzso zzso The zzso segment is bounded by zzso repeats of either 12 or 23 zzso zzso occurring at these zzso repeats will restore the zzso zzso zzso can be detected at both short zzso at zzso ranging from zzso zzso zzso to 1 zzso zzso These events, which have been verified by DNA sequence analysis, are reduced up to zzso in strains deficient for either zzso zzso or zzso They are not reduced in strains deficient in the zzso J zzso These results show that the zzso system can mediate zzso at short sequence repeats, and probably plays a major role in cellular zzso
