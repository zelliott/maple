zzso zzso is one of the most zzso human zzso for which no vaccine is available zzso zzso the impact of the host pressure on pathogen zzso is zzso but so far it was only assessed for zzso geographic zzso We aimed to evaluate the evolutionary picture of the zzso key zzso zzso which is one of the leading zzso vaccine candidates, in a worldwide zzso 

Using zzso molecular evolution methods and mathematical zzso we analyzed all zzso sequences reported worldwide, composed by zzso strains from 33 geographic regions of five zzso Overall, zzso of zzso were zzso The evolutionary pattern of zzso zzso acid zzso was found to differ from the remaining zzso reflecting the demanding constraints of this zzso zzso and dominant zzso zzso acid changes were zzso more frequent in zzso zzso zzso specifically within zzso zzso zzso where zzso of them are at fixation zzso According to the typical zzso arms race, this rampant zzso zzso variation likely represents zzso escape zzso as some zzso were previously shown to abrogate zzso of zzso zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso clusters of diverse zzso zzso are under zzso selection, suggesting a strategy that may lead to immune zzso Moreover, several silent zzso are at zzso generating preferential zzso that may influence zzso and may also reflect zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the most prevalent zzso zzso zzso E and zzso showed a zzso rate zzso lower than that of the remainder zzso suggesting more fitted zzso zzso 

Globally, the zzso evolution of the zzso zzso dominant zzso is likely driven by its complex zzso function and reflects distinct evolutionary zzso scenarios that may benefit the zzso and thus should be taking into account in the development of a zzso zzso
