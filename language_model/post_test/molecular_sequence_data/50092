zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso continues to zzso the human zzso However, because recent insertions are zzso they are not fully represented in sequence zzso Here, we have developed a system, termed zzso zzso typing of zzso active zzso that enables the selective amplification and display of DNA fragments containing the zzso of zzso zzso and their respective zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is robust and that the zzso display patterns are highly zzso segregate in Centre zzso du zzso zzso zzso and provide an zzso zzso zzso also allows the identification of zzso that are absent from current zzso databases, and we show that some of these zzso can zzso at high zzso in cultured human zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso also can identify zzso zzso within a subset of older, zzso zzso Thus, zzso provides a simple, zzso means to assess genetic variation associated with zzso zzso
