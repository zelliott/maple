We have isolated and studied the cloned zzso factors zzso from mustard zzso zzso In functional analyses using both promoter and factor zzso the three zzso proteins all had similar basic properties but also revealed differences in promoter preference and requirements for single zzso zzso Directed zzso genesis of zzso identified critical zzso within the zzso regions zzso and zzso necessary for binding of the zzso and zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso and 2, but not zzso each have a typical region zzso for binding of the extended zzso promoter zzso zzso has a zzso reminiscent of zzso K from zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso from an inactive precursor is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso In addition, zzso was found to be more abundant in zzso as compared to zzso mustard zzso while the converse was true for zzso
