Using the major peanut zzso zzso h 2 as an example, an zzso tool enabling the determination of zzso E zzso in processed food zzso was zzso We zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso linear zzso 3 zzso acid positions zzso of zzso h 2 and raised a zzso zzso against this zzso to obtain a positive control for future zzso resolved zzso First, a zzso of zzso 3, having a molecular mass of zzso zzso was zzso zzso and its structure confirmed by liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assisted laser zzso of flight zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was then used to raise high zzso zzso in rabbits using the zzso zzso and to characterize the specificity of zzso from zzso patients zzso to zzso h zzso The zzso exclusively detects zzso h 2 in crude peanut extract with a zzso of zzso by Western zzso and zzso specifically with zzso 3 shown by zzso mapping for a library of zzso synthetic zzso peptides covering the entire sequence of zzso h zzso Such zzso zzso are of high zzso relevance as they could constitute the basis for zzso detection systems for use in quality control in the food industry or for forensic purposes in cases of fatal reactions to otherwise zzso peanut zzso
