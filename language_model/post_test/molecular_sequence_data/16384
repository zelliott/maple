zzso is an important zzso target of zzso and it plays a critical role in growth arrest after DNA zzso Here, we report the identification of a novel alternate mouse zzso transcript that is zzso in zzso It differs from the classical zzso transcript in the first zzso which is located at approximately zzso zzso upstream of zzso start site of zzso and is sandwiched between two zzso binding zzso This novel zzso transcript is present in most mouse zzso with highest levels of expression in the zzso In contrast to the classical zzso transcript, this new transcript is highly dependent on zzso for its zzso zzso as evidenced by its absence in nearly all of zzso mouse zzso This transcript is also absent at zzso temperature in a zzso mouse cell line lacking zzso zzso and harboring zzso zzso zzso However, this novel transcript is induced to appreciable levels in the presence of high zzso activity at the zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso induction of zzso may be an additive effect zzso by individual increases in the alternate and classical zzso zzso
