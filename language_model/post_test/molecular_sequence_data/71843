African zzso zzso zzso historically associated with the zzso zzso occur in two geographically distinct zzso One zzso from far West Africa has been previously shown to be zzso and not closely related to the remaining eastern species of zzso zzso zzso Murphy and zzso zzso zzso 1997, zzso zzso zzso 14, zzso This is supported by further analysis of zzso DNA sequences from 19 species from 21 different zzso representing 19 of the putative 22 species of this western zzso zzso analyses of these data corroborate the zzso and zzso relationship of two distinct groups of zzso zzso and zzso Many of the relationships within zzso suggest that these zzso may have radiated within a short period of time relative to the rate of zzso within these zzso A third, and possibly zzso group of species, zzso is suggested to be the sister zzso to the first two zzso These three groups are elevated to generic rank and together represent the sister group to the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that the ancestors of this group diversified westward through zzso habitat and have only relatively recently entered the zzso zzso in which zzso and zzso have zzso with the latter zzso zzso a suite of traits collectively referred to as zzso
