We have previously constructed zzso coli strains in which an zzso zzso is integrated into the origin of zzso zzso zzso In such zzso zzso zzso is inactive and initiation of zzso replication instead takes place at the integrated zzso zzso Due to the large size of the zzso replication zzso generated at the zzso origin in these strains are considerably more zzso than those in zzso zzso zzso We have taken advantage of this and performed primer extensions on total DNA isolated from zzso zzso and mapped the free zzso DNA ends that were generated as replication zzso during zzso replication in zzso The sensitivity of the mapping was considerably improved by the use of a repeated primer extension method zzso The free DNA ends were assumed to represent normal in zzso start sites for leading strand DNA synthesis in zzso zzso The ends were mapped to a short region approximately 380 zzso away from the zzso minimal origin, and the positions agreed well with previous in zzso zzso The same start positions were also zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso indicating that zzso is not required for determination of the position at which DNA synthesis starts during initiation of replication at the zzso zzso
