In order to detect human zzso zzso DNA in invasive cervical zzso three different zzso chain reactions to amplify different zzso fragments of zzso DNA were carried out on DNA extracted from 93 zzso and zzso tumor zzso This study detected zzso DNA in 54 cases zzso which broke down to zzso 16 in 39 zzso cases, zzso 18 in six zzso zzso 52 in three, zzso 33 in one and zzso zzso type in the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso frequently contained zzso 16, zzso zzso 18 was present in zzso zzso cell zzso and small cell zzso of the zzso zzso study revealed that zzso 16 and 18 DNA found were more frequently than other zzso zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso 18 zzso zzso had a relatively high recurrence zzso These results indicate that cervical zzso might be clinically influenced by the difference in zzso of the infecting zzso
