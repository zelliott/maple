zzso was identified by us as a novel zzso that zzso mouse zzso cells in cooperation with zzso We later identified zzso zzso inhibitor of activated zzso as a zzso zzso and found that zzso restored zzso zzso zzso zzso activity that was zzso by zzso To further characterize the function of zzso we cloned zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be specifically expressed in the zzso In addition to the binding of zzso to the zzso region of zzso zzso was also found to bind in zzso and in zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso in a zzso manner and to be zzso with zzso or zzso in the zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso showed that the formation of a zzso complex between zzso zzso and zzso occurred in cells in which zzso bound to the zzso via zzso It was found that zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso activity in monkey zzso cells by recruiting zzso zzso zzso complex, including zzso and zzso and that zzso partially restored its zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is positively regulated by zzso which zzso the function of negative regulators, including zzso
