In zzso much of the softening process occurs prior to the respiratory zzso and production of zzso This fruit therefore represents an excellent model system for zzso the process of softening in the absence of zzso zzso zzso We have characterized the expression of three zzso zzso zzso clones zzso B and zzso isolated from fruit of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and B was detected by northern analysis only in fruit producing zzso zzso and by zzso in other zzso including flower zzso petals at zzso and zzso zzso zzso promoter fragments of zzso 860 and zzso zzso fused to the zzso zzso reporter gene directed zzso gene expression during the zzso in transgenic zzso zzso gene expression was observed in softening fruit, and reached maximum levels zzso higher than for zzso and zzso as fruit passed through the zzso However, expression of this gene was also readily detected during fruit development and in fruit harvested prior to the onset of zzso Using zzso expression of zzso was also detected at low levels in root tips and in zzso zzso These results suggest that PG expression is required not only during periods of cell wall zzso but also during periods of cell wall turnover and zzso
