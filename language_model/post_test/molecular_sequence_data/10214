Liver cancer is one of the most frequent and lethal zzso zzso Early detection is hampered by the absence of reliable zzso Mice transgenic for the zzso large T zzso under the control of a zzso promoter spontaneously develop zzso zzso zzso between 8 to 10 weeks of zzso They are excellent models to investigate the zzso of protein expression in the early stages of tumor development and to follow these changes during tumor zzso In the present study, we analyzed the zzso changes occurring during tumor development in transgenic mice expressing the zzso T zzso under the control of the zzso III zzso The analysis of serum and liver zzso by an zzso type zzso using the zzso from zzso zzso zzso as a probe, revealed the presence of increased levels of zzso zzso zzso on zzso in the zzso transgenic mice as compared to zzso On serum zzso the increase in zzso zzso followed tumor zzso reaching up to 10 times control zzso However, significantly higher zzso binding zzso could already be observed on serum zzso from mice exhibiting only microscopically small zzso zzso On liver membrane zzso the increase in zzso zzso was less zzso reaching two to three times control values in zzso zzso Western zzso of serum and liver proteins with zzso zzso showed that all zzso that bind the zzso in controls exhibit larger amounts of zzso zzso zzso on zzso in the zzso zzso This general increase in zzso zzso on all zzso is due to the increased activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which specifically transfers zzso zzso in zzso linkage to Gal zzso units on zzso As for the structures zzso by the zzso the increase of zzso I activity in the serum as well as in liver zzso of the transgenic mice followed tumor zzso Interestingly, the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which uses the same zzso zzso zzso zzso was unchanged in the earlier stages of tumor development but decreased in the serum and in liver zzso from later zzso Using a rat zzso I zzso as a probe, Northern blots of total zzso extracted from the zzso of control and transgenic mice revealed an increased zzso expression of the zzso I zzso The single transcripts detected in both normal and zzso liver showed identical zzso
