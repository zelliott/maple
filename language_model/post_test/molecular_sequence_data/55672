We have used zzso zzso to examine the functional role of each of the eight zzso zzso acid zzso in the region between proposed zzso segments 5 and 6 zzso of domain II of the rat brain zzso sodium channel alpha zzso The zzso sodium channels were expressed in zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso clamping with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sensitivity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso None of the zzso had significant effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso or block by zzso or zzso Three of the zzso had significant effects on the sensitivity of the channel to block by zzso and zzso zzso of negative charges at positions zzso and 945 greatly reduced the block by zzso and zzso suggesting that these two zzso interact directly with the zzso zzso of a nearby negative charge at position zzso resulted in a smaller decrease in zzso and zzso block, although analysis of zzso block of this zzso at low zzso strength suggests that the interaction is not simply by an zzso zzso zzso None of the other five zzso had any effects on block by either zzso or zzso The two zzso zzso that had dramatic effects on toxin binding had significantly smaller effects at a zzso membrane zzso The sodium channel interacts with zzso and zzso with higher affinity at zzso zzso so these two zzso must make a greater contribution to toxin binding in the low affinity zzso These results define a small segment of the sodium channel alpha zzso domain II zzso region that interacts with zzso and zzso and therefore must lie near the mouth of the channel zzso
