zzso in the zzso zzso factor zzso are associated with zzso tooth zzso that zzso affects zzso zzso Of the 18 zzso identified to date, eight are zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso paired zzso We determined the structural and functional consequences of these paired domain zzso zzso and correlated our findings with the associated dental zzso zzso In zzso testing included zzso zzso zzso interactions between zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso to a DNA consensus site and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso promoters zzso and zzso with and without zzso as zzso All zzso zzso proteins were localized in the nucleus of zzso cells and physically zzso with zzso zzso Three of the zzso retained the ability to bind the consensus paired domain recognition zzso the others were unable or only partly able to interact with this DNA zzso and also showed a similarly impaired capability for zzso of zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso For seven of the eight zzso the degree of loss of zzso and promoter zzso correlated quite well with the severity of the tooth zzso pattern seen in zzso One of the zzso however showed neither reduction in zzso nor decrease in zzso instead, a loss of responsiveness to zzso with zzso in target promoter zzso and a dominant negative effect when expressed together with zzso zzso could be zzso Our zzso studies, which modeled DNA binding and zzso stability, were able to predict functional consequences quite zzso
