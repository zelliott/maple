In zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso genes is regulated via a complex cascade involving DNA zzso specific zzso and the zzso protein zzso which zzso zzso under inappropriate environmental zzso We have investigated the involvement of a second zzso zzso integration host factor zzso in zzso gene zzso We found that zzso of the zzso genes is zzso in a strain harboring an zzso zzso particularly on entry into the stationary zzso zzso of the zzso zzso whose product is required for the zzso of these structural zzso is also enhanced by zzso in the stationary zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso which encodes an zzso of zzso is zzso by zzso in both the zzso and early stationary zzso of growth, as is another zzso zzso zzso We have identified regions of the zzso zzso and zzso promoters which form zzso zzso complexes in zzso and have located sequences within these regions with similarity to the consensus zzso binding zzso Moreover, results from experiments in which the zzso or zzso gene was expressed zzso confirm that zzso has a direct input at the level of both zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we provide evidence that at the latter promoter, the primary role of zzso may be to overcome repression by the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of a role for zzso in controlling gene expression in zzso zzso
