The zzso zzso gene has been shown to be involved in the determination of fate in a number of different cell zzso Similarly, zzso zzso in zzso zzso are involved in cell decision-making zzso It is of interest to determine if a zzso zzso zzso plays a role in cell fate zzso We have isolated zzso from a mouse zzso gene using zzso zzso with zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that this gene possesses zzso repeats, zzso repeats, and zzso repeats, characteristic of other zzso zzso Northern analysis revealed that the transcript size was roughly 10 zzso as has been found for the other zzso zzso We have studied the expression pattern of the gene by both conventional and whole mount in zzso zzso zzso patterns were consistent with mouse zzso having a zzso role in the formation of zzso zzso and the nervous zzso
