Field zzso of zzso disease virus zzso use zzso zzso as receptors for zzso whereas strains that are adapted for growth in cultured cell lines appear to be able to use alternative receptors like zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso potential of zzso is regulated by changes in the zzso of their zzso and the zzso state would be expected to be an important zzso of zzso for viruses that use zzso as cellular zzso Currently, zzso is the only zzso that has been shown to act as a zzso for zzso In this study, a zzso zzso zzso has been used to characterize the binding of zzso to zzso preparations of the human zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and other zzso zzso In this zzso binding of zzso resembled authentic zzso binding to zzso in its dependence on zzso zzso and specific zzso by zzso zzso Most importantly, binding was found to be critically dependent on the zzso of the zzso as virus bound only after induction of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the identity of the zzso acid zzso immediately following the zzso motif is shown to influence zzso the ability of zzso to bind zzso zzso and zzso and evidence is provided that zzso might be an important zzso zzso in zzso
