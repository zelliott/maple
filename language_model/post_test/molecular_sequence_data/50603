zzso zzso zzso has been used to obtain images in the zzso mode in air and moist conditions at molecular resolution for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The molecules were deposited from an zzso solution onto a zzso zzso The samples formed aligned zzso zzso and were also found as individual zzso The molecular dimensions of zzso height and repeat distance along the zzso were found to be close to the values previously determined by X-ray zzso The results support a molecular model based on a zzso structure for zzso
