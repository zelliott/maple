The presently used approaches to silence zzso zzso B cells act zzso and more specific therapies are obviously zzso In the present study, we analyze the ability of a zzso zzso to suppress selectively pathological zzso zzso in zzso mice by zzso their surface zzso receptors with the zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso The zzso was constructed by zzso an zzso mouse zzso 1 zzso to a rat zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso The administration of these zzso molecules to zzso mice with initial and with full-blown disease resulted in the reduction of the levels of zzso zzso 1 zzso of the zzso levels, of the size of zzso zzso and in prevention of the development of skin zzso The observed effect was limited to zzso B cells only, as the treatment did not decrease the zzso zzso response to an administered foreign zzso This study demonstrates the possibility to silence selectively zzso B cells and to delay the progression of an zzso disease using zzso zzso zzso
