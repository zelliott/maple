Previous investigations of the major surface zzso zzso promoter of zzso zzso indicated an ability to function zzso in transient transformation zzso at zzso This suggests there might be another zzso gene being zzso transcribed from the zzso promoter in its normal zzso zzso To investigate this possibility we have characterized the region upstream of zzso and report here a zzso zzso unit coding for a probable zzso surface protein with zzso to zzso and zzso This zzso which had not previously been identified in surface zzso experiments is given the zzso zzso for zzso sequence zzso zzso organization and sequence of a full-length zzso of zzso are zzso zzso against a zzso zzso protein produced in zzso coli, recognize a specific band of 46 zzso in zzso zzso which zzso to the largest of the zzso proteins by Western zzso The possible role of this previously unidentified surface zzso is zzso
