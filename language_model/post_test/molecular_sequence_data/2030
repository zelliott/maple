The zzso zzso gene fork head zzso promotes terminal as opposed to zzso development in the zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso region by zzso zzso P zzso zzso transformation and sequence comparison of zzso and zzso zzso identify the zzso gene within the cloned zzso zzso is expressed in the early zzso in the two terminal zzso that are zzso transformed in zzso zzso zzso The nuclear zzso of the zzso protein suggests that zzso regulates the zzso of other, subordinate, zzso The zzso gene product, however, does not contain a known protein zzso such as the zzso or the zinc fingers, nor is it similar in sequence to any other known zzso
