The zzso activity of zzso such as zzso is often associated with structural changes in the zzso resulting in selective and zzso reactions with the zzso To investigate the effect of a zzso and its chain length on the dynamics of the zzso we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of the native zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso complexes, where the length of the zzso chain ranges from two to 10 carbon zzso zzso were performed in water and zzso of 400 zzso were used to zzso the essential motions in these zzso Our results indicate that the internal motions of the zzso and zzso complexes occur in a zzso of only a few degrees of zzso A high flexibility is observed in zzso zzso which connect zzso and zzso In particular, loop regions zzso and zzso zzso extensively in the native zzso Upon zzso and binding of the zzso involving the displacement of the active site loop, these motions are considerably zzso With increasing chain length of the zzso the fluctuations in the essential zzso increase, zzso off at a chain length of 10, which zzso to the size of the zzso zzso
