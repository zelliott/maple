zzso couple the receptors for insulin and various zzso to zzso proteins containing zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso from zzso of Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing zzso The interaction was modulated by zzso and zzso binding to zzso was enhanced by increasing zzso zzso with zzso In contrast, zzso a zzso zzso zzso decreased binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but did not significantly alter the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso motifs occur between zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso peptides based on the these sequences inhibited the association between zzso and zzso These data demonstrate that zzso binds to zzso in intact cells in a zzso manner, providing a molecular link between the zzso zzso
