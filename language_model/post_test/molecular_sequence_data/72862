Our analysis of zzso and zzso clones unexpectedly revealed that the chicken zzso gene is zzso expressed from alternative first zzso Moreover, we show that the respective transcripts are zzso processed to yield zzso for two distinct zzso of zzso The major zzso which we described zzso has two zzso zinc fingers typical of a zzso zzso zzso The minor zzso on the other hand, has only one such zinc zzso We show that this novel zzso zzso within the zzso of zzso cells and can bind to a consensus zzso zzso This truncated zzso of zzso is compromised in its ability to zzso a simple target zzso however, and thus is functionally distinct from the major zzso of zzso
