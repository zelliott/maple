The unfolded protein response zzso is an zzso zzso mechanism by which all zzso cells adapt to the zzso of unfolded proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are two type I zzso zzso protein zzso receptors that signal the zzso through a process that involves zzso and zzso To zzso the molecular basis of the zzso zzso signaling event, we determined the zzso crystal structure of the zzso domain of human zzso The zzso of the zzso domain comprises a unique fold of a triangular assembly of zzso zzso zzso analysis identified an extensive zzso interface stabilized by hydrogen bonds and zzso zzso zzso creates an zzso groove at the zzso However, because this groove is too narrow for zzso binding and the zzso zzso domain forms zzso zzso in zzso zzso binding to this groove is not required for zzso zzso with our structural zzso zzso that disrupt the zzso interface produced zzso molecules that failed to either zzso or activate the zzso upon zzso zzso In addition, zzso in a structurally zzso region within zzso also prevented zzso Our zzso zzso and functional studies in zzso altogether demonstrate that zzso and zzso have zzso a common molecular interface necessary and sufficient for zzso and zzso zzso
