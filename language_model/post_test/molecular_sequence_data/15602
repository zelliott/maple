The interactions of viral coat protein zzso and host factors play an important role in viral replication and/or host defense zzso In this study, we constructed zzso zzso zzso library to find host factors interacting with zzso virus X zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we screened zzso zzso zzso independent zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso library and identified six positive zzso One positive zzso named zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is a zzso protein with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We confirmed the zzso zzso interaction using zzso hybrid zzso in zzso zzso binding zzso in zzso and zzso fluorescent zzso zzso in zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis showed that the zzso level of zzso increased in zzso zzso zzso plants as compared to that of healthy zzso The green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso was localized in zzso or zzso zzso structure of zzso When we zzso zzso and red fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which were introduced by zzso expressing these proteins in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, however, we observed the zzso of these proteins in the inclusion zzso complex in areas surrounding zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso plays a critical role in viral replication during zzso infection in host zzso
