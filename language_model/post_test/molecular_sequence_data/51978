The class II region of the human major zzso complex zzso is made up of three major zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso With the aim of gaining an insight into the evolution and stability of DR zzso a total of 63 zzso clones were isolated from the DR zzso zzso of a western zzso zzso All but one of these zzso clones were found to fall into two zzso The larger zzso A, was defined by 41 overlapping zzso clones and contained a zzso gene segment made up of zzso 4 through 6 and four zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso The total length of this cluster was approximately 180 zzso The second zzso B, zzso a zzso DNA stretch of approximately 145 zzso and was composed of 21 overlapping zzso zzso zzso B contained three zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso One zzso clone zzso containing a zzso zzso could not be linked to either cluster A or zzso Neither the organization of cluster A nor that of cluster B was identical to that of known zzso zzso However, two gorilla zzso zzso zzso and zzso the human counterparts of which are linked in the zzso zzso were found to be located next to each other in cluster zzso The arrangement of the zzso genes in cluster B, which is presumed to be the gorilla zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso and to that of the presumed ancestral zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
