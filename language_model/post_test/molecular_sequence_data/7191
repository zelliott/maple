In order to compare the zzso behavior of the zzso zzso c which belong to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso film technique was used to determine whether and how these zzso interact with zzso zzso of the variations of surface pressure and surface potential versus time have shown differences in their penetration capacity into zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso with 16 zzso zzso and zzso zzso Norway zzso and zzso zzso zzso which have been assumed to be soluble zzso zzso may be considered as zzso membrane zzso unlike the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (Mr 13 zzso The zzso properties are discussed in terms of the available three-dimensional structural data, the zzso potential zzso and the results obtained by zzso cluster analysis of the zzso zzso The very different behavior of the two zzso zzso (Mr 13 zzso zzso the role of a particular surface loop in the interaction with a model zzso A functional interpretation is proposed assuming that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and both zzso zzso (Mr 13 zzso and (Mr 26 zzso from the Norway strain might provide the link between zzso hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso zzso
