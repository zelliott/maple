Transport of zzso across the membrane by the zzso of skeletal muscle zzso zzso involves the transfer of two zzso zzso from a pair of zzso sites to a pair of zzso sites, driven by zzso of the zzso The zzso is inhibited by zzso at alkaline pH zzso zzso follows from a decrease in the rate of release of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso release of zzso from the zzso is zzso at alkaline zzso which is consistent with sequential release of zzso from the zzso zzso the rates of both components decrease with increasing zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the slow phase of release follows from the binding of zzso at the empty outer zzso site, vacated by the release of the first zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the rate of release of the first zzso zzso could follow from binding to a gating site also affecting the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso
