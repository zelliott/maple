zzso are zzso zzso factors that comprise three zzso an zzso signal zzso an internal passenger domain, and a zzso zzso The mechanism of passenger zzso across the outer membrane remains zzso with four models having been zzso the zzso the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to understand zzso zzso we screened the sequences of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso features indicative of a common zzso zzso Our analyses revealed a strictly zzso zzso motif within the predicted zzso zzso region, upstream of the zzso of zzso We investigated the function of this motif through a zzso approach using zzso as a zzso Our studies demonstrate that zzso throughout the zzso motif do not block zzso of the zzso into the outer zzso However, zzso zzso of four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and three polar zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the motif severely decrease or even abolish zzso zzso Further studies showed that these zzso interfere with passenger transport across the outer zzso zzso analyses suggest that the critical polar and zzso zzso acids zzso on opposite sides of the zzso that runs through the zzso zzso Our data indicate that the zzso motif is important for passenger zzso across the outer membrane and that zzso in certain zzso severely affect the zzso zzso We discuss how these results fit with the four proposed models for zzso zzso and potential applications in zzso and vaccine zzso
