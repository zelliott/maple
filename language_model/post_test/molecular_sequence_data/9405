zzso communities in the zzso zzso of metal tolerant and accumulating zzso zzso grown in highly and moderately zzso mine tailings zzso as well as the adjacent zzso with low metal contamination were characterized by using zzso and zzso zzso A total of 69, 73, and 83 bacterial operational zzso units zzso having zzso similarity with the closest match in the database were detected among high, moderate, and zzso soil clone libraries, zzso These zzso had a Shannon diversity index value in the range of zzso There were 9, 10, and 14 bacterial zzso specific to high, moderate, and low zzso soil clone libraries, zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso belonged to 8 zzso zzso and zzso were zzso among the zzso Most of the zzso zzso produced zzso zzso acid and zzso More strains from the highly zzso soil produced zzso zzso than the strains from the moderately and lowly zzso zzso In experiments involving canola grown in zzso sand containing 200 zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the isolated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found to significantly increase the zzso zzso dry weight zzso from zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso compared to the zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso harbor different zzso bacterial communities in their zzso zzso and the zzso expressing plant growth promoting traits may be exploited for improving the zzso efficiency of zzso zzso
