The zzso zzso sequence zzso at the top of the 3' zzso structure of the zzso zzso is well zzso in the zzso viruses but is more variable in zzso with no known zzso In this study, the sequence requirements of the zzso motif for yellow fever virus zzso zzso replication were zzso In general, individual zzso at either the second, third or fourth positions were tolerated and resulted in zzso zzso zzso at the fifth position were zzso Base pairing of the zzso at the first position of the zzso motif and a zzso four positions downstream of the zzso zzso zzso was a major zzso for zzso Despite the fact that the majority of the zzso zzso were able to replicate zzso they were zzso by parental zzso virus following repeated passages in zzso cell zzso Surprisingly, some of the virus zzso at the first and/or the ninth position that maintained the possibility of forming a base pair were found to have a similar fitness to zzso under these zzso Overall, these experiments suggest that zzso is less dependent on sequence conservation of the zzso motif for replication in animal cells than West Nile zzso However, in animal cell culture, zzso has a preference for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms behind this preference remain to be zzso
