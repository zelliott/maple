The tumor zzso gene zzso is zzso frequently in a large number of human zzso and many investigators have attempted to restore the function of zzso using the zzso zzso gene and viral zzso In this study, we treated the zzso animals with the zzso synthetic zzso coupled with the zzso carrier zzso which we designated as Trojan zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the Trojan zzso zzso zzso zzso were given for 3 weeks in the zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso growth, zzso and zzso zzso of the tumor and toxicity of the animals were zzso To examine its influence on the survival of zzso mice, Trojan zzso was administered in the zzso zzso dissemination zzso 

In the zzso zzso tumor model, a significant growth zzso was obtained by the Trojan zzso treatment when compared with the three control treatments, zzso vehicle, zzso form of zzso or Trojan zzso zzso zzso growth zzso was almost complete in the zzso zzso a relatively slow growing zzso Neither zzso zzso or body weight loss were zzso zzso of the zzso zzso tumor in the Trojan zzso treatment group revealed marked zzso formation and zzso death of cancer zzso In the zzso zzso dissemination model, the survival curve of mice treated with Trojan zzso was significantly longer than that of zzso 

These results provide evidence that the Trojan zzso zzso system, a zzso zzso coupled with a zzso zzso functions for experimental pancreatic cancer zzso
