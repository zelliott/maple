Over the years, the zzso human breast cancer cell line has provided a model system for the study of cellular and molecular mechanisms in zzso regulation of cell proliferation and in progression to zzso and zzso independent zzso Global gene expression profiling has shown that zzso action in zzso cells involves the coordinated regulation of hundreds of genes across a wide range of functional groupings and that more genes are zzso than zzso zzso to long-term zzso zzso which results in loss of zzso growth, involves zzso to gene patterns not only at early time points zzso weeks) but continuing through to later times zzso weeks), and even involves zzso to patterns of zzso gene zzso Only zzso of the genes which were regulated zzso or zzso by zzso in zzso cells retained this responsiveness after long-term zzso deprivation but other genes developed de zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure to zzso which resulted in loss of growth zzso by the zzso resulted in some very large fold changes in gene expression up to zzso zzso of gene profiles produced by environmental chemicals with zzso properties showed that each zzso gave its own unique expression profile which suggests that environmental zzso entering the human breast may give rise to a more complex web of interference in cell function than simply mimicking zzso action at inappropriate zzso
