The zzso zzso or zzso zzso factors comprise a large gene family whose members are defined by a common zzso acid DNA binding zzso Here we describe the structure and expression of the mouse zzso zzso which encodes a protein of 48 zzso with high similarity to other winged zzso zzso factors within the DNA binding region, but unique potential zzso zzso The gene is zzso by a single zzso and is expressed in zzso stage zzso in the zzso the anterior zzso and a few cells of the zzso zzso This expression becomes restricted to the zzso portions of the zzso zzso and the developing zzso From day zzso of gestation zzso zzso transcripts are restricted to the zzso and become progressively localized to the red zzso as the sole site of zzso The zzso gene maps to zzso zzso and is a candidate gene for the mouse zzso zzso zzso which is characterized by nervous zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Although the expression patterns of the zzso gene and another winged zzso zzso zzso zzso are overlapping in early stages of gestation and although the promoter of the zzso gene contains a zzso binding site, we demonstrate that the zzso of the zzso gene is independent of zzso zzso
