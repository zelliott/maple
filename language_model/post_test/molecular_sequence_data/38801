zzso was isolated from the gastric zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The yield calculated from the crude extract was zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso gave a single band on both zzso and zzso As no other active zzso was detected on the zzso it was concluded that the zzso snake has one major zzso The molecular mass of the zzso was estimated to be 38 zzso by zzso The sequence of the zzso 26 zzso acid zzso was determined and compared with those of other zzso The zzso structure of zzso snake zzso was more zzso with those of zzso zzso C than those of zzso zzso zzso The zzso was rapidly converted to zzso by way of an intermediate form induced by zzso The optimum pH of zzso snake zzso for bovine zzso was zzso and it retained full activity at pH zzso and 30 degrees C on incubation for 30 zzso The optimum temperature for the snake zzso was 50 degrees C and it was stable at 40 degrees C on incubation for 10 zzso The zzso activity of the zzso toward bovine zzso was about two times higher than that of zzso zzso A, however, the activity toward oxidized bovine insulin zzso was lower than that of zzso zzso A, and it did not zzso zzso The specificity for oxidized bovine insulin zzso of the zzso was different from that of zzso zzso zzso zzso snake zzso was inhibited by zzso A but not by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso
