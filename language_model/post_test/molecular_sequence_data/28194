zzso a newly developed zzso zzso technique zzso et zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso we have analyzed the structure of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso promoter open zzso The results show strong zzso DNA backbone contacts in the zzso zzso and most notably in the zzso zzso These results suggest that unwinding of the zzso to zzso region of the promoter in the open complex is zzso through zzso DNA backbone contacts on both sides of this zzso The pattern of bases that are zzso towards zzso or zzso within the zzso to zzso region zzso argues against a model in which this region is simply zzso and/or single zzso The results indicate specific protein contacts and/or a fixed DNA zzso within the zzso to zzso zzso
