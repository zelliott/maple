The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso signaling and is required for all zzso responses in zzso zzso zzso To dissect zzso signal zzso we isolated the partially suppressing zzso zzso zzso which partially suppressed zzso zzso to zzso zzso of root zzso The zzso zzso partially restored zzso sensitivity in zzso background and displayed zzso hypersensitivity in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis, and zzso tests revealed that zzso is a leaky zzso of zzso zzso that encodes a key zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that an application of zzso zzso eliminated the partial restoration of zzso sensitivity by zzso in zzso background and the zzso hypersensitivity of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also attenuated zzso zzso of root growth in the wild zzso In addition, the expression of zzso was inhibited by zzso and this zzso was dependent on zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso is involved in zzso signaling and zzso regulates zzso zzso of root growth, and zzso the zzso is zzso by zzso and is located downstream of zzso in the zzso zzso
