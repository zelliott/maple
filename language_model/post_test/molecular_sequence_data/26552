zzso expression of the zzso factor family zzso has been recognized to be involved in the development and/or progression of various solid zzso Increased zzso factor 1 zzso expression is found associated with tumor progression in some tumors, and zzso zzso zzso have been detected in gastric zzso The aim of the study was to analyze zzso zzso and expression in zzso zzso and their correlation with cancer progression and pathological zzso 

zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso by DNA zzso zzso zzso and protein levels in zzso of the primary tumors were determined using quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso The serum level of zzso was also detected by zzso zzso zzso for patients with zzso zzso 

Five zzso were detected in the zzso region and zzso 1 of zzso zzso expression was increased in zzso zzso compared to paired zzso zzso zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso showed no significant differences in tumor zzso levels with respect to zzso parameters such as the patient's sex, cancer zzso stage and zzso zzso zzso However, serum zzso levels were significantly elevated in patients with zzso zzso compared to healthy zzso 

The results indicate that zzso zzso zzso seem to be a rare event in zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a potential useful marker for patients with zzso zzso
