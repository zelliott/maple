Green fluorescent proteins zzso and zzso zzso are widely used to study protein zzso and zzso We engineered a specific zzso for fluorescent proteins based on a zzso zzso binding zzso derived from a zzso single chain zzso This zzso protein zzso can easily be produced in bacteria and coupled to a zzso zzso The zzso allows a fast and efficient zzso isolation of zzso fusion proteins and their interacting factors for zzso analyses including mass zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso zzso is also suitable for zzso zzso from cells expressing fluorescent zzso zzso Most importantly, zzso can be fused with cellular proteins to zzso recruit zzso fusion proteins allowing targeted manipulation of cellular structures and processes in living zzso Because of the high affinity capture of zzso fusion proteins in zzso and in zzso and a size in the lower zzso range we refer to the immobilized zzso protein as zzso This versatile zzso enables a unique combination of zzso zzso and functional analyses with one and the same zzso
