A molecular mechanical force field is described for the zzso analysis of zzso This force field has been derived by the addition of new parameters to the zzso force field and is compatible with simulations of zzso This new zzso is assessed by comparison of the theoretically predicted zzso of Man alpha zzso beta zzso with the corresponding crystal zzso zzso dynamics simulation data are presented for this structure both in zzso and with the explicit inclusion of water zzso While the former demonstrate significant zzso zzso about zzso linkages at zzso temperature, in the latter these zzso are highly zzso due to the stabilizing influence of a zzso of zzso and zzso hydrogen zzso
