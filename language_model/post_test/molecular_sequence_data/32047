zzso which produce the world's largest flowers, have captivated the attention of biologists for nearly two zzso Despite their fame, however, the zzso nature of the floral zzso in these giants has remained a zzso Most members of the family have a large floral chamber defined by a zzso The zzso encloses the zzso zzso where zzso by zzso flies zzso In lieu of a functional genetic system to investigate floral development in these highly specialized zzso we used comparative studies of structure, development, and zzso patterns to investigate the zzso of their floral zzso Our results surprisingly demonstrate that the otherwise similar floral chambers in two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are constructed very zzso In zzso the zzso is derived from the zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso it is derived from zzso of a unique ring structure located between the zzso and the zzso zzso which, although developed to varying degrees among the zzso appears to be a zzso of the zzso Thus, the characteristic features that define the floral chamber in these closely related zzso are not zzso These differences zzso the prevailing hypothesis that similarities between zzso and zzso are ancestral in the zzso Instead, our data indicate that zzso and zzso floral chambers represent two distinct zzso of this zzso The zzso zzso we identified in zzso in particular, may have provided architectural zzso which permitted the explosive growth in floral diameter that has arisen zzso within this zzso
