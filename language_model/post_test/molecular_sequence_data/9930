Nuclear zzso are intermediate zzso proteins forming a zzso zzso that zzso the inner nuclear zzso We have previously reported the identification of the human zzso B2 gene that maps to the zzso band zzso of zzso 19 in close proximity of a human DNA replication zzso Here we report the identification within the human zzso B2 gene of a novel repeated element zzso number of tandem zzso zzso that appears to have a very recent origin, being absent in the zzso of mouse and primates such as zzso zzso and zzso The zzso is adjacent to zzso 8 of the zzso B2 gene which, albeit zzso the nuclear zzso signal of the zzso is highly divergent both at zzso acid and zzso level among zzso zzso the zzso characterized by a repeated unit of about 100 zzso covers most of zzso 8 of the gene and reiterates both the last 7 zzso of the upstream zzso and the zzso zzso zzso experiments carried out on zzso cell zzso suggest that none of the downstream junctions is used during the processing of the zzso B2 zzso
