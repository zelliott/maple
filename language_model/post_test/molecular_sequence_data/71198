zzso is an zzso protein of low molecular weight which is widely distributed in zzso and is deeply involved in the dynamics of zzso assembly in the zzso The zzso ability of zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso has been localized in zzso zzso of the zzso primary sequence zzso et zzso 1991 zzso In the present study, in order to further clarify the functional zzso in zzso zzso we constructed expression zzso containing zzso of different size with deletion at the zzso of the open reading zzso The truncated zzso molecules produced in zzso coli were zzso and examined for their zzso and zzso zzso We found that the truncated zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso site could be zzso with zzso by zzso a zzso zzso In addition, these truncated peptides as well as synthetic peptides corresponding to the zzso sequence of zzso suppressed the zzso action of zzso on zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that additional zzso and zzso sites exist in the zzso region of zzso
