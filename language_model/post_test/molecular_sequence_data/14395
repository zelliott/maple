zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso zzso zzso a zzso disease of global economic zzso Similar to other zzso plant zzso zzso zzso has a suite of zzso and zzso zzso zzso which likely function as zzso or zzso zzso during the course of host zzso Using in zzso zzso we identified zzso candidate zzso proteins within the zzso zzso zzso with variable zzso zzso In extending this analysis, we present the functional characterization of one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and its closest zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso To assess if such zzso pairs are common among zzso plant zzso we examined the zzso among putative zzso pairs in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Of zzso predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso only 109 zzso had a putative zzso in zzso zzso and evolutionary rate analysis of these zzso shows that they are evolving significantly faster than most other zzso We found that zzso was zzso during the early stages of infection of plants, and, moreover, that zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso elicits a rapid zzso More interestingly, we also demonstrate that zzso arises as a product of alternative zzso making this the first example of an alternative zzso event in plant zzso zzso transforming a zzso gene to a functional zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest a role for zzso in zzso and, in total, our data provide a basis for comparative analysis of candidate zzso proteins and their zzso zzso as a means of understanding function and evolutionary history of pathogen zzso
