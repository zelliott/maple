To determine the variation in the zzso zzso zzso gene sequences and different zzso zzso of zzso zzso strains collected from children in mainland China, zzso strains with zzso collected from 2007 to 2009 were zzso Their molecular characteristics were zzso zzso were designed to sequence the zzso zzso Six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified by zzso Eleven sequence types zzso were detected with zzso zzso zzso the most frequent zzso followed by 910 zzso zzso and 338 zzso zzso Single zzso zzso zzso were identified at 11 locations in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso Four additional zzso were zzso Both zzso zzso 16, zzso and zzso zzso 62, zzso were present in the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in five strains belonging to zzso zzso 1, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in one zzso zzso Fifteen strains belonging to zzso zzso and zzso carried a zzso zzso that had an zzso head zzso Nine zzso strains carried zzso Three zzso strains carried a zzso zzso that had an zzso head zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso of zzso and all zzso zzso had no zzso zzso In conclusion, sequence variation in zzso genes and zzso zzso was generally related to the zzso zzso strains may indeed carry novel zzso zzso
