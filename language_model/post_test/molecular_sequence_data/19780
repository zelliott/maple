zzso zzso is a fungus of considerable zzso and ecological versatility, being a potent insect pathogen that can also colonize plant zzso The zzso details of these interactions are zzso We provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso to insects and plants using two different zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso induced in insect zzso and plant root zzso respectively, and produce regional zzso of adhesive zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso allowed this zzso to adhere to insect zzso zzso of zzso caused zzso cells to adhere to a plant zzso Our study demonstrated that as well as allowing zzso to insects, zzso at the surface of zzso zzso zzso or zzso is required to zzso the zzso and stimulate the expression of genes involved in the cell zzso zzso the disruption of zzso in zzso zzso delayed zzso suppressed zzso formation, and greatly reduced zzso to zzso The disruption of zzso blocked the zzso of zzso zzso to plant zzso but had no effects on zzso differentiation and zzso Thus, regulation, zzso and specificity control the functional distinction between zzso and zzso and enable zzso zzso cells to adapt their adhesive properties to different zzso
