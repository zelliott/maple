A zzso substitution zzso form of human zzso zzso zzso has been described previously as an zzso of the effects of zzso on various human zzso The zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso which expresses the human zzso zzso zzso in response to both zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso on human zzso peripheral blood zzso cells, zzso is a potent zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were performed to investigate the stability of different zzso of zzso 124 as well as the efficiency of different molecular mechanics force fields in zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso substitution alters the zzso end of the zzso in such way that the analogue still binds to the human zzso zzso zzso and signals through the zzso gamma zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso complex cannot signal through the human gamma zzso
