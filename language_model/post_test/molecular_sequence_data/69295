The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso acid integral membrane zzso found in many zzso which couples the zzso of the sugar zzso with the inward movement of zzso Based on its zzso profile and the application of von zzso zzso zzso rule zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a model of the zzso zzso protein zzso is proposed containing 10 zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso This model was tested by the creation of random zzso zzso zzso The data from 33 unique, randomly generated, zzso zzso and from 5 zzso zzso supported the proposed zzso between zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of the putative first zzso loop and the zzso zzso was not possible because the zzso zzso in this region were shown to be unreliable indicators of the zzso of zzso
