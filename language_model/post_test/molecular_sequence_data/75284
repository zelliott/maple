zzso growth zzso zzso increases the zzso zzso levels of several zzso zzso zzso zzso Using DNA zzso we show that zzso stimulates the activity of the mouse alpha zzso collagen promoter zzso to zzso in mouse zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that a segment of this promoter between zzso and zzso overlapping a nuclear factor 1 zzso binding site, is needed for zzso zzso A 3 zzso substitution zzso abolishing zzso binding to this site zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso binding site zzso to the zzso early promoter makes the promoter zzso zzso but the 3 zzso substitution does zzso Similarly, when the zzso binding site at the replication origin of zzso 2 and 5 is inserted zzso to the zzso promoter, the promoter responds to zzso Therefore an zzso binding site mediates the zzso zzso of the mouse alpha zzso collagen promoter by zzso
