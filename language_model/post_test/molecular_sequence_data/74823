zzso of proteins by zzso has emerged as a key regulatory mechanism in many cellular zzso including gene zzso Eighty to zzso percent of the zzso zzso in the cell is performed by the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein involved in gene regulation at several levels, has been shown to be a zzso and regulator of zzso in zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso in zzso and, at least in zzso this zzso is carried out by zzso The in zzso zzso of zzso zzso its ability to bind to DNA while leaving zzso binding activity zzso zzso with these activities having a role in zzso the DNA binding activity of the zzso zzso complex and the zzso of its target zzso zzso are both decreased by zzso of zzso in zzso However, in contrast to other zzso binding zzso a changing degree of zzso does not alter the zzso zzso of zzso Several other proteins involved in gene regulation can bind both zzso and zzso these data demonstrate a mechanism by which such binding activities may be controlled zzso
