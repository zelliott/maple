zzso zzso zzso zzso was proposed as a candidate for the zzso hormone zzso We found that a synthetic zzso zzso of zzso containing the zzso and zzso sequence zzso new bone formation in zzso and in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently identified as a candidate for the zzso hormone zzso which has been implicated in disturbed zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was predominantly found in zzso and mice deficient in a zzso of zzso showed increased bone density, suggesting that zzso produced in zzso zzso regulates bone zzso In this study, we examined the effects of a synthetic zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso region zzso containing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso motif on bone formation in zzso and in zzso 

The zzso activity of zzso was examined in organ cultures of zzso mouse zzso and in zzso by injecting zzso onto the zzso of zzso 

zzso examination showed that zzso zzso new bone formation with increased numbers of zzso in zzso mouse zzso in organ zzso In contrast, synthetic zzso zzso peptides without either the zzso or zzso motif failed to increase new bone zzso zzso daily subcutaneous injections of zzso onto the zzso in mice increased bone thickness and zzso new bone formation as determined by the zzso zzso zzso However, peptides in which the zzso or zzso sequence was scrambled did not stimulate new bone formation in zzso zzso increased cell proliferation and alkaline zzso activity and activated focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in human primary zzso 

Our results show that a synthetic zzso corresponding with the sequence of human zzso zzso stimulates new bone formation with increased number of zzso The results also suggest that the zzso and zzso motifs are critical to the zzso activity of zzso presumably through zzso zzso signaling pathways in zzso The anabolic effects of zzso may be beneficial for bone diseases associated with decreased bone zzso
