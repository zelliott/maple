zzso zzso in plants is most often dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso repeated zzso We have identified an zzso line zzso line 4) displaying zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This line contains a truncated copy of the zzso encompassing the zzso gene with its zzso promoter adjacent to an intact zzso zzso The orientation of the intact and the truncated copies zzso the generation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso we have investigated the zzso landscape surrounding zzso zzso in the silenced zzso line 4 and five zzso zzso lines without zzso in search of features that might explain the zzso zzso zzso content, putative zzso regions and zzso interference from zzso genes could all be ruled out as major causes of zzso zzso sequencing revealed de zzso zzso of the zzso promoter both in zzso and silenced plants of this line, thus zzso was not correlated to DNA zzso zzso Also, the zzso pattern deviated from that characteristic for zzso DNA zzso and zzso Our data therefore suggest that zzso line 4 represents a case where zzso is due to zzso zzso zzso pairing between the intact zzso and the adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso
