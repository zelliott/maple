An zzso raised against a zzso was used to select a unique zzso species from a zzso pool of zzso designed to resemble an zzso recognition site in zzso zzso The zzso and the selected zzso zzso could compete for zzso zzso suggesting that both zzso and zzso zzso occupy the same or overlapping zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso functioned as a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso can be used to tag unrelated zzso molecules and also to detect the presence of the zzso We propose that zzso recognition of zzso by zzso may involve zzso contacts similar to those occurring in other zzso zzso zzso In addition, these findings are compatible with the suggestion that zzso zzso zzso may arise through zzso zzso between proteins and zzso zzso
