A method for the modification of the zzso zzso of even small amounts of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso is zzso The method includes zzso zzso of the zzso onto the polystyrene surface of the zzso of zzso plates used as reaction tubes, zzso or zzso by incubation either with zzso or zzso or with zzso and the characterization of the modified zzso structures by probing them with zzso zzso zzso zzso employed as a model zzso was modified in amounts of as little as 100 zzso removing zzso acid zzso zzso zzso or all types of zzso with zzso zzso H or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso from rat liver, but could not be zzso with zzso from zzso zzso Changes in the structure and in the relative amount of the zzso could be monitored zzso with high sensitivity by the binding of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The method is easy to use, does not require zzso of the zzso zzso offers simple separation of the zzso and the product, and leaves the protein intact for further zzso
