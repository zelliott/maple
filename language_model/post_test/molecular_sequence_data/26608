zzso of zzso diseases such as dengue and yellow fever, which are both transmitted by the Aedes aegypti zzso has been correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso pumps that are involved in the transport of zzso across zzso Some of these proteins have been implicated in zzso resistance zzso In this study, we identified a putative zzso in the zzso database based on its significantly high identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso The zzso zzso activity of zzso cassette zzso in larvae was significantly increased in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso An zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso gene expression was detected in zzso larvae as determined by quantitative zzso To zzso the potential role of zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was performed in the presence of zzso The results showed an increase of zzso in zzso zzso which is in agreement with the zzso reversing zzso zzso interference zzso zzso of the zzso gene caused a significant increase in zzso toxicity zzso In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time in insects that zzso zzso expression can be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso
