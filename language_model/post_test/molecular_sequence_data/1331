zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso resonance energy zzso technology has facilitated the exploration of the zzso patterns of cellular zzso While most studies have used zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso donors and zzso respectively, this pair of proteins suffers from problems of zzso and bleeding between zzso In the present paper, we demonstrate the use of an alternative additional zzso zzso We have cloned two genes zzso zzso from stony zzso We isolated a zzso zzso from zzso zzso whose tentacles exhibit zzso zzso Similar to zzso from zzso zzso the zzso zzso forms a tight zzso zzso We also discovered an zzso zzso from zzso zzso As the orange zzso exists in a complex zzso structure, we converted this protein into a zzso form through the introduction of three zzso acid zzso recently reported to be effective for converting zzso into a zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso and zzso orange zzso as a zzso pair to monitor the activity of zzso 3 during zzso Due to the close spectral overlap of the donor zzso and zzso zzso (a large zzso zzso substantial zzso of the donor zzso quantum yield and the zzso zzso as well as good separation of the donor and zzso signals, the new pair can be used for more effective quantitative zzso zzso
