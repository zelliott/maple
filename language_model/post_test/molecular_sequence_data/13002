A zzso zzso protein zzso containing 167 zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso was produced in the zzso coli zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to construct a zzso with a protein coding region corresponding exactly to the original zzso zzso production was induced by zzso zzso was enriched from total soluble protein by zzso and zzso and then zzso by sequential zzso exchange and zzso interaction zzso The zzso protein was zzso by zzso and zzso analysis using a zzso zzso to the zzso consensus zzso zzso in zzso coli resulted in approximately zzso zzso of zzso protein per liter of induced zzso
