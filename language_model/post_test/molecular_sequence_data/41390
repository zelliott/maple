zzso is a key zzso responsible for maintaining visual function in zzso Despite extensive research on this zzso zzso zzso fundamental questions regarding its zzso remain zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso in a zzso zzso These zzso obtained from zzso active, zzso zzso displayed an unusual packing arrangement wherein zzso is embedded in a zzso zzso zzso differences between zzso and zzso zzso uncovered key zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso iron zzso X-ray zzso zzso data established that zzso as isolated contained a zzso iron center and demonstrated the presence of a tightly bound zzso consistent with a coordinated zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that the Lewis acidity of iron could be used to promote zzso zzso and generation of a zzso intermediate required for zzso zzso
