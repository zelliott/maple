A hybrid gene was made by fusing the zzso zzso promoter region of a mouse group 1 major urinary protein zzso gene to the coding region of the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and introduced into the zzso of mice by zzso zzso zzso males were zzso or when fertile did not transmit the foreign zzso and the transgenic male descendants of zzso females were also zzso Seven zzso were established by breeding from zzso females and their transgenic female zzso Six lines expressed zzso zzso zzso activity in the liver, and activity correlated perfectly with the presence of zzso zzso zzso In three of four lines zzso expression was lower in female than in male liver, and in these lines the same sex difference was observed in the rate of zzso zzso of the foreign genes in liver zzso When females of one of the sexually zzso lines were treated with testosterone, the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity were increased, although not to male zzso In these aspects of liver zzso and also in a lack of expression in seven other zzso the hybrid gene exhibits many of the characteristics of an zzso group 1 zzso zzso However, the gene was also expressed (at high zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso two zzso in which zzso genes are not zzso The zzso when introduced into five of the seven lines, carried a copy of the zzso coli zzso gene attached beyond the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso but this did not affect the overall expression zzso All of the lines were male sterile and expressed zzso zzso zzso in the zzso but one line showed no activity in the liver, and another showed none in the zzso zzso zzso expression is therefore the likely cause of zzso Data are described which suggest that the causes of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Since expression in each tissue occurred in several lines, the structure of the hybrid gene must be responsible in each zzso Five zzso studied lines showed at least four consistently different patterns of relative expression in zzso zzso zzso male liver, and female zzso These differences do not correlate in any way with the copy number of the foreign gene in the different lines and must be due to some other aspect of line specific zzso
