zzso which are zzso or associated with the cell envelope of zzso tuberculosis may contain protective zzso zzso Prior to this study, a zzso clone bank of zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso were screened for zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Five of these were selected for further study, and the zzso zzso and proliferation of human zzso from zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso donors were measured in response to zzso zzso zzso and one full-length zzso zzso from four of the five selected zzso were zzso in the human model and corresponded to zzso d zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso II, zzso and zzso Thus, this strategy identified novel human zzso peptides as possible candidates for a zzso zzso
