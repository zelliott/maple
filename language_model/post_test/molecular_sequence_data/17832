zzso bond formation can be zzso zzso by the reverse reaction of zzso Application is seen in the industrial production of human zzso Human insulin zzso can be zzso prepared using either zzso insulin or the single chain zzso insulin precursor as the starting zzso This is accomplished by either zzso digesting the starting material at zzso with zzso zzso zzso I zzso and then zzso with zzso zzso zzso blocking zzso zzso zzso or zzso subjecting zzso of zzso insulin or zzso of the single chain insulin precursor to zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be used for either type of reaction and, in the immobilized form, for the zzso zzso Since the single chain insulin precursor can be produced by gene technology zzso use of immobilized zzso or zzso and the zzso reaction using the single chain insulin precursor as the starting material ensures the continuous production of human insulin making it a feasible method for industrial zzso
