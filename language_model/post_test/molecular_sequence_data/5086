Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso with zzso representing sheep satellite I and satellite II zzso shows a different distribution of the two repetitive DNA families in the zzso region of most zzso The single signal per zzso produced by the satellite I probe suggests close proximity of this DNA family to the primary zzso Satellite II produces two separate signals on the sister zzso and large blocks of satellite II DNA constitute most of the short arm of all zzso zzso We have isolated and zzso a zzso clone containing a junction between discrete blocks of satellite I and satellite II zzso The junction is characterized by an abrupt juxtaposition of zzso of the two zzso The possibility that the peculiar structural features of this junction could have a functional significance is zzso
