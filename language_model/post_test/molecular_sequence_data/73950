We have generated zzso zzso against nuclear proteins from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso react with proteins of 47 and 49 zzso on zzso and with partially overlapping sets of proteins on two-dimensional zzso pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a nuclear zzso zzso zzso a zzso expression library yielded five independent full-length clones of two open reading frames from zzso IV, corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso data zzso These two open reading frames are predicted to zzso zzso zzso zzso of 47 and 49 zzso zzso A clone carrying zzso was zzso in its entirety and directs the expression of a zzso protein in zzso zzso A clone carrying zzso expresses a zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso grown in minimal medium plus zzso show significant reductions in nuclear zzso zzso Cell zzso studies zzso the zzso and zzso proteins to the zzso Nuclear zzso studies reveal that a portion of the zzso and zzso proteins can only be extracted with zzso zzso and high zzso The zzso of zzso zzso to the nucleus is unexpected given previous reports that zzso zzso is present in zzso and the zzso in zzso zzso
