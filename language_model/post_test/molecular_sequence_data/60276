zzso in human zzso cause zzso zzso zzso thereby raising the possibility that it functions as a zzso zzso To test this hypothesis we cloned a zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso and analyzed its activity in cultured zzso zzso When expressed in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso zzso of zzso zzso from medium containing zzso caused a rapid zzso zzso whereas the zzso pH increase following zzso removal from zzso medium was reduced greater than zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso medium was unaffected by removal of zzso zzso or by zzso of the membrane by addition of 75 zzso zzso to the zzso Like human zzso zzso zzso transcripts were expressed at high levels in zzso and colon and at lower levels in small zzso The expression of zzso zzso was modestly zzso in the colon of mice lacking the zzso zzso zzso These results show that zzso is a zzso zzso and suggest that it normally acts in concert with zzso to absorb zzso and that in zzso mice its activity is coupled with those of the sharply zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso channel to mediate zzso and fluid zzso
