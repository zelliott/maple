zzso virus zzso is considered to be a close zzso of zzso virus zzso the zzso member of the zzso zzso In the present study, we have analyzed the sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso to zzso its genetic relationship to zzso and other zzso zzso Products of these genes have been shown to be important in attachment of zzso to host cell surface receptors during viral zzso Additionally, the zzso gene is also responsible for cell fusion during infection, while the zzso gene is required for synthesis of the highly zzso major envelope protein zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso genes of three zzso zzso were determined by zzso amplification, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso sequence and the deduced zzso acid zzso sequences were compared with published sequences from other members of the zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis of all the three genes revealed high sequence identity of zzso zzso with zzso (close to zzso sequence zzso at both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the deduced zzso sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso genes also showed that zzso are more closely related to zzso than to any of the other zzso
