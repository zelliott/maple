The zzso gene clusters zzso P zzso and zzso G zzso DNA sequence analysis has resolved three G zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that differ in zzso specificity and therefore in binding to zzso zzso In this study, DNA zzso specific for the zzso gene cluster or the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences were used to examine 74 zzso and 204 urinary zzso coli zzso zzso from acute zzso 71 from acute zzso and 66 from zzso zzso In accordance with previous studies, a higher frequency of zzso strains was found in the urinary strains zzso than in the zzso zzso zzso coli zzso The zzso and zzso sequences were more frequent among urinary zzso zzso zzso zzso than among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso None of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso strains accounted for zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso dominated in acute zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was most frequent in zzso strains zzso zzso 37% zzso The zzso zzso strains formed an intermediate group zzso zzso zzso zzso Most of the zzso strains expressed P zzso which zzso human zzso sheep zzso and Gal alpha zzso beta latex zzso The zzso strains varied in zzso of human and sheep zzso and Gal alpha zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequences differ in disease zzso
