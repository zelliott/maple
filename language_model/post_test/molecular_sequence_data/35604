zzso are hosts of several zzso species that belong to different zzso To investigate the genetic mechanisms that may be involved in the zzso of similar hosts in these zzso distinct bacteria, we determined the complete zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for comparative zzso The zzso alignment indicates that their zzso organization is highly zzso which is in sharp contrast to the elevated zzso zzso observed in other zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso strategies revealed that zzso zzso can use a wide range of zzso suggesting that it is well suited to living in the gut (and possibly the circulatory zzso of its zzso zzso In comparison, zzso zzso has lost several zzso zzso genes and acquired additional sets of zzso zzso genes through tandem zzso suggesting that proteins from zzso blood meal or zzso host cells may be an important zzso zzso Moreover, one zzso zzso gene zzso was found in zzso zzso but not zzso zzso This gene is linked to the production of zzso oxygen species and has been shown to be a major zzso factor in zzso zzso This finding may explain the zzso of zzso zzso observed in previous artificial infection experiments, while no apparent effect was found for zzso zzso To zzso the gene content evolution at deeper divergence levels, we incorporated other zzso zzso for comparative zzso The results suggest that the losses of zzso pathways are a zzso theme in these zzso zzso
