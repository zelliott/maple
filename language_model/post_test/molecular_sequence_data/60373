zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso of zzso We have previously identified a mouse zzso gene that exhibits the hallmarks of a zzso that is, it has no zzso is flanked by direct repeats, and has a zzso tract at its zzso This zzso termed zzso is not a processed zzso rather, it is transcribed in a variety of mouse zzso and encodes a functional zzso In the current report, we present the sequence of a zzso zzso segment of the zzso zzso Several sequences of interest, including an zzso A particle zzso element, a zzso zzso and several expressed sequence tags zzso were found within or near zzso We also show, through analysis of an zzso zzso that zzso is located on zzso 12, tightly linked to the gene zzso that encodes zzso zzso another key zzso in zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso is present among several divergent species of the zzso zzso Thus, the integration event that generated zzso may have occurred early during zzso zzso
