The zzso sequence of a rice zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso designated zzso has been previously determined zzso zzso zzso extension analysis indicated that zzso starts 47 zzso upstream of the translation start zzso To gain an insight into the zzso regulation of this zzso the zzso promoter sequence and a series of its zzso deletions were zzso fused to the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was subsequently zzso in a transient expression system of tobacco ( zzso zzso zzso zzso which revealed the presence of a positive regulatory region zzso to zzso and two negative regulatory regions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso in the zzso promoter for the promoter zzso The positive regulatory region displayed an zzso activity when fused to the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso minimal promoter zzso to zzso to drive zzso expression and zzso on tobacco leaves by the zzso transient expression technique zzso zzso zzso for zzso activity on transgenic tobacco plants has further indicated a preferential expression in vascular zzso of stems and leaves zzso by the positive regulatory zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso promoter zzso to zzso fused with zzso was transformed into tobacco and proved to be capable of zzso zzso zzso Further zzso and 3' deletion analysis of the zzso promoter revealed that a zzso zzso located from zzso to zzso contained zzso responsible for zzso zzso
