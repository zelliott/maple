This work describes the zzso and characterization of zzso zzso the first zzso isolated from zzso zzso The zzso has a zzso activity and is only active against strains of zzso zzso zzso F appears to be formed through a processing zzso new to zzso The mass of the zzso zzso was determined by mass zzso and the zzso zzso acid sequence was determined by zzso zzso zzso of zzso the zzso structural zzso revealed that zzso F zzso to a zzso zzso in the central part of a zzso open reading frame, suggesting that mature zzso F is excised from the zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing and Northern zzso zzso revealed that zzso is zzso with genes zzso a putative zzso zzso and a protein from the radical zzso zzso A gene zzso an ABC zzso was also identified in close proximity to the zzso structural zzso The potential role of these genes in zzso F maturation and zzso is zzso
