zzso was first identified as a candidate gene for zzso zzso and its role in controlling zzso migration during zzso and effect on learning in zzso have been zzso In contrast, genetic association studies have been ambiguous in replicating its effects on zzso To better understand the regulation of zzso and the possible functional role of genetic variation in the promoter of zzso we selected three zzso zzso zzso with predicted functional consequences or suggested associations to zzso for detailed zzso zzso mobility shift zzso suggested the zzso binding of the zzso factors zzso (to zzso and zzso (to zzso and zzso that could be verified by competition zzso In addition, we zzso a complex of protein factors binding to the previously suggested zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso identified by mass zzso and protein zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso showed significant zzso differences in zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso each previously implicated in gene regulation, form a complex controlling zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso differences in the promoter or zzso untranslated region of zzso may affect factor binding and thus regulation of the zzso
