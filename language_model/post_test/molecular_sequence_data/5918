We have expressed a soluble zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and examined signaling in cells expressing the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso but not the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso cells and proliferation in zzso zzso Early zzso events zzso by the zzso including zzso of zzso zzso 3, and zzso were similar to signaling through the zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso with low affinity zzso 10 to 50 zzso zzso of zzso to zzso was zzso dependent with intermediate affinity zzso zzso to zzso zzso However, the concentration of zzso required for signaling through the zzso was zzso to zzso greater than that required for cells expressing the zzso zzso and zzso in the absence of zzso Furthermore, the zzso was capable of zzso the activity of zzso when tested on cells expressing the zzso zzso and zzso We propose that the observed zzso antagonism by the zzso may depend on limiting numbers of zzso molecules on cells already expressing the zzso zzso
