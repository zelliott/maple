The zzso zzso family contains two genes that code for zzso proteins that bind zzso DNA to regulate the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso We have designed a dominant negative zzso termed zzso that zzso the DNA binding of either zzso zzso zzso consists of the zzso domain of zzso and a zzso acid sequence that replaces the basic zzso zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso and both zzso are more stable than zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies show that the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso more stable than the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso can inhibit the DNA binding of either zzso or zzso in an zzso competition but does not inhibit the DNA binding of the three zzso proteins zzso zzso or zzso even at 100 zzso zzso zzso proteins containing the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso zzso from either zzso zzso or zzso indicate that both the zzso and zzso zzso regions of zzso contribute to its zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso can inhibit the zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso may be useful in zzso diseases where zzso family members are zzso
