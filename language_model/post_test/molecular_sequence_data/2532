The coding region of the low density zzso zzso gene from a patient zzso with zzso familial zzso zzso has been zzso from six overlapping zzso amplified fragments of the zzso from cultured skin zzso Two separate single zzso base changes from the normal sequence were zzso The first involved substitution of zzso for zzso in the third position of the zzso for zzso acid zzso zzso and did not affect the protein zzso The second zzso was substitution of zzso for zzso in the DNA for the zzso for zzso acid zzso zzso changing the zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and introducing a new site for the restriction zzso zzso zzso is a true zzso with two identical zzso and the zzso zzso with clinically diagnosed FH in his family in which first cousin marriages occurred zzso The zzso acid change occurs in the center of growth factor repeat C in the zzso growth factor zzso domain of the zzso a region of highly zzso sequence between bovine and human LDL zzso and results in slowed, but complete, maturation of the precursor to the mature form of the zzso and, despite its zzso from the zzso domain, in impaired binding of zzso LDL receptors in zzso skin zzso bind less LDL than normal and with reduced zzso Thus this naturally occurring single point zzso affects both zzso transport of the protein and zzso binding and occurs in growth zzso repeat C, a region that has not previously been found to influence LDL zzso
