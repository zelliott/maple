A zzso inhibitor zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 43 zzso was zzso from pear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Chemical zzso of this protein decreased the molecular mass to 34 zzso Gas zzso analysis suggests that zzso zzso accounts for the majority of sugar zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso zzso inhibitor protein provided information used to amplify a corresponding zzso by zzso chain zzso Multiple cloned products of these reactions were zzso and the same open reading frame was identified in all of the zzso It encodes a zzso zzso containing the zzso acid sequences determined by protein sequencing and predicts a putative signal sequence of 24 zzso acids and seven potential zzso zzso The expression of zzso inhibitor is regulated in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso level were much higher in fruit than in flowers or zzso
