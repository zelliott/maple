The effect of zzso on the rate and mechanism of transfer of a synthetic zzso zzso between zzso single zzso zzso has been zzso These zzso which had the sequence zzso (where zzso represents a saturated zzso chain of zzso zzso that is attached to the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso 8, 12, or zzso were distinguished by the length of the saturated zzso chain of zzso zzso that was zzso bonded to the zzso zzso The transfer of the peptides was monitored by following the rate of change of the intrinsic zzso zzso that followed mixing of donor zzso which contained zzso zzso and a zzso zzso with zzso composed only of zzso The transfer rates were independent of the structure and concentration of the zzso The zzso were zzso with the contribution of the fast and slow components being nearly zzso The rates of both components decreased with increasing zzso chain zzso the respective free energies of zzso were linear with respect to the zzso chain zzso These results showed that, unlike zzso transfer, zzso transfer is not always a simple zzso zzso However, like zzso transfer, the transfer rates are a predictable function of zzso It is proposed that the peptides exist as zzso on the zzso surface and that the two components of transfer are due to sequential transfer of each zzso in a zzso
