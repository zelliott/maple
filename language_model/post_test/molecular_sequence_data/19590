In the zzso zzso zzso abundant surface and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain extensive zzso in the form of zzso zzso based on zzso repeating zzso zzso are zzso in the zzso zzso apparatus and require transport of zzso zzso sugar precursors to the zzso zzso by zzso sugar zzso zzso zzso transport is zzso by the zzso gene product, and here we focused on zzso for zzso Data base mining revealed 12 candidate zzso genes in the zzso major zzso including zzso as well as a candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several zzso Gene zzso studies established that two genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the single zzso and zzso zzso produced zzso an zzso double zzso was completely zzso PG synthesis was restored in the zzso zzso by zzso expression of the human zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso and zzso rescued the zzso defects of the zzso zzso zzso which is deficient in zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso and zzso functions overlap but are not zzso since the zzso zzso showed a partial zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso showed a partial zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso Identification of these key zzso in zzso will facilitate the dissection of zzso synthesis and its zzso in the zzso life cycle and further our understanding of zzso zzso
