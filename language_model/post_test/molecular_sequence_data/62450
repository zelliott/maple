Previous work in our laboratory showed that the zzso protein of zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso zzso strong zzso responses in a large proportion ( approximately zzso of zzso or naturally infected nonhuman zzso Here, the zzso response to zzso in zzso monkeys was characterized at the zzso level by measuring zzso to zzso synthetic peptides spanning the zzso zzso The zzso response against the zzso portion of the protein was the strongest in both zzso and naturally infected zzso Moreover, these zzso became zzso the earliest during experimental infection, suggesting an ordered expansion of zzso zzso clones in the course of zzso The data support use of synthetic peptides in lieu of the full-length zzso protein in diagnostic zzso detection zzso
