The complete coding sequence of the zzso zzso gene was isolated using zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso gene encodes a protein of 259 zzso acids which shares high zzso with the zzso growth factor binding protein 4 zzso of eight zzso cattle zzso zzso goat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso giant panda zzso zzso sheep (95 zzso zzso orangutan (95 zzso and rabbit zzso zzso This gene is structured in four zzso and three zzso as revealed by zzso assisted zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso gene has a close genetic relationship with the zzso gene of zzso zzso analysis indicated that there was an zzso substitution in the position of zzso zzso of zzso 2 and this zzso did not alter the zzso zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that eight pig breeds displayed obvious zzso and zzso frequency differences at this zzso zzso Association of this zzso with litter size traits was assessed in Large White (N zzso zzso and zzso (N zzso zzso zzso and the results demonstrated that this zzso locus was significantly associated with the litter size of the first parity in Large White zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These data serve as a foundation for further insight into this novel zzso zzso
