Assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso sequence zzso is an important supplement to zzso zzso sequencing for zzso closely related bacterial zzso Species differentiation can also be achieved by determination of approximate size of zzso zzso chain zzso products of zzso based on their relative zzso mobility on zzso zzso zzso species can have zzso zzso products that are similar in zzso More precise molecular weight zzso determination of these products might allow improved discrimination of such zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso has the potential to provide such zzso For zzso analysis, size limitation of zzso products is currently limited to around 130 base pairs zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two closely related species with few distinguishing zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been zzso into two subgroups, zzso zzso strain, zzso and zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso products amplified from the zzso including the zzso terminal end of the zzso zzso and a zzso portion of the zzso were analyzed by zzso A 119 or 120 zzso zzso product was produced for zzso zzso zzso However, strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso each produced 114 zzso zzso In zzso a mass zzso method was developed for differentiation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Also, the genetic similarity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso determination of the molecular weight of zzso products from the zzso zzso zzso zzso region using zzso zzso mass zzso has great potential as a general technique for characterizing closely related bacterial zzso
