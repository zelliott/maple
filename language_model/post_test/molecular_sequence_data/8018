The zzso gene encodes a putative zzso factor with affinity for a sequence motif occurring in a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso was originally found to be expressed in a T zzso fashion within a set of human and mouse cell zzso In contrast, expression reportedly occurs in multiple zzso zzso during zzso zzso We have now raised a zzso zzso to document expression and zzso of the human zzso zzso As expected, the zzso protein was zzso only in cell lines of T zzso Its expression was always restricted to the zzso zzso on a panel of human zzso revealed that the zzso protein was found exclusively in zzso and in zzso T cells in peripheral zzso zzso Western zzso yielded a set of bands ranging from 25 zzso to 55 zzso resulting from extensive alternative zzso The zzso protein was zzso in all samples of a set of 22 zzso zzso of various stages of zzso but was absent from a large number of other zzso zzso These observations imply a T zzso function for zzso a notion zzso by recent observations on zzso zzso zzso In addition, these results indicate that nuclear zzso expression can serve as a zzso marker in the diagnosis of zzso zzso
