A zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso region of the soybean zzso zzso gene and its successive deletions with a shorter zzso sequence were zzso in frame, to the zzso zzso reporter zzso The zzso zzso were introduced into tobacco plants via zzso zzso zzso of the zzso activity in seeds of transgenic tobacco showed that the upstream region, zzso to zzso zzso to the zzso initiation site zzso of the zzso gene is required for optimal expression of the transformed zzso zzso between zzso nuclear factors and DNA fragments covering the downstream region of zzso in which are included the zzso box and zzso boxes, were not zzso The zzso factors capable of binding specifically to three zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso of the upstream regulatory region were zzso Such factors appeared to be zzso and could be found solely in developing seeds at the early middle stage of zzso zzso 24 days after zzso Evidence obtained by characterizing the nature of the binding proteins and by gel mobility shift zzso established that the same factor does interact with a consensus motif zzso which occurs four times in the zzso regulatory region between zzso and zzso Moreover, this zzso motif could also be found in the zzso regulatory region of another zzso zzso zzso Thus it is likely that the observed interaction between the nuclear factor and the zzso motifs would lead to zzso of zzso from the zzso genes in maturing soybean zzso
