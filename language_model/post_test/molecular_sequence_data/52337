zzso are abundant structural proteins in the zzso zzso and zzso genes are examples of highly expressed zzso which are present in multiple copies arranged in tandem zzso zzso analysis of such zzso genes using genetic manipulation has not yet been zzso Here we describe a method for creating deletions of zzso gene clusters by targeted gene replacement and report the isolation of zzso zzso deleted for either of the two zzso zzso zzso We also report zzso zzso in which both clusters have been deleted from their zzso zzso and in which zzso genes are present as zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression in these zzso indicated a zzso zzso of zzso zzso stability in zzso zzso which contained only one-third the normal number of zzso zzso A parallel increase in zzso zzso levels indicated coordinate regulation of zzso zzso in zzso
