Recently, several zzso zzso complexes in zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to contain zzso and zzso proteins zzso However, the function of zzso in these complexes is zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso complex binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mixed zzso zzso and that zzso binding allows the complex to associate with zzso pointed ends and branch zzso zzso binds to at least two distinct zzso in the C zzso of the zzso zzso and interaction with only one of these zzso is sensitive to zzso Based on these findings, we propose a model for zzso zzso of zzso binding by relief of zzso capping of zzso by zzso
