During zzso zzso zzso activity is mainly restricted to zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso however, proceeds for several days, requiring a high stability for zzso translated zzso We studied expression of the zzso beta 2 zzso zzso which is expressed solely in the male germ line from the primary zzso stage zzso zzso elements involved in the regulation of zzso levels were investigated in transgenic fly zzso In adult zzso zzso amounts from beta zzso fusion genes in the presence of an zzso zzso element, termed beta zzso are elevated about zzso The element is present at about the same position in the zzso untranslated regions of the beta 2 zzso genes of the zzso related species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the position of the element on the zzso reduces the stabilizing effect, while inversion of the beta zzso zzso its zzso The element also acts in a combination with the beta 1 zzso zzso start site, and the beta zzso which is required to achieve zzso zzso In all experiments done, the comparison of zzso with zzso stages strongly implies that this element is involved in regulating zzso zzso This zzso stabilizing element acts in a zzso manner and also on a zzso zzso showing its autonomous functional zzso
