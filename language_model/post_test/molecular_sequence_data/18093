A gene zzso the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso was identified on a circular 73 zzso DNA from the zzso zzso flagellate zzso zzso The zzso gene of zzso extends over zzso zzso It is a split gene interrupted by seven zzso as compared to nine intervening sequences in the zzso gene of the zzso related zzso zzso zzso sequences as well as the positions of the zzso within this gene are highly zzso in comparison with the zzso zzso except that two zzso are missing in zzso The alignment of the zzso acid sequences deduced from the zzso sequences of zzso of zzso and zzso shows zzso identical zzso acids whereas zzso of the zzso acids represent conservative zzso A zzso zzso transcript of the zzso gene was revealed by northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso By zzso analysis the gene product of zzso was detected as a 53 zzso zzso Genes for components of the zzso zzso and zzso systems zzso by zzso DNA of plants and green algae are zzso on the 73 zzso DNA of zzso zzso 25, zzso From our finding that zzso obviously is capable of zzso the zzso large zzso one must conclude that these genes are expressed and form functional zzso zzso and zzso zzso
