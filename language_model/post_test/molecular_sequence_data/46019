The sense of bitter taste plays a critical role in how organisms avoid generally bitter toxic and harmful zzso Previous studies revealed that there were 25 intact bitter taste zzso zzso genes in humans and 34 in zzso However, because the recent chicken zzso project reported only three zzso zzso it appears that extensive gene expansions occurred in the lineage leading to zzso or extensive gene zzso occurred in the lineage leading to zzso Here, I examined the zzso gene repertoire in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cows, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to investigate the zzso process of zzso genes throughout zzso zzso I show that zzso the first extensive gene expansions occurred before the divergence of zzso from zzso but after the divergence of zzso zzso from zzso zzso subsequent gene expansions continuously took place in the ancestral zzso lineage and the lineage leading to zzso as evidenced by the presence of 15, 18, 26, and 49 intact zzso genes in the dog, zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and zzso zzso of the gene repertoire happened in the lineage leading to zzso Thus, continuous gene expansions have shaped the zzso repertoire in zzso but the zzso subsequent to the first round of expansions have made the chicken zzso repertoire zzso These dramatic changes in the repertoire size might reflect the daily intake of foods from an external environment as a driving force of zzso
