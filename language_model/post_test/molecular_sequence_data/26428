The zzso sequence of zzso zzso the common zzso precursor of substance zzso zzso A and zzso K zzso predicts that, in the human, the precursor contains a zzso zzso zzso of 19 zzso acid zzso zzso Using an zzso raised against synthetic human zzso in zzso we have demonstrated that an extract of a human neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal zzso contained approximately zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso substance P and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and its primary structure was zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso indicates identity with zzso The data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso like the zzso is packed into zzso storage zzso but the zzso zzso in human zzso are removed from the zzso by the action of zzso processing zzso
