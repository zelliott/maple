zzso zzso zzso is the archetype of the family of zzso zzso aromatic zzso These zzso share a zzso zzso domain but lack a recognizable fold for binding the zzso zzso We have switched the zzso specificity of strictly zzso zzso from zzso zzso by zzso zzso To that end, we altered the zzso exposed zzso zzso region zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso selective replacements of zzso and zzso weakened the binding of zzso without disturbing the protein zzso Introduction of a basic zzso at position 34 increased the zzso binding zzso Double zzso and quadruple zzso zzso in the zzso part of zzso zzso did not change the zzso zzso By extending the replacements towards zzso 38 and 40, zzso and zzso zzso were generated which were zzso more efficient with zzso than with zzso It is concluded that specificity in zzso zzso zzso is zzso by interactions of zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso of bound zzso and that introduction of an zzso group at position 38 potentially enables the recognition of the zzso group of zzso This is the first report on the zzso zzso of a zzso aromatic zzso
