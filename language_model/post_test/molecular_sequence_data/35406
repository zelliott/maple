zzso zzso is a zzso opportunistic oral zzso It is frequently associated with zzso zzso of both chronic and aggressive zzso and the diseased sites of the zzso exhibit increased levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Some bacterial species can alter their zzso properties as a result of sensing zzso We have recently shown that this zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso with zzso zzso zzso However, current knowledge about the mechanism underlying bacterial zzso sensing is still zzso In this study, we characterized the interaction of zzso zzso total membrane protein with zzso through zzso mobility shift zzso The interacting zzso which we have designated bacterial zzso zzso I zzso was identified through mass zzso and was found to be zzso zzso Based on the results obtained using protein function prediction tools, this protein zzso to the outer membrane and contains a typical zzso signal zzso All six tested zzso cultures of clinical zzso zzso strains expressed the protein according to zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso K treatment of whole zzso zzso cells eliminated zzso forms that were outer membrane specific, as determined through zzso The protein was zzso in zzso coli in both the outer zzso form and a soluble zzso zzso When assessed using flow zzso the zzso zzso coli cells were observed to bind zzso times more zzso than the control cells, as detected with zzso zzso of zzso did not cause binding of a zzso negative control zzso In a zzso zzso soluble zzso bound to zzso but this binding was not specific, as a control protein for zzso also zzso with zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso expresses an zzso zzso zzso that may be part of the bacterial zzso zzso
