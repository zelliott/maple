The zzso zzso zzso zzso function 2 region of the zzso binding domain binds the zzso motifs of zzso zzso zzso engaging instead in an zzso zzso interaction with an zzso motif in the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso motifs are present in previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which account for their selection in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rate studies, and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate zzso selective interactions of these zzso motifs with the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso within zzso function 2 indicates distinct but overlapping binding sites where specificity depends on sequences within and zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso motifs eliminated interaction with the zzso binding domain but only modestly reduced zzso zzso in zzso zzso The studies indicate that the zzso binding motif is specific for the zzso and mediates interactions both within the zzso and with zzso zzso
