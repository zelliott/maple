Human alpha zzso zzso zzso has previously been shown to possess overlapping zzso sites for zzso and zzso zzso Shieh and Travis (1988) Science zzso zzso Since this is currently unique among zzso zzso of zzso and difficult to explain in terms of accepted zzso mechanisms, we zzso the zzso zzso characterization of zzso alpha zzso revealed an additional 12 zzso preceding the published zzso prompting us to revise the previous zzso We found that zzso caused zzso of the zzso bond in the zzso loop of the zzso whereas zzso caused zzso at two sites in zzso equal amounts at 37 degrees zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso At 0 degrees C alpha zzso became a more efficient inhibitor of zzso and the proportion of zzso at site 1 declined, indicating that zzso prefers to react with site 2 at 0 degrees zzso zzso of the alpha zzso type are zzso when zzso in their zzso zzso by zzso that they do not zzso so we conclude that site 1 is treated as a zzso by zzso Site 2 is the zzso site for zzso We confirm that alpha zzso does indeed have overlapping zzso sites for zzso and zzso and since the locations of zzso sites vary with temperature, we suggest that alpha zzso cannot have rigid zzso zzso More zzso it has a mobile zzso loop of the type that has been recently demonstrated for zzso zzso
