Two zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso were isolated from sludge deposited in a crude oil storage tank and a zzso on the interior of a pipe transporting natural zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso zzso rods and grew only on zzso zzso zzso produced methane from some alcohols without showing any zzso strain zzso did not zzso zzso The optimum growth conditions for strain zzso were 35 zzso pH zzso and zzso M zzso and for strain zzso were 40 zzso pH zzso and zzso M zzso zzso zzso was zzso and strain zzso was zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that strains zzso and zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and their closest relative was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso The findings from the zzso zzso gene sequence analyses were supported by analysis of zzso the alpha zzso of zzso M zzso On the basis of zzso analyses and zzso zzso two novel species are proposed, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with type strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
