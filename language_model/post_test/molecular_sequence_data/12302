zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli is regulated by zzso repression and zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso induce zzso zzso at one or more zzso zzso termination sites in the leader region of the zzso zzso requires translation of a zzso coding region, zzso located in the zzso transcribed leader region preceding zzso the structural gene for zzso In the present paper, we show that two bacterial species that lack zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso allow zzso induction and zzso zzso regulation when they carry a zzso containing the zzso coli zzso zzso The role of zzso in induction was examined by introducing zzso in a zzso segment of zzso of zzso coli surrounding and including the crucial zzso zzso zzso Some zzso resulted in a zzso zzso these mostly introduced zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso Other zzso had little or no zzso these generally were in third positions of zzso or introduced conservative zzso acid zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed to restore partial regulation when zzso zzso 12 of zzso was changed to zzso Stop zzso introduced downstream of zzso zzso 12 in all three reading frames established that induction requires translation in the natural zzso reading zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso leader zzso acts in zzso to prevent zzso zzso
