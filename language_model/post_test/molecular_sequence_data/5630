A construct zzso a single chain variable zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was made by combining the coding sequences for the heavy and light chain variable zzso with a sequence zzso the flexible zzso zzso an zzso signal zzso a zzso identification tag, and a zzso zzso zzso The construct was expressed in zzso coli and zzso from the zzso fraction using a zzso zzso column and zzso exchange zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed that the construct retains binding affinity for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were grown in 100 zzso zzso pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of low zzso of zzso resulting in zzso removal of the zzso and zzso zzso The structure was solved to a resolution of zzso A with an R factor of zzso an zzso of zzso and good zzso This result could lead to a clinically useful product based on zzso zzso for the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso The zzso will also be useful in zzso studies of functional zzso of zzso as well as studies of the intact zzso
