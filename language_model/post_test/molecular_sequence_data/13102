The role of zzso zzso in maintaining the accuracy of translation has been investigated genetically by selecting for zzso zzso that promoted zzso at a specific site in a reporter gene in zzso zzso zzso were recovered in two different regions of 23 S zzso and each promoted zzso of stop zzso as well as increasing the levels of zzso The first group of zzso was in a small stem loop (the 1916 zzso in domain IV of 23 S zzso This zzso has been mapped to the zzso interface of the zzso close to the decoding center on the 30 S zzso The second group of zzso was in zzso 89, one of the zzso emerging from the central loop of domain zzso zzso 89 has been implicated in zzso interactions and zzso activity, and it is proposed that zzso in zzso 89 influence the accuracy of decoding by affecting the interaction of the zzso end of the zzso with the zzso zzso
