zzso of the complex gene zzso multiple zzso of structural protein zzso is regulated by alternative zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso inclusion of zzso 16 generates protein zzso zzso having a fully functional zzso binding zzso Here we show that human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with the dramatic zzso changes induced by altered culture conditions, exhibit a novel zzso zzso switch involving a new zzso zzso zzso 450 zzso in the zzso coding zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso adherent to culture dishes mostly excluded zzso zzso whereas zzso transcripts processed in zzso suspension cultures of zzso strongly included this zzso This zzso zzso switch was zzso cells transferred from zzso zzso back to plastic resumed cell division and zzso zzso zzso zzso More detailed studies revealed complex zzso alternative zzso of zzso zzso and another new zzso zzso zzso zzso These results predict the existence of multiple zzso protein zzso with diverse zzso zzso Moreover, they strongly suggest that regulation of gene expression during differentiation of zzso cells is zzso not only by zzso mechanisms, but also by zzso processes such as alternative zzso zzso
