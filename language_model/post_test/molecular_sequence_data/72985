In animals and zzso small zzso proteins called zzso zzso play a role in heavy metal zzso zzso genes have been isolated in plants, but their function remains to be zzso We have isolated two distinct zzso zzso zzso genes that belong to the type 1 group of plant zzso genes in contrast to a zzso gene we previously isolated that belongs to type zzso We found similarities and differences between the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression patterns differed and this was most pronounced in roots, which contained high zzso but very low zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso transcript levels were not significantly affected by treatment with zzso zzso zzso and zzso at least under the experimental zzso zzso zzso levels varied in leaves and stem zzso of different zzso ages, with the highest expression in the older zzso The levels of zzso zzso correlated zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels within different zzso but not with a number of other metals tested (including zzso The three bean zzso were expressed in zzso coli and found to bind zzso zzso and zzso but not to zzso The zzso were tested to determine if they differed in their ability to bind a specific metal but no significant differences in binding were zzso
