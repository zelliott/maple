zzso gene delivery is an important aspect of many gene therapy zzso The experiments reported here constitute the first successful demonstration that zzso entry can be obtained by screening a random library of zzso envelope proteins produced from a zzso cell zzso The library consisted of zzso different zzso A zzso leukemia virus envelope protein zzso with 10 randomly zzso zzso acids in the zzso zzso zzso the library for fully functional envelope proteins able to mediate stable gene transfer resulted in the identification of a single envelope protein zzso zzso zzso examination of the host range of zzso revealed that it was highly specific for zzso canine zzso zzso This was in contrast to the host ranges of the parental zzso A and closely related zzso C envelope zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells further indicated that zzso usage by zzso was also altered compared with the A and C envelope zzso The zzso envelope protein thus isolated should be useful for studying gene therapy treatments of zzso in a zzso zzso
