zzso zzso zzso is a validated target for developing zzso zzso Using affinity zzso and mass zzso zzso analysis, we previously identified a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso compound zzso that selectively modified zzso at the IN zzso zzso Here we extend our efforts to dissect the mechanism of zzso and structural features that are important for the selective binding of compound zzso Using a zzso exchange zzso we found that the inhibitor strongly zzso dynamic interactions between IN zzso Restricting such interactions does not directly interfere with IN binding to DNA zzso or cellular zzso lens zzso growth factor, but it compromises the formation of the fully functional zzso zzso Studies comparing compound 1 with a structurally related IN zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso indicated striking zzso differences between these zzso The structures of the two zzso differ only in their central zzso regions, with compounds 1 and 2 containing a single zzso zzso group and two zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments highlighted the importance of these structural differences for selective binding of compound 1 to the IN zzso zzso Moreover, molecular modeling of compound 1 zzso to IN identified a potential inhibitor binding cavity and provided structural clues regarding a possible role of the central zzso zzso group in establishing an extensive hydrogen bonding network with both interacting zzso The proposed mechanism of action and binding site for the zzso inhibitor identified in the present study provide an attractive venue for developing zzso zzso of zzso zzso
