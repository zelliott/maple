The zzso receptors in rabbit isolated rings of zzso artery and zzso vein have been characterized using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although artery rings were more sensitive than those from vein to the zzso action of zzso zzso was about three times more potent as a zzso zzso on vein than on zzso In rings zzso with zzso zzso was 10 times more potent in vein than in artery rings to induce zzso zzso However, in rings zzso to a similar tone by zzso the relaxation zzso by zzso was reduced in the vein but remained unchanged in the zzso In zzso zzso artery, zzso and zzso zzso contraction with equal zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso were weak zzso In zzso zzso the rank order of sensitivity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso act as partial zzso The ETA zzso zzso zzso zzso to the right, the zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso artery zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso shifted to the right only the response to high zzso of zzso In vein but not in artery, zzso and zzso zzso induced an zzso relaxation, which was increased, in the case of zzso in the presence of zzso
