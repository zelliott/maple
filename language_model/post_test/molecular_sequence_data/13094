The X-ray crystal structure of the high affinity complex between the zzso zzso zzso domain from rat zzso zzso 1 zzso 1) and zzso zzso has been refined to zzso A zzso The domain fold is similar to others of known zzso zzso binds on the positively charged face of the zzso polarized domain, interacting predominantly with the beta zzso 2 and beta zzso 4 zzso The zzso and zzso groups of zzso interact much more extensively than the zzso Two zzso acids in the zzso 1 zzso domain that contact zzso have counterparts in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, where zzso changes cause inherited zzso suggesting a mechanism for loss of function in zzso zzso Using zzso and varying levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso may zzso and orient signaling zzso providing a general membrane targeting and regulatory zzso
