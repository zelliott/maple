The complete zzso sequence of two zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso ill zzso from the zzso have been zzso The zzso were respectively, zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso The coding strategy and functional protein sequence motifs of zzso zzso are presented in both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso based on maximum likelihood, maximum zzso and distance analysis of the zzso identified zzso virus as a member of the zzso encephalitis virus zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso Comparative alignment of the zzso regions revealed deletions of different lengths essentially at the same position downstream of the stop zzso for all zzso zzso Two direct 27 zzso repeats at the zzso were found only for zzso and zzso zzso Immediately following the deletions a region of zzso zzso with relatively zzso primary structure zzso zzso was observed at the zzso end of the virus zzso zzso comparisons of the zzso sequence data revealed similar levels of variation between the coding region, and the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso an equivalent strong selective control for translated and untranslated zzso zzso the predicted folding of the zzso and zzso regions revealed patterns of stem and loop structures zzso for all zzso zzso suggesting a zzso selection for preservation of essential zzso secondary structures which could be involved in zzso control and zzso The possible implications of these findings are zzso
