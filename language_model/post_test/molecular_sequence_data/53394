We have isolated a zzso clone of the rabbit zzso which has an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of 518 zzso zzso The sequence shows higher identity to those of zzso human, and rat zzso than to those of rabbit zzso and zzso The pharmacological binding properties of this clone expressed in zzso cells showed a characteristic profile as zzso high affinity for zzso zzso relatively high affinity for zzso zzso and low affinity for zzso zzso e zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have compared the levels of zzso expression of three zzso zzso in rabbit zzso using the competitive reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso In most rabbit zzso except heart, zzso zzso was expressed 10 folds more than the other two zzso However, binding experiments with zzso and zzso in rabbit zzso revealed a poor relationship between binding density and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding sites were exclusively zzso in zzso whereas the zzso zzso was minor at the zzso zzso These results indicate a high identity of structural and pharmacological profiles of three distinct zzso zzso between rabbit and other species, but there are species differences in their zzso
