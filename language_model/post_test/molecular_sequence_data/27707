The primary structure of zzso zzso c zzso is zzso The intact protein was fragmented with zzso zzso into five zzso partial zzso was observed at a zzso bond of the zzso The primary structure was established partly by automatic zzso zzso partly by manual sequencing of peptides obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The order of the zzso zzso fragments was further confirmed by overlapping peptides obtained by specific zzso of the whole zzso zzso zzso c zzso consists of zzso zzso acid zzso giving a calculated Mr of zzso
