zzso is one of the first zzso genes expressed upon zzso with zzso and also zzso zzso factors are able to induce zzso zzso The zzso gene family in pea zzso zzso has two zzso A zzso clone representing zzso zzso and a zzso zzso clone zzso have been previously zzso The isolation and characterization of a zzso zzso clone is presented in this zzso By using a zzso zzso zzso transformation system it is shown that both genes have a similar expression pattern in transgenic zzso zzso root zzso zzso analyses of both zzso promoters showed that the 200 zzso immediately upstream of the zzso start are sufficient to direct zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso
