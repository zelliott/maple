Human zzso type 5 zzso 5) zzso zzso zzso and persists in skin zzso of patients with zzso zzso zzso We investigated the expression pattern of zzso 5 in zzso from benign skin zzso of zzso patients by zzso analysis and in zzso zzso Nine different zzso could be generated from total zzso of one of these zzso by reverse zzso and zzso amplification with zzso zzso zzso We could identify two major zzso zzso one was found in the zzso part of the zzso region zzso and the other just downstream of the first zzso zzso of zzso zzso Each of the characterized transcripts was processed at one or the other donor site and the two corresponding leader zzso were found in combination with both zzso and late zzso Two transcripts appear to be specific for zzso zzso one species might zzso an zzso fusion zzso and the other zzso zzso is probably zzso for the full-length zzso zzso According to the results of the zzso analysis, zzso were designed for in zzso zzso experiments to study the cell zzso expression of the different zzso Only the zzso and zzso zzso led to strong signals almost throughout the zzso The signals generated by the zzso and E1 probe increased with cell differentiation and were mainly confined to the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso yielded more or less strong signals in the terminally differentiated zzso zzso The difference in the cell zzso expression of the zzso region zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may point to a zzso processing of zzso
