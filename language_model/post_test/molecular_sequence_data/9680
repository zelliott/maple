To identify members of the zzso machinery for zzso zzso we made use of the zzso system to establish a protein linkage map centered around zzso from zzso zzso the zzso for the zzso zzso targeting signal zzso Among the five interaction partners identified, zzso was found to be induced under conditions allowing zzso zzso zzso of the corresponding gene resulted in the inability of zzso cells to grow on zzso as well as the absence of zzso zzso The zzso gene product of approximately 38 zzso was zzso and zzso demonstrated to be a zzso membrane zzso despite the lack of a zzso zzso This protein was shown to interact with itself, with zzso and with both zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating a central function for the import of zzso zzso zzso either as a zzso protein or as a releasing factor at the zzso zzso
