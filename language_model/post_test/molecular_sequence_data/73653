zzso liver zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and zzso with zzso and the sequences of two peptides were zzso This sequence information was used to screen a rat zzso zzso zzso Among 11 positive zzso two covered the whole coding zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso zzso Mr zzso shared closer similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso than with the zzso from zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso In all cases the similarity was most apparent in the zzso and zzso zzso and low or insignificant in the zzso zzso A corresponding zzso zzso zzso was present in rat zzso including zzso brain and zzso whatever the dietary status, and also in zzso of animals fed a zzso zzso diet, but not in zzso of control rats, suggesting zzso zzso The full-length rat zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso The zzso zzso and the protein zzso from liver displayed zzso zzso with respect to zzso zzso and zzso but zzso zzso by zzso was zzso this zzso was antagonized by zzso Similar properties were observed with a truncated form of zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain, indicating that the latter is not implicated in zzso zzso or in salt zzso By contrast with the bacterial zzso rat zzso zzso did not zzso the reduction of zzso indicating that this zzso is not involved in human zzso or zzso zzso
