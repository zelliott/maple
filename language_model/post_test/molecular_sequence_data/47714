We have shown previously that zzso is the most abundant protein associated with a variety of zzso zzso and exhibits about zzso zzso acid sequence identity to zzso zzso binding zzso zzso The dual function of zzso in the cell as a regulator of both zzso and translation has been zzso To gain insight into the role of zzso in these zzso we performed the zzso zzso screen to identify zzso molecular zzso Here we report the identification of zzso as a zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso from zzso extracts as well as in zzso binding studies indicate specificity and a high affinity for the interaction between zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso binding to zzso is affected by zzso binding was observed at a low zzso ratio and was greatly reduced at higher zzso Since the zzso ratio appears to be important for zzso zzso we speculate that zzso can regulate the attachment of zzso to the zzso network depending on its zzso zzso Using zzso we show that zzso binds to zzso filaments in zzso cells and causes zzso fibers to bundle in zzso Together, these findings support the view that zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso filaments in the zzso
