zzso of 13 newly isolated zzso zzso and zzso strains were compared with previously described strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Colony zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso and cellulose degradation were zzso All 13 strains were sensitive to zzso (5 zzso and zzso zzso zzso and all strains but one were sensitive to zzso (20 zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification using zzso based on gene sequences from zzso zzso zzso zzso was successful for all 13 strains in the case of the zzso gene and 11 strains in the case of zzso zzso zzso Ten strains amplified a product of the expected size with zzso developed to be specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso Two of the 13 strains did not amplify any product with the zzso zzso designed for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso recognizing restriction activity was present in all of the five strains zzso The results of this study have several positive implications with respect to future development of a transformation system for zzso zzso
