In adult zzso leukemia zzso cells, a defective human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso zzso lacking the zzso long terminal repeat zzso designated type 2 defective zzso is frequently zzso To investigate the mechanism underlying the generation of the defective zzso we zzso zzso zzso integration sites from cases of zzso In zzso zzso retaining both zzso zzso repeat sequences were adjacent to the zzso and 3' zzso In 8 of 12 cases with type 2 defective zzso zzso repeats were identified at both zzso In five of these cases, a short repeat was bound to CA zzso of the pol and zzso genes at the zzso end, suggesting that these type 2 defective zzso were formed before zzso In four cases lacking the zzso zzso short zzso to zzso deletions in the host zzso were identified, indicating that these defective zzso were generated after zzso zzso indicated zzso of type 2 defective zzso of less than zzso for two carriers, which are much lower than those seen for ATL cases zzso In type 2 defective zzso the second zzso of the tax, zzso and zzso genes were frequently deleted, leaving Tax unable to activate zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso located on the minus zzso is expressed in ATL cells with this defective zzso and its coding sequences are intact, suggesting its significance in zzso
