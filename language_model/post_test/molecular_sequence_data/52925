The giant linear zzso zzso can integrate into the central region of the linear zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis around the target site for zzso integration in strain zzso identified a total of five copies of four zzso sequences zzso in a zzso DNA zzso Three of the four zzso zzso and zzso are new IS zzso and the other is zzso All of these elements contain one open reading frame which encodes a zzso zzso Two copies of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso aligned at the left end of the zzso Following these, zzso and zzso are located in a zzso orientation with zzso identity to each zzso zzso is located at the right end of the zzso The activities of zzso and zzso were demonstrated by zzso experiments and sequence comparison of several copies, zzso
