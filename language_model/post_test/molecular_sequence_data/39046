The signaling role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been associated with diverse cell zzso Yet, the zzso significance of zzso in zzso that feature a zzso zzso zzso has remained zzso zzso generated by zzso of zzso zzso or by zzso zzso of zzso zzso slowed down or abolished zzso zzso zzso in zzso rat zzso zzso of zzso blocking zzso fusion zzso or zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered a zzso and zzso zzso release restricted to the zzso zzso In cells loaded with zzso or expressing a zzso zzso and zzso to monitor zzso zzso and potential, zzso induced transient zzso loading and zzso of the zzso These zzso changes were associated with zzso depletion of the zzso zzso and preceded the arrest of cellular zzso zzso Thus, zzso acting within a restricted cellular region regulates the dynamic of calcium flow between zzso and the zzso zzso We have thus uncovered a novel role for zzso in excitable cells, the regulation of cardiac zzso zzso
