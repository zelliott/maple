The diversity of zzso compounds produced by plants plays an important role in zzso various zzso zzso and zzso zzso This diversity has resulted from gene zzso and zzso of the zzso that zzso and subsequently modify zzso Two zzso zzso in Norway spruce zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso provide the hydrocarbon precursors for most of the zzso zzso acids found in the defensive zzso of zzso Although these zzso zzso are zzso identical at the zzso acid level, one is a zzso zzso whereas the other is a zzso zzso that forms completely different zzso We used a rational approach of zzso zzso protein sequence comparison, domain zzso and a series of zzso zzso zzso to identify the specific zzso that direct the different product zzso A zzso acid zzso switched the zzso zzso into producing zzso and zzso and none of its normal zzso Four zzso were sufficient to zzso reverse the product profiles for both of these zzso zzso while maintaining zzso efficiencies similar to the zzso zzso This study illustrates how zzso can result from relatively minor changes in protein zzso increasing the diversity of secondary zzso important for conifer zzso
