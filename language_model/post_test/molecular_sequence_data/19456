zzso zzso that occur more than 50 bases upstream of terminal spliced junctions are generally thought to lead to degradation of the corresponding transcripts by the process of zzso zzso zzso It has also been proposed that some nonsense zzso may affect zzso by the process of zzso altered zzso zzso or by the disruption of a zzso regulatory zzso In this study, the effect of the zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso 11 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator gene was zzso Evidence that zzso causes zzso 11 to skip through the creation of a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The putative zzso appears to be active when located immediately upstream of a zzso zzso zzso These findings argue against the possibility that zzso zzso 11 skipping is caused by zzso The study further suggests that zzso zzso treatment would not be effective for patients with the zzso zzso zzso to the skipping of zzso 11, and further zzso the need for detailed zzso zzso of the consequences of nonsense disease zzso
