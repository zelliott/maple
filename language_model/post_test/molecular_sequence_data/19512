zzso zzso is a key zzso modification that zzso biological zzso Despite the fact that a number of zzso strategies have been exploited for the characterization of protein zzso the identification of protein zzso sites is still zzso We proposed here an alternative approach to mine zzso signals generated from a mixture of proteins when liquid zzso mass zzso zzso analysis is zzso The approach combined zzso reaction, accurate mass zzso from a zzso mass zzso and a computing zzso to differentiate possible zzso signals obtained from the zzso analyses by taking advantage of the mass shift generated by alkaline zzso zzso The retention times and zzso values of these selected zzso signals were used to facilitate subsequent zzso experiments for zzso site zzso Unlike commonly used neutral loss scan experiments for zzso zzso this strategy may not bias against zzso zzso We have demonstrated the zzso of this strategy to sequence more, in comparison with conventional zzso zzso experiments, zzso in a mixture of zzso and zzso The zzso scheme was applied to characterize the zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso and yielded 221 distinct zzso zzso Our data presented in this paper demonstrated the merits of zzso in mining zzso signals from a complex mass zzso data zzso
