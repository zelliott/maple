B cells in rabbit zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso To determine whether the preferential zzso of zzso results from preferential zzso we examined zzso gene usage in zzso zzso gene zzso genes that would not be influenced by zzso zzso Since zzso zzso gene zzso are found infrequently in zzso and adult zzso we examined the zzso gene zzso during early fetal zzso According to zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso genes in fetal liver appeared around day 14 of gestation and zzso sequence analyses of zzso genes cloned from zzso to zzso fetuses showed that many of the genes were zzso We found that most of these zzso genes had zzso zzso indicating to us that the preferential zzso of zzso is due to preferential zzso We compared the zzso sequence of the promoter region of zzso with sequences of several other zzso and infrequently zzso zzso genes and found that the core zzso factor motifs were similar in all zzso promoters zzso We suggest that zzso activity of the zzso promoter region does not explain the preferential zzso of zzso
