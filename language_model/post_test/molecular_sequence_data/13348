A high number of zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from a partial zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On average, zzso and zzso repeats occur in the zzso approximately every 8 zzso and zzso zzso zzso This is the highest density of zzso zzso reported in the zzso zzso categories of repeats are imperfect and compound repeats for zzso zzso and perfect repeats for zzso zzso Comparisons with other zzso and with zzso species showed significant differences in the frequency distribution of these categories of zzso Many zzso and zzso repeats are surrounded by various types of zzso suggesting an zzso distribution of short tandem zzso A high level of zzso zzso is demonstrated with one zzso zzso showing that multiple mating of the queen occurs in zzso zzso
