High affinity zzso play a central role in calcium zzso by zzso the active zzso of calcium from the zzso This study reports the identification of two additional type zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso and describes the detailed sequence analysis of these genes in comparison with zzso and other plant and animal zzso Southern analysis suggests that each of these genes is present as a single copy and also that there may be a small family of moderately related genes that zzso type zzso zzso in zzso Evidence is also provided from zzso that these genes are expressed in zzso zzso analysis predicts that the zzso of the zzso type zzso proteins is similar to the animal zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses suggest that the type zzso zzso can be further divided into zzso
