The organization of the zzso DNA zzso control region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso This zzso zzso represents the longest zzso for zzso so far, since the entire zzso sequence ranges from approximately zzso to approximately zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is organized in three distinct zzso a zzso domain near the zzso zzso a variable domain zzso the zzso zzso zzso and a relatively large central tandem array made up of a variable number of approximately 170 zzso repeats that is responsible for the zzso length variation zzso Like other zzso found in insects, the zzso zzso zzso contains two long zzso runs that may be involved in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso structures in the repetitive domain were identified and their possible role in generating length variation is zzso zzso comparison of the tandem repeat elements of zzso zzso suggests mechanisms of concerted evolution leading to homogenization of the repetitive zzso The utility of such an array of tandem repeats as a genetic marker for assessing zzso zzso and evolutionary relationships among populations is zzso Finally, the technical difficulties found in zzso the zzso zzso in zzso are remarked zzso
