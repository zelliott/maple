To zzso the mechanism underlying the zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the adrenal cortex, we have cloned the mouse zzso zzso The analysis of the zzso zzso showed an untranslated region of 321 zzso and the zzso gene was demonstrated to be composed of two zzso of 113 and 112 zzso lying upstream of the single coding zzso zzso zzso protection zzso showed two major zzso start sites separated by 4 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region inserted in a zzso reporter zzso had zzso promoter activity because it was functional only in mouse zzso zzso cells but not in mouse zzso zzso cells or zzso L zzso There was no dramatic change in the promoter activity in zzso cells for all the deletions tested up to zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso In contrast, expression in zzso cells was switched on from deletion zzso zzso while remaining zzso in L zzso zzso zzso of a zzso factor 1 zzso site at position zzso zzso resulted in a significant reduction in zzso expression by the promoter in zzso zzso zzso shift analysis of this site indicated specific binding of a protein in extracts of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, expression of zzso in L cells induced promoter activity of the construct zzso In conclusion, zzso expression of the mouse zzso appears to be controlled by at least two zzso One of them, most probably zzso is responsible for zzso zzso zzso The other as yet unknown factor binding between position zzso zzso and zzso zzso acts as a strong zzso factor in zzso zzso cells, resulting in the zzso expression of zzso
