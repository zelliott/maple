A proposed zzso mechanism of rapid zzso response to zzso has been the intense focus of recent zzso zzso a synthetic zzso is reported to act selectively through a rapid zzso pathway, rather than through the classical nuclear zzso zzso zzso pathway, to maintain bone density in zzso mice without zzso zzso To evaluate the mechanism and zzso effects of zzso we studied responses in adult zzso zzso In a zzso zzso zzso we found that 300 zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso in comparison, a more zzso response was seen with 1 mug zzso zzso The zzso response was partly zzso independent, because zzso knockout zzso zzso also exhibited a more moderate weight zzso zzso induced zzso cell proliferation in zzso but not zzso mice, indicating zzso dependence of the zzso growth zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes by zzso indicated that early (2 zzso changes in gene expression are similar to the early responses to zzso These gene responses are zzso dependent, because they are not seen in zzso zzso Later zzso changes in gene expression (24 zzso are blunted compared with those seen 24 h after zzso In contrast to early zzso these later zzso responses are independent of zzso because the zzso shows a similar response to zzso at 24 zzso We found that zzso or zzso treatments lead to depletion of zzso in the zzso zzso fraction and zzso in the nuclear fraction within zzso zzso consistent with the ability of zzso to regulate genes through a nuclear zzso rather than a zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the nuclear fraction of both zzso and zzso samples, suggesting that zzso might be involved in the later zzso zzso responses to zzso In conclusion, our studies suggest that zzso is zzso zzso in the mouse zzso and might induce nuclear zzso and zzso zzso Given its activity in our zzso model, the use of zzso as a zzso clinical compound needs to be zzso
