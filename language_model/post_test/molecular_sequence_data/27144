Among the members of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso channels zzso are receptors distinguished by the presence of two zzso in the zzso domain, for example, the zzso zzso Such receptors have thus far been cloned only from zzso and from zzso zzso and zzso We have now cloned and expressed two zzso receptors from zzso zzso a zzso and have shown that they form zzso zzso zzso We have also built up a database including the two receptors cloned here, previously cloned zzso and zzso zzso receptors taken from zzso and the same type of receptors obtained by a search of recently cloned zzso including two zzso zzso an zzso a zzso an zzso and another zzso We subjected these receptors to zzso analysis, alone and in combination with zzso receptors from the same zzso and from a recently cloned zzso The zzso analysis revealed the presence of two independent zzso of zzso zzso one from zzso and other from zzso and suggests that the ancestors of the current zzso zzso types zzso from the zzso receptors and from each other before the zzso zzso Finally, combining the results from the zzso analysis with those obtained from an analysis of the zzso receptors in light of recently published hypotheses concerning the zzso binding pocket, we predict that zzso receptors are not exclusively a zzso zzso
