The general zzso paradigm for eastern North America zzso is that many plant and animal species retreated into southern zzso during the last glacial period, then expanded zzso after the last glacial maximum zzso However, some zzso of the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain zzso demonstrate complex yet zzso zzso patterns that cannot be explained by this zzso For example, eight zzso endemic plant zzso with ranges from New York to South Carolina exhibit a large zzso separating northern and southern populations by zzso zzso zzso zzso a plant zzso that exhibits this pattern, consists of two zzso recognized as either species or zzso We investigated the zzso and zzso of zzso using zzso data, zzso zzso and amplified zzso length zzso zzso zzso characters thought to be important in distinguishing zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate substantial overlap with no clear zzso zzso differentiation is minimal and diversity estimates for northern and southern populations of zzso are similar, with no decrease in rare zzso in northern zzso In addition, the northern populations zzso several unique zzso zzso zzso appears to consist of one zzso variable species that persisted in or near its present range at least through the latter zzso while the zzso of the northern and southern populations may be comparatively zzso This work demonstrates that the zzso paradigm is not always appropriate and zzso endemic plants, in particular, may exhibit zzso patterns zzso different from those of other zzso plant zzso
