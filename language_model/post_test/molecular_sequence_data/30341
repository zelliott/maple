To investigate zzso relationships in zzso zzso zzso zzso we deleted the following zzso in the heavy zzso a) The zzso growth factor domain zzso zzso zzso b) the finger domain, and the zzso growth factor domain zzso zzso zzso and c) the finger, the zzso growth factor and zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso To study specifically the function of the growth factor domain we made two zzso of zzso 8 zzso acids zzso zzso in the growth factor domain zzso zzso and zzso the whole domain with factor IX growth factor domain zzso zzso Finally, zzso an analogue with substitution in the finger domain zzso consensus zzso was constructed zzso zzso A reduced zzso binding of all the zzso was zzso The zzso zzso activity of all zzso was also reduced and correlated to the zzso zzso In contrast, the activity of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and the plate zzso were only slightly reduced as compared to authentic zzso This suggested that at high zzso zzso the decreased zzso affinity was less critical for obtaining a high zzso zzso All zzso had a prolonged zzso in zzso as compared to authentic zzso The assumption of clearance mechanism involving mainly the growth factor region (or zzso 1) was not challenged by the observation of a prolonged zzso for the substitution analogue zzso zzso
