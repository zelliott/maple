The rapidly expanding availability of de zzso sequencing technologies can greatly facilitate efforts to monitor the relatively high zzso rates of influenza A viruses and the detection of zzso Both the zzso rates and the lineages of influenza A viruses are likely to play an important role in the natural history of these viruses and the emergence of zzso and zzso distinct zzso 

We evaluated zzso and mixed infections by de zzso sequencing the whole zzso of 10 virus zzso including eight avian influenza viruses grown in zzso chicken eggs (six waterfowl zzso - five zzso and one zzso an zzso turkey zzso and a bald eagle isolate with zzso mixed zzso and two tissue cultured zzso zzso influenza zzso Two waterfowl zzso zzso were included in the zzso zzso sequences of all segments were obtained with 20 to zzso coverage for the ten viruses and one zzso zzso The second zzso zzso yielded 15 influenza reads of approximately 230 zzso sufficient for zzso zzso of mixed infections or zzso zzso zzso or zzso of viruses were identified in four egg grown avian influenza zzso and one cell cultured zzso zzso A bald eagle isolate and the second zzso zzso showed evidence of mixed infections with two zzso and zzso and three zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Multiple sequence differences were identified between zzso zzso and the virus recovered using zzso chicken zzso 

We describe a new approach to zzso identify mixed infections and zzso in low passage influenza A zzso and zzso zzso and add to the understanding of the ecology of influenza A virus zzso
