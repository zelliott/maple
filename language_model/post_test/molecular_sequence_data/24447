zzso a protein with zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is important for zzso stress tolerance in both budding and zzso zzso Human zzso has associated zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso including synthetic Holliday zzso zzso zzso resolves Holliday junctions into linear duplexes by cutting across the junction exclusively on strands of like zzso In addition, zzso protein abundance increases in cells following exposure to agents that block DNA zzso Taken together, these findings suggest a role for zzso in resolving Holliday junctions that arise when DNA replication is blocked by damage or by zzso zzso zzso is not related by sequence to previously characterized Holliday junction resolving zzso and it has distinct zzso properties that suggest it uses a novel zzso strategy to cleave Holliday zzso
