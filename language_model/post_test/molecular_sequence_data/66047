We have studied the evolution of a type IV zzso system zzso in zzso which is thought to have changed function from zzso to zzso adherence following a recent horizontal gene transfer zzso The system, called zzso is unique among zzso in that genes zzso both zzso and zzso components are located within the same duplicated zzso This provides an opportunity to study the influence of selection on proteins involved in zzso zzso We zzso the zzso locus from several strains of zzso zzso and investigated its evolutionary history by comparisons to other zzso zzso Several instances of zzso and gene conversion events where detected in the zzso to zzso duplicated gene fragments encompassing zzso explaining the homogenization of the zzso protein zzso and the divergence of the minor zzso protein zzso A zzso analysis of the 7- to zzso duplicated gene coding for the major zzso protein zzso displayed 2 distinct zzso likely representing a zzso zzso The analyses of the zzso zzso strains also identified a recent horizontal transfer event of almost the complete zzso zzso We suggest that the switch in function of the zzso was zzso by the zzso of the genes zzso zzso components and their diversification by zzso sequence zzso within and among zzso We suggest that the zzso proteins have evolved by diversifying selection to match a divergent set of zzso surface structures, consistent with the trench warfare zzso zzso
