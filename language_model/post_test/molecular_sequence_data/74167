Previous studies of zzso zzso zzso in zzso African populations enabled us to identify discrepancies in zzso zzso suggesting the presence of new zzso and of a greater zzso than so far described in other zzso 

To analyze these discrepancies and to assess the factors leading to potential zzso in these zzso 



zzso samples from a zzso woman following in zzso death and panels of blood donors from zzso zzso Congo, and zzso from Central zzso 

zzso was performed using zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso and sequencing zzso 

Three new zzso were found on zzso zzso zzso 26 a) zzso situated between zzso and zzso b) zzso downstream of zzso c) zzso 26 zzso These zzso may lead to zzso DNA typing results, due either to a zzso in the complementary sequence recognized by the primer or to the appearance of a new zzso restriction zzso Furthermore, a bilateral linkage zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso 21 and the zzso zzso zzso 26) zzso found in zzso Asian, and zzso populations is not found in African zzso suggesting that its appearance was prior to zzso 

Three new zzso have been identified, two of them potentially zzso through their zzso Furthermore, the zzso found on zzso 26, localized in the complementary sequence of the zzso zzso may lead to a false typing zzso It is therefore important to diversify techniques, both zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to ensure accurate zzso zzso system zzso
