A region of zzso zzso has been zzso that is a part of a locus on the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a number of genes involved in zzso zzso zzso including zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso regulatory methanol zzso genes and the gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso Fifteen new zzso have been identified within the new region, and their sequences suggest that they zzso the following zzso the zzso part of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and 31 zzso of unknown function, three putative zzso of an zzso zzso two zzso similar to the products of zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso and other zzso a zzso zzso three zzso of folate zzso and zzso of 13 and zzso zzso with no zzso in the protein zzso Ten zzso zzso have been generated in the region to determine if the newly identified genes are associated with C1 zzso A zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso while zzso in the other genes all showed a zzso zzso It was not possible to obtain zzso zzso in a putative folate metabolism zzso zzso zzso the necessity of these folate synthesis genes for metabolism of C1 and zzso zzso zzso in the putative ABC zzso zzso the genes similar to zzso and zzso and other unidentified zzso produced zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso regions have been investigated upstream of zzso and zzso using the promoter probe zzso zzso zzso from these promoters was weak in zzso zzso zzso zzso but increased in regulatory zzso zzso
