The zzso zzso complex is composed of various cell zzso molecules and zzso plaque zzso Using a zzso zzso that recognizes a chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso complex, we have cloned a zzso of its mouse zzso The full-length zzso of mouse zzso zzso a zzso zzso containing a zzso domain with sequence similarity to zzso a tight junction zzso plaque zzso We designated this protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was concentrated in the zzso complex in various types of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, in the liver and zzso zzso was also distributed along zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso was found to be localized to the zzso of zzso in the liver, but in some zzso its distribution was not restricted to zzso but extended to the area of zzso zzso zzso studies have revealed that zzso was recruited to the zzso complex in zzso cells and to zzso contacts and stress fibers in zzso These findings suggest that zzso is involved in zzso the zzso zzso complex, especially zzso to zzso zzso
