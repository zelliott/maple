Greek small zzso zzso zzso strains remain relatively zzso at the molecular level, despite the fact that zzso diseases of small zzso are known to be widespread in the zzso In the present study, we investigated the sequence diversity of the zzso region in Greek zzso strains from sheep with and without disease symptoms, since sequence differences within this zzso area have been shown to lead to zzso with distinct replication zzso The zzso and zzso zzso motifs and the zzso were highly zzso among Greek zzso whereas the two zzso sites exhibited some zzso zzso comparisons with reference strains revealed that Greek zzso sequences were closer to the zzso strains zzso average zzso rather than the zzso strain zzso zzso average zzso The most striking difference observed between the two groups of animals was a zzso zzso deletion in the strains obtained from the zzso zzso The deletion was located within the R region of zzso which was also found to be much less zzso zzso average zzso than the zzso and zzso Taken together, our data suggest that the R region of zzso may be involved in virus zzso zzso Furthermore, a specific deletion within this region may, at least in part, be associated with low zzso of some zzso zzso
