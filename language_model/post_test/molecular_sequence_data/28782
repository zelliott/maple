We have identified a novel human gene zzso zzso a protein related to zzso of zzso zzso The combined sequence derived from several zzso clones is zzso zzso and comparison with zzso sequence shows that the gene contains 11 zzso The longest open reading frame encodes a deduced sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the zzso gene is highly zzso and related to sequences in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chicken and zzso zzso analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso points to possible existence of multiple zzso zzso zzso protein also displays some similarities to the bacterial zzso type zzso signature and to zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso As revealed by Northern analysis, the level of expression varies significantly between zzso with the highest level detected in the zzso The gene was mapped to zzso band zzso by zzso in zzso zzso We suggest that this gene is a member of a novel zzso gene zzso
