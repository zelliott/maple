Two models describing the interaction between zzso small nuclear zzso zzso and the zzso zzso site of zzso have been proposed on the basis of zzso zzso Here it is shown that a zzso sequence present in zzso zzso forms base pairs with zzso zzso at the zzso zzso junction and that this interaction is involved in zzso zzso site zzso These results demonstrate a specific function for zzso zzso in zzso and suggest that zzso zzso has a zzso role during zzso site zzso A model is presented in which this new interaction, in concert with previously described interactions between zzso zzso U2 zzso and the zzso zzso would position the branch point near the zzso zzso site for the zzso of the first zzso zzso
