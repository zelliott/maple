The DNA base sequence changes induced by zzso zzso zzso were analyzed in zzso male germ cells of zzso zzso 31 zzso zzso zzso were recovered in F1 and zzso generations, with a frequency of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso The results show that zzso zzso both base pair zzso zzso and deletions zzso In zzso with its relatively high ability to zzso zzso in DNA, the most frequent type of sequence zzso among the zzso changes are zzso zzso accounting for zzso of zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso transitions and zzso zzso Both induced deletions were zzso zzso not occurring between zzso zzso No influence of neighboring bases on the zzso position was zzso
