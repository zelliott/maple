zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the transfer of a zzso zzso from zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of complex zzso via zzso zzso These zzso structures are essential for the attachment of zzso acid to the zzso zzso and its levels are useful for the differential diagnosis of zzso zzso with respect to the zzso of zzso We have been successful in the zzso and zzso cloning of zzso from zzso brain and from a human zzso cell zzso In the present study, zzso expression of zzso in various rat zzso and human cancer cell lines was zzso along with the expression of zzso zzso and the induction by treatment with several zzso zzso analysis indicated high expression levels of zzso in brain and zzso zzso of normal rats, as well as for a number of zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Although various zzso did not induce zzso zzso differentiation of a tumor cell enhanced the zzso by zzso to zzso These results may provide new insight into studies on zzso in terms of zzso or zzso
