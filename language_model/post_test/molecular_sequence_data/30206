Previous studies demonstrated correct zzso and zzso expression of human zzso and zzso genes in transgenic zzso however, expression was extremely zzso When the zzso zzso I zzso zzso sites that are normally located upstream of the human zzso locus were fused individually to zzso or zzso zzso expression increased to zzso mouse zzso levels but zzso specificity was zzso In contrast, when the HS sequences were combined with fragments containing both zzso and zzso zzso correct zzso regulation was zzso We suggest that human zzso to zzso gene switching during development results from competition of individual zzso gene family members for interaction with the HS sequences and that factors influencing these competitive interactions determine zzso zzso
