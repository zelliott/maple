zzso coli uses the zzso motive force of the zzso membrane and zzso protein to zzso the active transport of zzso and vitamin B12 across the outer zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and outer zzso presumably during the course of energy zzso Previous results indicated that the zzso 65 zzso acids of zzso are essential for both its outer membrane association and zzso A highly zzso region zzso zzso within this domain, predicted to be an zzso zzso was the initial focus of this zzso zzso zzso indicated that only the aromatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso were individually important for zzso When the crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso subsequently became available, we observed that two additional aromatic zzso outside that region, zzso and zzso were potentially engaged in zzso zzso interactions with the three zzso identified zzso zzso these five aromatic zzso individually to zzso reduced zzso zzso Surprisingly, however, each substitution exhibited a unique zzso profile with respect to ability to support zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso B, D, zzso and M or sensitivity to zzso zzso The zzso results suggested that the zzso of zzso was a flexible and dynamic domain that could interact specifically with different zzso or zzso perhaps through the aromatic zzso The possibility of interactions among all the aromatic zzso was tested using zzso cycle zzso All possible combinations of zzso zzso were constructed, with the result that zzso containing any zzso substitution was inactive in the zzso zzso while retaining the ability to associate with the outer zzso This zzso rather than zzso effect of the double zzso suggested that, consistent with the flexibility suggested by analysis of the single zzso all the aromatic zzso might be capable of interacting with one zzso A means of reconciling these results with the crystal structure is zzso
