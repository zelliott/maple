T cell zzso major zzso complex zzso and zzso constitute zzso complexes which induce T cell zzso T cells in zzso mice generate zzso responses to a synthetic zzso composed of zzso zzso of pigeon zzso c zzso and its zzso with substitution at position 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, none of these peptides stimulate T cells in zzso zzso We zzso two zzso at positions 46 and 54 of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with two zzso acids on zzso of the zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice with these newly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Apart from zzso these peptides zzso T cell responses in zzso mice in an zzso manner, but did not stimulate those in zzso zzso Further, zzso inhibited competitively the responses of zzso restricted T cell zzso specific for zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso at positions 46 and 54 on the peptides act as an zzso and the zzso at position 50 acts as an zzso in zzso mice, as in zzso mice, and provide the possibility of opening up a new method to prepare zzso zzso which induce T cell responses in each zzso strain by introducing appropriate zzso acids on zzso
