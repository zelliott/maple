zzso of zzso throughout the zzso is essential for the growth and differentiation of zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso which is involved in nuclear migration, encodes a zzso zzso heavy zzso In this paper we use zzso to characterize the zzso zzso zzso heavy chain zzso and to show that the zzso is concentrated at the growing tip of the zzso zzso We demonstrate that four zzso zzso in the zzso gene result in a striking decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in nuclear division in animal zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso are able to grow slowly with occasional zzso found in the zzso and are able to undergo nuclear division, we have created a zzso zzso zzso and a tightly zzso zzso zzso These zzso exhibit a zzso very similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso with respect to growth, nuclear distribution, and nuclear zzso This suggests that there are redundant backup motor proteins for both nuclear migration and nuclear zzso
