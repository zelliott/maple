This study describes the functional characterization of a specific zzso zzso responsible for catalyzing the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso acid zzso The zzso was zzso from Aedes aegypti larvae by ammonium zzso zzso heat treatment, and various zzso techniques, plus zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a relative molecular mass of zzso by zzso zzso and internal sequencing of the zzso protein and its zzso fragments resolved a partial zzso sequence of 19 zzso acid zzso and 3 partial internal zzso sequences with 7, 10, and 7 zzso acid zzso Using zzso zzso based on the partial internal sequences for zzso amplification and zzso library zzso a full-length zzso clone with a zzso open reading frame was zzso Its deduced zzso acid sequence consists of zzso zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso and shares zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis shows the active zzso of the zzso in larvae and developing zzso zzso specificity analysis of this zzso zzso demonstrates that the zzso is active with zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso has greater affinity and zzso efficiency for zzso than for zzso and zzso The zzso characteristics of the zzso in conjunction with the profiles of zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso during zzso development clearly point out its zzso function in the zzso to zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso zzso was evolved in a manner precisely reflecting the zzso requirement of detoxifying zzso produced in the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso
