The zzso upstream region of a chicken zzso class I gene zzso contains sequence motifs similar to the zzso consensus sequences zzso contained in promoters of many zzso zzso zzso To study a possible functional role of this putative chicken zzso an zzso spanning the upstream sequences of the zzso gene zzso was cloned zzso or in multiple copies before the zzso zzso promoter controlling the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso expression studies performed with primary chicken zzso zzso showed that the chicken zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso The chicken zzso however, enhanced zzso activity up to zzso following treatment with chicken zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter also confirms that the upstream DNA sequences zzso contain a functional zzso recognized by chicken zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso gene was also activated by chicken zzso when introduced into zzso zzso zzso of chicken zzso containing reporters was also observed in transformed chicken zzso zzso We show that the chicken zzso binds two specific nuclear factors present in chicken zzso which are induced by zzso These factors were also capable of recognizing the mouse zzso suggesting the conservation of a relevant zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that the chicken zzso motif contained in a sequence from zzso to zzso of the zzso gene acts as a strong zzso element, which has been functionally zzso during about zzso million years of separate evolution of zzso and zzso
