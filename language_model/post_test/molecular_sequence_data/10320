zzso zzso zzso which is also referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a zzso acid zzso that can induce zzso outgrowth in zzso and is highly expressed in several zzso during fetal development but exhibits expression restricted to brain and bone zzso in zzso We have reported the zzso structure of mouse zzso zzso in which the open reading frame spans four zzso and at least two additional zzso zzso zzso zzso U2 and downstream zzso zzso zzso From analysis of isolated zzso two types of zzso were zzso one has a sequence for zzso and U2 and the other has a sequence for an zzso zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso This suggests that the zzso gene zzso two alternative zzso a zzso and a zzso promoter, designated promoters II and I, respectively, for the translation initiation site zzso zzso II is thought to exist upstream of the zzso while promoter I is present in the zzso zzso was employed to examine which zzso promoters are used during development and in various cell zzso In adult mice zzso 2 zzso usage of promoter I was zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in many zzso including brain and zzso At one fetal stage zzso promoter I was active in the major zzso including brain, liver, zzso and zzso while promoter II was active only in the zzso In the cell lines zzso usage of promoter I was zzso while promoter II was active only in a few cell lines such as zzso zzso for 7 zzso and zzso These findings suggest that zzso may play fundamental roles in zzso growth and maintenance of adult zzso as well as in zzso and indicate that the expression of zzso is zzso at least in part, by the usage of different promoters in the zzso
