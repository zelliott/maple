We have zzso zzso I zzso data for the binding of zzso factor zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso taking into account the zzso contacts observed in the crystal structure of the zzso zzso complex zzso zzso This structure was not available when many of the original zzso experiments on the zzso complex were zzso In this way the pattern of zzso I zzso can be interpreted to map out with greater precision the regions on the zzso DNA occupied by zzso Then, assuming the binding site for a zzso may be the same as that found in the structure of the zzso protein zzso complex zzso and taking into account zzso data for truncated forms of zzso the zzso zzso were fitted within the permitted zzso On the basis of this, an alignment of the zzso of zzso with its DNA binding site is proposed, which combines features of earlier models zzso
