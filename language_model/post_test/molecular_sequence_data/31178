The rapid zzso of sequence data has provided insight into the evolution of proteins and led to the identification of zzso zzso These proteins have evolved by duplication, zzso and deletion of a common pool of structural units or zzso yet their biological functions are zzso They are involved in cell zzso and migration, zzso and the pathways of blood zzso zzso and zzso The modular units are defined by zzso zzso which often include zzso zzso zzso Despite the available sequence information, little is known of the zzso structure of mosaic zzso If, however, the zzso zzso of the zzso were known, valuable structural information could be zzso about a wide variety of proteins and biological zzso An important mosaic protein is zzso an zzso zzso protein that consists of three types of module (see zzso 3, 7 for zzso Here we describe the structure of the zzso type 1 module which appears twelve times in zzso and is also found in factor zzso and tissue zzso zzso The module was produced using a zzso expression system and the structure was determined in solution using zzso zzso This methodology promises to be extremely powerful in the investigation of zzso from a wide range of mosaic zzso
