We have identified a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso designated zzso (for zzso cell zzso zzso is a type II membrane zzso of 237 zzso with a single zzso recognition domain zzso closest in zzso to those of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso contains a consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso A mouse zzso zzso a zzso protein has been zzso Northern zzso analysis showed zzso zzso to be predominantly transcribed in zzso zzso The gene zzso human zzso was localized to zzso zzso in a region close to the zzso gene zzso Unlike members of this complex, zzso displays a typical zzso zzso rather than an zzso cell type zzso domain, and was expressed on DC, zzso zzso B zzso and zzso but not detected on zzso and T zzso zzso was strongly expressed by DC derived from blood zzso cultured with zzso and zzso zzso was mostly expressed by zzso rather than zzso cell related DC obtained from zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso expression was zzso by signals inducing DC maturation such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso Thus, zzso is zzso expressed on DC depending on their origin and stage of zzso zzso represents a novel surface zzso expressed by zzso presenting cells, and of potential importance in regulation of DC zzso
