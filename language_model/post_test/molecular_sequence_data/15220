In 2006, we sampled the zzso bottom waters of a volcanic lake beneath the zzso ice cap zzso The sample contained 5 zzso zzso cells per zzso and zzso fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso showed these to be essentially all bacteria, with no zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of a clone library and zzso zzso of four major zzso revealed that the zzso was dominated by a few groups of putative zzso bacteria whose closest cultivated relatives use zzso sulfur or hydrogen as electron donors, and zzso zzso or zzso as electron zzso Hundreds of other zzso are present at lower abundance in our zzso tag libraries and a zzso analysis indicates that sampling did not reach zzso but FISH data limit the remaining zzso to zzso of all zzso The composition of this zzso can be understood in the context of the chemical zzso created by the mixing of zzso lake water and zzso glacial zzso
