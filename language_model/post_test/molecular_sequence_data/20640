While characterizing various zzso forms of zzso zzso we observed what appeared to be a novel zzso modification of zzso resulting in a higher molecular weight form that was dependent on the zzso zzso Further investigation revealed the higher molecular weight form to be a fusion protein between sequences zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso We found that the publicly available sequence of the zzso we used does not agree with the experimental zzso We caution other investigators to be aware of this potential zzso
