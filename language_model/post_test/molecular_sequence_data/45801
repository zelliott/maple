zzso nuclear zzso zzso a member of the nuclear zzso zzso binds DNA exclusively as a zzso zzso controls important aspects of zzso function, such as DNA zzso protein stability, zzso binding and interaction with zzso zzso data of the zzso zzso domain zzso demonstrated that the zzso interface is composed of zzso in zzso 7, 9 and 10 with zzso salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and zzso interactions contributing to the stability of the zzso To investigate the importance of the proposed zzso interactions for zzso zzso interactions critical for formation of the zzso zzso interface were disrupted by introducing point zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso interaction, DNA binding and zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso are able to bind DNA as zzso and zzso zzso confirmed zzso in zzso Furthermore, the zzso do not compromise zzso activity and are responsive to zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso located in the zzso loop, which was suspected to be involved in zzso stabilization via an zzso interaction with zzso zzso was zzso In contrast to the conservative substitution zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso revealing that the nature of substitution may play an important role in zzso zzso
