The zzso zzso from zzso zzso is toxic to larvae of zzso zzso and Aedes zzso which are zzso of important human tropical zzso With the objective of designing modified toxins with improved potency that could be used as zzso we determined the structure of this toxin in its functional form at a resolution of zzso zzso Like other zzso zzso the activated zzso toxin consists of three zzso zzso a zzso bundle responsible for pore formation zzso I) and the following two other zzso having structural similarities with zzso binding zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a plant zzso zzso zzso zzso We also studied the effect on toxicity of zzso acid zzso and deletions in three zzso located at the surface of the putative zzso binding domain II of zzso Our results indicate that one loop is an important zzso of zzso presumably through attachment of zzso to the surface of zzso zzso The availability of the zzso structure should guide further investigations aimed at the molecular basis of the target specificity and membrane zzso of zzso zzso
