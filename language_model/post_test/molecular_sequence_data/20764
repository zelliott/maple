Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were examined as potent zzso in mouse zzso melanoma cells for their feasibility as building blocks for zzso zzso zzso by zzso cells was first observed for all zzso zzso and, especially, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were shown to produce zzso larger amounts of zzso products than the corresponding true sugar zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso by cells resulted in zzso and subsequent zzso of the incorporated zzso zzso giving rise to zzso products zzso and zzso having similar zzso structures as the zzso zzso According to efficient zzso in cells, in addition to stability of the zzso zzso ends of the zzso that formed, the zzso zzso zzso have been demonstrated to be versatile building blocks for these zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso for zzso zzso was found to be decreased by one-third for zzso zzso zzso Observation of similar levels for zzso zzso under both cellular and zzso conditions suggested that zzso are likely to recognize the zzso oxygen zzso
