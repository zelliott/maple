To test whether human zzso zzso zzso with large scale sequence zzso to the upstream regulatory region are present in cervical zzso zzso zzso and cervical zzso 

New zzso based zzso were designed specifically to detect large scale zzso zzso in the upstream regulatory region of zzso 16 and zzso The zzso were applied to 24 cases of zzso and 34 cases of cervical zzso previously shown to contain these two high risk zzso zzso 

No large scale sequence zzso were found in any of the zzso containing zzso or zzso 

These negative findings suggest that major upstream regulatory region zzso of zzso 16 and 18 do not contribute to most cervical zzso
