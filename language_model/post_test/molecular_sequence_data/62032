We have cloned the zzso and zzso DNA of an active zzso zzso L from zzso zzso The zzso zzso has the shortest zzso among zzso L zzso It was predominantly expressed in zzso with an expression level of at least 10 times higher than in any other zzso It also has expression in stomach, zzso eye, zzso zzso and zzso Western blots zzso the mature zzso in zzso and a zzso L in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso L zzso is localized in the large zzso zzso of the zzso B cell of zzso zzso has a role in food zzso An interesting finding is that it exists in the nucleus of zzso zzso might have a specified zzso role in the nucleus of zzso zzso might also have a zzso function as is suggested for zzso zzso zzso
