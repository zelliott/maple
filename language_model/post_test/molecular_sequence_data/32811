In the zzso gene cluster of the zzso zzso zzso the small zzso zzso encodes a 71 zzso protein which shows significant sequence similarity to zzso from the zzso zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso zzso genes are frequently found in the zzso gene clusters of zzso antibiotics and zzso but their function has remained zzso In a recent publication it has been suggested that these genes may have no function for secondary zzso zzso An zzso deletion of zzso in the zzso cluster has now been carried zzso When the modified cluster was expressed in the zzso host zzso zzso zzso zzso was still zzso However, when the two further zzso genes from elsewhere in the host zzso were zzso as well, zzso formation was reduced zzso zzso with zzso or with any of three other zzso genes restored zzso zzso This is the first report proving the requirement of an zzso gene for secondary zzso formation, and the first proof that different zzso genes can functionally replace each zzso Feeding of an zzso triple zzso strain with an intact zzso zzso restored zzso production, showing that zzso is specifically required for the formation of this zzso of the zzso zzso
