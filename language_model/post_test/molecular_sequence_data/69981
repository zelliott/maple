The human zzso inhibitor heavy chain zzso zzso heavy chain zzso gene was isolated from two overlapping zzso It spans 14 zzso and is composed of 22 zzso from 15 zzso to 281 zzso in size and has consensus zzso zzso zzso sizes range from 80 zzso to 2000 zzso It codes for the precursor of zzso that is part of the serum zzso form of 220 zzso Two major zzso initiation sites were identified in the zzso region, which contained putative promoter zzso but no typical zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso heavy chain zzso was found only in zzso The zzso zzso of the gene might be due to the presence of binding sites for the zzso nuclear factor zzso and to the zzso zzso A previous overlapping of zzso clones indicated the absence of 29 zzso in one of these zzso The present study shows that the 29 zzso is located within the gene at the end of zzso zzso A zzso zzso chain reaction mapping analysis of liver zzso identified the two types of the zzso for zzso heavy chain zzso zzso the data demonstrate that there is alternative zzso of at least one zzso of the zzso heavy chain zzso zzso
