The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been widely recognized as a zzso for the detection of zzso activity in zzso chemical zzso We characterized the expression status of this important constituent of reproduction in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso freshwater fish species indigenous to Southern Africa, and investigated its utility in detection of exposure to zzso using a quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso We initially isolated a zzso upstream promoter region of the zzso gene and identified putative binding sites for several regulatory factors including zzso zzso zzso Evidence for the expression of several zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in a number of tissue zzso A quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was subsequently developed based upon a specific primer pair zzso that selectively amplified the zzso zzso The level of this transcript in liver tissue was high in females and lower, but zzso in males and was significantly increased in male fish following laboratory exposure to zzso zzso This study further established that juvenile whole body zzso zzso contained extremely low levels of zzso zzso zzso between 5 and 110 days zzso zzso compared to adult male zzso zzso exposure of 20 zzso juveniles to zzso showed a substantial increase in this transcript within hours, and when compared to classic male model under same conditions, the juveniles were remarkably more zzso We therefore conclude that the zzso using zzso methodology, of zzso zzso expression in 20 zzso zzso zzso juveniles has promise for assessing zzso zzso activity in aquatic zzso
