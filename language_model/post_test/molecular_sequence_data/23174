We report the novel cloning and preliminary characterization of a human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso initiation site was mapped to a base 337 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso by primer extension and zzso The minimal functional promoter region is within zzso zzso when the zzso zzso were zzso into zzso zzso The sex hormone testosterone significantly increases promoter activity, suggesting that hormonal regulation of zzso is the root cause of observed differences in zzso levels between males and zzso
