zzso zzso zzso for enhancing transplanted cell zzso in zzso and stimulating the zzso of injured zzso requires a zzso approach customized for the tissue to be zzso In particular, nervous tissue engineering may take a great advantage from the discovery of novel functional motifs zzso transplanted stem cell zzso and nervous fiber zzso Using zzso display technology we have discovered new zzso sequences that bind to zzso neural stem cell zzso neural precursor cells zzso and promote their viability and differentiation in zzso when linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso We characterized the newly zzso zzso zzso via atomic force zzso circular zzso and zzso obtaining zzso zzso that support human and zzso zzso proliferation and differentiation in zzso One zzso zzso zzso showing the highest stem cell viability and neural differentiation in zzso was finally tested in acute zzso spinal zzso injury in rats, where it fostered nervous tissue regrowth and improved locomotor zzso Interestingly, animals treated with the zzso zzso had an zzso zzso intermediate between zzso animals and zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso with zzso peptides may constitute promising zzso scaffolds for in zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso therapy of the injured nervous zzso Moreover, this zzso approach can be used to zzso zzso for other specific tissue engineering zzso
