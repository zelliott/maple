zzso peptides zzso are zzso molecules of innate zzso zzso zzso a recently discovered zzso with zzso activity, is produced zzso by the zzso sweat zzso and zzso into zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso processing, zzso zzso and stability of zzso peptides in zzso zzso Using zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso analysis, we identified in zzso sweat 14 zzso processed zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that processing of zzso is individually different, but generates a few dominant zzso At body sites with a high probability for contact with zzso zzso a high amount of zzso active zzso peptides was detected in zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso rate of zzso is constant during a period of prolonged sweating and that zzso peptides are stable in sweat over several zzso Other known zzso like the human zzso zzso and zzso or zzso were not detected in significant quantity in zzso zzso zzso to the durable and abundant presence, zzso peptides contribute to the first line of defense by building a constant barrier that zzso the zzso zzso
