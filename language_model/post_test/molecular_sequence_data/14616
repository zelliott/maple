zzso zzso zzso belong to a family of proteins that selectively zzso a small zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and regulate several essential cellular activities such as cell division, zzso segregation and zzso zzso A comparative zzso sequence analysis of different zzso species indicates the presence of multiple zzso zzso that exhibit highly zzso zzso However, an exact function of most of these zzso in zzso remains zzso In the present study we characterized the function of a zzso zzso in zzso by employing an zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso by an open reading frame, designated as zzso zzso acid sequence alignment and zzso analysis suggest that zzso zzso as zzso is highly zzso in zzso zzso modeling of zzso reveals a zzso structure zzso of zzso fold typical to zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli exhibits a zzso zzso activity which is inhibited by the presence of zzso Interestingly, the zzso protein is zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso during zzso and exhibits association with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further studies demonstrate that zzso is essential for interaction of zzso with zzso zzso of zzso and specifically zzso zzso of zzso are required to facilitate this zzso Moreover, zzso devoid of zzso region interacts well with zzso even in the absence of zzso indicating a regulatory role of the zzso domain in zzso zzso
