Recently, we found that zzso a tight zzso zzso was concentrated in the so called isolated zzso junction fraction from the liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso Using this fraction derived from chick liver as an zzso we obtained three zzso zzso specific for a approximately zzso protein in zzso This zzso was not zzso from plasma zzso without zzso suggesting that it is an integral membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso with these zzso showed that this approximately zzso membrane protein was exclusively localized at tight junctions of both zzso and zzso zzso at the electron microscopic level, the labels were detected directly over the points of membrane contact in tight zzso To further clarify the nature and structure of this membrane zzso we cloned and zzso its zzso We found that the zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso A search of the data base identified no proteins with significant zzso to this membrane zzso A most striking feature of its primary structure was revealed by a zzso zzso four putative zzso segments were included in the zzso zzso This zzso plot was very similar to that of zzso an integral membrane protein in gap zzso These findings revealed that an integral membrane protein zzso at tight junctions is now identified, which we designated as zzso
