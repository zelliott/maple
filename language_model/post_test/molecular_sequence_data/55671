This study investigates the functional state of the zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso hybrid cells chronically exposed to an zzso For this purpose, a novel in zzso zzso protocol was established using zzso selectively depleted of zzso function by transient exposure to low pH and then zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso With zzso E1 zzso zzso zzso zzso activity as an zzso zzso zzso of cells previously rendered tolerant to the zzso zzso zzso exhibited approximately zzso elevated zzso generation upon stimulation with zzso compared with zzso zzso cell zzso This effect developed zzso with respect to the zzso concentration used for zzso of the cells and was blocked by zzso exposure to zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso by the stable zzso analogue zzso did not reveal any difference in zzso zzso activity between zzso zzso of control and chronically zzso zzso Furthermore, the functional activity of zzso zzso displayed no difference between control and zzso cells, as assessed in zzso zzso zzso zzso using sodium zzso extracts derived from zzso zzso The data presented suggest that the increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso hybrid cells most likely relates to enhanced zzso efficiency between the zzso binding site zzso and zzso Moreover, our results support the concept that zzso to zzso drugs reflects an zzso mechanism of cells chronically exposed to an zzso
