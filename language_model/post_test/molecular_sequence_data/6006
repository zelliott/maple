The zzso zzso motor zzso zzso is assembled from two zzso zzso zzso and zzso together with an zzso 115 zzso zzso Here we report the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso a close relative of zzso Both zzso and zzso are predicted to have a zzso domain organization consisting of an zzso motor domain, a central stalk domain capable of zzso formation, and a second zzso zzso zzso The sequences of the central stalk zzso predict that zzso and zzso should be capable of forming zzso coiled zzso Furthermore, zzso complexes can be zzso from a zzso translation system, providing direct evidence that zzso and zzso are capable of zzso
