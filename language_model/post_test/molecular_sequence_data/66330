zzso is a potent zzso agent that is activated by zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso that can activate the drug results in increased zzso to the zzso As zzso of zzso zzso by human zzso is relatively inefficient, we have developed zzso therapy approaches based on the zzso combination using a rabbit liver zzso zzso However, the in zzso application of this technology may be hampered by the development of an immune response to zzso zzso we have developed a zzso human zzso zzso based on the human liver zzso zzso that can activate zzso approximately zzso more efficiently than the zzso protein and can be expressed at high levels in zzso zzso Indeed, zzso delivery of zzso with human tumor cells resulted in up to a zzso reduction in the zzso value for zzso as compared to cells zzso with zzso control zzso Furthermore, zzso studies with human tumors expressing zzso confirm the ability of this zzso to activate zzso in zzso and induce zzso zzso We propose that this zzso should likely be less zzso than zzso and would be suitable for the in zzso application of zzso zzso zzso
