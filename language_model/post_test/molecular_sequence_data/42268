Human zzso zzso gene was engineered for expression in zzso zzso The stability of zzso zzso produced by two kinds of cells, Chinese zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso cells, were zzso The zzso expressed in zzso cells in zzso medium was zzso by zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso This zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso more efficiently than by zzso On the other hand, the zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells was not zzso resulting in the stable production of zzso at a rate of 2-3 zzso zzso by use of a gene amplification method with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso cells showed the desired characteristics as a host cell for the production of zzso zzso The stability of zzso proteins in zzso systems may vary depending on the host zzso
