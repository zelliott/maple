In the zzso and zzso of higher plants there is an zzso editing activity responsible for specific zzso zzso and for a few zzso zzso leading to zzso sequences different from the corresponding DNA zzso zzso editing is a zzso process which essentially affects the transcripts of protein coding zzso but has also been found to modify zzso transcribed regions, structural zzso and zzso zzso zzso editing is essential for correct gene expression: proteins translated from edited transcripts are different from the ones deduced from the genes sequences and usually present higher similarity to the corresponding zzso zzso zzso and stop zzso can also be created by zzso zzso zzso editing has also been shown to be required for the stabilization of the secondary structure of zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso editing in plant zzso is still largely zzso In zzso recent experiments indicate that zzso editing may be a zzso zzso A zzso transformation technique showed to be a powerful tool for the study of zzso zzso The zzso as well as the evolutionary features of zzso editing in both zzso are compared in order to identify common as well as zzso zzso
