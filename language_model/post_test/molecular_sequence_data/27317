zzso muscle zzso caused by unloading is characterized by both decreased responsiveness to zzso growth factors zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso and zzso and increased zzso Here, we show that unloading stress resulted in skeletal muscle zzso through the induction and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso with and zzso the IGF-1 signaling intermediate zzso In turn, the loss of zzso activated the zzso induction of zzso a dominant zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice were resistant to zzso zzso and the loss of muscle zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso and strongly decreased the zzso induction of zzso Our results indicate that the zzso destruction of zzso is a critical dual zzso of both increased protein degradation and reduced protein synthesis observed in zzso muscle zzso The zzso of zzso zzso may be a new therapeutic strategy for zzso muscle zzso
