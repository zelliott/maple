A novel zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed in this paper based on two strains isolated from leaves and one strain from soil in zzso The strains produce one or two zzso zzso in each zzso preceded by zzso of individual zzso zzso assignment and distinction of the species from other recognized species of zzso are based on zzso and zzso characteristics and on zzso analysis of zzso sequences of the zzso zzso of the large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene reveals that the zzso closest relatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso The novel species could be differentiated from the latter two species based on zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was isolated from a leaf of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
