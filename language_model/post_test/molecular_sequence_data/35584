In this paper, we cloned a novel full-length zzso that encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso using zzso zzso The zzso mature zzso protein zzso was then expressed in an zzso coli expression system and zzso with zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso revealed that zzso was expressed across all development stages of the zzso but had the highest expression level during the adult zzso Furthermore, zzso was detected in zzso zzso products with zzso rabbit zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso was strongly recognized by the zzso zzso zzso in Western zzso zzso that zzso protein appeared in the peripheral blood of zzso mice as circulating zzso zzso We then analyzed the dynamic levels of zzso zzso and its zzso in zzso zzso zzso by using an improved zzso sandwich zzso zzso zzso zzso and indirect zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso can be detected much earlier compared to zzso detection in zzso zzso In addition, we monitored the effects of zzso drug therapy (a dosage of zzso body weight, twice a day) on zzso zzso mice by detecting the levels of zzso zzso and its zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso The results showed that the levels of zzso dramatically decreased after successful drug treatment, while the zzso level remained zzso Overall, the novel zzso zzso zzso could be a promising novel circulating zzso zzso for the detection of zzso infection and for monitoring the efficacy of drug treatment of zzso
