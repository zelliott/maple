The recent development of selective and highly potent zzso zzso for zzso receptors has constituted a major breakthrough in the field of zzso zzso Following the discovery of the first zzso zzso for zzso receptors ten years ago, numerous other zzso have been developed for most zzso zzso These new, metabolically stable compounds, orally active and capable of crossing the zzso barrier, offer clear advantages over the previously available zzso zzso zzso zzso have provided valuable tools to investigate zzso receptors at the zzso pharmacological and anatomical levels, and have considerably advanced our understanding of the zzso roles of peptides in the zzso and zzso Evidence from animal and clinical studies suggests that zzso zzso binding to zzso receptors could be useful for the treatment of disease states associated with high levels of zzso In this article Catalina zzso zzso zzso and William zzso will address the recent developments in zzso zzso for zzso zzso with a particular focus on their zzso zzso
