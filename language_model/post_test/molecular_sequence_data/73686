zzso were isolated from soybean zzso soil collected as two field sites in zzso All the zzso were identified as zzso species and were screened for zzso production and the presence of two zzso zzso and zzso known to be involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso resistance profiles were determined for 53 zzso from cultivated and zzso sites, and approximately half the strains were zzso zzso zzso by the zzso pair group method with averages indicated the presence of two major zzso with the majority of resistant strains from cultivated sites being placed in cluster zzso Only representatives from this cluster contained zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso were zzso diverse, and only half could be assigned to known zzso zzso comparison of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes revealed that zzso producing zzso were zzso zzso It appeared that a population of zzso had zzso the zzso and that a proportion of these were capable of zzso zzso
