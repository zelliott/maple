zzso zzso zzso transport zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are very attractive therapeutic targets in zzso zzso of the functions and structures of zzso is necessary for the development of effective medicine which targeting these zzso However, in comparison with zzso there is little information on location of the function zzso of zzso and which constituent zzso acids govern the transport function of zzso The aim of the present work was to determine the molecular mechanism of zzso transport via zzso 

Transport of zzso via zzso was determined by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso was measured in the absence and presence of chemical modification agents and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed the zzso of zzso 

In zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso a compound specific for zzso zzso completely abolished the transport activity of zzso although this zzso was prevented by the presence of zzso On the other hand, chemical modifications except for zzso treatment had no effect on the transport activity of zzso The zzso has six zzso zzso zzso two in the zzso zzso zzso and four in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso of zzso is void of any transport activity without the zzso of zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso in zzso is a critical zzso involved in zzso zzso recognition by zzso
