zzso cloning and complete zzso sequencing of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso contained four zzso segments with sizes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each zzso segment had unique sequences and contained a single large open reading frame zzso In zzso translation of transcripts derived from full-length zzso clones of zzso zzso yielded single products of sizes similar to those predicted from the deduced zzso acid sequences of the individual zzso zzso similarity searches revealed that zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso In this study, it was determined that zzso encodes the major zzso protein and that zzso zzso by zzso is zzso as a minor zzso All four zzso of zzso like the zzso segments of viruses with zzso zzso were found to have extended regions of highly zzso terminal sequences at both zzso In addition to the strictly zzso zzso 10 zzso a second region consisting of zzso of the sequence zzso was found immediately upstream of the zzso zzso zzso These zzso repeats are reminiscent of the zzso zzso elements of zzso The zzso 14 zzso were also strictly zzso As zzso and related viruses with four zzso segments zzso zzso have not been previously characterized at the molecular level, they were zzso classified in the family zzso zzso viruses with zzso zzso This study represents the first report on molecular characterization of a zzso and the results suggest the creation of a new family of zzso with zzso zzso zzso to accommodate zzso and related zzso
