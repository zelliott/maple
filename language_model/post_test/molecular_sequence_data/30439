zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso in zzso and energy metabolism of all zzso zzso of its activity in human zzso plasma has become a standard procedure for diagnosis of Type I zzso and other types of zzso This paper presents a rapid and simple zzso procedure for human zzso zzso and the production of specific zzso zzso In the isolation zzso the fat zzso of human milk obtained by zzso was zzso and a zzso fraction zzso zzso on zzso and zzso This three-step procedure provides a high yield of apparently pure zzso with very high specific activity against zzso zzso zzso The apparent molecular weight of zzso on zzso was 60 zzso zzso acid analysis and zzso sequencing proved the identity and the apparent zzso of the isolated zzso zzso and zzso III, common zzso in earlier isolation procedures, were not zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to produce in the rabbit a specific zzso zzso that inhibited zzso activity from human zzso plasma and other zzso In zzso plasma from normal individuals, zzso zzso was used in Western zzso to show zzso zzso In zzso zzso or in certain patients with Type I zzso no specific signal was zzso The improved zzso procedure presented here allows the rapid isolation of human zzso and production of zzso to the zzso both of which will greatly facilitate future studies of this important zzso
