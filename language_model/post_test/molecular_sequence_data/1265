In this study, we compared the properties of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from human urine by zzso followed by a zzso zzso zzso m or zzso zzso zzso These zzso differ in their action upon different hormone zzso We used zzso zzso to further characterize the zzso The zzso specificity of urinary zzso was studied using different internally zzso fluorescent zzso and zzso was zzso by zzso Other zzso present in zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso neutral zzso like and zzso converting zzso were not able to zzso this zzso zzso is zzso inhibited by zzso and resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is completely inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso bound zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso When studying zzso zzso the zzso sites determined to the related zzso were zzso using BK as zzso and zzso using zzso The kilometers value obtained for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from kidney and urine can zzso zzso bounds from components of the zzso system, the zzso system and the zzso system, straight contributing in kidney zzso zzso was located at the zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and can have an important function in the control of zzso found in this portion, since is known that all components of the zzso system were found in this zzso The zzso role of zzso could be related to the zzso between the zzso system and zzso in the control of the water zzso balance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso (1992) zzso
