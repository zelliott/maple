Type zzso collagen is a newly discovered member of the zzso zzso zzso with interrupted triple zzso group of zzso zzso zzso Based on the primary structure, type zzso collagen is thought to act as a zzso between zzso and other zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the complete zzso organization of zzso and show that it contains 51 zzso spanning more than 250 zzso of zzso zzso The comparison of zzso structures of zzso and other zzso family genes revealed several similarities among these zzso The structure of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 domain of the zzso chain is similar to that of the NC zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 domain of the zzso chain except for the NC 3 domain of zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso 6 domain of zzso are also similar to those of the zzso zzso 4 domain of zzso zzso Previously, zzso was mapped to human zzso zzso where zzso is also zzso Likewise, the present work shows that the mouse zzso gene is located on mouse zzso 1, region A3, where zzso has also been zzso Taken together, the data suggest that zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were duplicated from the same zzso gene of the zzso zzso Three CA repeat markers with high zzso were found in zzso These markers may be useful for linkage analysis of age-related zzso diseases involved in eyes and/or zzso
