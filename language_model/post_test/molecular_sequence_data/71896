zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso domain zzso linked through a zzso intervening sequence to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain forming a zzso fused zzso zzso advantages of zzso were zzso by separating the zzso on the zzso level and expressing them as zzso zzso zzso protein generated from the zzso domain alone was fully active in both the forward and reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited no zzso zzso However, extension of the zzso domain at the zzso zzso by inclusion of the 36 zzso zzso region restored zzso zzso An zzso mixture of the two zzso zzso zzso the overall reaction zzso of zzso from zzso + zzso comparably to the fused zzso zzso The importance of the domain order and organization was demonstrated by generation of a series of rearranged zzso in which the order of the two active zzso was reversed or altered relative to the zzso zzso The critical role of the zzso region was established by generation of zzso that had the zzso deleted or rearranged relative to the two active zzso The intrinsic stability of the various zzso was also investigated by measuring zzso zzso as a function of time of incubation at 25 or 37 degrees zzso The expressed zzso zzso which was initially fully active, was unstable compared with the fused zzso wild type zzso zzso with a zzso of 10 zzso at 37 degrees zzso Progressive extension by addition of zzso sequence at the zzso side of the zzso zzso eventually stabilized zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly zzso in a zzso manner in the rearranged proteins as zzso In contrast, no significant zzso of any truncated zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was observed at either zzso It would therefore appear that fusion of the two zzso enhances the intrinsic stability of the zzso zzso
