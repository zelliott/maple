zzso zzso regulatory proteins zzso constitute a novel family of zzso zzso that control the expression of several diverse zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso one of only a handful of these proteins yet discovered, controls the zzso of the zzso zzso antibiotics zzso and zzso Recently, comparative analyses have revealed significant similarities among the predicted zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso domain of the zzso family of regulatory zzso Using the crystal structure of the zzso domain as a template, zzso was mapped by zzso and zzso zzso Several highly zzso zzso within the zzso are crucial for DNA binding and protein zzso zzso arranged zzso imperfect repeat sequences are found within the zzso promoter regions of target zzso zzso for each zzso within the repeats of the zzso promoter were performed by zzso zzso The zzso promoter fragments were found to have modified binding characteristics in gel mobility shift zzso The spacing between the repeat target sequences is also critical for successful occupation by zzso and, therefore, competent zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
