zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso play pivotal roles in the life cycle of zzso but strict regulation of their activities is also essential for maintenance of zzso physiology and interaction with zzso In this study, we identified and characterized zzso a novel inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed low sequence identity to other zzso zzso but 3 motifs zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso zzso in zzso zzso were found in the zzso The overall structure of zzso consisted of 8 zzso that progressed in parallel and closely resembled the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited various zzso zzso including zzso human zzso B, human zzso zzso and zzso with K zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was active over a wide pH range and was highly stable under zzso zzso The protein was zzso and retained its zzso activity even after incubation at zzso zzso formed tight complexes with zzso zzso so the complexes remained intact in the presence of sodium zzso zzso and zzso but they were zzso by zzso An zzso electron zzso analysis demonstrated diffused zzso of zzso within zzso and zzso but not within zzso which suggests a possible role for zzso in host cell invasion by zzso zzso
