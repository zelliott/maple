Although the structural analysis of membrane proteins is zzso an understanding of the basic principles that zzso their folding and assembly remains limited because of the high zzso intrinsic to these molecules and zzso challenges in obtaining zzso Fortunately, from an experimental standpoint, membrane protein folding can be zzso as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso segments one with another to form the final functional protein zzso zzso derived from the sequences of native zzso zzso segments and those that mimic their properties are therefore valuable in the experimental evaluation of protein folding within the zzso Here we present an overview of the progress made in our laboratory and elsewhere in using zzso models toward defining the sequence requirements and forces stabilizing membrane protein zzso
