In the present study, we determined the complete zzso DNA zzso sequence of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso We present here an analysis of features of its gene content and zzso organization in comparison with zzso zzso to assess the variation within the zzso zzso and among main groups of zzso The size of the entire zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso zzso containing 2 zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso 22 transfer zzso zzso genes and one control zzso These genes are transcribed from both strands and have a zzso composition high in A and zzso The contents of zzso of the complete zzso are zzso for zzso zzso The AT bias had a significant effect on both the zzso usage pattern and zzso acid composition of zzso There are a total of zzso zzso in all 13 zzso zzso excluding termination zzso The most frequently used zzso acid is zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Met zzso zzso regions in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are zzso zzso in zzso The order and orientation of the gene arrangement pattern is identical to that of zzso zzso except for the position of the zzso zzso zzso analyses using zzso zzso acid sequences of 13 zzso zzso with three different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all revealed two distinct groups with high statistical support, indicating that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two separate species, consistent with results of previous zzso and molecular zzso The complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso provides additional genetic markers for studying population zzso zzso and zzso of zzso
