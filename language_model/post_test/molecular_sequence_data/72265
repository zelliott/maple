The avian zzso have an intrinsic zzso clock function that controls rhythmic synthesis of zzso and an environmental light signal can reset the phase of the zzso In addition to the zzso function, the zzso synthesis of the zzso is regulated by neural signals from sympathetic zzso Thus the avian zzso show diagnostic characters which seem to represent an evolutionary transition from zzso cells of lower zzso to the zzso cells of zzso To understand the evolutionary background of the regulatory mechanism for the zzso synthesis in this organ, we screened the chicken zzso zzso library to find zzso of zzso zzso involved in the zzso and neural zzso In addition to the zzso zzso zzso zzso supposed to mediate the zzso pathway, we isolated zzso clones zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha and its zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of each G alpha had a potential site for zzso zzso zzso As it is known that zzso zzso zzso of zzso synthesis is blocked by zzso zzso the zzso identified in the present study are likely to contribute to this neuroendocrine function of the chicken zzso zzso
