Selective chemical modification of zzso zzso has been carried out with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso was shown to result in loss of its ability to interact with intermediate electron transfer protein - zzso To identify zzso acid zzso involved in zzso pairing with complementary zzso groups of zzso zzso zzso complex with zzso was modified with zzso zzso zzso was then removed and zzso zzso was additionally modified with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and separation of digest obtained by combining various types of zzso resulted in seven major radioactive zzso The zzso acid sequence of the peptides was determined by zzso The major zzso groups modified with radioactive zzso zzso were found to be at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso and at zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso The role of zzso interactions in fixation of zzso zzso complex with zzso is zzso
