zzso protein zzso also known as zzso is a major zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is expressed on the zzso surface of the membrane with the zzso zzso zzso anchor and zzso in urine at a rate of zzso zzso per zzso Although zzso is the most abundant urinary zzso the function of zzso remains zzso In addition, little is known about the mechanism by which large amounts of zzso are actively released into the urinary zzso In this study, we examined the zzso structure of highly zzso zzso derived from human zzso zzso Y efficiently zzso urinary zzso indicating that the zzso structure of the protein contains an zzso acid zzso with a free zzso zzso These results are consistent with our previous finding that urinary zzso does not bind zzso zzso We obtained peptides from the complete zzso of urinary zzso with zzso We zzso the most zzso zzso with zzso zzso pore glass zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis indicated the zzso begins with zzso 520 and ends between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing of highly zzso urinary zzso gave a sequence of zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso zzso We therefore conclude that urinary zzso is generated by a zzso zzso between zzso and zzso 66 zzso acids upstream of a possible zzso attachment zzso Because the sequence of zzso including the zzso site, is highly zzso to that of zzso a zzso protein within the zzso and both zzso and zzso are abundantly found as soluble forms in the zzso zzso a common mechanism may exist governing the zzso release of zzso membrane zzso
