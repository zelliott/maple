The zzso degrading zzso zzso in human plasma and the zzso active on these zzso were studied by kinetic and zzso zzso Data obtained evidence the existence of complex zzso of zzso zzso and of formation of its zzso zzso These appear to originate from the combined effect of further zzso of the zzso fragments after their release and of competition between the different zzso present in zzso zzso separation of plasma zzso zzso indicates the existence of several pools of substances acting on all three zzso groups that degrade zzso The partial specificity of these substances zzso competition zzso consequently, the actual protection over zzso is considerably lower that the total zzso zzso That notwithstanding, plasma zzso control zzso zzso to a relevant extent, while they modify only slightly the ratio of zzso between the different zzso This latter zzso specifically the large prevalence of zzso over zzso and zzso controlled mainly by kinetic zzso
