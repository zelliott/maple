It is well known that zzso stimulating hormone zzso zzso the differentiation of mouse zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso Although zzso hormone zzso possesses the same zzso acid sequence as zzso does, it is not clear whether the zzso and its fragments induce the differentiation of mouse zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso of human zzso and its fragments were investigated by adding them into a culture medium zzso zzso from the initiation of primary culture of zzso cell zzso Their zzso were compared with the potency of zzso After 2-4 days of primary cultures with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso appeared in the zzso and zzso of zzso that were in contact with the adjacent zzso zzso By 14 days, cultures contained mostly pigmented zzso The order of zzso of zzso fragments and zzso shown by the zzso value was as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The length of their zzso chains was zzso zzso to the zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso and zzso failed to induce the differentiation of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso and zzso possessed a weak potency at high doses only zzso and 1,000 zzso These results suggest that zzso is the minimal message sequence required to induce the differentiation of mouse zzso zzso in culture zzso The zzso acids of zzso and zzso are suggested to be important for its zzso
