We have identified three members of a mouse gene family related to the zzso segment polarity zzso zzso zzso Like zzso they zzso putative zzso proteins and are thus implicated in zzso zzso One of these, Sonic zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso the floor plate, and the zone of polarizing activity, signaling centers that are thought to mediate central nervous system zzso and limb zzso zzso expression of zzso in the mouse zzso leads to the zzso of floor zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may play a role in the normal zzso interactions that pattern the zzso zzso
