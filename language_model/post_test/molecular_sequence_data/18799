To clone and express functional, zzso full-length human zzso in partial zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We constructed double promoter series expressing the constant regions of the light and heavy chain genes using the zzso expression zzso zzso the obtained zzso was named zzso Human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were isolated and zzso was performed using 44 pairs of zzso zzso to generate variable region genes of the heavy and light chains zzso and zzso Then, they were inserted into the zzso zzso The full-length human zzso library zzso was transformed into partial zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso analysis of 20 clones was carried out and the zzso were submitted to the zzso zzso to determine accuracy and diversity of the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was zzso and the expressions of zzso and zzso were determined by zzso The full-length human zzso library zzso was constructed with a library capability of zzso The zzso analysis showed that the zzso were functional as zzso 

We successfully constructed a full-length human zzso zzso library in zzso zzso zzso which allows the screening of functional zzso
