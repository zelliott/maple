zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis is a broadly used technique for detecting zzso The aim of this work was to assess the zzso of zzso as a new tool for the detection of the molecular zzso of zzso zzso - zzso Three zzso regions were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso amplified by zzso were subjected to zzso under conditions zzso for each zzso zzso In all of the analyzed regions, zzso revealed the presence of zzso zzso by routine zzso zzso zzso of the method was confirmed by the multiple alignments and zzso analyses of representative sequences showing different zzso zzso
