zzso by zzso involves the fusion of viral and cellular zzso with subsequent transfer of viral genetic material into the zzso The zzso envelope zzso that mediates fusion consists of the surface zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso directs zzso attachment to the zzso zzso and zzso then promotes zzso membrane zzso A zzso zzso zzso complex within zzso composed of zzso and zzso zzso segments has been proposed to represent the core of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso can be formed by the zzso and zzso peptides connected by a flexible zzso in place of the zzso loop zzso zzso structure of zzso reveals that three molecules fold into a zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso within the bundle form a central, zzso zzso coiled zzso whereas three zzso zzso pack in the reverse direction into three zzso grooves on the surface of the zzso zzso This zzso zzso displays the salient features of the core structure of the isolated zzso zzso and thus provides a possible target for zzso designed selectively to block zzso zzso
