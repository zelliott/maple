This report describes zzso zzso gene targeting at two zzso zzso in zzso zzso y and zzso In the best case, nearly all induced parents produced zzso zzso zzso of their offspring were new zzso and most of these were targeted gene replacements resulting from zzso zzso zzso with a marked donor zzso The procedure that generates these high zzso relies on zzso of the target by designed zzso zzso zzso and production of a linear donor in zzso Increased induction of zzso expression led to higher zzso of gene zzso demonstrating the beneficial effect of zzso the zzso In the absence of a zzso donor DNA, zzso zzso led to the recovery of new zzso at three zzso zzso and zzso zzso end joining zzso after zzso Because zinc fingers can be directed to a broad range of DNA sequences and targeting is very efficient, this approach promises to allow genetic manipulation of many different zzso even in cases where the zzso zzso cannot be zzso
