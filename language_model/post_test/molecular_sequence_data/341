zzso zzso has undergone extensive degenerative evolution, with a large number of zzso It is also the zzso with the greatest divergence between gene zzso from independent zzso zzso zzso zzso is a good model to verify the currently predicted coding sequence regions between different zzso to identify new ones and to investigate the expression of zzso We submitted a total extract of the bacteria isolated from zzso to zzso using a linear zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso were analyzed using the zzso zzso genes and 1133 zzso and zzso zzso zzso databases and a database containing the full zzso zzso We identified a total of zzso zzso including five proteins zzso by previously predicted zzso which upon closer inspection appeared to be proper zzso Only 11 of the additional zzso by zzso were zzso We also identified six zzso peptides from five proteins from regions not considered to be coding zzso in addition to peptides from two zzso gene candidates that overlap with other zzso Our data show that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is quite accurate, and there were no zzso observations corresponding to true zzso except for a new gene candidate, overlapping with an essential zzso on the complementary zzso
