The zzso zzso is an zzso zzso on both zzso and zzso DNA zzso We have investigated the zzso of the zzso reaction with small, zzso zzso zzso under zzso conditions using zzso flow zzso zzso complexes were allowed to form in zzso zzso The zzso reactions were initiated by mixing with zzso The reaction zzso were fit to several possible reaction mechanisms and quantitative estimates were obtained for rate zzso for individual reaction zzso The relative rates of forward reaction versus zzso from the DNA, and the fact that inclusion of excess zzso zzso DNA to trap free zzso has no effect on the zzso reaction, indicates that the reaction is zzso The reaction products show that the reaction begins near the zzso of the zzso zzso and the major zzso sites are two to four zzso bonds zzso The product distribution is unchanged as the zzso concentration varies from 10 zzso to 100 zzso zzso while the overall reaction rate varies by about zzso These observations suggest that DNA zzso is tightly coordinated with movement of the zzso along the zzso The reaction zzso at low zzso of zzso (10 zzso and 25 zzso have a significant lag before zzso products zzso We propose that the lag represents zzso movement of the DNA from an initial binding site in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso to the zzso active site in a separate domain of zzso The extent of reaction of the zzso is limited zzso zzso under all zzso This may indicate the formation of a zzso zzso complex that does not zzso in the 1-2 s zzso of our zzso
