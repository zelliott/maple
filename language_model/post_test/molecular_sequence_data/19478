zzso zzso is a widespread zzso heavy metal that enters the aquatic environment as a result of natural and human-caused activities, including industrial zzso mining, and agricultural zzso In the present study, we investigated time and zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in a number of goldfish zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels remained unchanged in the zzso tested throughout the zzso zzso with zzso significantly increased zzso zzso levels in the brain, liver, kidney and zzso in a zzso manner at all time tested zzso 12, 24 and 36 zzso We isolated the full length zzso zzso from goldfish zzso and found it to contain zzso zzso including an open reading frame, predicted to zzso a protein of 142 zzso zzso In contrast, injection with zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso levels in the liver and kidney in a zzso and zzso zzso and became zzso after 12, 24 and 36 zzso The findings provide molecular characterization of zzso and zzso in goldfish and suggest that exposure to zzso results in significant zzso changes in zzso
