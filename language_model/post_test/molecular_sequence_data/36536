zzso DNA size was measured in clinical zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of DNA restriction zzso Because of the high zzso zzso content of zzso zzso DNA, restriction zzso that recognize sequences with at least four zzso base pairs were expected to be rare zzso Five zzso that produced fragments greater than 200 zzso in size were used to digest intact zzso and fragments resolved by zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All five had recognition sequences with at least six zzso base zzso The zzso DNA size of zzso zzso zzso zzso estimated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is 1,950 zzso
