Monitoring of microbial DNA in zzso by dot zzso zzso and zzso analysis is a useful technique for gaining insight into the survival and impact of genetically modified zzso released in the zzso Most methods of DNA isolation from zzso require a large number of zzso steps rendering them zzso for quantitative analysis of multiple zzso Here we describe a very rapid method for the isolation and zzso of multiple samples of soil DNA that can be used directly for dot zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA extracts are prepared by zzso treatment at pH zzso and zzso by ammonium zzso zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso In a practical application of this method, sandy soil samples were seeded with zzso zzso cells and exposed to high temperature zzso degrees zzso or zzso As a result, the number of zzso zzso zzso cells which could be recovered from the soil samples quickly zzso However, the concentration of a marker gene zzso resistance to cadmium, zzso and zinc zzso remained zzso
