zzso zzso zzso including the zzso receptors zzso mediate a broad range of fundamental cellular activities through binding to a wide range of zzso zzso the structural basis for the zzso selectivity of these proteins is of significance to their zzso drug zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso sites provides a useful way to study their zzso zzso Various zzso methods have been developed for the zzso comparison of soluble zzso In this work, we applied this approach to the analysis of the primary zzso sites of 92 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the studies confirmed that the binding site of bacterial zzso is indeed different from all zzso In the latter group, further comparison of the binding sites indicated a group of zzso that could be responsible for zzso selectivity and important for zzso drug zzso Furthermore, unexpected zzso zzso were observed among zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the percentage of the overall sequence identity between a target protein and a template protein alone is not sufficient for selecting the best template for zzso modeling of zzso membrane zzso These results provided novel insight into the structural basis of zzso selectivity of zzso membrane proteins and are of practical use to the zzso modeling of these zzso
