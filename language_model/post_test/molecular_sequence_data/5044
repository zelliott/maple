A new zzso named zzso has been identified in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso on the basis of its ability to block the rat zzso channels expressed in zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and characterized as a zzso zzso zzso by four zzso zzso zzso shares zzso and 59% sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso two recently isolated zzso zzso whereas it is only zzso identical with the other scorpion zzso channel zzso zzso by three zzso zzso The zzso and zzso forms of zzso were zzso zzso and identity between the natural and the synthetic zzso peptides was proved by mass zzso zzso on zzso zzso and blocking activity on the rat zzso zzso The zzso bridge pattern was studied by zzso limited zzso at zzso pH and zzso zzso zzso on an immobilized zzso zzso both followed by mass and sequence zzso Three of the zzso bonds are connected as in the zzso scorpion zzso and the two extra zzso zzso of zzso are zzso as in zzso These results, together with those of CD analysis, suggest that zzso probably adopts the same general folding as all scorpion zzso channel zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of the rat zzso channels zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso does not compete with zzso for binding to its zzso site on rat brain zzso zzso but competes efficiently with zzso for binding to the zzso zzso channels on the same preparation zzso zzso 1 zzso
