The zzso zzso gene zzso plays a role in embryonic stem cell differentiation and is highly expressed in the developing zzso and zzso To understand the mechanisms of regulation of zzso gene zzso the zzso region of the zzso gene was isolated from a mouse zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a single zzso start site 130 zzso upstream of the translation initiation zzso zzso zzso with a zzso reporter gene under the control of serially deleted zzso sequences revealed that the zzso zzso to zzso region contained a positive zzso element for efficient expression of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of this region and zzso competition in the zzso mobility shift zzso revealed the presence of a zzso box, which is a target for zzso nuclear factor Y zzso zzso is essential for positive gene zzso No zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso is expressed during the early stages of zzso development, specifically in the brain at zzso zzso as well as during the late stages of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is an essential regulatory factor for zzso zzso activity, which is important for the zzso stage of the developing zzso
