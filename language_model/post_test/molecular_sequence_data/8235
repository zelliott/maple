zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso total correlation zzso zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to assign essentially all the zzso in a zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso zzso formed with an analogue of the zzso drug zzso zzso The analogue has a zzso acid side chain zzso on the zzso position designed to interact with the zzso 57 and His 28 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso it binds a factor of zzso more tightly to the zzso than does the parent zzso zzso zzso and 11 zzso zzso were measured involving the bound zzso acid zzso These provided the distance constraints used in conjunction with an energy zzso and simulated zzso protocol zzso zzso from zzso zzso to dock the zzso analogue into zzso zzso In calculations where side chains and backbone fragments for zzso zzso were allowed flexibility, zzso of the 40 calculated structures had reasonable zzso geometry and none of them had zzso distance violations of greater than zzso zzso The zzso of the aromatic rings in the bound zzso were zzso in all the structures, with zzso angles zzso 1 zzso zzso degrees zzso 4 degrees zzso and zzso 2 zzso 53 degrees zzso 4 degrees zzso the aromatic rings of the zzso occupied essentially the same space in all the calculated structures zzso mean square zzso value zzso zzso zzso of the zzso interactions into the energy zzso indicated that structures in which the zzso group of the zzso interacts with the side chains of zzso 57 and His 28 are of low zzso zzso differences in zzso and backbone zzso were detected between zzso zzso in the zzso complexes with the zzso analogue and zzso
