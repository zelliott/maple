We describe a multiplex zzso zzso to identify and discriminate between zzso of zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was identified by sequence analysis of an expression zzso that restored zzso zzso levels in zzso coli strain zzso zzso With zzso zzso developed to the zzso zzso zzso zzso nearly full-length zzso zzso were amplified from an additional 11 zzso of zzso zzso 20 zzso of zzso coli, 16 zzso of zzso zzso and five zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sequence of each zzso was determined, and sequence alignment revealed a high level of species zzso zzso zzso were constructed to exploit species differences, and a multiplex zzso zzso was developed to positively identify zzso of zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We characterized an additional set of 41 zzso zzso by partial zzso sequence analysis to further demonstrate the uniqueness of each zzso zzso The multiplex zzso zzso was validated with 105 genetically defined zzso of zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 34 strains representing 12 additional zzso species, and 24 strains representing 19 zzso zzso Application of the multiplex zzso method to zzso zzso obtained from 108 clinical and environmental zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso correlation with zzso typing zzso
