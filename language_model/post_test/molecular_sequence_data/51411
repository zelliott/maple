For more effective screening of suspects, we combined two methods to zzso the zzso evidence from a crime scene: zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso for DNA typing of zzso zzso zzso and zzso direct sequencing for DNA typing of zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha was typed by an zzso zzso zzso alpha kit from zzso zzso beta was typed by direct sequence using the zzso chain termination zzso In 20 DNA samples, complete separation was demonstrated by these two zzso zzso This will be of considerable use in screening suspects in crime investigation zzso The sensitivity of zzso is useful for trace evidence, and the rapid results of zzso zzso and the precise results of direct sequencing have significant zzso
