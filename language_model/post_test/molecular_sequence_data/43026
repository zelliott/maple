Six touch zzso zzso with distinctive zzso features sense gentle touch in zzso zzso Previous studies have identified three genes zzso zzso and zzso that regulate touch cell zzso However, since other cell types also require these zzso we suspected that other genes help restrict the expression of touch cell characteristics to the six zzso seen in the wild zzso To identify such zzso we have examined zzso defective in genes required for the development of other zzso zzso cells for changes in the pattern of touch zzso zzso zzso in seven genes either reduce zzso or increase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the number of touch zzso zzso The zzso action of these zzso all of which are required for the production of many cell types, restrict the number of cells expressing touch zzso characteristics in zzso animals by acting as positive and negative regulators and by removing cells by programmed cell zzso
