Representative samples of Ugandan zzso zzso from Lake Albert and Lake Victoria were examined using DNA zzso sequence analysis of two partially overlapping regions - zzso zzso zzso & MORGAN zzso zzso - of the zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso The Victorian sample exhibited greater zzso diversity, zzso zzso zzso and a significant population partition appeared as zzso did not zzso between zzso With one exception, Lake Albert populations were more mixed by sampled location, while those from Lake Victoria appeared more zzso Using statistical zzso zzso zzso 1 was zzso ancestral to all others and analysis of MORGAN zzso confirmed population zzso All samples fell into two of five zzso zzso zzso zzso broadly zzso by zzso It seems that zzso zzso 1 (and close zzso was likely widely dispersed throughout the zzso environment but later diversified in zzso and in zzso within Lake Albert and Lake zzso The genetic uniformity of Ugandan zzso zzso can no longer be zzso which might better explain known zzso zzso While it appears plausible that locally evolved zzso traits could spread through most of the Lake Albert zzso it seems unlikely they could quickly zzso into Lake Victoria or amongst populations zzso
