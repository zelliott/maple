zzso the identity and zzso activities of zzso associated with the decomposition of organic materials is expected to contribute to the evaluation and improvement of composting zzso In this study, we examined the zzso and zzso abilities of bacteria isolated from sawdust zzso zzso and coffee zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria were isolated using zzso mineral salt zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identification was performed based on the sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities were characterized using zzso zzso zzso Eleven zzso were obtained from zzso and 10 zzso from zzso DNA analysis indicated that the zzso from zzso and zzso belonged to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the most dominant zzso in both zzso zzso All zzso with the exception of two zzso lacking zzso activity, showed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on zzso activities expressed as the ratio of zzso zone diameter to colony diameter, it was suggested that the species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso contribute to efficient zzso and zzso processes during zzso
