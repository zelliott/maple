zzso syndrome zzso is an zzso disease that results in pathological dryness of mouth and zzso The diagnosis of SS depends on both clinical evaluation and specific zzso The goal of this study was to use quantitative zzso to investigate changes in tear proteins in a rabbit model of zzso dry eye, induced zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed by zzso and zzso zzso on tears collected from the zzso surface, and specific proteins were verified by high resolution zzso It was found that in the tears of zzso rabbits at 2 and 4 weeks after zzso zzso zzso zzso A9, and serum zzso were zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gamma chain C region were zzso High resolution zzso with zzso labeling verified the changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results indicated significant changes of tear proteins in zzso zzso suggesting these proteins could potentially be used as zzso for the diagnosis and prognosis of dry zzso Several of these proteins were also found in the tears of zzso dry eye patients indicating a common basis of zzso surface pathology, however, zzso appears to be unique to zzso
