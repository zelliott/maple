zzso zzso are thought to play important roles in fruit development, especially cell zzso However, the mechanisms and regulation of zzso activity have not been well zzso This study zzso zzso zzso and expression of genes involved in zzso metabolism in developing tomato zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the transcript levels of the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were high at zzso and decreased immediately zzso In contrast, zzso concentration and the transcript levels of the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased after zzso The expression of zzso response regulator genes was high in tomato zzso from zzso to early zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso signal zzso zzso is active in the cell division phase of fruit zzso This study also investigated the effect of zzso application on fruit set and zzso Application of a synthetic zzso zzso zzso to zzso tomato zzso induced zzso fruit zzso The zzso zzso fruits were smaller than zzso zzso because of reduction of zzso cell size rather than reduced cell zzso Thus, zzso zzso was attributable to the promotion of cell division, not cell zzso Overall, the results provide evidence that zzso are involved in cell division during development of tomato zzso
