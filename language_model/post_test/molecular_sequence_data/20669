zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso result in the dominant zzso tissue disease zzso zzso zzso syndrome has a variable zzso even within families carrying the same zzso zzso zzso in gene expression resulting from sequence differences in the promoter region of the zzso gene are likely to be involved in causing this zzso zzso In this report, we present an analysis of zzso zzso start site zzso use in mouse and human zzso We found that zzso of zzso initiated primarily from a single zzso promoter which was highly zzso in zzso It contained potential binding sites for a number of factors implicated in zzso differentiation and gene zzso The human zzso line zzso had high levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein to form zzso zzso zzso The human embryonic kidney line zzso and two breast cancer lines zzso and zzso had levels of zzso zzso 1000 fold lower and produced negligible amounts of zzso zzso Therefore zzso appears to be the optimal cell line for examining zzso biologically relevant promoter activity for zzso In reporter zzso the zzso promoter region was more active in zzso cells than in zzso lines but additional elements outside the zzso promoter are probably required for optimal zzso zzso zzso the regulation of the zzso gene may lead to alternative therapeutic strategies for zzso zzso
