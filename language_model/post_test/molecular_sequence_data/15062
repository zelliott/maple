The iron regulatory hormone zzso is zzso zzso in response to iron zzso but the mechanisms by which iron levels are sensed are not well zzso zzso genetic screens in the zzso have resulted in the identification of zzso anemia zzso with a range of zzso affecting zzso pathways in iron metabolism and zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso plays a critical role both in iron transport and in regulating zzso expression in zzso zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of the zzso zzso anemia zzso zzso which exhibits zzso zzso due to zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso reproduced the anemia zzso and decreased zzso and terminal gut iron zzso while zzso of zzso zzso partially restored these zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso exhibited low levels of zzso zzso however zzso in the absence of a zzso in the zzso pathway, failed to impair zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso iron and that zzso expression is regulated by a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
