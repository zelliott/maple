zzso zzso coding for two different zzso zzso receptors were isolated from a human lung zzso zzso DNA sequencing revealed that they corresponded to either the zzso zzso zzso originally identified in cows zzso or the zzso zzso first found in rats zzso An open reading frame coding for a zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso also found in other G zzso zzso was zzso Whereas the zzso acid identity is about zzso between the characterized members of a given zzso zzso with the best zzso parts being the zzso zzso zzso less than zzso identity was found between the human A and B zzso Southern zzso analysis of human zzso DNA revealed the existence of multiple zzso bands when using zzso derived from the full-length ETA or zzso zzso However, when shorter fragments were selected as zzso only one band remained zzso which suggests the existence of a zzso gene for each zzso of zzso zzso
