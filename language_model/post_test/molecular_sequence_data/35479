zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which, under zzso stress, interacts with zzso zzso to activate genes required for maintaining zzso zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso among low zzso zzso bacteria, and often exist in multiple zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso zzso which harbors two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to examine the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and to identify the genes regulated by each zzso zzso zzso devoid of zzso were sensitive to zzso and hydrogen zzso while the zzso zzso double zzso was hypersensitive to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains expressing zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso products were used in zzso and quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso analyses in order to uncover genes under zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso identified many genes that were zzso when either zzso or zzso was produced, but several genes were uncovered whose transcript levels increased in only one of the two zzso zzso suggesting that each zzso zzso zzso a unique zzso Among genes that were zzso were those zzso zzso of proteins that are specifically involved in maintaining zzso zzso zzso or alleviating zzso zzso Some of these genes have important roles in zzso zzso zzso and a large number of zzso hypothetical genes have no zzso outside of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses also unveiled a regulatory link that exists between the two zzso zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso and zzso are zzso regulators involved in zzso zzso stress but also control a set of genes whose products function in other cellular zzso
