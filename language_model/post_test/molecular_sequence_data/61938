To date, little attention has been paid to the possible role of zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso and zzso in innate host zzso against zzso zzso In the current study, using a zzso high pressure liquid zzso zzso method for zzso zzso followed by mass zzso and zzso acid sequencing for identification and zzso we report the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso of the human tongue compared with zzso zzso zzso Using a specific zzso we show that the zzso are abundant in zzso zzso human oral zzso cell zzso zzso In the context of their previously reported zzso activity, our results may imply a role for zzso in host zzso against oral zzso cell zzso
