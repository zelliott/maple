Although expression of zzso zzso zzso can be altered in human zzso their functional relevance is zzso zzso regions are zzso zzso segments that are zzso zzso across humans, mice, and zzso Conservation of gene sequences across species may indicate an essential functional role, and therefore we evaluated the expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso The global expression of zzso was analyzed with a custom zzso zzso was verified in cell lines by real-time zzso or in zzso by in zzso zzso using tissue zzso Cellular zzso expression was modulated with zzso and the effects on global gene expression and growth of human and zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed in zzso cells compared with zzso zzso Among these zzso the greatest change was noted for zzso element 338 zzso which was dramatically increased in human zzso compared with zzso adjacent zzso Although zzso is partially located within the zzso binding protein 2 zzso zzso the transcribed zzso zzso zzso is expressed independently of zzso and was cloned as a zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso gene zzso analysis indicated zzso effects on genes involved in cell zzso These effects were zzso demonstrated in both human and zzso zzso zzso to zzso decreased both zzso and zzso growth of zzso zzso These studies identify a critical role for zzso in regulation of transformed cell growth and of transcribed zzso zzso as a unique class of genes involved in the zzso of zzso
