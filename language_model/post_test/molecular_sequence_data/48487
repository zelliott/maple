The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coordinates the zzso iron with two zzso and exists either with a b zzso or with a zzso attached zzso The binding of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso involving the reorganization of internal void zzso The formation of zzso within the resulting zzso is thought to facilitate zzso exchange and play a functional zzso Here we monitored the zzso induced by pressure on the zzso zzso and zzso states of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso We inspected the outcome with a statistical analysis of 170 zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso landscape of zzso as represented by the variation of an average chemical shift zzso was highly sensitive to zzso swapping and zzso zzso zzso zzso of rare zzso was observed at high pressures and consistent with cavity zzso upon zzso zzso In all states, the zzso loop was found to be exceptionally zzso to pressure, suggesting a functional role as a zzso hinge between the adjacent zzso Finally, zzso clusters presented a common pattern of zzso pressure zzso The zzso dissection combined with protein sequence analysis established locations with zzso signatures relevant to residual communication of zzso zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
