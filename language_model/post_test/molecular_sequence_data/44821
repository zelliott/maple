Little is known about how cell shape is zzso We are using the zzso of zzso zzso zzso on the plant zzso zzso as a model to study how cell shape is zzso zzso zzso zzso are large, single zzso cells with a stalk and three or four zzso whereas in zzso zzso zzso the zzso have a shortened stalk and only two zzso To further understand the role of the zzso gene in zzso zzso we have cloned the zzso zzso zzso gene by zzso zzso and report here that it encodes a member of the zzso zzso of zzso motor zzso zzso proteins transport diverse cellular materials in a directional manner along zzso zzso proteins are characterized by a highly zzso zzso region that comprises the motor domain, and a zzso zzso region that is thought to participate in recognition and binding of the appropriate zzso
