zzso zzso F elements are members of the zzso of zzso mobile repeated DNA sequences that lack zzso and zzso by the reverse zzso of zzso zzso zzso The F zzso end region zzso two promoters zzso and zzso that transcribe in a zzso zzso Each promoter has been functionally dissected by zzso in zzso zzso cultured cells templates carrying base zzso and/or deletions across the zzso to zzso region of the element zzso zzso that likely controls the synthesis of gene products and zzso zzso is internal to the transcribed zzso Two elements play a major role in zzso zzso The zzso element spans the zzso zzso to zzso and includes a major zzso start zzso zzso DNA featuring a nearly identical zzso sequence can functionally replace the zzso module only when properly spaced from downstream F zzso The zzso element is within the zzso zzso to zzso and may zzso to a motif zzso zzso to zzso zzso in other zzso zzso zzso is a zzso promoter that directs zzso predominantly from three nearby sites (a to zzso zzso expression is influenced by multiple elements located upstream of zzso zzso relative to site a as zzso within a region zzso shown to stimulate the zzso zzso zzso promoter in an orientation and zzso zzso Changes within the zzso to zzso zzso may suppress or stimulate zzso from sites a and zzso zzso from a site approximately 30 zzso upstream of site a is enhanced by zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso The expression of the two F zzso determined by the interaction of the zzso machinery with distinct DNA zzso is influenced by a common element within the alpha zzso
