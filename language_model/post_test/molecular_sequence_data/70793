The zzso capacity of the zzso zzso system is such that thousands of volatile chemicals are perceived as having distinct zzso Here we used a combination of calcium imaging and zzso zzso to identify zzso receptors zzso for zzso with related structures but varied zzso We found that one OR recognizes multiple zzso and that one zzso is recognized by multiple zzso but that different zzso are recognized by different combinations of zzso Thus, the zzso system uses a zzso zzso coding scheme to zzso odor zzso Our studies also indicate that slight zzso in an zzso or a change in its zzso can change its zzso potentially explaining how such changes can alter perceived odor zzso
