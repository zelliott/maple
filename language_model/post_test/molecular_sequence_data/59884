Following zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso in one zzso group were identified as being unable to fix nitrogen in pea zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso had lowered levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but increased levels of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were greatly reduced in their ability to zzso the artificial electron donor zzso but zzso prepared from them had increased levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso was insensitive to the respiratory inhibitor zzso A, that targets the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso revealed that they were affected in the zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso contained zzso in a gene zzso to that zzso zzso zzso and in the other the zzso was in DNA zzso to that zzso the zzso b component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso proteins of zzso and zzso were absent from zzso from the zzso whereas an additional soluble zzso zzso protein of zzso was zzso We conclude that the larger of these two zzso proteins zzso to zzso zzso and, in its absence, the protein of zzso does not remain associated with the zzso zzso of this zzso component was specifically blocked in a third zzso zzso which contained zzso in a region of DNA showing zzso to a zzso zzso gene previously shown to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso complex is essential for symbiotic nitrogen zzso the other zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
