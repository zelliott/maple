Recent findings suggest a pivotal role for zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso in animal zzso In this study, zzso gene zzso zzso of a zzso zzso caused zzso zzso on leaves, abnormal leaf zzso and retarded plant growth in zzso zzso zzso was associated with the zzso and this association required the zzso membrane zzso zzso of zzso reduced the cellular zzso activity to approximately zzso of control levels without changing the zzso activity and did not alter zzso zzso content zzso The affected cells showed programmed cell death zzso zzso zzso including nuclear zzso and DNA zzso Similar to animal cell zzso zzso c was released into the zzso and zzso and zzso zzso activities were strongly zzso Furthermore, based on flow zzso zzso zzso plants zzso zzso zzso and zzso both of which are predominantly associated with zzso exhibited enhanced resistance to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, the addition of zzso zzso to zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso c release and loss of zzso membrane zzso Together, these results show that zzso critically regulates the execution of zzso in plant cells, suggesting a link between zzso metabolism and zzso
