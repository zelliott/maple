The sequences of the internal transcribed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains from 7 of 15 AIDS patients were found to vary during discrete episodes of zzso zzso zzso Changes in the ITS sequence correlated with changes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The coincidence of changes in the sequences of the zzso which is located in the nucleus, with changes in a zzso gene excludes zzso as the cause of the genetic differences between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains isolated during different episodes of zzso zzso pneumonia and supports the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso pneumonia is caused by zzso rather than by zzso of zzso zzso Thus, limiting the exposure of zzso patients to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso should help prevent zzso zzso zzso
