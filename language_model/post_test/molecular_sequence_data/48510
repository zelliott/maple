Alternative zzso zzso is a terminal zzso zzso present in the respiratory chain of all zzso investigated to date, but zzso distribution in other members of the zzso is less zzso We assessed the zzso distribution of zzso using zzso Multiple sequence alignments compared zzso proteins and examined zzso acid zzso involved in zzso zzso function and zzso zzso Novel zzso sequences were found in both zzso and zzso and we conclude that zzso is widespread in the zzso zzso zzso families are common in zzso plants and the appearance of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the divergence of the zzso and zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso function are highly zzso between zzso and zzso while zzso zzso regulation likely differs in these two zzso We demonstrate zzso that an zzso gene is present in the moss zzso zzso and that the gene is zzso Our findings suggest that zzso will likely exert an influence on plant zzso and carbon metabolism in zzso such as green algae, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and that further research in these systems is zzso
