The opening of the three tandem zzso zzso in the replication origin zzso of zzso coli by zzso zzso assisted by protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents an essential early stage in the initiation of zzso replication zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) Cell 54, zzso We now show by zzso zzso of the zzso region that zzso function, both in zzso and in zzso requires zzso in the left zzso and sequence specificity in the middle and right zzso zzso of zzso protein with the middle and right zzso are crucial for the opening of the zzso zzso of the protein to the top strand of the zzso appeared to maintain zzso in the bottom zzso zzso zzso the inhibitor of zzso binds the three zzso and blocks the opening of the zzso The degrees of zzso by zzso protein of zzso opening and of zzso zzso replication observed with zzso forms of the zzso could be correlated with the binding affinity of zzso zzso Whereas the binding of zzso protein to the zzso did not affect the binding of zzso protein to its four zzso boxes, interaction of zzso protein with the zzso was zzso The selective interactions of zzso and zzso proteins with the zzso region appear to be components of the zzso switch that controls initiation of zzso coli zzso zzso
