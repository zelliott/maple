In order to produce biologically active zzso in large amounts by zzso degradation of isolated bacterial zzso zzso highly specific zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli are made zzso The genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso the soluble zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso A zzso were independently fused to the zzso zzso sequence of zzso protein A zzso under control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso fusion proteins were zzso zzso at high levels in zzso coli upon temperature induction at 42 degrees C and account for zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of total zzso The zzso fusion zzso immobilized on zzso zzso are zzso sensitive, in zzso resulting in complete degradation of the zzso portion of the fusion proteins and release of the zzso zzso in intact and zzso active form into the zzso zzso degradation could be prevented by zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The immobilized fusion proteins were zzso active and could be used for the batch production of biologically active zzso which were successively separated on zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso to zzso zzso when zzso G zzso was used in combination with zzso A combination of zzso with zzso left the zzso and zzso being zzso via an zzso bond zzso zzso
