zzso zzso zzso causes the zzso stripe disease in zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso with zzso zzso zzso does not produce disease zzso A comparison of the zzso sequences of these closely related species may permit a better understanding of contrasting zzso such as zzso association and zzso life zzso To achieve this goal, we constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries to identify DNA fragments present in one species and absent in the zzso In a parallel approach, partial zzso sequence from zzso zzso was directly compared in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso differences between the two organisms revealed by zzso suggested that zzso and zzso are potential molecular factors involved in the different zzso zzso The cluster zzso probably involved in cellulose zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso of this gene cluster was increased in zzso zzso cells attached to the surface of zzso zzso and knockout of zzso gene led to decrease in zzso root surface attachment and zzso zzso The production of cellulose could be responsible for the zzso attachment pattern of zzso zzso that is capable of zzso zzso zzso
