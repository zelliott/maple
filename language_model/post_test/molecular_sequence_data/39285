A novel marine bacterial strain, zzso isolated from a microbial mat located at a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the Pacific Ocean, has been zzso This zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso range, zzso degrees zzso No growth was observed with zzso zzso zzso or zzso as the electron zzso and zzso as the electron zzso The major fatty acid detected in strain zzso was zzso : zzso zzso zzso had zzso consisting mainly of zzso and zzso and possessed zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of the strain was zzso zzso and the zzso size was about zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences placed zzso within the zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarity levels of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with respect to the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA from strain zzso showed low mean levels of zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso was classified in the zzso zzso within a distinct novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
