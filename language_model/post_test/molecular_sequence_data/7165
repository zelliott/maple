The nuclear factor I zzso family consists of zzso zzso proteins that activate both zzso and zzso DNA zzso We have characterized three new members of the zzso family that belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and differ in their zzso We show that these zzso can activate zzso in zzso and zzso Schneider line 2 cells, using an zzso domain that is subdivided into adjacent variable and zzso zzso each having independent zzso properties in zzso zzso Together, these two zzso constitute the full zzso zzso zzso In addition, we find that the zzso zzso zzso proteins are capable of zzso zzso DNA replication through their zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, their in zzso zzso activities are specifically inhibited by a novel zzso domain contained within the zzso part, while the zzso and replication functions per zzso are not zzso However, zzso of zzso activity in zzso is relieved within the cell, as zzso zzso occurs irrespective of the presence of the zzso zzso Moreover, the region zzso the zzso domain zzso in zzso zzso that may allow the relief of zzso zzso in zzso and trigger zzso zzso are zzso
