A clone isolated from a purple zzso pea zzso zzso zzso zzso library was shown to contain the complete coding sequence of a zzso with considerable zzso to various members of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso are a group of zzso zzso proteins of 21-25 zzso found in zzso zzso zzso sequences in the isolated clone include the zzso site, zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso involved in membrane zzso Comparisons of the predicted zzso acid sequence with those of other zzso proteins show significantly higher zzso zzso zzso to two zzso gene products, those of the zzso zzso and the canine zzso zzso than to any of the plant zzso gene products so far identified zzso zzso zzso The high percentage of zzso acid identity suggests that this zzso may be the product of a zzso designated zzso which is the plant counterpart of zzso zzso proteins are a zzso of the zzso zzso thought to be involved in zzso transport from the zzso zzso to the zzso apparatus and in zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis of total zzso from green and purple zzso pea revealed a zzso species of approximately the same size as the isolated zzso
