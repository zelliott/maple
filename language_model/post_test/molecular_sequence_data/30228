To obtain zzso of the zzso coli zzso gene zzso protein zzso zzso with its zzso site, we have searched for zzso conditions with 26 different DNA segments greater than or equal to 28 zzso in length that explore a variety of zzso zzso zzso and extended zzso or 3' zzso In addition to utilizing uninterrupted zzso zzso site zzso we devised a novel approach of zzso zzso that allowed us to efficiently generate zzso DNA segments with a wide variety of extended zzso and lengths in the large size range zzso than or equal to 28 zzso required by this zzso We report three crystal forms that are suitable for X-ray analysis, one of which zzso form zzso gives measurable zzso zzso to 3 A zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso produce modest improvements in the quality of zzso from crystal form zzso zzso stabilization of crystal form III is unexpectedly complex, requiring a greater than tenfold reduction in the salt concentration followed by addition of zzso and then an increase in the concentration of zzso zzso
