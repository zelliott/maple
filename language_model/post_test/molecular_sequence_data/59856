Milk zzso zzso from humans, cows and rats contained a protein identified as zzso zzso protein zzso associated with the zzso surface membrane zzso This zzso previously believed to be specific to zzso was a major constituent of the zzso surface and was present in a zzso complex that contained zzso amounts of zzso and zzso zzso Identification of zzso was by sequence similarity of zzso peptides from cow and human proteins with the sequence zzso from the zzso for mouse zzso The putative zzso of zzso zzso from zzso human and rat milk was recognized specifically by zzso raised against a zzso zzso to duplicate the zzso 26 zzso of the mouse zzso In zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found only in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso apparently zzso and one modification apparently was zzso primarily with zzso zzso and zzso fatty zzso Two zzso zzso of zzso were present in cow zzso membrane zzso In zzso zzso served as a zzso for protein zzso associated with milk zzso zzso zzso but this protein did not seem to become zzso zzso
