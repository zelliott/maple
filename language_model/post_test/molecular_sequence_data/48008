zzso has been implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle zzso Basic zzso one of the zzso zzso is expressed exclusively in smooth muscle cell zzso zzso and is considered to be a zzso marker of differentiated zzso To define the molecular mechanism of zzso gene zzso in humans, we isolated and characterized the zzso region of this zzso zzso analysis revealed that several putative zzso elements were clustered within a zzso sequence upstream of the zzso start zzso However, the zzso promoter region obtained zzso lacked a completely matched consensus sequence of the zzso box that is commonly identified in the promoter region of other zzso zzso A zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso promoter region was sufficient to drive a zzso zzso activity not only in human vascular smooth muscle cells zzso but also in zzso zzso In particular, the sequence between positions zzso and zzso had a significantly higher zzso activity in zzso than in zzso zzso In contrast, the promoter activity was drastically decreased between positions zzso and zzso in both types of zzso These results indicate that the sequence spanning from position zzso to zzso contains an essential domain involved in the zzso zzso activity of the human basic zzso zzso and that the zzso region of the zzso zzso sequence presented zzso may play a pivotal role in the zzso zzso of zzso
