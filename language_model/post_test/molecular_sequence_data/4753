The guinea pig zzso protein zzso zzso termed zzso plays an important role in zzso fusion, and was the first recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which zzso at least two distinct zzso processing zzso zzso alpha is processed first, in the zzso whereas zzso beta is processed separately during zzso maturation in the zzso The final processing of zzso beta occurs immediately adjacent to its predicted zzso zzso domain, and exposes an zzso recognized by a fusion blocking zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that one or more zzso zzso activities associated with zzso zzso can process zzso beta in zzso in a fashion that closely mimics the processing pattern observed in zzso during zzso zzso zzso In contrast, several zzso that were added to zzso zzso did not mimic the pattern observed in zzso These findings raise the intriguing possibility that a zzso beta converting zzso active in zzso may originate from zzso instead of from the zzso zzso Further, we show that zzso alpha is most likely processed zzso in the zzso zzso based on three zzso zzso only processed zzso zzso but not the precursor zzso can be zzso zzso zzso some processed zzso alpha is sensitive to zzso zzso suggesting zzso occurs prior to the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso of processed zzso alpha showed that the zzso zzso site is next to four zzso zzso a consensus sequence for zzso zzso type zzso zzso The zzso sequence analysis further showed that processed zzso alpha contains an intact membrane anchored zzso domain, and not a truncated zzso domain as reported previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and White, zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso processing is thought to play an important role in regulating the function of zzso and the present study represents a first step toward a better understanding of zzso activities involved in the maturation of zzso and potentially other zzso surface zzso
