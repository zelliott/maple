The present paper introduces the use of a weak zzso zzso column in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso functionality is well-known to selectively complex ammonium and zzso zzso which should make this column highly suitable to trap peptides with free zzso or free zzso groups from zzso side zzso This unique selection mechanism was put to the test in an zzso setup which aims for the enrichment of deliberately zzso protein zzso peptides from a serum zzso It was demonstrated that peptides with free zzso groups and peptides with zzso groups can be separated from each other using this weak zzso zzso zzso The peptides of interest, bearing no free primary zzso were found to be significantly enriched in the zzso flow zzso At the same time a favorable zzso of zzso peptides was zzso To obtain more insight in the contributions of the two distinct column zzso zzso the weak zzso zzso and the crown zzso the experimental data were checked against a theoretical prediction of the zzso
