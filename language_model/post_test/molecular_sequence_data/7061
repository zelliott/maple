The zzso zzso distribution, toxicity and behavioral effects of zzso zzso zzso were investigated to define how these compounds interact with neural tissue to inhibit translation of a target zzso Both zzso modified and unmodified zzso are rapidly taken up by zzso neural zzso zzso of the unmodified zzso was found to be fast zzso zzso 1 zzso relative to the zzso modified zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso synthesis in zzso at zzso below the toxic threshold of approximately 5 zzso zzso injections of zzso zzso zzso into the region of the zzso in zzso resulted in a small decrease in zzso zzso and a zzso drinking response within the first 24 zzso consistent with a deficit in zzso translation with zzso similar to those observed in zzso Water intake returned to normal by the second day indicating relatively rapid clearance of the zzso and minimal side zzso Although the mechanisms of zzso and details of the molecular interactions are still unknown, our observation of preferential zzso and/or retention of zzso within a subset of zzso in zzso suggests some process of selective zzso Thus, low zzso of zzso targeted to the untranslated zzso end of zzso zzso can be effective for the acute and zzso control of zzso synthesis in zzso zzso with relatively rapid onset of behavioral effects and minimal side zzso
