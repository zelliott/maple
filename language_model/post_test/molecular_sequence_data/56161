The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso reductive zzso was cloned from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso The gene was identified by zzso with a zzso zzso designed from the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso was found, which predicts a zzso product of 248 zzso acids having a molecular weight of zzso which agrees favorably with the sodium zzso zzso gel zzso molecular weight of 30,000 reported for the zzso zzso The predicted zzso product of zzso matched the zzso sequence of the zzso protein zzso From the zzso zzso the protein appears to have a processed zzso An zzso coli zzso zzso clone was shown to produce zzso and zzso from zzso zzso data base searches grouped the predicted zzso sequence of zzso with two previously reported plant zzso zzso but less significantly with any of the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso
