zzso syndrome zzso is a zzso disorder affecting several systems caused by a zzso deletion in the zzso region zzso A common zzso that includes up to 17 genes reported so far is deleted in the great majority of zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the cardiovascular features, but the specific contribution of other deleted genes to the zzso zzso remains zzso We have fully zzso a gene commonly deleted in zzso zzso previously reported in a truncated form as zzso The zzso zzso encodes an zzso acid protein with a basic zzso motif zzso and a zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso suggesting a function as a zzso zzso zzso is expressed as a zzso transcript predominantly in adult liver and at late stages of zzso zzso The zzso locus encompasses 33 zzso of zzso DNA with 17 zzso Two zzso zzso zzso repeats have been identified and used to verify zzso in zzso zzso We have also cloned the mouse zzso and mapped its locus to mouse zzso 5, in a region of zzso zzso with human zzso Given that other zzso proteins are dosage sensitive and based on the putative function of zzso as a zzso factor, zzso at this locus could be involved in some features of zzso
