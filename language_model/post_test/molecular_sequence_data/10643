The zzso positions of four zzso strains obtained from zzso of common bean plants zzso zzso zzso grown in an Austrian soil and of the Mexican bean isolate zzso are zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso genes revealed sequences almost identical to that of the zzso zzso type strain, zzso with a maximum of two zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene sequences with those from other bacteria indicated highest similarity to zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso determined by zzso zzso was high among the Austrian zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and ranged from 21 to zzso with zzso but zzso analysis revealed very low zzso to the recognized common zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene organization was studied by Southern zzso with the zzso zzso gene and temperature zzso gel zzso indicating identical organizations and the presence of three identical zzso zzso copies in the zzso of this zzso The six strains investigated showed different zzso profiles based on their geographical zzso We propose that the Austrian zzso and the Mexican strain zzso are members of the species zzso zzso
