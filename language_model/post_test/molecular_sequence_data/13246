The zzso zzso gene locus encodes zzso of the light chains of zzso zzso molecules and is thought to contain up to 300 variable zzso zzso genes generally considered to comprise 20 zzso To delineate the locus we have isolated 29 zzso artificial zzso zzso clones that form two zzso span zzso zzso zzso and contain two known zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso specific for 19 V zzso gene families and Southern analysis, we have refined the genetically defined order of these V zzso gene zzso Of these, V zzso 2 maps at least zzso zzso from the joining zzso zzso region and appears to be the most zzso V zzso gene zzso
