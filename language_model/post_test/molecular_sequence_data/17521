Gene 22 of zzso T4 encodes a major zzso scaffolding core protein of zzso zzso acid zzso From its zzso sequence the gene product zzso 22 has a predicted Mr of zzso and a zzso of zzso The protein is rich in charged zzso zzso acid and zzso and contains low amounts of zzso and zzso and no zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso limited zzso processing which eliminates the short zzso piece from the zzso during the early steps of zzso zzso Most zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso chain zzso have an zzso zzso and form seven peculiar zzso A model suggesting the spatial organization of zzso is zzso Three long zzso numbered 1 zzso and zzso 3, and 5 zzso and zzso are packed in an zzso fashion along the major axis of the zzso zzso Two rather short zzso (2 and 4) are located at the zzso and zzso ends of the protein zzso zzso zzso number 2, which is a zzso zzso of zzso found in mature T4 heads, is packed with zzso zzso and 3, similar to a novel element of zzso structure, the alpha zzso zzso number 4 probably interacts with the zzso zzso of the zzso The implications of the structure of the zzso zzso for the assembly of the zzso core are zzso
