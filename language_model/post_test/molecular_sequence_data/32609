The zzso library approach has been used successfully to isolate novel zzso genes from zzso zzso We report the cloning of a novel zzso gene by zzso screening of a zzso zzso library constructed with DNA from alkaline zzso zzso The gene was named zzso A and had an open reading frame of zzso base zzso It zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of 38 zzso The predicted protein had zzso similarity to a zzso from zzso zzso zzso The putative zzso gene was zzso into zzso zzso and zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso to zzso zzso characterization with liquid zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso A protein zzso the zzso of zzso to form zzso
