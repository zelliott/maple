zzso and immunity may be associated with zzso cell zzso injury and zzso zzso We explored the mechanisms through which a zzso immune response directed against the zzso might promote zzso Using the interaction of zzso zzso and complement zzso with cultured zzso as a model, we studied the expression and function of tissue factor, a zzso for factor zzso conversion of factor X to zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso zzso and C in zzso amounts zzso the synthesis of tissue factor over a period of zzso zzso Cell surface expression of tissue factor activity required zzso of C and assembly of the membrane attack complex, because expression was inhibited by soluble zzso and was not detected in the absence of zzso zzso of tissue factor zzso zzso was observed over a period of zzso h and required protein zzso zzso of tissue factor was not a direct consequence of the action of C on the zzso but was a secondary response that required as an intermediate step the release of zzso 1 zzso an early product of the zzso response to C zzso These findings suggest that, after the assembly of membrane attack complex on zzso the production of tissue factor and initiation of zzso in a blood vessel depend on the production of zzso 1 alpha and on its availability to stimulate affected zzso
