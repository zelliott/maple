Numerous proteins that are involved in cell signaling and viral replication require zzso modification by zzso to function zzso The molecular details by which this zzso modification affects protein function remain poorly zzso To facilitate in zzso zzso and structural studies of the role of zzso on protein function, a method was developed for zzso peptides with saturated zzso groups at zzso zzso and demonstrated using peptides derived from the zzso region of zzso virus zzso zzso The synthetic approach takes advantage of zzso chemistry to specifically modify only the zzso zzso within peptides and zzso links zzso groups via zzso bridges using a new zzso zzso zzso The chemistry presented here takes place in solution under mild conditions without the need for protection of the zzso functional zzso A method for zzso these modified peptides is also zzso This protocol can be of general use to investigators studying the role of zzso in biological zzso
