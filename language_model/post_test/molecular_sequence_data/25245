zzso increased the zzso activity of several zzso plasma protein genes in zzso zzso cells, suggesting the presence of functional zzso receptors zzso The level of zzso was, however, insufficient for stimulation of zzso zzso gene zzso containing zzso elements zzso By zzso of zzso cells with a zzso expression zzso a cell system was generated that allowed analysis of the interaction between zzso and zzso elements of the rat alpha zzso zzso gene and identification of the principal regulatory elements of the rat zzso zzso Although the expression of zzso zzso zzso was reduced by zzso treatment, the concentration of zzso was sufficient for full, short-term stimulation of zzso zzso By comparing the pattern of regulation of the cloned zzso in zzso and mouse zzso an zzso zzso independent zzso response was monitored for the alpha zzso zzso element but a response limited to zzso cells was found for the zzso zzso The data indicate that, although substantial differences exist in the organization and composition of the regulatory elements of the two zzso the overall function is, zzso remarkably zzso
