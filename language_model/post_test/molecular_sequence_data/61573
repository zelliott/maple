The recently identified human and zzso plasma membrane proteins zzso zzso and zzso belong to a gene family zzso that also includes the bacterial zzso transport protein zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso has established that zzso zzso functionally to the three major zzso zzso transport processes found in human and other zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and mediate zzso - linked zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, one describes a complementary zzso zzso transport study of zzso coli zzso using the zzso zzso zzso in which the coding region of zzso was flanked by zzso and zzso sequences from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resembled human zzso and rat zzso zzso in zzso zzso including an ability to transport zzso and the zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but also zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso affinities were higher than for zzso with apparent zzso values of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso and 112 and 130 zzso respectively, for zzso and zzso Unlike the relatively low zzso capacity of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso exhibited broadly similar apparent zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not require zzso for activity and was zzso - zzso The zzso of zzso transport measured as a function of external pH were consistent with an ordered transport model in which zzso binds to the zzso first followed by the zzso These experiments establish the zzso system as a useful tool for characterization of zzso transport of zzso zzso and clinically relevant zzso therapeutic zzso
