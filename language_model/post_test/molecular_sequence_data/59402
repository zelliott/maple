The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 6-2 is a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The gene zzso this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene corresponded to an open reading frame of zzso zzso that translates into a putative 433 zzso acid protein with a molecular weight of zzso The deduced zzso terminal sequence of zzso coincided with that previously found for the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shared significant similarity with those of human and zzso coli zzso zzso The cloned zzso gene was zzso in zzso coli cells to produce an active zzso in large quantities that accounted for approximately zzso of the total zzso
