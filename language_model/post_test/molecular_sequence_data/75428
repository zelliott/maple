We have used the zzso zzso to map the binding sites of the zzso and the zzso proteins of signal recognition particle zzso on zzso zzso We found that the regions of protection to zzso afforded by the two proteins were zzso zzso protected primarily the two tips in the zzso secondary zzso zzso protected a large region extending across the center of the particle and altered the zzso pattern in the regions that zzso would zzso suggesting that these two proteins may be in close proximity in the zzso The protection afforded by the two proteins in combination was equal to the sum of the individual zzso We have not observed zzso in the binding of these two proteins as assessed by the protection zzso nor do we have any evidence that the structure becomes more compact as it zzso The map derived from this zzso analysis places the signal recognition domain zzso bound to the zzso via the zzso zzso and the zzso arrest domain zzso with the zzso end of the zzso on opposite ends of the zzso Thus, it is possible that zzso recognizes signals by the direct interaction of zzso with the signal sequence at the nascent chain exit site and simultaneously blocks zzso by the entrance of zzso into the zzso zzso site 16 zzso zzso
