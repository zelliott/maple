zzso zzso and zzso in zzso specifically interact with a zzso called zzso zzso factor zzso We have shown that the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso regions of zzso zzso are involved in binding to zzso zzso comparison between zzso zzso zzso which do not bind to zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso suggested that the zzso site on zzso is much smaller than predicted zzso To define more precisely the zzso site, we constructed additional zzso zzso The results showed that a region spanning 11 zzso acids zzso on zzso is essential and sufficient for zzso zzso whereas the extreme zzso region zzso together with zzso region zzso affects the size of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso interactions also demonstrated that the extreme zzso and zzso regions are important but not essential for zzso To confirm the importance of zzso on zzso for zzso zzso we constructed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose zzso region was replaced with the zzso region of zzso zzso binds to zzso indicating that the zzso region is indeed a major interaction site on zzso involved in zzso zzso
