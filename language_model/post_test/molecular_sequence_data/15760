The zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso within the gene specifying the small zzso of zzso zzso zzso determination of the zzso revealed that the zzso DNA had a single base pair deletion at the 3' end of the zzso The zzso altered the zzso reading frame such that the zzso of all but one of the last 15 zzso acids of the protein were changed and the termination zzso zzso Although zzso did not induce zzso amounts of zzso activity at both 31 degrees and zzso degrees, it zzso as well as zzso virus at 31 degrees in zzso growing tissue culture cells under one step growth zzso At zzso degrees, however, zzso behaved as a zzso zzso These findings suggest that at low temperatures the zzso zzso is zzso for virus growth in actively dividing tissue culture cells but at high temperatures the zzso is essential for virus zzso Under these conditions altered properties of the host cell contribute to the zzso zzso of the zzso In the presence of zzso which zzso both the cellular and virus zzso zzso growth of the zzso at 31 degrees was inhibited more than zzso virus zzso Growth of the zzso at the zzso temperature was also sensitive to high zzso of zzso whereas zzso virus zzso was resistant to the zzso It is therefore likely that zzso is dependent on the cellular zzso zzso for growth at this zzso In zzso cells, growth of the zzso virus at 31 degrees was severely zzso Thus, like zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is required for virus zzso in resting tissue culture zzso
