zzso to zzso and zzso depend critically on the ability of the animal to detect changes in zzso zzso However, it has only been recently that an zzso system has been identified in zzso Evidence is accumulating that this molecular zzso sensor is, surprisingly, a class of soluble zzso zzso zzso known as zzso zzso It has long been known that the conventional zzso alpha and beta zzso form zzso zzso that are zzso activated by zzso but do not bind zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are only slightly sensitive to zzso but are zzso activated under hypoxic zzso Here we review evidence that suggests that the zzso zzso can function as molecular zzso sensors zzso behavioral responses to zzso zzso comparisons of other predicted zzso zzso suggest that most, if not all, insects express two zzso zzso an zzso zzso and a separate zzso zzso zzso data and recent experiments that block the function of cells that express the zzso zzso and experiments that reduce the zzso levels in these cells also suggest a role in behavioral responses to sweet zzso
