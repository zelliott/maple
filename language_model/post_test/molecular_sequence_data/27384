Two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso were zzso from the serum of the Japanese rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso a zzso of a zzso zzso specifically inhibited the basic zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso whereas the zzso one composed of two distinct zzso zzso A and B, inhibited both the zzso and basic zzso of zzso zzso On the basis of their zzso acid zzso these zzso were assigned as zzso beta and zzso zzso zzso A zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso having an apparent molecular weight of zzso and composed of zzso zzso was also zzso from the zzso zzso zzso This zzso was zzso with zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso zzso but lacked in the zzso activity toward the zzso and basic zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were cloned from liver zzso and their zzso sequences were compared with those of other zzso and zzso zzso
