We have isolated a human zzso clone zzso a novel zzso protein of zzso 55,000 that we designated zzso since it has zzso to zzso and is localized zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso body of the connecting zzso of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of human zzso showed significant zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso region and also with zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso motif similar to that seen in zzso and other zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a novel zzso protein involved in the zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso was mapped to human zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso
