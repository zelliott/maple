zzso zzso a zzso fungus producing zzso zzso is an important opportunistic pathogen that primarily affects zzso zzso zzso pigmentation of zzso zzso significantly influences its zzso in a zzso zzso In the present study, six zzso forming a gene cluster spanning 19 zzso were identified as involved in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses showed the six genes to be zzso regulated and expressed during zzso The gene products of zzso (for zzso zzso zzso (for zzso zzso zzso and zzso have high similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, found in the zzso zzso zzso of brown and black zzso The zzso gene (for zzso brown zzso encodes a putative protein possessing two signatures of zzso zzso The zzso gene product has zzso to the zzso zzso by the zzso gene of zzso zzso The function of zzso (for zzso zzso zzso remains zzso zzso of the six genes in zzso pigmentation was confirmed by the altered zzso color zzso that resulted from disruption of each gene in zzso zzso The presence of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso was supported by the zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso whereas only zzso was accumulated in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are well-known signature zzso of the zzso zzso Based on DNA sequence zzso gene disruption results, and zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso DNA zzso contains a zzso cluster which is required for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, the presence of zzso zzso and zzso in addition to zzso zzso and zzso suggests that zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is more complex than the known zzso zzso
