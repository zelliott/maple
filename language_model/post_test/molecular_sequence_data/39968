To investigate the diversity of zzso genes involved in zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso a total of 32 bacterial strains were isolated from surface zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two sets of zzso zzso were constructed to detect the zzso and zzso sequences of the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso amplified the DNA fragments from all zzso bacteria by using zzso zzso and from all zzso bacteria, except two, by using zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed three zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso detected by zzso zzso had high sequence zzso to zzso from zzso zzso zzso and were zzso from 8 of the 16 zzso zzso The primer also generated zzso that had a zzso similarity to zzso and zzso identity to zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso and zzso genes are prevalent in the zzso bacteria and that they are useful for determining the presence of zzso genes in environmental zzso
