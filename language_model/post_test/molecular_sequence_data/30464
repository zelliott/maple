Three families with abnormal zzso have been reported in Japan and sequencing analysis revealed that they had the same point zzso in one zzso of the insulin genes causing zzso zzso To estimate whether or not this same zzso came from a common zzso we determined the sequence of the zzso region zzso the third zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This region is composed of 42 tandem repeating zzso is zzso base pairs long and the sequence is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3' zzso as a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso d zzso zzso f zzso zzso i zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The length of this region is different from those of the first and second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This difference suggests either that insulin zzso and insulin zzso zzso are not of the same origin, or that three cases of zzso zzso in Japan have the same zzso but zzso has occurred in this region at some point in the zzso
