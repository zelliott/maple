Human DNA zzso iota zzso zzso possesses high zzso DNA replication features and performs zzso DNA zzso It may be specialized and strictly regulated in normal zzso zzso zzso of pol zzso may contribute to the acquisition of a zzso zzso However, there are few reports describing the zzso regulatory mechanism of pol zzso and there is controversy regarding its role in zzso In this study, we performed the deletion and zzso experiment, zzso zzso zzso interference and western zzso zzso to prove that zzso activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the zzso of pol zzso in normal and cancer zzso zzso zzso group C protein zzso and zzso zzso related protein zzso promote early zzso zzso in response to DNA damage and consequently enhance the expression of pol zzso indicating that the novel role of zzso signal zzso is involved in DNA damage zzso Furthermore, associated with elevated zzso activity, the zzso of pol zzso is positively correlated with the clinical tumor grade in 97 zzso cancer samples and may contribute to the zzso The zzso pol zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells identifying by the special zzso zzso Our results support the conclusion that zzso of pol zzso by zzso is involved in zzso and offer a novel understanding of the role of pol zzso or zzso in zzso
