The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proceeds zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of two zzso acid zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the region 3' of zzso in zzso zzso zzso identified an open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso It was proposed that zzso A zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso by using an zzso gene disruption zzso and culture zzso extracts of the zzso were zzso for the presence of zzso derivatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that the major component in culture zzso extracts of the zzso was less polar and smaller than zzso zzso Comparisons of zzso mass zzso as well as zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso of the zzso compound with those previously reported for zzso confirmed the structure of the compound as zzso the zzso analog of zzso zzso The ORF, designated zzso was cloned and the zzso zzso fusion protein produced in zzso coli and zzso from cell zzso zzso produced in zzso coli exhibited spectral properties similar to those of zzso zzso zzso that have undergone conversion to the zzso inactive zzso zzso Based on these properties and the high similarity of zzso to other zzso zzso zzso we conclude that zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
