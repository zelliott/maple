zzso zzso sequences of the zzso zzso gene of 18 zzso viruses isolated in the zzso during 1994 and 1995 show a high degree of zzso zzso zzso when compared with each zzso These sequences form a cluster distinct from zzso viruses isolated from other geographic regions and from the sequences of vaccine strains and two zzso from the zzso from earlier zzso Despite the low level of genetic zzso observed, a common feature of the zzso zzso is the presence of three zzso changes (at positions zzso zzso and zzso not observed in zzso from other zzso
