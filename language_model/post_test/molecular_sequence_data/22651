The detection of methamphetamine and other chemically related illicit drugs relies extensively on zzso Here we report the cloning and affinity maturation of an zzso zzso which is being employed in the current commercial zzso An zzso zzso was cloned from zzso cells, expressed in bacteria and its affinity towards methamphetamine and zzso zzso was determined by Surface zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was subjected to random zzso by error prone zzso and zzso with improved affinity were isolated from the resulting library by a novel screening methodology termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Iverson, zzso Rogers, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a versatile technology for the isolation of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 101, zzso The isolated clones exhibited improved affinity to these illicit drugs, yet maintained low zzso to over-the-counter zzso In addition, all clones displayed improved expression characteristics in zzso zzso The affinity improved zzso zzso are thus likely to be useful in methamphetamine class zzso
