zzso zzso is a bacterial small stable zzso in which the zzso and zzso sequences can be folded into a zzso secondary structure which can be zzso with zzso It was found that zzso coli zzso zzso facilitated the incorporation of zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso acid, but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso into the growing zzso in zzso depending on zzso zzso zzso zzso This result indicates that zzso zzso functions as an zzso for the zzso which has been found to be attached to the C zzso of truncated zzso zzso in zzso zzso with zzso was required for zzso zzso acid incorporation and for efficient association of zzso zzso with the zzso indicating that zzso zzso also functions as an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The dual function of zzso zzso both as an zzso and as a zzso in zzso strongly supports the trans translation zzso
