We recently reported an association between Type 1 diabetes and the zzso major zzso complex zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso As further families have been analyzed in the Type 1 Diabetes zzso zzso zzso we tested replication of the association and, with more data, analyzed zzso zzso 

An additional zzso case and zzso control zzso have been analyzed from the zzso with human zzso zzso zzso typing and data for zzso zzso across the zzso zzso 

We confirmed the association of zzso (new data zzso zzso zzso We also found two additional zzso nearby that were significantly associated with Type 1 diabetes (new data only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For studies of Type 1 diabetes in the zzso region, it is critical to account for linkage zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of these new data indicated that the effects of zzso and zzso on Type 1 diabetes risk are independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 12 zzso (including the three highly significant zzso zzso diabetes risk zzso risk, zzso and zzso with high-risk zzso limited to approximately zzso in zzso The zzso region is zzso of the zzso gene and contains zzso a hypothetical zzso 

We believe that zzso of the zzso zzso locus zzso may zzso risk for Type 1 zzso
