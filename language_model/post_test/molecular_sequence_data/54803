The zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso is a powerful technique for the installation of novel chemical functional groups in zzso This is often achieved by zzso a stop zzso and requires two additional zzso an evolved zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Analysis of the most successful zzso reveals common zzso The highest zzso zzso systems derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso feature specific zzso to two zzso reported to interact with the zzso group of the zzso zzso We demonstrate that the restoration of just one of these zzso for zzso acid specificity results in the loss of zzso as the evolved zzso become noticeably zzso These results offer a partial explanation of a recently zzso strategy for the synthesis of zzso Similarly, we zzso a zzso zzso reported to allow the zzso incorporation of zzso zzso within zzso zzso In multiple experiments, the zzso displayed elements of zzso despite its previous characterization as a high zzso zzso Given the many similarities of the zzso and zzso reevaluated here, our findings can be largely combined, and in doing so they reinforce the long-established central dogma regarding the molecular basis by which these zzso contribute to the zzso of zzso Thus, our view is that the central claims of zzso reported in several zzso systems remain unproven and zzso
