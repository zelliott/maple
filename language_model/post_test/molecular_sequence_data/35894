The infection of cells by zzso zzso virus results in the rapid zzso of zzso protein zzso but not of viral protein zzso To determine if this zzso selectivity might be zzso by the viral zzso we constructed a zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso end of the viral zzso zzso including the zzso binding site, fused in frame with the gene zzso zzso and compared it to a control zzso zzso containing the cellular rabbit zzso gene zzso end fused with the zzso zzso zzso Both plasmids contained identical promoter and 3' zzso regions and expressed similar levels of zzso in the indicator cell line zzso In cells zzso with either zzso viral infection resulted in a approximately zzso decrease in protein synthesis by five zzso The level of zzso from cells zzso with zzso also decreased zzso with the decrease in total protein zzso However, the level of zzso from cells zzso with zzso zzso was not affected by viral zzso Our data suggest that sequences in the zzso end of the viral zzso allow for the selective translation of the viral message in the presence of an inhibited zzso zzso
