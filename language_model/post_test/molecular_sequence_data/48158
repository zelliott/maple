The zzso actions of zzso hormones zzso are zzso by receptors zzso that are zzso by two zzso zzso and zzso The precise functions of the zzso zzso are unclear and this study focuses on the potential roles of the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso muscles zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were first zzso zzso and zzso by Northern zzso A quantitative analysis of zzso zzso expression was then zzso using zzso protection analysis with novel zzso designed to detect relative expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in functionally distinct muscles from zzso pigs kept under controlled conditions of nutrition and zzso zzso We found a striking zzso pattern of zzso zzso zzso in heart the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso was markedly greater zzso than that of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso the opposite pattern of expression occurred zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso there were no differences between the two zzso The overall abundance of zzso was very much lower than that of zzso and zzso was expressed at a higher level than zzso in all zzso Together with recent data from zzso gene zzso studies and the established role of zzso in determining zzso heavy chain zzso expression and muscle zzso these results suggest a role for differential expression of zzso zzso in acquisition and maintenance of optimal cardiac and skeletal muscle zzso
