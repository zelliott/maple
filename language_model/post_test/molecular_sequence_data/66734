zzso and zzso are zzso zzso factors that bind to zzso elements and are indispensable for expression of core zzso clock components such as the zzso and zzso zzso A key step in expression is the zzso of zzso and zzso and their zzso in the nucleus with an approximately zzso zzso We show here that zzso shuttling of zzso is essential for zzso and for degradation of the zzso zzso Using serial deletions and point zzso we identified a functional nuclear zzso signal and zzso nuclear export signals in zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso of zzso and zzso zzso their zzso as well as zzso clock gene zzso Moreover, in embryonic mouse zzso robust zzso of zzso is tightly associated with massive degradation of the zzso zzso zzso proteins suppressed this process during the zzso phase and led to nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, these findings suggest that the decrease of zzso abundance during the zzso cycle reflects robust zzso zzso of clock genes rather than zzso of zzso zzso
