zzso profiling of zzso barrel medic zzso zzso cell cultures using zzso liquid zzso coupled to zzso and mass zzso detection revealed the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as a major response to zzso zzso zzso large-scale zzso profiling indicated that three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso induced with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity based upon in zzso zzso specificity and product profiles of zzso proteins expressed in zzso zzso zzso possessed significant zzso activity relative to other zzso zzso zzso tested but has not been reported in this species before and was not found in differentiated roots in which high levels of the zzso transcripts zzso We propose that zzso is formed in cell cultures by zzso zzso when the pool of its zzso zzso builds up as a result of an imbalance between the upstream and downstream segments of the zzso pathway, reflecting the plasticity of plant secondary zzso The results illustrate that integration of zzso and zzso in genetically zzso plant cell cultures is a powerful approach for the discovery of novel zzso secondary zzso and the mechanisms underlying their zzso
