At least 32 mostly zzso zzso of zzso zzso alpha variable zzso genes have been described in zzso The zzso zzso is the largest, estimated by zzso to contain as many as five zzso However, a search of zzso sequence databases reveals a much greater number of unique sequences corresponding to this zzso In order to resolve this zzso between zzso and zzso sequencing data, and to better understand the nature of zzso among variable genes within a large zzso a zzso characterization of the zzso zzso in humans was carried zzso Total zzso DNA, as well as isolated zzso clones spanning the zzso region were screened for members of the zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso sequencing as well as by zzso A total of eight zzso genes were identified and their zzso sequences were zzso Three of the sequences represent new zzso Based on structural features and the results of zzso screening of zzso none of these new genes appear to be zzso Several additional previously reported zzso sequences were determined to represent zzso of zzso zzso and simple zzso restriction digest zzso were established for their zzso Use of each of the identified zzso genes as zzso zzso failed to reveal any additional zzso zzso Thus the zzso represent the largest zzso zzso with a maximum of eight members, several of which have common zzso zzso
