The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso zzso expressed and zzso characterized as a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso an zzso zzso reading zzso with similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso was found, tentatively designated zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso has a clear preference for zzso with a saturated zzso displaying highest activity on zzso zzso and zzso zzso also known as zzso The zzso and zzso zzso on the other hand, clearly prefer zzso as zzso zzso analysis of known and putative zzso zzso acid sequences showed that the zzso zzso zzso proteins cluster into four distinct zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso clustered with zzso the only zzso zzso present in zzso tuberculosis zzso a protein involved in cholesterol zzso and zzso The zzso range of zzso expressed zzso zzso was nearly identical with that of zzso zzso indicating that these are zzso zzso The results imply that zzso and zzso are newly identified zzso in the cholesterol zzso pathway, and important steroids with respect to zzso
