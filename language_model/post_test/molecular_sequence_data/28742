zzso zzso E zzso zzso zzso was previously zzso to apparent zzso from the zzso fraction of bovine heart zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso was identical to that of the 88th to zzso zzso acids deduced from the monkey zzso or human zzso zzso that encodes a hypothetical protein with unknown zzso The primary structure has the consensus region of zzso and of zzso We constructed an expression zzso using the zzso zzso and the monkey zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso protein with a zzso of 33 zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity and was zzso to apparent zzso by zzso column zzso The zzso and zzso values for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were about zzso zzso center dot zzso of protein and 28 zzso zzso The zzso zzso was activated by various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in order of decreasing zzso Moreover, the zzso distribution was high in the heart and brain, but the zzso was not expressed in the seminal zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is identical to the zzso zzso from the zzso fraction of bovine heart, and is a novel type of zzso zzso based on the primary structure, a broad specificity of zzso requirement, and tissue zzso
