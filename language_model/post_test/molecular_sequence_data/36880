We zzso the complex between zzso and zzso protein using two types of zzso in zzso Base changes in the zzso binding sites, zzso boxes, had little effect on origin zzso zzso which change the distance between zzso boxes zzso and zzso on the other hand, zzso zzso unless the zzso deleted or inserted one complete zzso zzso Origins with other 10 base pair insertions in the zzso between zzso boxes zzso and zzso were functional, but not insertions in the zzso zzso zzso protein binds to a zzso site in zzso between zzso boxes zzso and zzso A model for the zzso complex based on these results suggests an array of zzso zzso with a 34 A spacing upon which zzso is zzso
