A zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamics based on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso nuclear zzso effect data is zzso The protein backbone is highly rigid zzso zzso and displays little variation in zzso time scale dynamics over the zzso The loop structure containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) displays anomalous zzso which is attributed to its high zzso zzso Also reported are protection factors calculated from zzso zzso These data reveal that loop 3 zzso including the zzso zzso are protected from exchange as a result of long-range zzso zzso These results are contrasted with data reported for zzso zzso zzso zzso which displays higher overall flexibility zzso zzso greater variation of dynamics as a function of structure, and low protection factors for loop zzso This analysis reveals that zzso proteins with similar functions and zzso may display diverse zzso zzso
