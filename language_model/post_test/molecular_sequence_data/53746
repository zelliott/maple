zzso zzso zzso strains of different origin were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Fourteen of the 15 genetic zzso zzso were zzso whilst zzso zzso was zzso There was a mean of six zzso per locus and a mean genetic diversity of zzso zzso analysis identified 90 zzso types zzso separated into two major zzso divisions at a genetic distance of zzso Division I consisted of 81 zzso carrying the zzso class A zzso gene zzso whereas division II comprised 9 zzso carrying the class B zzso gene zzso but not zzso The presence of these two genes was assessed by zzso and the expression of the zzso gene was investigated by determining the level of resistance to the zzso zzso zzso showed a smaller genetic distance among the zzso of the zzso than among the zzso zzso No other particular cluster was zzso The zzso gene zzso was detected by zzso DNA sequencing of the products obtained showed that the different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were scattered randomly zzso the zzso zzso No association between distinct clones and clinical manifestations zzso zzso zzso geographical origin or host origin zzso or zzso could be zzso
