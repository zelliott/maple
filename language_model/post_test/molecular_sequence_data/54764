zzso zzso of human zzso zzso were used to generate a zzso zzso targeting zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso zzso two zzso receptors that mediate zzso and survival cell signaling in zzso zzso zzso that specifically bind zzso or zzso were generated using zzso display with a library containing as many as 10 ( zzso zzso zzso zzso display was also used to zzso lead zzso zzso resulting in clones that inhibited zzso zzso at 7 to 38 zzso compared to zzso zzso for the parental zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for blocking either zzso or zzso signaling were engineered into a single protein zzso zzso The zzso inhibited zzso of zzso and zzso induced zzso degradation, and inhibited zzso cell signaling and proliferation of human cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso 50 values ranging from zzso to 113 zzso Although zzso bound to zzso at a site distinct from those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso like the zzso the zzso zzso blocked the binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of both zzso and zzso driven human tumor zzso induced degradation of zzso and reduced zzso zzso in zzso These results demonstrate efficient engineering of zzso zzso with high potency and desired zzso The zzso may improve biological activity compared to zzso zzso as tumor growth is driven by multiple growth zzso Our results illustrate a technological advancement for constructing zzso zzso in cancer zzso
