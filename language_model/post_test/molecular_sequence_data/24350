zzso zzso a zzso channel blocker from the sea zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso by 3 zzso zzso In an effort to generate truncated zzso zzso of this potent channel blocker, we have evaluated three zzso one in which the native sequence was truncated and then stabilized by the introduction of additional zzso links (a non-native zzso and two zzso zzso and two in which non-native structural scaffolds stabilized by zzso and/or zzso bridges were modified to include key zzso acid zzso from the native zzso The effect of introducing a zzso bridge in the first zzso of zzso toxin (to create zzso was also examined to confirm that this modification was compatible with zzso All four zzso were tested in zzso for their ability to block zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso and their solution structures were determined using zzso zzso zzso The zzso bridge in full-length zzso is well zzso with only a zzso reduction in binding to zzso The truncated and stabilized analogue was zzso apparently due to a combination of slight zzso from the native structure and zzso to side chains required for zzso One of the zzso scaffolds was also inactive because it failed to adopt the required structure, but the other had a zzso of 92 zzso This active zzso incorporated mimics of zzso and zzso which are essential for activity in zzso and an zzso zzso that could mimic zzso or zzso in the native zzso zzso of this zzso should produce a more zzso low molecular weight zzso analogue which will be useful not only for further in zzso and in zzso studies of the effect of blocking zzso but also for mapping the interactions with the pore and zzso of this zzso channel that are required for potent zzso
