zzso cataract is a major cause of zzso worldwide, and cortical cataract is the second most prevalent type of age-related zzso Although a significant fraction of age-related cataract is zzso the genetic basis remains to be zzso We report that zzso deletion of zzso in two independent strains of mice developed progressive cortical zzso zzso revealed development of cortical zzso at one month of zzso visible cataract appeared around three months, which progressed to mature cataract by six zzso zzso protein expression in the lens is zzso and temporally zzso It is low in anterior zzso cells, zzso as the cells enter differentiation at the zzso strongly expressed in the cortical fiber cells, but absent in the zzso zzso of zzso caused a significant increase in the expression of zzso zzso zzso of human zzso before the onset of zzso The zzso zzso was in an zzso form, indicating excessive cellular stress and protein zzso The zzso human zzso gene on zzso zzso was tested in three independent worldwide Caucasian populations for zzso association with cortical zzso Common zzso in zzso were found that showed significant association with cortical zzso and zzso was the most significant in zzso In addition, we zzso zzso of zzso in linked families and identified a new zzso zzso zzso in the protein zzso domain that significantly alters zzso functions in cellular and zzso zzso Thus, zzso evidence from humans and mice suggests that zzso is important in maintaining lens clarity with zzso
