Previous studies demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso binding sites and compounds with zzso activity in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso providing evidence for the role of zzso as a zzso regulator of zzso function in this zzso In the present study, the expression of three forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in this marine zzso species was demonstrated for the first zzso Moreover, there is evidence for differential zzso and zzso expression of zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso zzso zzso with salmon zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso whereas chicken zzso treatment was without zzso Novel information was also provided about organization of zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirming that zzso gene organization is maintained through evolution, despite changes in the size and sequence of zzso and zzso
