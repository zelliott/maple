The zzso toxins zzso cause zzso zzso skin syndrome, a disease characterized by specific separation of layers of the zzso Evidence suggests that the toxins act as zzso zzso though the specific zzso and mode of action are not known for zzso The crystal structure of zzso toxin A zzso was reported earlier and shown to be similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso A resolution crystal structure of the other zzso zzso zzso which is zzso identical to zzso The overall structures of ETA and zzso are similar including the positions of key zzso within the active zzso The structure of zzso supports the previous findings that the zzso are zzso zzso that cleave zzso after zzso acid zzso In this study we also discuss a number of structural differences including a large 14 zzso loop zzso which may be a key feature involved in the differing biological properties of the zzso particularly the zzso and lethal activities of zzso not shared by zzso
