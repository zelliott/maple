We have isolated a human zzso for the signaling adapter zzso zzso zzso factor target and shown that it is zzso in response to nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso binding domain of zzso directly binds the zzso receptors at the same zzso zzso that binds the signaling adapter zzso suggesting a model in which competitive binding between zzso and zzso regulates differentiation versus zzso zzso with this model, zzso binds zzso zzso the zzso domain containing zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 3 zzso domain of zzso providing a functional link between zzso cell cycle, and multiple zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cells expressing an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso to stop cell cycle progression and to stimulate zzso zzso
