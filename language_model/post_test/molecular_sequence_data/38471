zzso zzso H chains turn over considerably more rapidly than zzso zzso H chains in the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso This rapid degradation occurs in zzso zzso membrane zzso H chains accumulate in the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso degradation of membrane zzso H chains may be closely coupled zzso zzso zzso degradation of membrane zzso H chains was also observed in zzso zzso zzso At steady state, the membrane form of the H chain associates more readily with zzso and zzso than its zzso zzso The preferential recognition of zzso as opposed to zzso zzso H chains by some zzso zzso zzso may provide an explanation for the accelerated zzso degradation of the zzso
