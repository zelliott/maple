Cellular regulatory genes including zzso factors may play an important role in the zzso zzso and progression of lung zzso These regulatory genes are zzso by various zzso stimuli including zzso zzso zzso zzso The differential zzso display method was used to identify potential early response genes regulated by zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso cell zzso Using this technique, several zzso fragments were found to be potentially zzso regulated by zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso One of these zzso fragments of approximately 100 zzso was determined to be zzso induced by at least zzso by zzso by northern zzso analysis and to zzso to a single zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso was zzso zzso and identified to be identical to a portion of the zzso region of the human early growth response zzso zzso Using zzso zzso as a probe, it was demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in at least three other zzso cells as zzso In addition, zzso caused a transient increase in expression of the zzso transcript reaching a maximum level by 1 h before decreasing in zzso and three other types of zzso zzso Treatment of these zzso cells with zzso showed a transient increase in zzso zzso similar to zzso which also reached a maximum level after 1 zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells also showed a zzso transient increase in expression of zzso zzso after treatment with zzso In contrast, treatment of zzso cells with zzso showed that expression of zzso zzso increased by 1 h but reached a maximum level only after 6 zzso These results indicate that both zzso and zzso can induce zzso zzso expression in zzso cells and zzso zzso however, while zzso zzso zzso zzso similarly in both cell types, zzso zzso zzso zzso expression more rapidly and more zzso in zzso cells than in zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may play different roles in response to zzso in normal and zzso lung zzso
