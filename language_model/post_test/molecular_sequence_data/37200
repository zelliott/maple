zzso zzso is recognized to be a major mechanism for the control of zzso events in zzso zzso From a human fetal brain zzso library, we isolated a zzso clone zzso a novel dual specificity protein zzso which showed zzso identity with previously reported mouse zzso at the zzso acid zzso The deduced protein had a single zzso zzso zzso domain, and lacked a zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the heart, zzso liver, and zzso and the expression level in the zzso was zzso The zzso gene was located in human zzso zzso and consisted of five zzso spanning zzso of human zzso zzso zzso fused to zzso showed zzso activity towards zzso zzso which was optimal at pH zzso and 40 degrees C, and the activity was enhanced by zzso and zzso The zzso activity of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso showed zzso activity toward zzso containing zzso and zzso indicating that zzso is a protein zzso with dual zzso zzso
