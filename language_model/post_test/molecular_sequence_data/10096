The four core zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso have been individually expressed in zzso quantities in zzso zzso The full-length proteins and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso under zzso conditions and folded into zzso zzso Both intact and truncated zzso zzso as well as chicken zzso zzso were assembled into zzso core particles using a 146 zzso zzso DNA zzso from a 5 S zzso zzso The three types of core particles were characterized and compared by gel zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso with increasing zzso zzso zzso core particles containing native and zzso zzso made in bacteria have facilitated its X-ray structure determination at zzso A zzso
