The appearance of jaws was a turning point in zzso evolution because it allowed primitive zzso to capture and process large, zzso zzso The zzso jaw consists of separate zzso and zzso skeletal elements connected by a zzso How this structure evolved from the zzso zzso bar of a zzso zzso is an unresolved question in zzso zzso To understand the zzso bases of this evolutionary transition, we examined the expression of 12 genes involved in zzso zzso patterning in the modern zzso fish zzso We find zzso expression of zzso zzso as well as zzso expression of zzso Hand and zzso genes along the zzso zzso axis of the zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso patterning evolved before the appearance of the zzso In addition, we find that zzso and zzso key regulators of joint formation in zzso are not expressed in the zzso first arch, whereas zzso which is absent from the intermediate first arch in zzso marks this domain in zzso Taken together, these data support a new scenario for jaw evolution in which incorporation of zzso and zzso into a zzso zzso patterning program drove the evolution of the jaw by altering the identity of intermediate zzso zzso We present this zzso model as an alternative to current models linking the evolution of the jaw to the de zzso appearance of sophisticated zzso zzso zzso
