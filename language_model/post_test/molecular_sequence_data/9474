zzso zzso and zzso insects have evolved a zzso zzso system in the zzso in which water is constantly and rapidly taken up before zzso In the zzso zzso zzso the movement of water through the zzso within the zzso zzso complex is likely facilitated by the two zzso zzso and zzso Both are functionally zzso and are predominantly expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso belong to the zzso zzso integral zzso and zzso zzso zzso integral zzso zzso respectively, of the insect zzso zzso In zzso analyses using zzso zzso for each zzso zzso the predicted molecular mass for the respective zzso were around 25 zzso and further indicated that both tended to be zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was exclusively expressed at the zzso plasma membrane of zzso and zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso was expressed at the zzso plasma membrane of these zzso This zzso zzso of zzso was also observed in the outer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the six zzso just outside the zzso zzso complex zzso lead zzso In the zzso zzso water is transported from the zzso zzso to the zzso space and then deposited into the zzso of the outer zzso the water then goes through the zzso zzso to exit the complex and is finally transported across the zzso lead zzso We conclude that zzso water retrieval into the zzso occurs at the very limited region of the zzso sites in zzso zzso after passing the zzso and zzso zzso and that the high zzso zzso is due to the presence of two distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso cells of zzso zzso
