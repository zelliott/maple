zzso zzso protein was recently zzso in 100 zzso quantities by zzso methods and surprisingly, the synthetic zzso which normally does not escape the zzso zzso was found to inhibit the release of zzso from cultured zzso zzso This is the first demonstration of significant biological activity associated with a precursor protein and provides the rationale for its further zzso We now report the results of our initial examination of the zzso properties of zzso protein as a prelude to solving its solution phase zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and pH zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso reveal that the protein is resistant to zzso zzso changes but is particularly sensitive to zzso zzso changes; while zzso and zzso zzso may contribute to structural stability, His and zzso zzso zzso zzso is about zzso zzso in the range of zzso degrees zzso however, even at 90 degrees C, the zzso retains nearly 50% of its zzso zzso There is no evidence for a cooperative zzso for this reason, differential scanning zzso failed to yield a defined transition zzso zzso apparently does not pass through a transition state as a function of temperature but appears to flex and retain a high percentage of zzso structure, resulting in subtle changes in secondary zzso There is no discernible zzso zzso On either side of the neutral pH range, however, there are dramatic changes in structure that result in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
