zzso is one of the most abundant sources of organic zzso zzso in soils, but must be zzso by zzso bacteria to release P for plant zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso have been developed zzso but few studies have evaluated the ecology of these bacteria in the zzso or the types of zzso that they zzso Here, we studied the diversity of zzso zzso bacteria zzso with the ability to zzso zzso in the zzso of pasture plants grown in volcanic zzso of southern zzso zzso methods were used to detect candidate zzso genes and to identify zzso bacteria that carry these zzso This study revealed that the zzso zzso populations of pasture plants included species of zzso and zzso which carried genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity confirmed the ability of these zzso zzso to degrade zzso The zzso genes described here may prove valuable as molecular markers to evaluate the role of zzso in organic P zzso in the zzso
