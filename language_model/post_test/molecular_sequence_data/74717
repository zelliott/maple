zzso signaling protein zzso functions to regulate pigmentation in mice, while its role in many other animals and in humans has not been fully zzso In this study, we identify a zzso tandem zzso encompassing the zzso zzso and zzso coding regions and the zzso promoter region as the genetic cause of white coat color of dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is located upstream of the zzso coding zzso zzso expression of a second copy of the zzso coding sequence regulated by a duplicated copy of the nearby zzso promoter causes the white sheep zzso A single copy zzso gene with a silenced zzso promoter occurs in zzso black zzso In contrast, a single copy functional zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the ancient zzso sheep coat color zzso The gene zzso was facilitated by zzso zzso between two zzso zzso sequences zzso the duplicated zzso This is the first sheep trait attributable to gene zzso and shows zzso zzso zzso and gene conversion events at the zzso zzso locus could have an important role in the evolution of sheep zzso
