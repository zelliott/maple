zzso zzso are now being used routinely for the treatment of zzso zzso Alternative zzso to replace or to complement in zzso zzso methods for assessment of the safety and potency of these zzso zzso therapeutic products are urgently zzso Advances made in understanding the mode of action of zzso zzso have provided the basis for the development of alternative zzso zzso zzso Thus, the identification of zzso zzso protein of molecular mass 25 zzso as the zzso protein target which is selectively zzso during poisoning by zzso zzso type A zzso has enabled the development of a functional in zzso zzso for this zzso Using zzso DNA methods, a segment of zzso zzso zzso zzso spanning the toxin zzso site was prepared as a fusion protein to the zzso protein in zzso zzso The fusion protein was zzso by affinity zzso and the zzso isolated after zzso with Factor zzso zzso zzso specific for the N and C zzso of zzso as well as the toxin zzso site, were prepared and used in an zzso to demonstrate zzso zzso activity towards zzso zzso zzso The reaction required low zzso of reducing agents which were zzso at higher zzso as were metal zzso and some zzso of zzso The zzso zzso has proved to be more sensitive than the mouse zzso for detection of toxin in therapeutic zzso A good correlation with results obtained in the in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso described here may provide a suitable replacement zzso for the zzso of the potency of type A toxin in therapeutic zzso
