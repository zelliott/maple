zzso have many unusual biological properties, including zzso attachment and severe repression of local zzso zzso These properties are partly an outcome, partly a cause, of unusual DNA structure in the zzso zzso Although several plant and animal zzso have been zzso most zzso sequences have not been completed or analyzed in zzso To shed light on the unique organization, zzso and evolution of zzso DNA, detailed analysis of a zzso sequence that includes zzso 8 zzso of zzso rice was zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso families (including 11 previously zzso were identified in the zzso region, totaling 245 elements and fragments that account for zzso of the zzso The ratio of solo zzso to intact elements in the zzso region is approximately zzso compared with approximately zzso in zzso regions of zzso However, the ratio of solo zzso to intact elements in the core of the zzso region ( approximately zzso is higher than in any other region investigated in rice, suggesting a hotspot for unequal zzso zzso of the zzso region of zzso and its zzso segments from zzso rice indicated that approximately zzso of the intact zzso and solo zzso were inserted into zzso after the divergence of zzso and zzso from a common zzso compared with approximately 50% for previously studied zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso were observed in the zzso region, including a zzso zzso that was found to be composed of three rearranged tandem zzso zzso analysis also revealed recent zzso zzso and extensive zzso and zzso of the zzso satellite zzso
