We analyzed protein zzso R zzso domain sequences of zzso C virus zzso zzso protein and the profile of zzso zzso from zzso zzso of zzso infected zzso zzso were compared with clinical data to verify their influence on the course and result of zzso Of 9 patients enrolled in a 12-month treatment with zzso zzso alpha zzso plus zzso zzso 6 patients responded to therapy, as assessed by the lack of zzso zzso in their zzso and 3 did zzso Among 8 zzso patients, those who responded did not have significantly more zzso in the zzso sensitivity determining region zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, in the remaining zzso acid region of the zzso domain, behind zzso the number of zzso did not differ significantly between the two groups zzso zzso zzso A correlation was found between the presence of envelope 2 zzso zzso and the result of treatment zzso zzso zzso This pilot study indicates that zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso do not correlate with outcome of zzso zzso However, the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso infected individuals could serve as a zzso marker predicting the result of treatment, before its zzso
