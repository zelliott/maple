zzso derived from the zzso zzso molecular clone of zzso zzso virus zzso called zzso replicates poorly in primary zzso monkey zzso zzso zzso zzso with three to nine zzso acid changes in the envelope replicate 100 to 1,000 times more efficiently in these zzso cultures than parental zzso Early events, including virus entry into cells, were analyzed by measuring the amounts of newly zzso viral DNA 14 to 16 h after infection of zzso by using a quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso zzso ws found to enter zzso with an efficiency similar to that of the zzso zzso The zzso indeed measured newly zzso viral DNA since detection was inhibited by the reverse zzso zzso zzso and zzso and by heat zzso of the virus stock prior to zzso Furthermore, entry of zzso and zzso zzso into zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso against zzso Analysis of the time course of viral DNA zzso showed that although initial entry of zzso into cells occurred zzso subsequent zzso increases in the amounts of viral DNA associated with spread of virus through the zzso cultures was zzso zzso the amount of zzso incubated with zzso increased the amount of virus entering the cell, but this could not overcome the block to zzso Thus, restricted replication of zzso in zzso is determined by the zzso but surprisingly it is not due to restricted virus zzso
