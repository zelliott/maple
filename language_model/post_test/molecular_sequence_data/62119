zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso in response to zzso calcium zzso is regulated by its zzso zzso or zzso zzso Although well studied in zzso the zzso characteristics of the zzso domain offer no zzso value in determining its zzso zzso To understand the molecular basis for zzso targeting in zzso the zzso targets of the zzso 1 zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso C2 zzso zzso were identified in zzso canine kidney cells and compared with that of hybrid C2 zzso containing the calcium binding zzso from zzso on zzso and zzso domain zzso In response to an zzso calcium increase, zzso targeted plasma membrane regions rich in zzso and zzso displayed a zzso targeting pattern, first targeting zzso regions in the plasma membrane and then the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso and zzso hybrids targeted zzso and zzso with zzso The zzso properties of these hybrids suggested that the membrane binding mechanism was similar to zzso but not zzso or zzso These results suggest that primarily calcium binding zzso 1 and 3 zzso structural information specifying zzso targeting of zzso and the hybrid zzso
