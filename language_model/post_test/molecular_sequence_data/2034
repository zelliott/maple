We have previously shown that zzso chicken zzso has retarded mobility, novel zzso zzso and enhanced zzso activity during zzso zzso cell zzso Here we show that novel zzso zzso occur at zzso 34, zzso 46, and zzso zzso The possibility, previously raised, that zzso 17 is zzso during zzso is zzso The zzso sites lie in consensus sequences for zzso by zzso the zzso component of maturation promoting factor zzso Furthermore, highly zzso zzso from zzso zzso eggs zzso both zzso and zzso zzso at these zzso zzso zzso alone is sufficient to account for the large zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of normal zzso by zzso retarded mobility and zzso of zzso zzso restored normal zzso These results suggest that zzso is one of the targets for zzso action, which may account in part for the zzso changes in protein zzso and cellular architecture that occur during zzso
