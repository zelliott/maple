The DNA sequence has been determined of the 3' zzso from the zzso large zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of the zzso green zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene contains two intervening sequences with characteristic sequence motifs of group II and group I zzso zzso The zzso boundaries of the zzso have been revealed by sequence determination of the mature zzso During zzso processing of the precursor zzso several abundant zzso molecules are zzso maintained in addition to the mature zzso in zzso In zzso transcripts of the zzso gene containing the group II zzso zzso zzso display a strong zzso activity under high salt zzso The zzso zzso zzso is the first group II zzso reported to be integrated into a zzso gene and represents the smallest zzso group II zzso from zzso zzso so far zzso
