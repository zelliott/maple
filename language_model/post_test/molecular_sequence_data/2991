The role of zzso was investigated by altering its expression status in developing spinal zzso zzso genes zzso zinc finger proteins zzso to zzso zzso In zzso neural development, they are generally expressed in the zzso neural zzso Chick zzso was initially expressed evenly along the zzso axis and its expression became increasingly restricted zzso during the course of zzso The zzso expression of zzso was regulated by Sonic zzso zzso and zzso as revealed by their zzso in the spinal zzso When zzso was zzso on the zzso side of the chick spinal cord, zzso differentiation was inhibited irrespective of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso properties were not zzso affected as revealed by molecular zzso zzso when zzso was zzso in the zzso spinal zzso in transgenic mice, we observed zzso in the zzso spinal zzso The zzso cells were increased in comparison to those of truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso we observed a significant cell number reduction without loss of zzso properties in the zzso spinal cords of zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso controls the expansion of zzso precursors by zzso the progression of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso differentiation is likely to act downstream of zzso genes since zzso is zzso in zzso spinal cords in both the mouse and the zzso
