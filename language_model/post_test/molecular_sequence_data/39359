zzso studies on mouse brain protein expression are still holding center stage as the generation of a reference database for the brain zzso a need for designing zzso studies at the protein zzso We therefore decided to extend the amount of identified brain proteins by the use of zzso In order to reduce the complexity of mouse brain zzso we applied zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction zzso prior to zzso followed by mass zzso identification zzso zzso We analyzed about 17,000 protein spots in zzso zzso of mouse brain and identified about 10,000 zzso A total of 1841 proteins showing different zzso or zzso representing probably zzso modifications or zzso zzso were products of zzso different zzso Numerous proteins were clearly identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We additionally provided evidence for the existence of hypothetical proteins predicted from zzso acid zzso Moreover, observed zzso of proteins are listed thus enabling zzso of proteins in a zzso information that cannot be obtained from theoretical zzso in zzso The results represent so far the largest database of mouse brain proteins and provide valuable information for the design of zzso studies in the zzso
