zzso is a zzso zzso factor complex essential for generating the correct balance of zzso and zzso zzso in multiple regions of the nervous system, including the zzso horn of the spinal zzso and the zzso Although the components of zzso have been identified as the basic zzso zzso factor zzso its zzso zzso partner, and zzso no neural targets are known for this zzso factor zzso Here we identify the zzso differentiation gene zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) as a direct target of zzso A zzso zzso neural tube zzso localized 3' of the zzso coding sequence was identified that requires a zzso binding site for zzso activity in mouse and chick neural zzso zzso and loss of zzso function in zzso demonstrate its role in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso from neural tube tissue demonstrates that zzso is bound to the zzso zzso Thus, zzso expression is directly regulated by the zzso complex, identifying zzso as the first neural target of zzso and revealing a zzso zzso factor cascade functioning in the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso spinal zzso and zzso
