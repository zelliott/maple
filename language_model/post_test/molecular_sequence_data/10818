zzso derived from zzso virus zzso have the potential to zzso zzso zzso cells by zzso into host zzso Despite active research on the use of zzso zzso for gene therapy, the structure of integrated zzso zzso has not previously been analyzed at the DNA sequence zzso Studies on the integration of zzso zzso have identified a common zzso integration locus on human zzso zzso however, most zzso zzso do not appear to integrate at this zzso To improve our understanding of zzso zzso integration, we analyzed the DNA sequences of several integrated zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with an zzso shuttle zzso and integrated zzso containing zzso human DNA were recovered as bacterial plasmids for further zzso We found that zzso zzso integrated as zzso zzso at random zzso locations and that the zzso zzso DNA at integration sites was not zzso to zzso or the zzso integration locus of zzso zzso zzso junctions were scattered throughout the zzso terminal repeats with no apparent site zzso None of the integrated zzso were fully zzso zzso zzso with nearly intact terminal repeats were excised and amplified after infection with zzso zzso and zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso integrate by zzso zzso after partial degradation of entering zzso zzso These findings have important implications for the mechanism of zzso zzso integration and the use of these zzso in human gene zzso
