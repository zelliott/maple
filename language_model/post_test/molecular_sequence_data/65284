The zzso zzso zzso zzso order zzso family zzso comprises zzso bacterial pathogens of a wide range of zzso that are currently classified in the three recognized species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bacteria contain a type zzso zzso system zzso known to be a key zzso factor of the related zzso zzso Providing the first respective sequence information for the zzso type species, zzso zzso the three zzso components zzso zzso and zzso were used as zzso markers to test hypotheses implicit in the currently accepted zzso organization of zzso at the species, zzso and family zzso These results, zzso firmly corroborate the previous zzso zzso zzso zzso of the species zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso order zzso and, zzso support the current zzso of the investigated zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains in different species of the same zzso In contrast, the analysis of zzso sequence distances does not lend support to the current zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the family zzso but is consistent with a zzso neutral zzso assignment within the order zzso
