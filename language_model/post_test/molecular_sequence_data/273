A zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a zzso system in zzso Republic of zzso zzso were found to be zzso zzso and zzso the major fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso the zzso respiratory zzso was zzso and the DNA zzso content was zzso zzso A zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons showed that strain zzso forms an evolutionary lineage within the radiation of the zzso zzso and that its closest relative is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso Evidence from this zzso study showed that strain zzso could not be assigned to any recognized zzso It therefore represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
