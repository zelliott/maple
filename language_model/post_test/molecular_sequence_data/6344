zzso events leading to the zzso of tumor zzso genes often involve zzso zzso that can be detected as loss of zzso zzso In the zzso zzso spontaneous tumors of the zzso zzso and zzso develop as a result of a zzso zzso of the zzso sclerosis 2 zzso zzso We examined the pattern and frequency of zzso at the zzso locus in 77 primary tumors and cell lines to gain an understanding of the role of zzso zzso loss in the zzso of zzso zzso Although most zzso and zzso tumors zzso and cell zzso displayed zzso zzso zzso did zzso Although the presence of normal tissue may account for some of this difference, the possibility exists that an alternative zzso such as subtle zzso or gene dosage effects, may be involved during zzso zzso Northern analysis confirmed that zzso resulted in loss of the zzso transcripts for the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of both zzso plays an important role in zzso and zzso tumor development, in keeping with zzso two-hit zzso In addition, zzso tumors that retained the zzso zzso also did not express the normal transcript, suggesting that the remaining zzso zzso had acquired subtle zzso resulting in loss of gene zzso
