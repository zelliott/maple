zzso zzso is a target for numerous regulatory events in all living zzso Recent studies identified a few zzso zzso on the surface of bacterial zzso zzso that mediate its interactions with diverse accessory zzso zzso among these hot spots, the zzso zzso clamp zzso serve as a major binding site for the initiation factor zzso and for the zzso factor zzso Furthermore, the two proteins interact with the zzso DNA strand in zzso complexes and thus may interfere with each other's zzso We show that zzso does not inhibit zzso initiation but, once recruited to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We argue that this apparent competition is due to a zzso exclusion of zzso by zzso that is zzso bound to the zzso DNA and clamp zzso both of which are necessary for the zzso recruitment to the zzso zzso Our findings highlight the key regulatory role played by the clamp zzso during both initiation and zzso stages of zzso
