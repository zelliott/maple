zzso zzso levels in zzso and blood compartments decrease below detection limits during highly active zzso zzso Despite these therapeutic effects, it is clear that persistent, zzso zzso reservoirs are capable of rebounding in the absence of drug treatment or by evolution of escape zzso zzso The current study was designed to examine the presence of zzso virus in zzso and blood compartments and its evolution following potent combination therapy with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in cultured seminal and blood zzso cells in all patients up to zzso days zzso Higher levels of zzso zzso were consistently detected in seminal zzso cells as compared to peripheral blood zzso cells zzso in all time points analyzed zzso Analysis of viral zzso from cultured zzso before and after therapy displayed no evidence of zzso drug resistance in the viral zzso gene in the majority of zzso However, distinct envelope populations were detected in these viral zzso populations following therapy, indicating possible selection of zzso The observed ongoing replication and evolution in the zzso viral envelope sequences likely occurred in the seminal compartment zzso zzso given that the seminal cells showed the ability to express zzso zzso following zzso This together with our previous studies zzso zzso et zzso J zzso zzso zzso suggest that the zzso and blood compartments likely serve as distinct reservoirs harboring zzso zzso during prolonged drug zzso
