zzso is a member of a set of putative zzso switch regulatory genes zzso zzso selected by screening zzso libraries prepared from human blood zzso cells cultured for 2 zzso with zzso and zzso The sequence shows high zzso with the zzso zzso zzso which encodes a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso sequences reveals a zzso structure characteristic of the zzso family of zzso Freshly isolated cells show high levels of zzso and zzso zzso which decline rapidly during incubation in culture zzso The zzso of expression suggest that the high initial levels are caused by the isolation zzso and do not reflect zzso zzso In cells zzso for a day, levels of zzso zzso reach a maximum 20 zzso after the addition of zzso and decline to control levels over the next 3 zzso zzso of zzso zzso reach a maximum 40 zzso after the addition of zzso and decline to control levels over the next 6 zzso In freshly isolated cells, both zzso and zzso zzso increase dramatically in response to the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso In zzso cells, the zzso response is zzso especially in the case of zzso These differences in expression of zzso and zzso suggest different roles and zzso zzso of low base zzso zzso potential in the region of the gene are zzso These indicate where base order has been adapted for purposes other than zzso stability zzso zzso proteins or gene zzso zzso of low potential in a zzso zzso segment containing the zzso gene suggest that the potential may help locate genes in uncharted DNA zzso
