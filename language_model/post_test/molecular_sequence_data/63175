Recently a zzso protein zzso from goat zzso zzso has been reported from our laboratory which is found to stimulate zzso zzso zzso without any significant effect on zzso zzso In the present study, detailed structural and functional zzso as well as the zzso significance of the protein has been zzso The zzso effect is found to be inhibited by known zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Monitoring of the zzso intermediate by zzso has shown that the stimulation of the zzso is due to the enhancement in the rate of zzso of the overall reaction zzso Along with the stimulation of the zzso activity, the protein is found to enhance the calcium zzso zzso acid analysis data show that the zzso contains about zzso zzso zzso acid zzso easy penetration to the zzso core of the membrane bound zzso zzso zzso analysis of the protein suggested the presence of all secondary structural zzso The zzso experiment shows its expression level is the highest in goat zzso zzso fragments obtained in zzso analysis when subjected to zzso database search by MASCOT search engine reveals that the proteins of close similarity with the protein under study are zzso related protein 2/3 complex zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso releasing zzso zzso Besides, the protein under study is also shown to decrease the forward zzso of goat zzso without having any significant effect on the total zzso indicating its possible role in fertility zzso
