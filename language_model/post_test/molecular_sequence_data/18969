Biological functions of a zzso zzso protein in the zzso gene cluster of a novel circular zzso zzso Q zzso were characterized in this zzso zzso analysis and database search of the regions zzso the zzso structural gene zzso revealed four open reading frames zzso zzso zzso and zzso related to zzso zzso zzso shares some similarity to the zzso zzso zzso often found in the zzso gene clusters of circular zzso Mass zzso analysis showed zzso of active mature zzso inside zzso knockout zzso zzso expression of zzso demonstrated that it zzso robust immunity against zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the immunity could be attributed to the zzso of zzso to the cell zzso Thus, the zzso zzso protein has a dual function in the zzso of zzso as an zzso zzso and as a zzso zzso zzso of mature zzso inside the cell in zzso knockout zzso further implied that zzso occurs within the zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on zzso zzso inside the cell and the dual role of a zzso zzso protein in circular zzso zzso
