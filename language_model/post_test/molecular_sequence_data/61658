zzso peptides patterned after the zzso of zzso associated protein of 25 zzso zzso efficiently abrogate regulated zzso In contrast, the use of zzso zzso peptides to zzso zzso receptors zzso complex assembly and zzso has not been zzso Here, we show that the zzso of zzso specially the segment that encompasses zzso is essential for the formation of the zzso zzso zzso patterned after this protein domain are potent zzso of zzso complex zzso The zzso activity correlated with their propensity to adopt an zzso secondary zzso These peptides zzso zzso complex formation only when added previous to the onset of zzso zzso Analysis of the mechanism of action revealed that these peptides disrupted the zzso complex formed by zzso and zzso The identified peptides inhibited zzso zzso from zzso excitable zzso zzso these zzso acid sequences markedly protected intact zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso with a potency that zzso that displayed by zzso zzso Our findings indicate that peptides patterned after the zzso of zzso are potent zzso of zzso complex formation and zzso zzso Because of their activity in intact zzso these cell permeable peptides may be hits for zzso and zzso drug zzso
