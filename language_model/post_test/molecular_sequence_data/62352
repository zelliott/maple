DNA fragments were amplified by zzso from all tested strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso designed based on sequence alignment of all zzso zzso C, and zzso A1 genes and the zzso zzso zzso all of which have been reported to have the consensus region of the putative zzso zzso zzso All strains showed zzso activity, and all amplified DNA fragments contained a zzso sequence corresponding to the zzso zzso Thirty-five distinct zzso sequence patterns and 15 distinct deduced zzso acid sequence patterns were found in the amplified DNA fragments from 59 zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the amplified DNA fragments from zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains had distinctive zzso zzso suggesting a zzso sequence in each zzso Furthermore, the zzso acid sequence patterns appear to differ between clinical and environmental zzso among zzso zzso zzso Some strains whose zzso sequences were identical to one another in the amplified region showed an identical DNA zzso pattern by repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and also zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have a gene zzso a protein with zzso zzso zzso of the gene appear to be widely distributed in zzso zzso probably zzso with the evolutionary genetic difference between clinical and environmental zzso of zzso zzso Additionally, the distinctive zzso sequences of the genes could be attributed to the zzso of each strain, suggesting that their analysis may be helpful in zzso the genetic zzso of zzso
