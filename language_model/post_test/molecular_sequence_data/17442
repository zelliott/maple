zzso zzso dishes, zzso by a plasma deposition process, were surface modified by the zzso linking of two different zzso modified zzso regions zzso from zzso zzso for example, zzso and zzso structural zzso The two zzso preparations share the same structural elements of apple zzso but the relative amounts and lengths of the neutral side chains present zzso Surface analysis by X-ray zzso zzso contact angle zzso and atomic force microscope zzso zzso zzso was used to characterize the effects on surface chemistry and zzso forces of the surface modification zzso Cell zzso experiments using continuous zzso zzso and primary zzso smooth muscle cells were performed to evaluate the effect of the zzso nature on cell zzso zzso show that zzso of the zzso affects the zzso field of forces and the cell behavior: zzso contact angles, obtained by a recently introduced zzso approach, decrease after zzso zzso reaching a value close to 20 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso show a more extended (or zzso interface in the case of the zzso bearing longer side zzso zzso depending on the zzso preparation, cells shifted from spread zzso and zzso behavior zzso comparable to that observed on conventional tissue culture polystyrene to rounded zzso and significantly lower zzso These data show that engineering of plant zzso can be a valuable tool to prepare novel and finely tuned zzso having different zzso and biological properties, to be used in the surface modification of medical devices and zzso
