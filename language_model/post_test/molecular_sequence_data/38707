zzso of zzso coli into larvae of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in the appearance of a zzso substance on the zzso zzso To characterize this zzso substance, we zzso it to zzso from the zzso zzso and determined its molecular structure to be zzso using the liquid zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the same retention time on zzso as the zzso zzso from zzso zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso synthesis in zzso we examined the zzso activity of zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso increased dramatically approximately 8 h after zzso zzso zzso activity of injected larvae being zzso higher than zzso larvae after 24 zzso To evaluate the extent of quantitative changes of zzso zzso in response to bacterial challenge, zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from the whole larvae and a zzso clone for zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that expression of the zzso zzso gene was activated zzso zzso h after zzso coli zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso zzso was detected from 8 to 24 h in zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, bacterial injection into zzso zzso larvae might induce zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and then synthesis of zzso The zzso zzso might be used as a zzso by zzso during zzso synthesis in the zzso defense response or the zzso zzso reaction of the cellular defense zzso
