zzso zzso of zzso zzso in dairy cattle in zzso nations have mostly shown a dominance of zzso zzso especially its zzso zzso in zzso zzso Few studies, however, have been conducted on the distribution of zzso species and zzso zzso zzso in various age groups of dairy cattle in developing zzso In this study, we examined the prevalence and molecular characteristics of zzso in dairy cattle in four Nile River delta provinces in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to screen for zzso zzso in 1974 zzso specimens from animals of different ages on 12 zzso Positive zzso specimens were identified from all studied farms with an overall prevalence of zzso By age group, the infection rates were zzso in zzso calves, zzso in zzso calves, zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and DNA sequence analyses of zzso zzso specimens revealed the presence of four major zzso zzso In zzso calves, zzso zzso was most common zzso or zzso but zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso were also present at much higher zzso seen in most zzso zzso Mixed infections were seen in zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was the dominant species zzso or zzso in zzso calves and older zzso zzso of zzso zzso based on sequence analysis of the zzso zzso gene showed the presence of zzso zzso in nine zzso zzso in 27 zzso and a rare zzso zzso in one zzso The common occurrence of zzso zzso species and zzso zzso in zzso calves is a distinct feature of zzso transmission in dairy cattle in zzso The finding of the same two dominant zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso recently found in humans in Egypt suggests calves can be potential reservoirs of zzso zzso
