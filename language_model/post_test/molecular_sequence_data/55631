Growth of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso in certain cloned human zzso lines, such as zzso selects for zzso containing a premature stop zzso within the zzso domain of the zzso envelope zzso In contrast, propagation of virus in zzso or in their cultured T cells favors replication of virus containing the full-length envelope zzso To zzso the causes of this phenomenon, we used a human zzso virus zzso system to assess the effects on zzso of the zzso zzso of envelope zzso obtained from zzso and zzso These envelopes contain truncated and full-length zzso zzso zzso By analyzing human zzso virus particles containing zzso genes zzso with each zzso or with zzso zzso we found that zzso of the zzso domain resulted in a significant advantage in viral entry into zzso T cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain significantly enhanced both envelope density on particles and zzso zzso zzso It is likely that one or both of these effects contribute to the observed differences in zzso and to the selection of zzso with short zzso tails in human T zzso
