zzso zzso zzso zzso mass of zzso zzso in the outer membrane of zzso zzso type b zzso permits diffusion into the zzso of small zzso up to a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso modeling of zzso zzso identified its structural similarities to zzso of zzso coli and disclosed for zzso zzso a shorter length of loop 3 and a longer length of loop zzso By zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso were constructed to contain 6 or 12 zzso acid deletions either in loop 3 or in zzso loop zzso Wild type zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in a zzso zzso zzso strain deleted for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso and zzso into zzso zzso tested for channel formation and compared with wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso possessing a zzso acid deletion in loop 3 displayed a broad distribution of single channel zzso values, while deletion of 12 zzso acids from the same loop zzso the zzso zzso By comparison, deletion of 6 or of 12 zzso acids from loop 4 of zzso zzso resulted in an increased single channel zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with wild type zzso zzso zzso 85 zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein was inserted either into loop 3 or into loop 4 of zzso zzso By flow zzso the zzso zzso was detected as zzso in strains expressing zzso zzso in loop 4; in strains expressing zzso zzso in loop 3, the zzso was zzso We propose that loop 4 of zzso zzso although zzso is oriented toward the central axis of the pore and that deletions in this loop increase the single channel zzso by widening the pore zzso
