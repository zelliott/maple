zzso the mechanism of zzso regulation of zzso switching has scientific as well as clinical relevance because of the influence of fetal zzso zzso production in adulthood on the clinical manifestation of zzso and zzso cell zzso We have previously found that the normal zzso patterns of zzso gene expression are zzso in an experimental system of primary cultures that support differentiation of zzso zzso We further found that high activities of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are associated with normal adult zzso zzso 

In the present work, we have zzso the activities of zzso and zzso during differentiation of cultured zzso zzso derived from zzso blood and from fetal zzso as well as from beta zzso zzso 

The results showed high zzso binding activity and very low zzso activity in the fetal liver zzso This pattern was in contrast to cultures derived from normal adult peripheral blood, in which both zzso and zzso activities were zzso zzso blood cultures showed an additive combination of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso derived from a beta zzso patient with high zzso production showed zzso zzso On the other hand, in cultures of 2 beta zzso patients without high zzso zzso pattern was zzso 

In the present work, we show that human fetal and adult zzso zzso are distinct in their zzso factors, and that the commitment to fetal or adult program occurs at a very early differentiation zzso Our studies also demonstrate that under anemic stress, recruitment of fetal zzso may occur in zzso
