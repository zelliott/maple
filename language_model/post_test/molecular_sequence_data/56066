zzso is one of the small nuclear zzso frequently targeted by zzso in systemic lupus zzso We isolated and characterized the zzso present in lupus zzso that are specific for the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso This region is highly zzso to sequence zzso of the zzso I zzso one of the nuclear zzso induced by infection with zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso over a zzso zzso column were able to recognize this sequence in the context of the whole zzso zzso as they reacted with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound also the zzso I zzso zzso and detected the zzso I zzso in a total cell extract from zzso zzso zzso A population of zzso zzso is, therefore, able to bind an zzso shared by the zzso and the viral zzso zzso zzso To investigate the involvement of this shared zzso in the generation of zzso zzso we zzso mice with the zzso I zzso zzso zzso from zzso animals displayed the same pattern of zzso of spontaneously produced zzso zzso They reacted in fact with the zzso zzso as well as with zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that molecular mimicry may play a role in the induction of zzso zzso
