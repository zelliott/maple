As reported previously zzso zzso zzso zzso Mallett, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso from a number of zzso and zzso sources contain a zzso zzso zzso insert that is completely absent in the zzso zzso zzso On limited zzso with zzso the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is readily converted to two major fragments corresponding to masses of approximately 40 and 23 zzso The combined application of sequence and mass zzso analyses demonstrates that the zzso zzso represents the zzso of intact zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso band represents a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso limited zzso in effect zzso most of the zzso insert zzso indicating that this represents a flexible region on the protein zzso The zzso and other zzso properties of the zzso including both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso behavior with both zzso and zzso and preferential binding of the zzso form of the oxidized zzso were largely unaffected by zzso zzso turnover analyses of the intact and zzso zzso zzso (at zzso approximately 10 zzso demonstrate that the single major zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso increase in zzso the basis for this altered kinetic behavior is derived from an zzso decrease in the zzso rate constant for reduction of the zzso zzso as measured in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the flexible surface region represented by elements of the zzso insert plays an important role in zzso efficient zzso zzso
