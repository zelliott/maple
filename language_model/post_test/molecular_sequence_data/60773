This paper reports that zzso rats develop experimental zzso zzso zzso when zzso with zzso zzso basic protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso In contrast, most zzso strains are zzso by this zzso zzso as low as 5 zzso zzso + zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso Lewis zzso rats did not develop zzso even after zzso with 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso but were rendered tolerant to zzso zzso rat T cells proliferated to zzso and proliferation was inhibited by zzso and by zzso and zzso 2 zzso This indicates that the ease of induction of zzso in this strain does not reflect a decreased requirement for T cell zzso through the zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was zzso in the presence of zzso zzso An zzso zzso T cell line expressed zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso these zzso In contrast, a T cell line from zzso + zzso zzso rats (which did not develop zzso failed to zzso these zzso Although this line did not express zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso suggesting zzso regulation of zzso zzso Attempts to induce zzso in zzso rats with zzso zzso zzso were also zzso
