We report the discovery of the zzso interacting protein I zzso which binds specifically to the zzso of human zzso both in the zzso screen and in in zzso binding zzso For the interaction in zzso a protein region downstream of the zzso stretch in zzso is zzso The zzso zzso isolated by the zzso screen encodes a 55 zzso zzso of a novel zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso a protein of 116 zzso was detected in brain extracts by Western zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso exhibits significant similarity to zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso play a functional role in the cell filament zzso The zzso gene is zzso expressed in different brain regions at low zzso zzso is enriched in human brain but can also be detected in other human zzso as well as in mouse zzso zzso and zzso behave almost zzso during zzso zzso and both proteins are enriched in the membrane containing zzso
