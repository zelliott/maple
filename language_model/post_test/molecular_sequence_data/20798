zzso is one of the central hormones in plants, and zzso response factor zzso is a key regulator in the early zzso zzso zzso zzso play an essential role in zzso signal zzso but knowledge remains limited about the regulatory network between zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso In this study, we used a novel zzso rice zzso with zzso root defects to investigate the zzso expression patterns using zzso zzso A number of zzso showed reduced zzso sensitivity in the zzso compared with the wild type, consistent with the zzso zzso of the zzso Four zzso with significantly altered expression patterns in the zzso were further confirmed by Northern zzso which supported our zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed some novel zzso zzso in zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and expression patterns suggested the evolutionary conservation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso promoter analysis suggested the possibility that most plant zzso might share the similar zzso mechanisms with other zzso zzso genes transcribed by zzso zzso zzso zzso response elements were proved to be more frequently present in zzso zzso zzso Comparative analysis of zzso and zzso gene expression zzso uncovered many zzso expressed zzso pairs, which could provide some hints for zzso downstream zzso Based on these findings, we also proposed a feedback circuit between zzso and zzso The results presented here could serve as the basis for further in-depth studies of plant zzso involved in zzso zzso
