The conversion of zzso steroids to zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso product of the zzso zzso zzso sites of expression include the zzso and zzso however, in a small subset of zzso zzso is also expressed in the zzso In humans, zzso expression employs a promoter zzso to the start site of translation, whereas expression in the zzso relies on a promoter which is zzso to this zzso We characterized the bovine zzso gene in both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to determine if this method of regulation of zzso expression is employed in other zzso Both bovine and human species express zzso in these zzso however, the pattern of expression is very zzso In both humans and zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso cells of the zzso however, after zzso only the zzso zzso cells of the human continue to express zzso There is a high degree of sequence identity zzso shared between humans and cattle in the zzso zzso DNA, whereas little identity zzso was found between humans and cattle in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions of human and bovine zzso genes were zzso into a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso human zzso cells failed to express zzso zzso When zzso zzso were zzso into zzso bovine zzso cells, there was no change in zzso activity in cells zzso with the bovine zzso after treatment with zzso whereas all of the corresponding human zzso expressed zzso zzso The bovine zzso DNA lacks a zzso zzso sequence zzso critical for zzso zzso of zzso in the human zzso With the absence of this CLS sequence in the bovine zzso there appears to be little enhancement of zzso by zzso in the portion of the zzso region studied so zzso When the analogous region of the bovine promoter was zzso to the human CLS, only a partial restoration of zzso activity was zzso An additional element therefore appears to be important in preventing the full expression of the bovine zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso
