zzso zzso of genetic material in DNA form is a novel approach to vaccination that has proved zzso for a number of viral zzso We are interested in the potential of this approach for the delivery of vaccines based on attenuated or zzso zzso Toward this goal, we tested the effect of intramuscular zzso of a zzso containing the entire zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso DNA delivery was compared with intramuscular or zzso zzso of virus zzso from the same molecular zzso The outcome was monitored by zzso analysis and quantitative virus load determination over a zzso zzso DNA zzso was found to be a reliable means of infection, although zzso and the rise in zzso virus load were delayed relative to intramuscular or zzso zzso of zzso At 31 weeks, similar levels of zzso DNA were detected in central zzso tissue of all infected zzso In conclusion, DNA zzso of zzso DNA will be of use as a novel method of zzso virus challenge and may have further potential for the delivery of zzso zzso
