The common ice plant, zzso zzso shifts from zzso to zzso acid metabolism zzso photosynthesis in response to zzso zzso The expression of a number of genes zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso increases as a result of increased zzso zzso To begin to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the zzso zzso we have characterized the zzso control region of a specific zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso that plays a key role in zzso We have determined the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso region of this zzso zzso contains a long zzso sequence with the zzso start site located zzso zzso zzso of the zzso initiation zzso Multiple DNA interactions with nuclear factors are zzso within the zzso region of zzso We have used copper zzso zzso to demonstrate that one particularly abundant factor zzso zzso binds the zzso promoter at two distinct zzso sites located zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso These binding sites share a loose consensus motif having the sequence zzso zzso zzso competition experiments with zzso containing these zzso binding sites suggest that both sites bind the same factor, but with different zzso zzso of crude nuclear extracts by zzso zzso indicates that zzso is more prevalent in extracts prepared from zzso leaf zzso Additional binding activities that interact with the zzso binding sites have been detected that either increase or decrease in abundance or binding affinity in response to salt zzso
