The zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was identified previously as an essential factor for expression of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso To identify other genes that are essential for zzso production, zzso zzso with zzso was carried out, and 25 zzso that were unable to produce zzso and zzso were zzso Analysis of the zzso gene of one of the zzso zzso revealed the presence of a zzso zzso in this zzso and a zzso was found in zzso in the zzso In addition to its inability to produce zzso zzso did not grow well on zzso zzso zzso and some other carbon sources, most of which were zzso system zzso zzso Thus, the inability to produce zzso was assumed to be caused by the zzso in zzso of zzso via the zzso considering that zzso is the minimal zzso for zzso induction and the major product of zzso zzso by zzso of this zzso To confirm this zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso II zzso was cloned by reference to its zzso coli counterpart, and the zzso zzso zzso was shown to comprise zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso drastically reduced production of zzso and zzso and impaired growth on zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso is zzso by the zzso and that the zzso zzso II zzso constitutes its major zzso Since zzso zzso is essential for induction of zzso and zzso production, zzso appears to be the key zzso in recognition and zzso of zzso by zzso zzso
