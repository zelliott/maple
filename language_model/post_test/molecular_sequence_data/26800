zzso zzso modification was analyzed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Application of modern zzso techniques localized the modification in the zzso sequence and revealed it to be an zzso on zzso of one zzso of zzso zzso A double digest with zzso and zzso zzso was necessary to obtain an zzso zzso because the modification blocked the zzso zzso site at this zzso Furthermore, a zzso extraction protocol without zzso acid was crucial to acquire the modified zzso indicating an acid zzso of the zzso This finding was supported by the presence of a truncated version of the original zzso with zzso exchanged by zzso zzso zzso verified that the zzso occurred on zzso With our approach, we were able to zzso a zzso modification within a large zzso of 31 zzso acid zzso The present study provides a method suitable for the identification of so far unknown protein modifications on zzso or other zzso It represents a new tool for the zzso analysis of protein zzso
