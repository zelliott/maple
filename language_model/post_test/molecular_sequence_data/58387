zzso zzso simulations on zzso and zzso complexes suggest that the DNA within these complexes is significantly more ordered than free zzso Similarly, both the protein and the DNA are more ordered in the specific zzso zzso complex than they are in the zzso zzso complex, consistent with recently proposed analogies between protein folding and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso shows that the net zzso gain upon specific binding to be the result of opposing zzso zzso release, which increases zzso versus zzso terms (as measured by the magnitude of the atomic zzso and collective terms from tight zzso between the motions of the protein and the zzso
