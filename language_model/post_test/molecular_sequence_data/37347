The solution zzso of two peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso from human zzso zzso large zzso loop zzso with known importance in the zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso binding interaction was characterized using circular zzso zzso In addition, the solution structure of zzso 1 that contains a zzso zzso zzso in zzso known to be critical in the binding interaction with zzso was determined using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both peptides are zzso in water but begin forming significant zzso zzso following the addition of zzso or more zzso zzso a result consistent with their zzso zzso found in the native zzso The CD data recorded as a function of pH and zzso concentration are consistent with stabilization of the zzso structure from zzso forces for both zzso zzso 1 is able to block the binding interaction of zzso zzso zzso to zzso expressed on zzso T cells at high zzso zzso zzso a low affinity that we attributed to the random zzso structure in zzso
