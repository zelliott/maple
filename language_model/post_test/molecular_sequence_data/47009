Many bacteria have been shown to bind to the zzso part of zzso but also the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are of zzso To investigate the chemistry of the zzso of kidney zzso to which the zzso zzso coli zzso different mass zzso techniques were zzso First, a mixture of zzso isolated from man and mice kidney was separated by zzso zzso (TLC) and scanned by direct zzso from the plate by fast atom zzso mass zzso zzso Second, the zzso were zzso by zzso TLC and analyzed by zzso zzso After zzso further analyses were made with zzso zzso zzso electron zzso zzso zzso zzso gas zzso zzso and zzso zzso laser zzso zzso The zzso compositions of the four zzso were determined using all these zzso techniques and the reliability of the different methods for this type of analyses is zzso zzso of the mouse kidney zzso with the corresponding zzso from human kidney showed the same degree of zzso of zzso among zzso and zzso zzso but a significantly higher degree of zzso among mouse kidney zzso with three and four sugar zzso This result might be of relevance for the binding of zzso zzso coli to the urinary tract zzso
