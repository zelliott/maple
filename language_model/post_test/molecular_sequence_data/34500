The zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso which regulates mercury resistance zzso in zzso bacteria, was subjected to directed evolution in an effort to generate a zzso zzso that responds to zzso but not zzso zzso zzso was used to introduce random zzso into the key zzso regions of zzso The effects of these zzso were assessed using a zzso in which zzso controlled the expression of green fluorescent protein zzso and zzso via the zzso zzso An zzso coli cell library was screened by zzso cell zzso using a zzso dual screening strategy that selected for zzso zzso that showed zzso repression when cells were induced with zzso but zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Two zzso zzso zzso with decreased responses toward zzso were identified through the first zzso zzso These zzso were used for a second zzso round, which yielded eight zzso zzso that had no significant response to zzso zzso or the other tested zzso Seven of the eight zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activities equal to that of zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso (12 to zzso in zzso indicating that the zzso of metal specificity with maintenance of zzso function was due to the combined effect of many zzso rather than just a few zzso acid zzso The zzso acid changes were studied by alignment against the sequences of zzso and other zzso zzso family zzso The analysis indicated that the generated zzso zzso zzso appear to be unique among the zzso family members characterized to zzso
