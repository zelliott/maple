Large zzso zzso zzso represent substantial proportion of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso whereas the frequency of zzso in the zzso gene is low in many zzso We screened for zzso in zzso and zzso genes by multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso in 521 unrelated patients negative for zzso point zzso selected from 655 Czech high-risk breast and/or zzso cancer zzso Besides long range zzso a zzso zzso zzso array comparative zzso zzso zzso was used for accurate location of zzso We identified 14 patients carrying 8 different zzso in zzso that accounted for zzso of all zzso zzso zzso No zzso were detected in the zzso zzso In a zzso of 239 patients from high-risk families, we found 12 zzso zzso whereas two zzso were revealed in a zzso of 282 zzso cancer cases zzso Five zzso zzso of zzso zzso 5-10, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso two zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso belong to the already described zzso zzso one zzso zzso of zzso zzso was reported from several zzso The deletions of zzso zzso and zzso identified each in four families, represented Czech founder zzso The present study indicates that screening for zzso in zzso should include patients from breast or zzso cancer families as well as high-risk patients with zzso cancer, in particular cases with zzso breast or zzso zzso On the contrary, our analyses do not support the need to screen for zzso in the zzso zzso Implementation of zzso zzso could markedly facilitate the design of zzso for amplification and sequence analysis of junction fragments, especially in deletions overlapping gene zzso
