Class II major zzso complex zzso proteins are cell surface zzso that bind peptides and present them to T cells as part of the mechanism for detecting and responding to foreign material in the zzso The zzso activity exhibits zzso preferences for particular zzso at some positions, although the structural basis of these preferences is not understood in zzso We have determined the zzso A crystal structure of the human class II zzso protein zzso in complex with the tight binding zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to discover zzso interactions that are important in determining the binding motif and to investigate zzso constraints on the bound zzso 

The bound zzso adopts a zzso zzso zzso and places several zzso within pockets in the binding zzso Bound water molecules mediate zzso contacts at several zzso A zzso zzso from the beta 2 zzso domain of zzso was found to project into a pocket underneath the zzso domain and may be important in modulating zzso interactions in zzso zzso 

The zzso motif of zzso includes an aromatic zzso at position zzso an zzso zzso at position zzso and a small zzso at position zzso (where the zzso refers to the normal zzso class II zzso these preferences can be understood in light of interactions observed in the zzso zzso zzso of the structure with that of another zzso complex shows that completely different zzso sequences bind in essentially the same zzso and are zzso with only minimal zzso of zzso zzso Small zzso differences that are observed appear to be important in interactions with other zzso
