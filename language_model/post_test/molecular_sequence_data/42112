We have shown previously that in liver, zzso zzso binding to plasma zzso causes a rise in zzso calcium and zzso of zzso Here we show that the calcium zzso pump in liver plasma zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the system being zzso by zzso gamma zzso Also, zzso stimulates zzso zzso in liver plasma zzso in a zzso zzso manner, with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to determine the nature of G zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to both zzso zzso against the zzso of different zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso with zzso alpha blocked zzso zzso of the calcium zzso but they had no effect on zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso alpha zzso antagonized stimulation of zzso breakdown by zzso without affecting zzso zzso of the calcium zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso alpha had no effect on both zzso We conclude that the calcium signal induced by zzso in zzso may be zzso to both an zzso of zzso C and zzso of the calcium zzso both zzso being coupled to the zzso zzso by different G zzso zzso and zzso zzso
