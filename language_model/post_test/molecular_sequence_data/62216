We have cloned a novel zzso acid type A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso zzso contains an alternatively spliced zzso resulting in the addition of 40 zzso acids to the zzso zzso domain between zzso and zzso We show that zzso failed to zzso to the cell surface when it was zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells suppressed zzso zzso binding in a zzso manner by preventing zzso zzso zzso zzso We also generated a zzso zzso with zzso and zzso converted to zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that this zzso has a significantly lower affinity for the zzso and zzso zzso and failed to reach the cell surface when zzso with these zzso Together, our results indicate that zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso constitute a critical zzso When this motif is disrupted by zzso of the alternative zzso access of the zzso zzso to the cell surface is zzso
