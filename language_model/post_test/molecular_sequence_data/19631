zzso factor zzso is a zinc finger protein that has been implicated in regulating the expression of several genes involved in cellular differentiation and embryonic zzso The zinc finger region of zzso zzso factors binds to zzso or zzso elements present in the promoters of a number of male germ cell target genes that are zzso expressed during zzso The zzso and zzso regions of the zzso proteins recruit zzso factors to the zzso zzso complex that are important for zzso zzso zzso in male germ zzso Studies in our laboratory have identified several alternatively spliced transcripts zzso zzso zzso that display stage and zzso expression profiles in zzso germ cells in the zzso zzso of the zzso This review summarizes the expression patterns and functional significance of these zzso zzso factor zzso during zzso
