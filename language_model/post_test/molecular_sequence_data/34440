Combined zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso error of metabolism zzso by zzso of urine zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso Nearly all reported cases are caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso Most patients have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was also described in symptomatic patients with normal zzso activity, suggesting zzso in this zzso 

We identified two zzso with a zzso zzso zzso through the Quebec newborn urine screening zzso While they share the zzso zzso of elevated MA and zzso the zzso zzso was higher than MA, the clinical courses were benign, zzso gene sequencing was normal and zzso activity, measured in one zzso was zzso Using zzso sequencing in the single zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso with unknown zzso and zzso The second zzso was zzso for a different zzso zzso zzso Both zzso were in zzso zzso and were identified in less than zzso of their respective ethnic control zzso 

These results suggest that zzso is a candidate gene for zzso zzso observed in our patients and document the value of zzso sequencing of a limited number of patients for the identification of novel disease zzso
