The zzso zzso approach is widely used in zzso analysis of zzso bacteria zzso which are isolated from environmental samples using the zzso racetrack zzso To evaluate whether the zzso zzso enrichment can truly reflect the diversity of zzso in the targeted environmental sample, zzso diversity studies of zzso enriched from the zzso lake near Beijing were carried out, using both the zzso zzso zzso and a modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in the studied sample using both zzso Comparative studies showed that three clusters of zzso zzso were revealed by the modified zzso zzso approach, while only one of them zzso zzso zzso was detected by the zzso zzso approach from the studied zzso This suggests that the result of zzso zzso enrichment might have been biased by the zzso of zzso zzso It appears that the zzso zzso approach better reflects the original diversity of zzso in the environmental zzso
