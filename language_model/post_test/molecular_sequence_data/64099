The family of human zzso zzso Related zzso zzso currently contains 11 zzso We have identified zzso as a new member of the zzso zzso zzso For many of the zzso family members, primary tumor expression data and function have been zzso However, all of the zzso family proteins share considerable zzso with the Never In zzso gene A zzso zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso as well as its most closely related human zzso zzso are required for zzso progression and promote zzso maturation during zzso We isolated zzso from a primary human colon zzso library, and found it to be highly zzso to zzso zzso Recently, a previously named zzso sequence was renamed zzso in zzso due to its lack of zzso to zzso zzso and its high zzso to zzso zzso Interestingly, in our study, zzso analysis suggests that human zzso and zzso form a zzso within the zzso zzso zzso has high zzso to the zzso family zzso domain as well as to a regulator of zzso zzso domain zzso which is also present in zzso The open reading frame of human zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein with a calculated molecular weight of 75 zzso zzso is differently expressed between normal human breast tissue and breast zzso zzso of a zzso zzso domain zzso in zzso cells led to a decrease in zzso zzso and a small increase in the level of zzso Our data demonstrate for the first time that zzso is a novel tumor associated zzso and shares considerable sequence zzso with the zzso family of protein zzso and may be involved in zzso zzso
