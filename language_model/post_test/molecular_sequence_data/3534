zzso is a basic zzso zzso that is expressed in up to zzso of zzso acute zzso zzso but not in the T zzso We have cloned a complementary DNA, called Human zzso Associated zzso 1 zzso whose zzso zzso zzso level expression is zzso correlated to the zzso zzso level in human zzso zzso zzso The zzso encodes a zzso protein that belongs to a novel family of proteins zzso from plants to humans and characterized by motifs related to, but highly divergent from, the consensus motifs found in zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite these divergent zzso acids at positions involved in zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso activities, we found that zzso specifically binds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso and exhibits intrinsic zzso zzso Among mature zzso cells, zzso is specifically expressed in resting T and B zzso and its expression level tremendously decreased at the protein but not the zzso level during zzso or zzso zzso suggesting a specific role for this new type of zzso during the immune zzso
