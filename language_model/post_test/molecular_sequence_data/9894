Recent zzso evidence indicates that protein zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso signal termination and zzso The zzso chain reaction zzso was used to investigate the expression of zzso and zzso genes in zzso tissue and in isolated zzso zzso zzso from channel zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of cloned zzso zzso products showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso products obtained from isolated zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso beta and zzso delta were expressed in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso product was obtained from isolated zzso zzso that shared zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence identity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene products beta zzso and beta zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso activity, completely inhibited zzso zzso activity in isolated zzso zzso This result suggested that zzso zzso activity is zzso by the zzso zzso beta zzso Taken together, these results are consistent with the conclusion that zzso beta and beta zzso mediate zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso
