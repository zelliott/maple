We have identified a zzso zzso zzso in first zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso By the end of zzso and during early first zzso zzso zzso zzso animals show a marked decrease in zzso zzso resulting from both a reduction in number and rate of zzso zzso zzso of neurotransmitter release, using targeted expression of zzso toxin light chain zzso in the zzso zzso marked by an zzso results in a similar zzso of largely absent or zzso zzso Cloning of the zzso gene identifies a product related to a family of proteins of unknown zzso We show that zzso is associated with zzso indicative of it being a zzso zzso and that during zzso and early zzso development is restricted to the nervous system in a subset of zzso The zzso marks a cellular component of the zzso that is seemingly required to regulate zzso zzso
