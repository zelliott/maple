We describe here the use of zzso substitution zzso in the zzso disease zzso plaque zzso zzso to probe zzso zzso structure and zzso In one approach, zzso zzso were grown from zzso zzso peptides under reducing conditions and then challenged with an zzso agent to probe zzso accessibility of different zzso in the zzso In another approach, zzso zzso zzso either in the zzso form or modified with zzso acid or zzso zzso were grown into zzso zzso and the equilibrium position at the end of the zzso formation reaction was zzso by determining the concentration of zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso zzso obtained were then compared in order to provide information on the environment of each zzso side chain in the zzso In general, zzso zzso in the N and C zzso of zzso were not only accessible to zzso in the zzso state but also, when modified in the zzso state, did not greatly impact zzso zzso these observations were consistent with previous indications that these portions of the zzso are not part of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso were not only zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso state, but their modification with the zzso charged zzso group in zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso confirming other data showing that these segments are likely packed into a zzso zzso zzso zzso 20, 30, and 35, zzso these implicated zzso regions, are accessible to zzso in the zzso indicating a location in zzso exposed zzso
