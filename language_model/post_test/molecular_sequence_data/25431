Avian liver zzso zzso zzso A zzso contains seven zzso per 53 zzso zzso zzso that harbor these zzso can be mapped by zzso zzso separation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Native zzso is zzso by a variety of zzso that target zzso zzso Of particular interest is the zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso copper zzso that target zzso zzso The identity of the zzso which are modified by these zzso can be determined by zzso mapping after zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso While the extent of reaction of any particular zzso zzso depends on the identity of the zzso zzso three of the zzso seven zzso zzso are frequently modified upon zzso of the zzso The peptides which contain these zzso zzso have been isolated and their sequences have been determined by zzso degradation zzso zzso of these sequences with the deduced primary structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates strong zzso These zzso allow assignment of the zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso The sensitivity of these zzso to zzso that target zzso zzso coupled with the fact that zzso is the zzso involved in formation of the zzso intermediate zzso et zzso (1988) zzso 27, zzso suggests that these three zzso may be closely juxtaposed within the zzso zzso zzso
