Recent studies have provided evidence to zzso involvement of the core zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso in adherence to host zzso To better understand the role played by zzso in the zzso of this zzso the aim of the present study was to clone and characterize genes involved in core zzso The zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are structurally very zzso both contain two main chain zzso of zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso By zzso a zzso zzso zzso library into zzso zzso and zzso (formerly known as zzso and zzso zzso zzso we were able to isolate the zzso zzso I and II genes of zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso which restored smooth zzso production in the zzso zzso were zzso Similarly, zzso zzso was able to complement the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the DNA insert of zzso revealed one open reading frame zzso which could code for a protein of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the deduced protein exhibited zzso identity with the sequence of the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained one zzso capable of zzso a zzso zzso The sequence of the predicted protein was zzso identical to the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by the zzso system confirmed that a zzso protein was zzso by zzso and a zzso protein was zzso by zzso zzso gel zzso was used to determine the map locations of the cloned zzso and zzso zzso which were found to lie between zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso zzso Using a zzso strategy, we attempted to generate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Despite multiple attempts to isolate true knockout zzso all zzso were identified as zzso
