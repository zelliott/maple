zzso an zzso toxin obtained from the zzso zzso plant is extremely toxic and a potential zzso zzso zzso date there is no antidote or vaccine available against this zzso The only known zzso zzso zzso against zzso namely zzso has been shown to rescue the toxicity of zzso in cells as well as in zzso The present study focuses on mapping the zzso region to understand the mechanism of zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso A chain revealed that the zzso acids zzso of zzso A chain contain the core zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are crucial for binding of the zzso In zzso analysis of the position of the mapped zzso indicated that it is present close to the active site zzso of zzso A zzso Thus, binding of the zzso near the active site blocks the zzso activity of zzso A chain, thereby rescuing zzso of protein synthesis by the toxin in zzso At zzso zzso concentration of zzso the zzso zzso rescued cells from zzso zzso of protein synthesis but did not prevent cell attachment of zzso Further, zzso of the zzso bound to zzso was observed in cells by zzso zzso This is a novel finding which suggests that the zzso might function zzso and possibly explains the rescue of zzso toxicity by the zzso in whole cells and zzso To our knowledge, this study is the first report on a zzso zzso for zzso and provides zzso insights into the poorly understood mode of action of zzso chain zzso against several toxins including zzso
