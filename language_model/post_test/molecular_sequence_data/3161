zzso of the zzso zzso channel zzso has been suggested to play a role in its zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso the zzso zzso of the beta and gamma zzso zzso their interactions with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso channel zzso Three protein zzso which zzso the zzso zzso of beta and zzso have been identified by an in zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the immediate vicinity of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso has also been demonstrated in zzso in channels expressed in zzso zzso and mutating zzso and zzso into zzso increased the channel activity by zzso zzso of the above zzso on interactions between zzso and zzso have been studied using surface zzso zzso zzso having zzso at positions zzso or zzso bind the WW zzso of zzso two to three times better than the zzso zzso due to higher association rate zzso Using a number of different approaches it was demonstrated that the protein zzso acting on zzso and zzso is the zzso regulated zzso zzso It is suggested that an zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso the channel by zzso its interaction with zzso
