zzso is one of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We previously cloned the zzso zzso zzso This study determines the structure of zzso zzso gene zzso and its expression during mouse embryonic zzso The mouse zzso gene was isolated from a bacterial artificial zzso mouse zzso DNA library and characterized by zzso chain reaction and Southern zzso The zzso gene spans zzso zzso pairs of mouse zzso The gene consists of three zzso and two zzso zzso 1 constitutes 88 bases zzso of untranslated zzso zzso 2 is zzso b and contains most of the coding sequence of zzso zzso and zzso 3 has 152 b of coding sequence and zzso b of 3' zzso zzso The mouse zzso gene has a zzso element, a zzso zzso box, which locates 27 b zzso from the zzso initiation zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso indicate that in early stages of embryonic development, day 7 post coitus the zzso expresses little or no zzso zzso different levels of zzso zzso can be detected in various organ systems, such as cornea zzso zzso cartilage, heart, zzso and zzso The cornea and heart are the two zzso that have the highest expression in zzso zzso studies found that zzso core proteins became abundant in the cornea and zzso by zzso day 10 but that zzso zzso could not be detected until after the eyes zzso These results indicate that zzso is widely distributed in most zzso zzso zzso The modification of zzso with zzso zzso in cornea is concurrent with eye opening and may contribute to zzso zzso
