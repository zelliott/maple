The zzso zzso is essential for the initiation of DNA replication in zzso Two regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso and zzso In this study we determined the expression pattern of zzso and zzso and examined their involvement in DNA zzso We show that zzso expression is restricted to zzso and early zzso whereas zzso is expressed throughout zzso zzso from zzso egg extracts indicated that both proteins are only found in complexes with zzso and there is a zzso zzso excess of the zzso over zzso zzso Both complexes exhibit zzso activity and are zzso zzso during the cell zzso zzso of the zzso from egg extracts inhibited DNA zzso whereas depletion of zzso had little zzso zzso binding studies indicated that zzso is required for zzso complex zzso but not their zzso zzso complexes bound to the zzso in two steps: the first step was independent of zzso complex assembly and the second step was dependent on zzso complex zzso By contrast, binding of zzso complexes was entirely dependent on zzso complex zzso Finally, we present evidence that the association of the two complexes on the zzso is not regulated by zzso checkpoint pathways that result from DNA replication zzso These data suggest that zzso but not zzso complexes support the initiation of DNA replication in zzso egg extracts and during early embryonic zzso
