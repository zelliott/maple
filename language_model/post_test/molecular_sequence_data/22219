Alternative zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso mutually exclusive zzso zzso and zzso results in highly zzso expression of functionally distinct zzso zzso and zzso We previously identified an zzso zzso zzso that enhanced zzso zzso zzso and silenced zzso zzso zzso Here, we have performed comprehensive zzso analysis to define critical sequence motifs within this element that independently either enhance zzso of upstream zzso or repress zzso of downstream zzso Such analysis included use of a novel zzso zzso reporter zzso that allowed quantitative determination of relative functional activity of zzso zzso using flow zzso analysis of live zzso We determined that specific sequences within this element that mediate zzso enhancement also mediate zzso repression, depending on their position relative to a regulated zzso Thus, factors that bind the element are likely to be zzso involved in zzso both aspects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent upon a zzso zzso sequence containing a zzso zzso zzso Previous studies of zzso zzso zzso in zzso nuclear extracts demonstrated that this zzso zzso primarily impaired the second step of zzso suggesting that zzso may block zzso zzso inclusion at this zzso However, results presented here that include use of newly developed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso using extracts from a cell line expressing zzso strongly suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso occurs at or prior to the first step of zzso
