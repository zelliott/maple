zzso selectivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of rice zzso zzso zzso was explored in a comparative study of zzso from seven plant zzso In zzso labeling of zzso carrier protein zzso with zzso or zzso showed that zzso from zzso plants, such as rice that uses either zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso as zzso donor at comparable rates, displays lower selectivity than the zzso from zzso plants, such as spinach, which zzso uses zzso acid zzso rather than zzso acid zzso as an zzso zzso This may be a result of the size and character of the zzso pocket of zzso zzso modeling and protein zzso sequence alignment of zzso revealed that proteins from either zzso or zzso plants shared a highly zzso domain containing the proposed zzso zzso However, the aligned zzso surrounding the zzso pocket are highly zzso and may have an influence mainly on the size of the zzso binding pockets of zzso The zzso selectivity of zzso of rice can be improved by enlarging the zzso pocket using molecular biological zzso
