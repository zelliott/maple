In order to explore the potential of DNA zzso to serve as a zzso of zzso thus establishing a link between exposure to environmental zzso and zzso significant changes in gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso patterns in the promoter regions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes of Japanese zzso zzso zzso were zzso Adult male and female zzso were exposed to either 0 or 500 zzso 17 zzso zzso for zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso and brains were removed and zzso DNA was zzso zzso of zzso DNA were then analyzed by zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso of an approximately zzso region containing suspected zzso sites from the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein content in exposed zzso was significantly induced in all male and female zzso compared to zzso zzso activity in exposed zzso was significantly increased in the male brain, zzso and female brain as compared to zzso The zzso changes described by these studies indicate the potential for anthropogenic zzso of the mechanisms controlling gene zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso While zzso differences were not paralleled by changes in protein expression in this study, changes in zzso have the potential to impact the regulation of normal gene expression and these changes could be transmitted to zzso
