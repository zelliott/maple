zzso is a zzso protein which binds to DNA that is zzso at zzso In zzso zzso in mouse cells has shown that the protein is most concentrated in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may play a role in the formation of zzso zzso Here we have isolated a minimal zzso binding domain zzso from zzso zzso is 85 zzso acids in zzso and binds exclusively to DNA that contains one or more zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso affinity for DNA, confirming that zzso and zzso specific binding zzso of zzso are zzso In zzso zzso indicates that zzso binding can protect a 12 zzso region surrounding a zzso pair, with an approximate zzso constant of zzso zzso
