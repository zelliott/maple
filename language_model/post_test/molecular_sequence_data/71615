The complete zzso acid sequence of the fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso has been delineated on the basis of protein sequencing of the intact protein and its zzso zzso The resulting zzso sequence shows a zzso side chain attached at zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to form a small zzso zzso On the basis of the sequence of zzso a computer search in the sequence database yielded zzso and zzso zzso identities with the sequences of zzso zzso zzso C1 and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and very little similarity to those of several known zzso zzso zzso zzso alignment of the three similar zzso reveals that the single small zzso loop is unchanged but the zzso attachment in zzso is absent from the other two zzso zzso also shows a highly zzso region zzso zzso zzso which is assigned as one of the essential zzso in the active zzso The zzso zzso zzso was amplified by using reverse zzso zzso with zzso zzso based on its zzso acid zzso zzso specific zzso were zzso for use in the 3' and zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso products led to the deduction of a zzso zzso zzso sequence for zzso The zzso contains an open reading frame of 320 zzso acid zzso including a zzso putative signal zzso and the zzso mature zzso Finally, the zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli strain zzso in which the zzso zzso after zzso with zzso and zzso showed both zzso and zzso zzso The assignment of zzso to the active site was further supported by evidence that the zzso protein zzso zzso in which zzso was replaced by Ala, was not able to degrade DNA or zzso
