zzso encodes a zzso zzso factor whose zzso are responsible for the zzso zzso syndrome zzso involving zzso abnormalities often associated with premature zzso failure zzso 

We describe a zzso zzso zzso in a case of zzso without zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was normal but its zzso capacity tested on two reporter zzso one of which should be relevant to the zzso was significantly lower than that of normal zzso However, zzso was able to activate strongly a reporter construct driven by the promoter of zzso zzso related 2 zzso zzso which we have suggested to be a crucial target of zzso in the zzso zzso This is compatible with the absence of zzso in our zzso 

Our data provide evidence in zzso of the implication of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and confirm the regulatory interaction between zzso and zzso whose zzso might contribute to the zzso abnormalities observed in zzso zzso
