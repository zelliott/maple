zzso gastrointestinal zzso tumor zzso is a rare zzso dominant genetic disorder associated with zzso zzso zzso In sporadic forms of the disease, zzso zzso target either zzso or zzso zzso In a zzso in which 5 individuals had zzso no zzso zzso in zzso coding sequence has been zzso We hypothesized that the zzso gene could be a zzso gene in familial zzso We zzso zzso zzso 12 and 18 because several zzso zzso were identified within this zzso We detected a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in a zzso substitution for the highly zzso zzso acid at zzso zzso This zzso showed perfect zzso with the zzso zzso among the 7 family members zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso is zzso to zzso zzso which is located in the zzso zzso zzso II zzso In a previous study, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in a Japanese zzso in which 6 individuals had zzso zzso of a zzso complementary DNA in nude mice was found to be zzso confirming the zzso potential of this zzso The present study shows that zzso is a second familial zzso zzso zzso These results indicate a further example of involvement of structurally related genes in familial cancer zzso
