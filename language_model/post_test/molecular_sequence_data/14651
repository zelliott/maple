zzso body conversion, a complex process essential for zzso involves the progressive addition of specific proteins to zzso zzso zzso is a zzso domain protein first described as interacting with zzso and involved in zzso zzso zzso We found that, in zzso zzso zzso was exclusively expressed in cells that require functional zzso bodies, zzso sensory zzso and male germ zzso zzso was associated with the zzso body transition zone zzso in these two cell zzso zzso of zzso led to defects in sensory zzso and in zzso Loss of zzso resulted in altered zzso trafficking into zzso zzso irregular deposition of proteins on zzso zzso bodies, and, consequently, distorted zzso zzso zzso zzso flies did not show zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso is essential for normal zzso body structure and function in zzso potentially through effects on the zzso The function of zzso in zzso signaling in zzso has either been acquired during zzso evolution or lost in zzso
