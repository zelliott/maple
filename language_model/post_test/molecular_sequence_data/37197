It has been well established that zzso is an important reaction for the regulation of protein zzso In the zzso domain of the zzso of pig gastric zzso zzso sequential zzso occurs at zzso 10 and zzso zzso In this study, we determined the structure of the zzso involving the zzso from zzso 2 to zzso 34 of pig gastric zzso and investigated the zzso zzso zzso change using CD and zzso zzso The solution structure showed that the zzso zzso has a zzso zzso and the zzso adopted two zzso in 50% zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso has a high zzso propensity under zzso zzso Furthermore, the CD and zzso data suggested that the structure of the zzso zzso becomes more zzso as a result of zzso of zzso zzso This zzso change induced by the zzso of zzso 10 might be an advantageous reaction for sequential zzso and may be important for regulating the function of zzso
