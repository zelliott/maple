zzso C virus zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso Despite the overall sequence diversity among individual zzso zzso the zzso 98 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which constitute part of the zzso region zzso are highly zzso This zzso region may contain the zzso signals for zzso replication involving possibly both viral and cellular zzso We carried out zzso zzso studies, which revealed that this zzso region contains three zzso but may also assume alternative zzso We further performed zzso zzso experiments to detect cellular proteins that bound to this zzso A zzso cellular protein zzso was zzso Its binding site was mapped to the zzso 2 and 3, which are the most zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that both stem structures and specific zzso sequence within the two zzso are important for zzso zzso zzso that disrupted stem structures abolished protein zzso while the zzso zzso restored its zzso This region also contains partial sequence similarity to the reported consensus binding sequence for zzso zzso protein zzso (a zzso zzso The zzso protein could be zzso with the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso with the same binding specificity as zzso establishing that this protein is zzso However, the reported zzso sequence was not zzso but rather the entire zzso 2 and 3 were required, for zzso zzso thus, its binding specificity is significantly different from the reported zzso sequence zzso This protein was detected in both the zzso and zzso of most zzso cell lines tested and human primary zzso zzso may participate in the regulation of zzso zzso synthesis or zzso
