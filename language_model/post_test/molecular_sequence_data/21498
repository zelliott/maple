The lack of a rapid and efficient system to regulate zzso induction in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is currently a limitation of this model zzso The commonly used zzso promoter has excellent dynamic range and a low zzso transcription, but takes zzso hours to induce upon zzso zzso zzso other induction systems have rapid response times, but suffer from a limited dynamic range and/or relatively high levels of zzso zzso Recently, the zzso gene was identified as a rapidly induced transcript, responding to zzso addition in zzso zzso and exhibiting low zzso zzso and high dynamic zzso However, attempts to reproduce this zzso result in a significant increase in zzso transcription, severely limiting zzso To overcome this, we have adapted the zzso zzso cassette exchange zzso system to facilitate easy zzso of sequences at the zzso zzso We show that the zzso induction zzso are maintained when zzso open reading frames zzso replace the native zzso zzso As proof of principle, we zzso zzso expression in cells zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After 60 zzso induction we observe clear zzso breaks, demonstrate zzso of cells are committed to zzso and show that the zzso repair protein associates robustly with sequences adjacent to the zzso This zzso system will be a valuable tool for future studies in zzso zzso
