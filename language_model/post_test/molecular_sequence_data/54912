A clone zzso expressing a new zzso gene was isolated from a zzso library of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest zzso The DNA insert of zzso was fully zzso and 38 zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso + C content and gene organization with zzso bacterial zzso suggested that the zzso DNA insert belongs to an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso domain analysis and zzso by zzso zzso showed that the protein zzso by zzso was responsible for the zzso activity and was named zzso The zzso zzso zzso was capable of zzso a broad range of zzso showing the highest activity against zzso zzso zzso The zzso was active over a pH range of zzso and was insensitive to zzso zzso zzso is moderately zzso with optimum temperature between 50 and 60 zzso and was zzso activated zzso activity zzso after 1 h incubation at 50 zzso zzso analysis suggested that the zzso is a member of family I of bacterial zzso and clusters with other moderately zzso zzso of this zzso Comparisons of the DNA insert of zzso zzso with other zzso zzso and sequence database suggest that zzso gene has a zzso origin and was acquired by horizontal zzso
