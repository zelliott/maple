The zzso zzso factor regulates the differentiation of immature zzso zzso and zzso cells, although only the latter cells become transformed by the zzso zzso These are also the only cells that express the zzso gene zzso suggesting that zzso requires zzso cooperating factors to activate such zzso Here, we investigated the zzso regulation of the zzso promoter and found that it not only contains binding sites for zzso but also for zzso a zzso zzso factor that probably zzso to zzso zzso zzso Both types of binding sites were found to be required for full activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proteins in zzso cells or zzso was sufficient to induce zzso markers of zzso zzso like the zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso proteins act as a zzso zzso signal that regulates the expression of zzso zzso even in zzso cell zzso
