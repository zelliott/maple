In this study, we have investigated the effects of zzso and zzso on the growth and differentiation of zzso T cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells expressed higher levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso than zzso T cells from the same source, whereas zzso T cells expressed more zzso and zzso zzso zzso T cells were cultured for 6 days with zzso zzso and zzso and their ability to zzso to express zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and to zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso could act as a growth factor for zzso T cells during primary zzso but inhibited proliferation of the zzso zzso zzso T zzso The highest levels of zzso for zzso and zzso were detected in control cultures in which little zzso for zzso zzso or zzso was zzso zzso of zzso to the primary cultures reduced the capacity of the zzso cells to express zzso for zzso and for zzso but enhanced expression of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso of zzso to the cultures, alone or in conjunction with zzso or addition of zzso zzso zzso had little zzso However, in conjunction with zzso zzso enhanced expression of zzso for zzso and for zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso regulate the differentiation of zzso T cells and the growth of zzso and other types of zzso T cells, and suggest pathways through which zzso T cells may interact with other immune zzso
