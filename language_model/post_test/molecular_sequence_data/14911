T zzso zzso requires a combination of signals, one of which is provided by interaction between zzso and its zzso on zzso presenting zzso Although zzso sequences have been identified in a few zzso the function of fish zzso is virtually zzso In this study, we cloned and analyzed a zzso zzso zzso from zzso tongue sole zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso contains 229 zzso and shares zzso overall sequence identities with known fish zzso zzso zzso possesses structural features zzso in zzso and zzso zzso which include the zzso motif in the zzso zzso domain and the zzso motif in the zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso zzso and composed of four zzso and three zzso which in organization resemble those of zzso and trout zzso zzso real time zzso analysis showed that zzso expression occurred predominately in zzso zzso gut, and zzso zzso is localized on the surface of head kidney zzso and zzso zzso of zzso induced significant levels of cellular zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso is similar to zzso zzso in genetic and protein structures and possibly plays a role in T cell zzso
