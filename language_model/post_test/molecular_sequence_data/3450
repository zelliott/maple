zzso responses to zzso zzso are often dampened by a zzso state of immune zzso Previous work has attempted to overcome zzso zzso zzso by the direct injection of zzso carrying the genes zzso one of a variety of zzso We zzso that the zzso stimulation of T cells, preferably through the zzso complex, would result in a cascade of zzso associated with zzso zzso and would be best able to overcome zzso zzso Here we use the highly attenuated zzso zzso to express on tumor cells, in zzso and in zzso either of three zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso Using this system, we have expressed zzso specific for the zzso zzso chain zzso zzso zzso complex zzso and V beta 7 chain zzso zzso cells bristling with these zzso are capable of inducing zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso When injected into growing tumors zzso zzso and zzso these zzso induce the zzso of immune zzso cells and result in the rejection of the zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso reveal that the injection of zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso complex attracts and activates zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This approach represents a novel strategy to overcome zzso zzso in tumors and allow the stimulation of zzso T zzso
