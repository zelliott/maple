zzso is a novel zzso zzso protein that zzso zzso and zzso zzso filaments and regulates zzso zzso Here, we dissected the structure and function of zzso by structural and zzso zzso We show that zzso is composed of an zzso domain, two zzso zzso zzso and a fused zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We determined crystal structures for the zzso and zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso resolution, zzso The zzso domain adopts an zzso zzso hairpin that further zzso into a zzso zzso The zzso domain also mediates zzso At least one of the coiled coils is required for zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso The key zzso required for zzso binding were zzso The zzso domain lacks a zzso basic zzso pocket but can bind zzso to zzso zzso via a basic surface patch, zzso the involvement of zzso signaling in zzso zzso Our results provide novel insights into the functional organization of zzso
