The zzso for two zzso resistance mechanisms, zzso and zzso are separated by approximately 3,300 zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Garvey, zzso Fitzgerald, and zzso Hill, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the intervening region led to the identification of two open reading frames zzso which are transcribed in the opposite direction to the Abi zzso One of these zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of a zzso zzso located to a zzso The second zzso zzso shares zzso with the zzso gene of the zzso zzso Analysis of a number of zzso strains confirmed the presence of zzso sequences in at least two other zzso zzso The proximity of the zzso and zzso zzso suggested a possible role in the phase resistance zzso by the Abi zzso However, no evidence was obtained to demonstrate a function for either zzso in the expression of either zzso or zzso Nor could the zzso gene restore resistance to zzso in a zzso zzso strain, zzso Interestingly, it was shown that the zzso zzso zzso is necessary for complete expression of the zzso zzso confirming a role for zzso in this zzso infection zzso
