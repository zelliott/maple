We have isolated and characterized a novel zinc finger gene by screening a human zzso zzso zzso The isolated zzso termed zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed 9 sets of zzso zinc finger structures and zzso regions in several zzso zzso exhibited ubiquitous expression in all fetal and adult zzso zzso The transcript size was zzso zzso in adult zzso while the main transcript size in the zzso stage was zzso zzso The transcript size is zzso zzso When the zzso cloned with green fluorescent protein zzso zzso was expressed in zzso and zzso cells, strong zzso zzso were observed only in the nucleus of both cells by zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may be related to the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso structure analysis mapped zzso to zzso zzso between markers zzso and zzso because a sequence zzso site mapped to the locus was found in the zzso region of the zzso zzso
