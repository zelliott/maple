We have determined the crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso zzso is a protein of unknown function with over 170 zzso found in zzso and zzso To zzso the molecular function of zzso its crystal structure at zzso A resolution was determined and a series of zzso screens for zzso activity was zzso The crystal structure shows that zzso has two zzso a small alpha domain and a putative zzso domain formed by a zzso structure of two zzso flanked by five zzso on both zzso The small alpha domain interacts with other molecules in the zzso unit and contributes to the formation of zzso The structural comparison of the putative zzso domain with known structures suggested its zzso function to be a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso analyses with its zzso also indicated that there is a zzso center at the interface of two zzso formed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso An absolute requirement of metal zzso for activity has been proved by zzso zzso with various zzso metal zzso A panel of general zzso zzso of zzso revealed zzso zzso activity toward model zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso secondary zzso screens with natural zzso demonstrated significant zzso activity toward zzso and zzso activity toward zzso Thus, our structural and zzso studies have identified the zzso function of zzso as a novel zzso and disclosed key zzso zzso involved in metal binding and zzso zzso
