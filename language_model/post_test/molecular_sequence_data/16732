zzso is characterized by focal zzso clusters of mast cells and zzso in the bone zzso and by a zzso acquired zzso Kit zzso zzso The relationship of the occurrence of this zzso to the zzso clusters of mast cells and zzso in bone zzso is zzso We hypothesized that these two unique features of zzso were zzso To explore this hypothesis, laser capture zzso mast cells, B cells, and T cells, from both zzso and zzso areas of bone zzso biopsy zzso from patients with zzso were examined for the zzso zzso in their DNA, using zzso restriction zzso of zzso zzso products amplified from extracts of dissected zzso The zzso zzso was detected in mast cells, B cells, and T cells from zzso but not zzso areas of bone zzso zzso B cells obtained from zzso areas of tissue were also assessed for zzso and were found to at least represent an zzso zzso Thus, mast cells and zzso within focal zzso in the bone zzso of those with zzso are more frequently positive for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, the B cell population is zzso suggesting that zzso proliferation is unlikely to be the basis of zzso
