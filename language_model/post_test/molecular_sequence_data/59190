The first evidence for a plant zzso gene is zzso This gene is found closely linked 400 zzso upstream, and on the complementary zzso of a zzso zzso gene in the zzso nuclear zzso Southern zzso analysis indicates that this zzso is a member of a zzso zzso This gene does not contain any zzso and exhibits classical zzso regulatory elements found in zzso zzso genes (A and B zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso sequences display typical features found in nuclear zzso zzso The deduced mature zzso sequence is almost identical to the sequence of a zzso zzso from wheat zzso The zzso zzso gene is expressed in zzso in zzso and in transgenic zzso as shown by zzso zzso
