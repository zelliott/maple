The human zzso gene zzso zzso at zzso 11 band zzso was identified through the study of the zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso encodes a DEAD box zzso zzso Positive mouse zzso and zzso zzso clones were obtained by screening mouse zzso zzso and zzso libraries with a human zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of an open reading frame from a zzso clone revealed a protein with zzso identity to human zzso All positive mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso clones containing mouse zzso zzso gene zzso zzso were localized by fluorescent in zzso zzso to band B of mouse zzso 9, a region showing zzso linkage zzso to human zzso 11 band zzso Mouse zzso was localized to the region between zzso and zzso by molecular linkage zzso A zzso zzso and a zzso protein were identified as mouse zzso gene products which are similar in size to products of the human zzso zzso as shown by Northern and Western zzso zzso
