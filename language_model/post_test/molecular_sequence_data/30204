As a first step in a molecular dissection of the zzso controlling the determination of zzso cell fates in zzso zzso we have analyzed the gene zzso We show that zzso zzso in this gene specifically prevent the induction of zzso cell lineages and result instead in the expression of zzso cell zzso We isolated a zzso zzso of zzso and used it to clone a zzso region that contains the zzso zzso The location of zzso within this region was determined by identifying a transcript affected by three independent zzso zzso and by zzso the minimal segment of DNA sufficient to rescue the zzso zzso zzso in germ line transformation zzso The predicted zzso protein sequence is not similar to sequences in current data zzso suggesting that zzso defines a novel class of gene involved in the zzso of cell zzso Although our genetic studies indicate that zzso is required specifically for the determination of zzso cell zzso zzso transcripts are present in cells other than zzso precursor zzso This result suggests that zzso may have a general but redundant role in development, functioning in diverse cell lineages to control cell zzso zzso zzso may function specifically in zzso development, in which case zzso activity could be regulated at a zzso level or could have biological consequences only in conjunction with the products of other zzso
