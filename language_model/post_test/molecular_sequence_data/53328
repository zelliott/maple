The zzso major coat protein of the zzso zzso is stored in the inner membrane of the infected cell during the zzso zzso The protein consists of 44 zzso zzso and contains an zzso zzso zzso domain, a zzso domain, and a short basic zzso zzso The mainly zzso zzso protein zzso the membrane once, leaving the zzso in the zzso and the zzso in the zzso A zzso approach was followed to measure which part of the zzso zzso protein is inside or outside the zzso In this approach, the zzso probe zzso zzso was attached to zzso zzso of the zzso coat zzso The labeled zzso coat proteins were zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso model zzso We subsequently studied the zzso characteristics at the different positions in the zzso We measured the local polarity of the environment of the probe, as well as the accessibility of the probe to the zzso zzso zzso The results of this study show a single zzso protein with both the zzso and zzso remaining close to the surface of the zzso A nearly identical result was seen previously for the zzso zzso coat zzso On the basis of a comparison between the results from both studies, we suggest an zzso zzso model for the zzso coat zzso zzso model zzso revealed a higher zzso and zzso efficiency at the zzso zzso Furthermore, from the outside to the inside of the zzso a steeper polarity zzso was measured at the zzso interface as compared to the zzso zzso These results suggest a thinner interface for zzso than for zzso zzso
