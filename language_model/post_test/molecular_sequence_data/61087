zzso cells lack the zzso zzso checkpoint but contain mobile DNA sequences that transpose by a mechanism in part shared with zzso of the zzso zzso signal sequences zzso In this work, zzso zzso and zzso of sequences associated with an zzso zzso zzso zzso element is zzso The structure of this zzso zzso sequence and other dispersed zzso elements suggests that zzso closed zzso structures are not unique to zzso of the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso but rather can be generated by zzso at zzso zzso leading to characteristic inversion and zzso zzso Comparative analysis of zzso events at zzso sequences resembling the zzso zzso zzso may be useful in understanding zzso zzso zzso events in zzso zzso cells or genetic diseases such as zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso checkpoint is zzso
