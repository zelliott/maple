We have identified zzso zzso zzso protein 1) as a new zzso protein with zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso cell cycle regulating zzso factors zzso and zzso The DNA recognition sequence was determined by random zzso selection and confirmed by gel zzso and footprint zzso The consensus binding site of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with an zzso restriction zzso recognition site at its zzso This zzso binding site is similar to zzso and zzso binding sites but shows a clear difference from these elements in one of the central core zzso There are binding sites for zzso in the zzso zzso promoter zzso but they are distinct from the zzso binding sites in zzso and zzso will not bind to zzso or zzso binding zzso The zzso promoter contains several zzso zzso and its expression is induced by heat zzso high zzso zzso stress, DNA damage, and zzso zzso When fused to the zzso zzso domain, zzso acts as zzso zzso defining it as the first zzso in the zzso family and the first potential negative regulator of zzso induced by zzso zzso of zzso results in a zzso zzso lengthening of zzso an increase in cell volume, and a repression of zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso may contribute to the repression of specific transcripts and cause a transient cell cycle delay under stress zzso
