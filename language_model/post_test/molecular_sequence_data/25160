A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in cultured insect cells by using the zzso expression zzso zzso The zzso recovered in the culture zzso was zzso to zzso Its apparent molecular mass zzso zzso estimated by both zzso and molecular zzso was higher than the value zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis indicated that zzso of signal sequence had occurred but the zzso still remained at the N zzso The zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as zzso for the zzso zzso The reaction product formed at pH zzso was isolated and characterized by zzso acid sequence analysis, zzso and zzso It was shown that the zzso zzso had converted the model zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso instead of the zzso product zzso indicating that the zzso widely known as zzso should be called zzso zzso zzso A novel zzso present in the insect cell culture medium and zzso from the expressed zzso could convert the zzso zzso to the zzso product at zzso pH zzso It is concluded that the zzso of zzso peptides is a zzso process zzso by the zzso and the novel zzso
