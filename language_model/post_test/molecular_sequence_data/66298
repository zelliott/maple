Secondary exposure to respiratory zzso virus zzso can lead to zzso and enhanced disease in vaccinated zzso zzso with individual zzso proteins influences the type of secondary zzso immune response that develops upon challenge zzso infection, as well as the extent of zzso zzso memory zzso T cells can directly contribute to zzso through their zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice with a zzso zzso virus zzso expressing the attachment zzso protein of zzso results in pulmonary zzso upon zzso challenge, whereas zzso of mice with a zzso expressing the fusion zzso protein does zzso We analyzed the zzso zzso response to an zzso zzso zzso zzso within the F protein of zzso corresponding to zzso acids 51 to 66 in an effort to better understand the similarities and differences in the immune response zzso by the G versus the F zzso zzso with the G protein zzso a mixture of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells with a restricted zzso zzso zzso In contrast, we demonstrate here that zzso with the F protein elicits a broad repertoire of zzso zzso zzso T cells that predominantly exhibit a zzso zzso However, in the absence of gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells zzso zzso and mice developed pulmonary zzso after zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited decreased weight loss compared to zzso controls, suggesting that zzso zzso systemic zzso These data demonstrate that zzso can have both beneficial and zzso effects during a secondary zzso zzso
