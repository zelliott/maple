To study the molecular mechanism of the differentiation induced by zzso acid zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso we established a new zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells were neither differentiated by a single or a combination of zzso zzso nor by the addition of zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, the combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso cells using zzso zzso showed a zzso pattern which was not restored even by the combination of zzso and zzso whereas the zzso pattern in zzso cells was rapidly restored to the normal speckled pattern by zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso alone or the combination with zzso did not zzso zzso in zzso cells, which was in contrast to zzso zzso The zzso fusion gene and transcript in zzso cells were zzso as well as the zzso gene and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso transcript in zzso cells indicated a Pro zzso to zzso zzso zzso at zzso 900 zzso zzso in zzso domain, while the zzso transcript had a normal zzso These data suggest that differentiation of zzso by zzso is triggered directly through zzso and is associated with its zzso Furthermore, there might be another mechanism of differentiation which does not require the zzso of zzso and the restoration of the zzso zzso
