The zzso zzso 2 zzso belongs to the family of zzso plasma membrane zzso and is localized on the zzso terminals of zzso zzso zzso differs from other family members by its extended zzso zzso zzso We report that zzso of a zzso zzso most likely zzso in spinal zzso zzso or cultured spinal zzso zzso results in partial zzso of zzso zzso sensitive to zzso zzso in zzso are located in the zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso fusion protein with spinal zzso extract in the presence of calcium followed by protein sequence analysis localized the major zzso zzso site after zzso zzso with a second zzso site being situated after zzso zzso Interestingly, the size of the zzso truncated zzso protein zzso zzso is similar to that of most other zzso family members, and truncated zzso displayed full transport activity upon expression in zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso may contribute to the regulation of zzso trafficking and/or function in the zzso plasma zzso
