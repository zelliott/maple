Previously, zzso links have been unveiled almost exclusively by zzso zzso while molecular methods were used only in simple agricultural zzso systems in the form of zzso zzso Here, we present a general method for the molecular detection of these links applied to a complex zzso food web from tropical rainforest of zzso New zzso We DNA zzso zzso zzso and their tissue remnants and matched the sequences to our extensive library of local zzso We were thus able to match zzso of host sequences and zzso of zzso sequences to species and zzso zzso or family in almost all zzso Our analysis affirmed 93 zzso unknown zzso links between 37 host species from a wide range of zzso families and 46 zzso species from zzso and zzso by identifying DNA sequences for both the host and the zzso involved in the zzso zzso detection proved especially useful in cases where distinguishing host species in zzso stage was difficult zzso or when the zzso died during zzso We have even detected a case of extreme zzso specialization in a pair of zzso species that do not differ in zzso zzso and zzso Using the molecular approach outlined here leads to better understanding of zzso host zzso opens new possibilities for rapid surveys of food web structure and allows zzso of species associations not already zzso
