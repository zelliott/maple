In higher plants the promoter elements of pol zzso and pol zzso zzso genes are zzso zzso a zzso zzso box and an upstream sequence element, zzso The zzso and zzso are zzso approximately four and three zzso DNA turns apart in pol II and pol III zzso respectively, and it is this difference in the element spacing that determines the zzso zzso specificity of the zzso In this study we have analyzed the effect of spacing zzso on activity of zzso U2 and zzso genes in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and in zzso transformed zzso In the pol zzso zzso gene the insertions and deletions of either odd or even numbers of half zzso turns completely zzso zzso in zzso zzso consistent with the high conservation of the element spacing found in all plant zzso zzso Surprisingly, while insertions of 50 base pairs zzso or more into the zzso of the pol zzso U2 gene zzso transcription, a deletion of 5 zzso or insertions of as much as 20 zzso decrease zzso by only 40 to zzso This relaxed requirement for the zzso element spacing is only seen in zzso zzso since the same zzso U2 genes are not transcribed in zzso transformed tobacco when zzso takes place from the zzso The results provide some clues about possible factor interactions at the promoters of plant zzso genes and also offer an example of major differences in zzso between zzso and zzso transformed zzso
