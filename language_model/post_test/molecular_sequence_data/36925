All zzso J chain zzso bridges of human zzso the zzso bonds between the J chain and the two zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso bridge were zzso zzso was isolated from zzso of healthy women and zzso with zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso This procedure generated fragments of 140 zzso 60 zzso and 28 zzso The zzso zzso comprised the complete J chain zzso bound to two alpha 1 chain zzso derived from the zzso of two alpha 1 zzso The zzso zzso was zzso with zzso The resulting peptides were zzso by zzso and subsequently characterized by zzso analysis, mass zzso and gas phase zzso These data unequivocally show that the J chain zzso zzso zzso and zzso form zzso chain zzso zzso The second zzso and the third zzso J chain zzso are zzso linked to two alpha chain zzso zzso joining the two zzso zzso of zzso tail to zzso The remaining two alpha chains of the two zzso are directly bound to each other via their ultimate zzso zzso A new model for the J chain in zzso is zzso
