The roles and zzso of DNA sequence and zzso zzso fold structure in determining zzso zzso stability and positioning have been determined and zzso The presence of four tandem copies of zzso in the zzso region of zzso resulted in a DNA zzso with increased affinity zzso of approximately 700 zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso and the dominant, quantitative contribution of the zzso repeats of the zzso zzso to this increased affinity has been zzso The zzso and zzso positioning of zzso zzso assembled on the zzso sequence and on DNA molecules selectively incorporated into zzso zzso by zzso have been zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions were located where the minor and major zzso respectively, zzso faced the zzso zzso core, and identical positioning results were obtained using zzso a closely related zzso zzso also from zzso zzso However, zzso did not have similarly high affinities for the zzso DNA zzso and zzso experiments have shown that this difference in affinity is determined by zzso differences in the zzso region of zzso 3 of the zzso fold, a region that is not expected to directly interact with zzso Rather this region is thought to participate in forming the zzso zzso interface at the center of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso If differences in this interface do result in zzso zzso zzso with different sequence preferences, then the assembly of alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso could provide an unanticipated and novel structural mechanism to regulate gene zzso
