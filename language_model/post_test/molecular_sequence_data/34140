zzso receptors zzso expressed at the cell surface of zzso sensory zzso lining the zzso zzso are the first actors of events leading to odor perception and zzso As for other zzso zzso few dog OR have been zzso mainly because of the absence of good methodology and the difficulties encountered to express zzso at the cell zzso Within this work, our aim was 1) to zzso a large subset of dog OR and 2) to compare the implication of the 2 main zzso namely the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso For this, we used 2 independent tests to assess the importance of each of these 2 pathways and analyzed the responses of 47 canine family 6 zzso to a number of zzso zzso We found these zzso globally capable of inducing zzso calcium zzso through the zzso zzso as confirmed by the use of specific zzso and/or a zzso increase in response to zzso zzso We showed that the implication of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was dependent upon the zzso combination rather than on one or the other zzso Finally, by exposing zzso cells to the 21 possible pairs of zzso zzso zzso we confirmed that some zzso pairs may have an zzso or additive zzso Altogether, these results reinforce the notion that zzso zzso zzso may constitute functional units and call for a more systematic use of 2 complementary tests interrogating the zzso and zzso pathways when zzso zzso
