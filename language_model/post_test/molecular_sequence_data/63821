Recent studies have shown that the cosmopolitan zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of several zzso and genetically distinct zzso To assess whether the separate species have a cosmopolitan distribution, we zzso 184 strains from marine and zzso sites zzso We identified the strains using light and electron zzso and we zzso the zzso region of nuclear zzso zzso All recently described species were genetically zzso and all but two were zzso zzso zzso was found for the only zzso character used to distinguish zzso zzso and zzso zzso which cannot be identified based on zzso zzso Furthermore, multiple genetically distinct zzso which may represent cryptic species, were found within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that all currently recognized species of zzso are zzso however, gaps seem to occur in their geographical zzso For example, some species are found in both the northern and southern temperate latitudes whereas other species appear to have only zzso to tropical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso seem to have more restricted geographical ranges because the former was not found along American coasts and the latter was encountered only in US zzso A zzso update is provided for zzso strains currently available in several culture collections, which could aid reinterpretation of results obtained in comparative studies using these zzso
