The zzso zzso a selective potent inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown by point zzso or by zzso scanning to display two regions essential for zzso the active site zzso in the first loop and zzso in the second zzso The deletion of the zzso zzso bond in the zzso scaffold, zzso zzso II, had no effect on its binding zzso CD zzso zzso studies and structure calculations were carried out on the wild type zzso the weakest analog zzso and zzso II zzso to zzso in order to point out the zzso differences between these zzso Then, an attempt to correlate the zzso data and the affinity results was zzso CD and zzso data were identical for the zzso analog and zzso revealing the crucial functional role of the zzso side zzso On the other hand, the scaffold of the first loop in zzso II was shown by zzso to represent the minimal zzso for the optimal interaction of the toxin with the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso forming property of the 6th zzso zzso in the active site of the zzso can be correlated with its zzso
