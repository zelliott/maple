The zzso stasis of many freshwater crustaceans has resulted in the prior zzso of cosmopolitan species and has been explained by their capacity for long-distance zzso This study examines the zzso of zzso zzso a zzso thought to be widespread in North zzso However, sequence variation of the zzso zzso c zzso zzso I gene indicates that this zzso is composed of two zzso cryptic species, designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is restricted to the east, whereas zzso is broadly distributed across the United States, and is subdivided into four zzso that show weak genetic differentiation over broad geographical areas, which likely reflects recent long-distance zzso The current zzso of the four zzso in zzso can be explained by recent range expansion from different zzso following the last zzso glacial zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso identified in this study do not zzso to lineages detected in a previous zzso zzso However, the latter groups are associated with a habitat shift suggesting that natural selection may have played a role in their zzso The results of this and previous studies illustrate the complicated zzso history of freshwater zzso
