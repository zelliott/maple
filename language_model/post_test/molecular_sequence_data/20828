This review focuses on recent trends in multiple sequence alignment zzso It describes the latest zzso improvements including the extension of zzso methods to the problem of zzso multiple sequence zzso Some results are presented suggesting that zzso methods are significantly more accurate than simpler alternative zzso The validation of existing methods is also discussed at length with the detailed description of recent results and some suggestions for future validation zzso The last part of the review addresses future challenges for multiple sequence alignment methods in the zzso era, most notably the need to cope with very large zzso the need to integrate large amounts of experimental data, the need to accurately align zzso and zzso sequences and finally, the need to integrate many alternative methods and zzso
