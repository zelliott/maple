The dynamics of the zzso of the constituent zzso as well as of the exchange zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with water in a zzso hybrid, zzso ] duplex zzso are reported here in details for the first zzso The exchange zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso hybrid zzso I) have been compared with identical studies on the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This comparative study shows that the zzso zzso o of various zzso in the zzso hybrid zzso varies in the range of approximately 1 zzso and they are quite comparable to those of the shorter zzso duplexes zzso and zzso but very different from the zzso o of the larger duplexes zzso and zzso the zzso o for the base pair of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, while the corresponding zzso o in the zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It has also been shown that the total energy of zzso zzso assessed from the exchange rates of both zzso and zzso zzso representing energetic contributions from both zzso and zzso zzso as well as from the exchange process of the zzso zzso from the open state with the bound water, is close to the zzso of the short zzso duplex zzso approximately zzso zzso
