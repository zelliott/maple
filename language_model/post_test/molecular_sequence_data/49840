zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso were prepared by reaction of the zzso or zzso zzso with the protected zzso on a controlled pore glass zzso zzso with zzso enabled successful isolation and zzso of the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso mobility shift experiments showed that the zzso zzso of complexes formed between an zzso or zzso zzso and complementary zzso or zzso targets zzso and zzso were in the low zzso concentration range at 37 degrees C, whereas no binding was observed for the corresponding zzso zzso even at a concentration of 500 zzso Fluorescence studies suggested that this enhanced affinity is most likely due to the ability of the zzso ring of the zzso or zzso group to stack on the last base pair formed between the zzso and target, thus stabilizing the zzso The binding affinity of a zzso zzso zzso which contained an alternating zzso zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso target, increased zzso times as a consequence of zzso with zzso The zzso group of zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso which zzso readily with zzso and zzso to form stable zzso zzso This feature was used to couple an zzso with zzso a zzso that contains a zzso zzso zzso A simple method was developed to introduce a zzso functionality into peptides that contain a zzso zzso by reacting the zzso with zzso The resulting zzso was then coupled to the zzso This procedure was used to prepare zzso zzso of a zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso having a zzso zzso The combination of the unique zzso of the zzso group and enhanced binding affinity zzso by its zzso ring suggests that zzso may serve as a useful platform for the preparation of novel zzso zzso
