zzso zzso variation in zzso mycoplasma species is considered an important feature of zzso zzso Such zzso protein variation was observed for the interaction of zzso zzso zzso zzso Small zzso the agent of contagious bovine zzso with zzso zzso Colony zzso allows the definition of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which zzso at low zzso zzso of zzso zzso were shown to be surface located, and resided on multiple zzso in the zzso zzso size zzso zzso display and a zzso database were combined to determine the gene zzso the proteins recognized by zzso zzso A gene zzso the putative zzso of the zzso zzso system was zzso Genome sequence analysis of strain zzso revealed two highly similar copies of this zzso resulting from zzso of the zzso region carrying the zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrated the presence of this zzso in almost every African strain tested, but not in European zzso DNA analysis revealed that zzso switching is governed by a base substitution occurring upstream of the coding region for the zzso zzso This event generates a stop zzso that results in the premature termination of the zzso zzso
