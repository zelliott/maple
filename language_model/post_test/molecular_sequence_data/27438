zzso zzso zzso zzso is a common feature of cancer zzso leading to loss of zzso zzso is associated not only with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso but also with zzso zzso of zzso Here we show unique zzso zzso of the zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso that are tightly associated with zzso of the zzso arm in zzso zzso showing zzso zzso The zzso zzso a cellular zzso of zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulates signal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in most zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso were zzso in zzso cells, zzso was shown to functionally and genetically act as a zzso zzso zzso zzso did not have zzso zzso zzso activity, but inhibited that of zzso zzso and zzso (also known as zzso leading to prolonged zzso of zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso showed enhanced sensitivity to a variety of zzso compared to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso further zzso their sensitivities to a broader spectrum of zzso including stem-cell factor zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating the presence of a zzso that could not be attributed to a simple zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso on zzso sensitivity of zzso largely disappeared in a zzso background or by zzso of zzso zzso which suggests the zzso importance of loss of zzso zzso zzso found in most cases of zzso zzso zzso Our findings provide a new insight into a role of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso associated with zzso in the zzso of some zzso cancer zzso
