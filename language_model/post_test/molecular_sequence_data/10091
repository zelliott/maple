zzso oxide is zzso in diverse zzso zzso by a family of zzso zzso oxide zzso The zzso zzso of zzso oxide zzso zzso is targeted to the specialized zzso membrane zzso termed zzso zzso zzso the principal structural protein in zzso interacts with zzso and leads to zzso zzso in a zzso process modulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also interacts with other structurally distinct signaling proteins via a specific region identified within the zzso sequence zzso acids zzso that appears to zzso the role of a zzso zzso We now report that the zzso of zzso with zzso is completely and specifically blocked by an zzso corresponding to the zzso scaffolding zzso zzso corresponding to this domain markedly inhibit zzso oxide zzso activity in zzso zzso and interact directly with the zzso to inhibit activity of zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso scaffolding domain zzso is competitive and completely reversed by zzso These studies establish that zzso via its scaffolding domain, directly forms an zzso complex with zzso and suggest that zzso zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso by zzso
