zzso belongs to a family of zzso zzso that is characterized by zzso WW zzso a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and in most cases an zzso C2 zzso We had previously identified a series of proteins that associates with the WW zzso of zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that one of the zzso zzso zzso belongs to a small group of zzso zzso proteins with three zzso zzso zzso binds zzso WW zzso via the two zzso motifs present in the zzso zzso of the zzso In addition to zzso zzso can interact with the WW zzso of a number of zzso family members and is zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso expression of the protein zzso the structure of the zzso suggesting that zzso forms part of a family of integral zzso membrane zzso Based on previous observations in zzso we propose that zzso may act as an zzso for zzso proteins and their putative targets to control zzso protein sorting and zzso
