Certain zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso starter strains for the manufacture of zzso zzso zzso produce zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis is controlled by the zzso zzso regulatory system and thereby induced at the beginning of the stationary growth zzso We have found a new zzso sequence zzso designated zzso in the zzso gene of a spontaneous zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the first IS discovered in zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso with a predicted zzso of zzso zzso zzso which displays similarity to the zzso of zzso family zzso Southern zzso analyses have identified 6 to 11 copies of zzso among which 6 copies were at the same zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso three commercial starters, and another three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All of the eight spontaneous zzso zzso which were derived from five independent zzso cultures, had a new additional zzso copy in zzso at six different positions within 600 zzso of the zzso zzso The target sites of zzso were determined to be zzso zzso sequences by sequencing the zzso regions of zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso by the zzso zzso in contrast to other zzso members that use the conservative zzso and that most, if not all, of spontaneous zzso zzso appear to have resulted from the zzso of zzso exclusively into zzso The presence of zzso hot spots in zzso which is essential for zzso zzso as well as high zzso activity, would account for the high frequency of spontaneous zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso
