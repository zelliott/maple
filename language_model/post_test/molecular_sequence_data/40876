A particular type of zzso repeat zzso proteins with variable length of the 35 zzso zzso motifs and zzso zzso zzso named the zzso zzso was so far exclusively identified in land zzso Several zzso proteins with such domain extensions zzso zzso zzso were shown to be involved in plant zzso zzso editing but their evolutionary origin had remained zzso We here report the first case of zzso zzso proteins outside of the plant kingdom in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso on horizontal gene transfer in very early land plant zzso
