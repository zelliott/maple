zzso of zzso disease is caused by zzso to human zzso zzso zzso To zzso important zzso zzso in zzso we studied three models of immunity to zzso in zzso 

Mice transgenic for zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso with zzso for zzso domain zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso responses of zzso zzso to zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso responses, serum zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso mice responded to zzso zzso with zzso responses to several zzso which increased in intensity and spread to include more zzso during a zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice developed weak zzso zzso Both types of mice developed zzso zzso measured by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso There was evidence of weak zzso stimulation in one group of zzso zzso of zzso transgenic mice to zzso protein induced a striking response to an zzso with sequence zzso zzso zzso to peptides derived from the zzso sequence (including zzso caused strong responses to the zzso and development of immune responses to several other zzso zzso within the zzso sequence zzso zzso and zzso reacting with zzso This implies that zzso with zzso zzso produced immunity to mouse zzso 

zzso and zzso responses to genetic zzso differ in zzso and zzso transgenic mice, and there is less genetic control of zzso than of zzso zzso During both zzso and zzso zzso zzso there was evidence of zzso spreading during the zzso Several functionally important zzso are zzso especially zzso However, if similar progressive zzso recruitment occurs in human disease, zzso therapy will be difficult to zzso
