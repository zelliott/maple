Loss of zzso a zzso nuclear membrane zzso causes zzso muscular zzso We analyzed 13 zzso zzso and four zzso zzso that do not disrupt zzso stability or zzso We show that zzso binds directly to zzso factor zzso a zzso zzso and that this binding to zzso requires zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso has two distinct functional zzso the zzso at the zzso which mediates binding to zzso and a second functional domain in the central region, which mediates binding to zzso zzso Disease zzso zzso mapped to the zzso domain and disrupted zzso A binding in zzso Two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso mapped outside the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may have additional functional zzso relevant to zzso The zzso zzso proteins all remained active for binding to zzso both in zzso and in zzso suggesting that disease can result from the loss of specific molecular interactions between zzso and either zzso A or putative novel zzso The demonstration that zzso binds directly to zzso coupled to similar results for zzso provides proof in principle that all zzso nuclear proteins can interact with zzso with interesting implications for zzso attachment to the nuclear zzso
