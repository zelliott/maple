We investigated zzso zzso of V2 zzso zzso along the zzso using a specific zzso zzso zzso was observed in some of thick ascending limbs and all of principal and inner zzso collecting duct zzso zzso Not only zzso but also zzso membrane was stained in collecting zzso especially in terminal zzso zzso To learn the functional role of zzso V2 zzso in zzso we studied the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso water zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using isolated zzso rat zzso In the absence of bath zzso zzso zzso caused a small increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirming the presence of V2 zzso in the zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso by zzso in the presence of bath zzso by decreasing zzso zzso via zzso or zzso receptors and by an unknown mechanism via V2 receptors in the zzso membrane of zzso These data show that V2 receptors are localized not only in the zzso membrane but also in the zzso membrane of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acts as a negative feedback system upon the zzso action of zzso in zzso
