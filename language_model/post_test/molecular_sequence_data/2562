zzso of the surface exclusion zzso zzso and zzso of the F zzso of zzso coli K-12 has been analyzed using zzso zzso protection zzso The results show that both genes possess functional promoters in zzso and that a strong zzso termination signal lies immediately downstream of zzso Moreover, the adjacent downstream zzso zzso is expressed from its own promoter and appears not to lie within the major transfer zzso zzso stability experiments indicate that the products of zzso and zzso are translated from a stable zzso zzso We propose that the zzso and zzso promoters serve to supplement the expression of these genes from the major zzso promoter, zzso
