The zinc finger is a protein domain that zzso specific zzso zzso activity on a wide range of functionally important zzso In this paper we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso revealed that the gene expresses a zzso protein zzso by a zzso zzso zzso The protein has an unusual arrangement of 13 zinc fingers into a zzso of 12 tandem fingers and a single isolated finger near the zzso This structural organization is zzso with the probable chicken zzso zzso zzso also contained an additional domain at the zzso which has previously been implicated in the regulation of zzso zzso factor zzso via zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in a wide range of zzso embryonic and adult zzso The structural organization of zzso and its expression profile suggest that it may function as a zzso zzso protein that regulates the expression of specific zzso
