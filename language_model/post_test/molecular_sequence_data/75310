A new approach has been developed for sequencing zzso A radioactive label is attached specifically to the zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso is subjected to varying zzso zzso From the zzso patterns zzso of the zzso appropriate zzso conditions are selected, giving zzso peptides of different lengths which are zzso The zzso peptides are zzso in order of increasing size (from 1 to zzso zzso zzso being zzso until the zzso sequence of zzso zzso is zzso This approach allows the determination of a complete protein sequence with a minimal number of zzso zzso The method was successfully applied to bovine zzso zzso zzso which was completely zzso with only 239 zzso zzso
