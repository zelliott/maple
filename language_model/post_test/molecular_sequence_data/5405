The authors have already described that a series of short zzso zzso after sequences related to human zzso zzso zzso proteins and sharing some common structural features, activate zzso clones through a process involving zzso presentation in zzso zzso Those peptides induce also zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso of zzso present in human peripheral blood zzso cell zzso zzso The release of zzso 2 zzso and zzso gamma zzso by zzso cells present in zzso depleted of zzso or B cells is reported, after incubation in the presence of those zzso zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso The authors found that all the molecules tested needed at least the presence of a type of zzso cell zzso to exert their zzso zzso Some peptides seem to be zzso presented to zzso cells by B cells, while others seem to depend on zzso for this zzso The dependence on one or another zzso seems to be due to differences in the sequences of these zzso The zzso agents studied also gave rise to a clear increase in a zzso activity associated with zzso zzso of zzso That there is a correlation between the release of zzso and this zzso activity when using a complete zzso population, B zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with the peptides tested has been zzso
