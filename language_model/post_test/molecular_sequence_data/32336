A remarkable trend in the evolution of zzso is the occurrence in most zzso of zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso are believed to have given rise to zzso freshwater resident zzso The present work examines the zzso of the European paired species zzso zzso and zzso zzso in an attempt to zzso species pair evolutionary zzso We studied sequence variation in zzso b and zzso 6, 8 zzso genes in 63 individuals from 21 localities of the paired species throughout their distribution zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso analyses were largely consistent, suggesting the existence of three major evolutionary zzso lineage I and possibly lineage II are widespread throughout Europe, while the most ancestral lineage III is apparently restricted to the zzso zzso The high genetic diversity observed in the zzso Peninsula is probably the result of zzso persistence and subsequent zzso of variation over several ice ages, whereas the low levels of genetic diversity observed in central and northern Europe should reflect a rapid zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso originated within at least two distinct evolutionary zzso rejecting the single origin zzso The observed lack of zzso zzso within lineage I may be the result of ongoing gene flow if the two zzso are alternate zzso forms of a single zzso However, structure within lineage I is also consistent with the hypothesis of divergence of zzso after zzso zzso zzso 2000 generations zzso with incomplete lineage zzso Further testing of the alternative hypotheses is zzso
