The structural organization of small peptides zzso the zzso acid sequence of the common zzso precursor around the zzso zzso locus was investigated by a combination of zzso zzso In water both circular zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicated that these peptides adopted a random zzso Evidence for folded structures was obtained when these compounds were placed in a zzso environment zzso 40 zzso zzso in zzso buffer or zzso Whereas the CD zzso indicated the formation of various types of zzso in rapid zzso zzso of zzso temperature zzso and Nuclear zzso zzso by 400 and 500 zzso zzso revealed the existence of contacts and of a folded zzso These observations are discussed in relation with previous hypothesis made on the secondary structure organization of the zzso processing site of zzso hormone zzso
