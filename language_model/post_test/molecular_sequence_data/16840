We isolated a zzso zzso which is impaired in zzso induction of expression of the major zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso activity and has severe growth defects on zzso and zzso carbon sources, indicating that zzso zzso has a single zzso zzso In addition to zzso the zzso of several zzso genes was also strongly reduced in the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso in zzso expression was observed in other zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso it seems that the zzso and a functional zzso flux are necessary for induction of expression of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
