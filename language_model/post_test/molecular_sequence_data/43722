The gene for a male zzso zzso zzso in four sibling species of the zzso zzso zzso has previously been shown to have a zzso rate zzso of zzso substitution that is indistinguishable from the synonymous rate zzso By examining this gene in two other species of this zzso we found that zzso is generally large and can sometimes be more than twice as large as zzso This suggests that positive selection may be operating at this locus of male zzso
