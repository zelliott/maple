zzso the region of difference between the virulent strains of zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso zzso is the most explored region in terms of zzso zzso and vaccine zzso This study found a zzso zzso region between two zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a 53 zzso repeat element that created a zzso among the clinical zzso reported previously as the zzso zzso repetitive unit zzso 39 zzso The zzso power of this locus was found to be high for zzso zzso as indicated by a zzso diversity index value of zzso and low for Beijing zzso and zzso zzso zzso The presence and zzso of zzso 39 in the zzso region led us to investigate the functional role of the repeat element by measuring the zzso levels of the downstream genes zzso and zzso by quantitative zzso among the different zzso of clinical zzso Higher zzso levels of zzso were observed in strains with four copies of the repeat element in the upstream region, whereas the zzso level of zzso was higher in strains with six copies of the repeat zzso These data suggest that changes in zzso levels resulting from zzso of different copy numbers of the repeat element may affect regulation of gene expression in zzso zzso
