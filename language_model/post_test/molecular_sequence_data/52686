The cloning and characterization of zzso a zzso protein representing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso A zzso zzso zzso expression library was screened with zzso zzso zzso on an zzso 66 zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the resulting zzso clones revealed that zzso belongs to the zzso protein family and represents zzso of zzso zzso The key structural features and sequence motifs of the zzso were all zzso By zzso we demonstrated that the native protein is zzso Northern and Southern zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed and zzso by a single or low copy number zzso A zzso zzso zzso was expressed as zzso protein in zzso zzso By overlay with zzso it was demonstrated that the native and zzso proteins bind zzso Using zzso with zzso zzso a zzso pattern was observed which points towards a putative zzso of zzso in the nuclear membrane and zzso zzso zzso of a structurally zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates the very early evolutionary origin of the machinery for quality control of protein folding in the zzso zzso and the molecules involved zzso
