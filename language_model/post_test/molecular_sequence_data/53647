Cell zzso expression of the human zzso collagen zzso gene depends on a zzso element that consists of two zzso protein binding sites zzso and zzso located between zzso zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start zzso The present study focused on the characterization of the zzso zzso DNA binding zzso and cell zzso experiments revealed that the zzso core sequence of zzso zzso binds the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and this in turn leads to promoter zzso In the presence of all three nuclear factors, cooperative interactions between zzso zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso result in binding of the zzso to zzso in zzso Similarly, zzso of different combinations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the composition of the zzso complex zzso from zzso cells, the zzso complex from zzso cells contains zzso and zzso but lacks zzso However, zzso zzso introduced into zzso cells cannot stimulate zzso zzso unless zzso with zzso Within the intrinsic limitations of the experimental model, our results indicate that zzso interactions among zzso and zzso or zzso proteins are involved in regulating zzso production of collagen zzso
