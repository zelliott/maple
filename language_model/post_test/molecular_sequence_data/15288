Reliable molecular typing tools are required for a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of zzso zzso The genes zzso and zzso are highly zzso and have been used as markers in many zzso zzso population zzso These markers were used to assess the genetic diversity of zzso zzso strains from French zzso (South zzso and to develop a molecular typing zzso 

A total of 120 blood samples from 109 patients (including 10 patients suffered from more than one malaria episode, samples were collected during each zzso with zzso zzso infection were zzso All samples were zzso by zzso zzso and zzso gene sequencing was performed on 57 zzso zzso protocol applied to distinguish between new infection or zzso from zzso zzso and treatment failure or zzso from zzso zzso was based on zzso first zzso by zzso and zzso only if the zzso of the two samples are zzso on sequencing the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of three sizes were amplified by zzso types A, B and zzso Eleven different zzso were identified among the 109 samples zzso by zzso zzso In zzso of cases, a mixed zzso infection was zzso The sequence of zzso gene revealed 22 unique zzso and zzso of cases with mixed zzso In the 57 samples zzso by both methods, 45 zzso were found and zzso were zzso Among ten patients with two or three malaria episodes, the protocol allowed to identify five new infections or relapses from zzso zzso and six treatment failures of relapses from zzso zzso 

The study showed a high diversity of zzso and zzso genetic markers among zzso zzso strains in French zzso with a low zzso infection zzso These results indicated that the zzso zzso zzso protocol presented has a good discrimination power and can be used in clinical drug trials or zzso zzso
