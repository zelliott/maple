zzso clocks allow organisms to predict environmental changes of the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso clock machinery, the zzso level and zzso activity of the clock protein zzso zzso with a period of approximately zzso The time information is transmitted from zzso to the zzso zzso zzso through the zzso zzso activity of zzso ultimately resulting in zzso zzso zzso Here, we showed that zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has the domain structure of an zzso zzso zzso and that its zzso domain, which contains a zzso site at zzso is responsible for the zzso activity and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso associate through their zzso zzso with an affinity that depends on their zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso activity of zzso requires the zzso zzso zzso site and depends on its zzso zzso We show that the zzso activity of zzso is essential for the generation of normal zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso simulations suggest that zzso time information zzso zzso zzso is released mainly by zzso zzso during the late zzso zzso
