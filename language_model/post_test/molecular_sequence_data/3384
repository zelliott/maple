zzso carrier protein zzso of zzso coli is a small zzso protein which functions as carrier of growing zzso chains during their zzso and as donor of zzso chains during transfer to target zzso This unique zzso of zzso coli is expressed zzso In more complex bacteria, multiple zzso are present, indicating a channeling of pools of zzso units into different zzso zzso In zzso for example, besides the zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso and transfer of common fatty zzso three specialized zzso have been reported: zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso that transfers zzso acid to a sugar backbone during zzso A zzso and zzso the zzso protein which is required for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso All three of those specialized zzso zzso are required for the zzso of zzso molecules that play a role in establishing the symbiotic relationship between zzso and their zzso zzso Surprisingly, the recently zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggest even more candidates for zzso in zzso
