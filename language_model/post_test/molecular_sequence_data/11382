We recently demonstrated that zzso of T cell zzso zzso zzso are frequently altered after both zzso and zzso zzso The data reported here describe several characteristics of altered T cell zzso zzso their capacity to endure zzso zzso their correspondence to zzso donor T cell subsets, zzso the origin of the clone (in one case amenable to zzso from a mature T cell and not from new zzso and zzso the presence of such a clone throughout a year of follow-up in a patient with chronic zzso disease zzso in whom it represented up to zzso of zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso and was found to be zzso Taken together, these findings provide direct evidence for the zzso of a large proportion of the peripheral T cell repertoire in patients subsequent to bone zzso zzso possibly accounting for their frequent depressed immune zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso demonstrated in a clone from the patient with chronic zzso strongly suggests that an zzso response can be linked to a pathological zzso
