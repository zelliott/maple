Several zzso clones with similarity to zzso have been characterized from a library made from adult female zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso Aedes zzso The corresponding zzso designated zzso I zzso zzso is expressed specifically in the zzso zzso of the adult female zzso zzso a pattern overlapping that of another zzso Mal I, involved in zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of Amy I indicates that this gene encodes a zzso approximate zzso zzso zzso that appears to be a novel member of the zzso gene zzso The zzso protein contains a putative signal zzso for zzso and several consensus sites for zzso zzso The Amy I protein shows significant similarity to zzso and zzso zzso including the conservation of four zzso and zzso binding zzso However, the zzso region of the zzso protein is unique to the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso protein is evident only after the first 260 zzso acids in the zzso zzso The identification of this gene and its expression pattern adds to the observed relationship between zzso gene expression in the female zzso zzso and the specific feeding mode of the adult zzso
