Previous studies of class I zzso molecules have shown that the zzso monkey zzso possesses at least two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These two zzso have different zzso points, and exhibit differential zzso with the zzso zzso zzso We report zzso sequences of the zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso The two zzso zzso we identified exhibit a single zzso acid difference at position zzso An zzso zzso at position 3 was correlated with zzso zzso whereas zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso was zzso to a zzso zzso cell line when it was zzso with the zzso from the zzso cell zzso zzso 3 of zzso is located at the surface of the class I zzso It is also close to position 121 of the zzso class I heavy chain, which has previously been shown to influence zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso binds a compact zzso on the class I zzso that includes both zzso 3 of zzso and zzso 121 of the heavy zzso We examined the distribution of the two zzso motifs in a sample zzso population using an zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The pattern of zzso segregation we observed matches that which was defined previously by zzso Additionally, we identified zzso hybrid animals who possess both zzso of zzso
