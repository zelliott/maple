zzso zzso zzso which was characterized by maternal and fetal zzso and by a low level of zzso zzso into urine during pregnancy, was studied by zzso and molecular zzso zzso Among zzso participating in the electron transport system of the patient's zzso zzso only zzso activity was observed to be reduced zzso zzso of normal zzso Northern and Western zzso analyses showed that the zzso of the zzso gene and the translation of its zzso seemed to proceed normally in the patient's zzso However, the zzso zzso isolated from the patient was found to contain an extra DNA zzso of 87 base pairs zzso which zzso 29 zzso acids in frame but no termination zzso The zzso was located at the zzso point between zzso 6 and zzso 6 of the normal zzso zzso The extra DNA zzso represented the first part of zzso 6 except that its initial zzso was altered to zzso These findings indicated that, in the patient's zzso zzso the zzso between zzso 6 and zzso 6 did not occur at the normal zzso This reflected the presence of one point zzso in its consensus sequence which caused the next cryptic consensus sequence 87 zzso zzso to be used according to the zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso thus translated contained an extra 29 zzso zzso Furthermore, the patient's zzso zzso was observed to produce a protein zzso with a trace of activity in the transient expression system of zzso cells and in the high level expression system of zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing of zzso genes from the patient and parents confirmed that this zzso is a zzso disease with an zzso zzso inheritance zzso The patient and parents are zzso and zzso respectively, for this zzso
