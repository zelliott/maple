In this study, we investigated the role of charged zzso in zzso binding interactions of zzso receptors zzso Charged zzso of zzso both zzso and zzso which are located close to the membrane interface were zzso to zzso to determine their role in zzso zzso The zzso zzso belonged to specific zzso of zzso which have previously been implicated in zzso zzso binding zzso We demonstrate that zzso charged zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso charge zzso zzso seem to play a role in zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso charged zzso zzso did not have any zzso In conclusion, specific charged zzso of zzso both zzso zzso may contribute to zzso function either directly or zzso
