zzso stress is a major zzso stress that limits agriculture productivity zzso Rice is a model plant of zzso including cereal zzso Studies have suggested a critical role of protein zzso in salt stress response in zzso However, the zzso in rice, particularly under zzso stress, has not been well zzso Here, we use zzso Diamond zzso zzso to study rice zzso differential expression under salt zzso zzso zzso zzso and 11 zzso zzso putative zzso have been zzso Further analyses indicate that 10 of the 17 zzso proteins are probably zzso at zzso level instead of the protein zzso Meanwhile, we have identified 31 salt stress zzso regulated proteins using zzso Ruby zzso While eight of them are known salt stress response zzso the majority has not been reported in the zzso Our studies have provided valuable new insight into plant response to zzso zzso
