The structural genes for zzso zzso designated zzso A and zzso B, were cloned from zzso zzso type 1 zzso and a zzso sequence analysis was zzso Both zzso A and zzso B were present on a single zzso unit, with zzso A preceding zzso zzso The molecular weight calculated for the processed A zzso was zzso while the molecular weight of the processed B zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso sequences for zzso toxin and zzso toxin I zzso from zzso coli revealed that the genes for zzso toxin and zzso were greater than zzso zzso three zzso changes were detected in three separate zzso of the A zzso Only one of these zzso differences resulted in a change in the zzso acid zzso a zzso in zzso toxin at position 45 of the A zzso compared with a zzso in the corresponding position in zzso Furthermore, zzso toxin and zzso had identical signal peptides for the A and B zzso as well as identical zzso sites, a putative promoter, and zzso operator zzso These findings indicate that zzso and zzso are essentially the same zzso Southern zzso studies with total cellular DNA from several zzso strains and internal toxin zzso for zzso and its zzso zzso zzso showed that a single zzso in zzso zzso type 1 zzso strongly with the internal zzso zzso zzso with weaker zzso to the zzso probe were detected in zzso zzso type zzso but no other zzso No zzso between the zzso toxin II zzso probe and any of the zzso zzso was zzso Whereas zzso and zzso are zzso zzso no zzso could be induced from zzso zzso type 1 or other zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso toxin genes responsible for high toxin production are present in a single copy in zzso zzso type 1 but not in other zzso The findings further suggest that zzso genes are absent in zzso as are zzso zzso
