zzso zzso Shift zzso zzso are used to detect zzso zzso With this type of zzso it is difficult to distinguish between specific and zzso zzso complexes or to define which protein binds to the zzso Here we describe a novel Western zzso zzso zzso zzso for a zzso imaging system which permits easy identification of specific zzso This method also allows investigation of several zzso complexes in zzso We have identified and distinguished clearly between the zzso and zzso complexes which exhibit overlapping binding to the zzso of the zzso zzso
