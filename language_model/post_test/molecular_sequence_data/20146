zzso zzso factor zzso is a novel zzso factor that was first discovered in zzso human zzso cell line zzso zzso can bind to zzso promoter to regulate its zzso The first zzso zzso (named as zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was of zzso zzso and consisted of a zzso untranslated region zzso of 112 zzso a 3' zzso of zzso zzso and an open reading frame zzso of 450 zzso zzso a zzso of 149 zzso acids with an estimated molecular mass of zzso zzso and theoretical zzso point of zzso A typical zzso zzso was identified in zzso by SMART zzso zzso analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso with other known sequences by using the zzso program revealed that zzso was zzso to the zzso from human and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse and chicken zzso zzso zzso western clawed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in different zzso including zzso muscle, zzso heart, zzso and zzso and the zzso expression in zzso challenged by zzso or zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts could be detected in all zzso examined and be zzso in zzso after zzso zzso No significant changes were observed after zzso zzso All these data indicated the existence of zzso in zzso and also provided clue on the presence of zzso molecules in zzso
