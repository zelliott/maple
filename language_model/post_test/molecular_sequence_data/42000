zzso and its derivatives are potent analgesics that also have many other pharmacological effects in the nervous zzso These agents and the zzso zzso peptides exert their effects by interacting with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors have been isolated and zzso These zzso which are members of the zzso of zzso spanning zzso share a high degree of zzso acid sequence similarity with approximately 50% of the zzso being zzso The cloned zzso receptors mediate zzso zzso of zzso zzso formation and have pharmacological properties similar to the zzso zzso The cloning of these receptors will facilitate the development of new clinically useful compounds as well as studies of the molecular basis of tolerance and drug zzso
