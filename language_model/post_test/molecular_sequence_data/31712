A novel zzso designated zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso sample collected from the South China zzso Growth occurred from 4 to 45 zzso zzso 28 zzso pH zzso zzso pH zzso The strain formed zzso colonies after 5 days incubation on zzso modified with 5 % zzso medium at 28 zzso zzso were zzso short rods and zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso zzso was affiliated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The strain zzso zzso contained zzso acid in the cell zzso The major polar lipids were zzso and zzso The major fatty acids were zzso and zzso The zzso zzso were zzso and zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso and zzso characteristics as well as zzso data, strain zzso zzso represents a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AB zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also proposed in the light of the new zzso
