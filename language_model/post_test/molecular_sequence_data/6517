zzso zzso produced primarily in the human liver, is the sole protein component of zzso zzso and serves as a zzso for the LDL zzso Two zzso positive elements between zzso and zzso control zzso zzso expression of the human zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Breslow, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, two zzso zzso elements zzso to zzso zzso to zzso have been identified using zzso I footprint zzso Through in zzso zzso and transient zzso experiments in zzso zzso and zzso cells, the element zzso to zzso was observed to have a negative effect on zzso of the zzso zzso The element zzso to zzso was found to have a strong positive effect on zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso cells and mild positive effect in zzso zzso Therefore these two zzso elements mediate zzso specific expression of the zzso gene by interacting with zzso protein zzso
