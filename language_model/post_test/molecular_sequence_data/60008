zzso models of zzso were created and investigated by computer zzso First, single and double zzso of various lengths were zzso The 1 zzso 6 branching in double and single zzso of zzso was zzso zzso of single zzso double zzso and branch points were used as building blocks of larger zzso The possible makeup of zzso unit clusters was investigated via a series of models, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The lengths of the single zzso section that linked two branch points zzso zzso was systematically varied between values of zzso zzso zzso It was found that certain internal chain lengths lead to parallel double zzso Thus, it was zzso that the length of internal chains may determine the degree of local zzso Furthermore, it was noted that some of the low-energy arrangement of double zzso could be superimposed on either the two adjacent and nonadjacent double zzso of zzso A and B starch zzso In other cases, the distance between the double zzso is so large that it may in fact be a model for branching between two zzso zzso or unit zzso zzso obtained through this work were corroborated, where possible, with information available from zzso zzso and zzso zzso
