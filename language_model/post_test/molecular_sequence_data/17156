zzso is a highly zzso protein that serves as the scaffold for zzso assembly of zzso zzso zzso We report the zzso solution structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zinc bound at the zzso cluster assembly zzso The compact core of the zzso structure has an zzso sandwich architecture with a zzso zzso zzso and four zzso A nascent zzso is located zzso to the core zzso The zinc is zzso by three zzso zzso and one zzso zzso that are located in and near zzso dynamic zzso at one end of the zzso zzso zzso of the zinc metal by zzso results in widespread loss of structure in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso may be a good model for zzso zzso and may demonstrate structural features found in the zzso cluster bound zzso zzso and functional similarities, zzso context in zzso containing other zzso zzso and zzso of zzso surface zzso support the hypothesis that zzso protein zzso are zzso zzso derived from a common zzso with the zzso family of zzso cluster assembly zzso
