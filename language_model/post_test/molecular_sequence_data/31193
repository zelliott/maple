Fifteen individual species of zzso were treated with the chemical zzso zzso 50% zzso zzso or zzso M zzso Following zzso of the chemically modified material on zzso gels containing 8 M zzso zzso minor bands, in addition to the expected main band, were observed for 12 of the 15 zzso zzso of the content of chemically altered bases in material recovered from such bands indicated that zzso containing modified zzso in zzso stems were excluded from the main band and present, often in enhanced zzso in the minor zzso zzso The persistence of residual secondary structure on 8 M zzso gels run at 45 degrees C and the ability of chemically modified bases to alter zzso zzso warrant caution in designing and interpreting experiments in which chemically modified zzso is isolated on gels prior to further zzso zzso zzso was unique in that modified bases in non zzso regions, according to the zzso model of secondary structure, caused exclusion from the main zzso zzso we propose a secondary structure for partially zzso zzso zzso in which these bases are located in double stranded regions of the zzso
