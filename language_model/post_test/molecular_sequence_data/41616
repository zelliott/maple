zzso have often been considered as a mixing vessel for different influenza zzso In order to assess their role in more detail, we undertook a retrospective sequencing study to detect and characterize the zzso present in European zzso and to estimate the rate of zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso internal zzso zzso We zzso 69 newly obtained whole zzso sequences of zzso zzso from zzso influenza viruses sampled between 1982 and 2008, using zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these zzso together with previously published zzso revealed a large zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso segments containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso We subsequently examined zzso between the zzso and zzso segments and estimated the zzso rates between lineages using a recently developed evolutionary analysis zzso High rates of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso lineages were detected in European zzso with an average of one zzso every 2-3 zzso This rapid zzso results from zzso lineages in zzso and in consequence we should expect further zzso between currently circulating zzso strains and the recent zzso zzso pandemic zzso
