We have improved a system to examine forward zzso that occurred in the zzso gene of zzso coli placed on a zzso zzso Using this system, we determined the zzso specificity for a zzso deletion zzso in which zzso III is zzso The frequency of zzso zzso in zzso strain was zzso zzso zzso that is essentially the same as that in zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso Half the number of the zzso zzso were large zzso where a specific deletion among a zzso pair direct repeat zzso but other types of deletions were also zzso Most of the deletions were associated with the presence of directly repeated sequences capable of accounting for their zzso zzso zzso in zzso strain also significantly increased compared with those of zzso (17 zzso zzso Base zzso comprised zzso of the events, specificity of which in zzso strain was the same as that in zzso zzso The present data suggest that zzso is a novel class of zzso that strongly zzso repeated sequence dependent deletion zzso and high zzso of zzso zzso
