The bone zzso zzso contains zzso cells which are part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines differ both in their ability to support zzso and zzso development and in their ability to undergo zzso differentiation in zzso These processes have been examined in the zzso zzso zzso cell line and compared to other zzso and zzso cell zzso In long-term cultures, the zzso zzso cells support zzso cell growth, consistent with their expression of zzso stimulating factor zzso However, despite the presence of zzso for the zzso supportive zzso zzso 6 and 7, zzso cells failed to support zzso cell dependent B lineage zzso cells in zzso suggesting that these zzso cells exhibit only a zzso support zzso The zzso cells differentiate into zzso spontaneously when cultured in zzso fetal bovine zzso The process of zzso can be accelerated by a number of zzso based on zzso and gene marker zzso Following induction with zzso zzso zzso and insulin in zzso a time dependent increase in the steady state zzso and zzso activity levels of the following zzso specific genes was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was accompanied by a slight decrease in the signal intensity of the zzso stimulating factor zzso level, similar to that which has been reported in other bone zzso zzso cell zzso These data demonstrate that although the zzso support function of zzso bone zzso zzso cell lines is heterogeneous, they share a common mechanism of zzso
