zzso zzso proteins are a family of zzso proteins that participate in the regulation of zzso alternative zzso zzso of zzso activity in humans leads to zzso Here, we report upon the identification and characterization of three zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Alternative zzso of the three zzso primary transcripts gives rise to at least four protein zzso for zzso four for zzso and five for zzso zzso All of the zzso proteins contain the characteristic zzso zinc fingers required for zzso zzso In addition, several structural zzso including a zzso zzso region, are zzso among zzso zzso in zzso but not zzso These genes are broadly expressed in most adult zzso However, the relative expression levels of specific zzso vary across different zzso During zzso zzso and zzso are both zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso transcripts are not detected until the late zzso zzso Our results reveal the expression pattern of various zzso zzso for the first time and suggest that they may play specific roles during fish zzso
