zzso is an essential gene that has been related to cell wall zzso the zzso zzso and protein zzso In order to help to understand its molecular function, we carried out a characterization of the zzso zzso It is primarily located at the zzso zzso membrane facing the zzso zzso zzso more slowly than expected, which might suggest zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is a protein that is neither zzso nor zzso In contrast, it is zzso By a directed zzso of several zzso zzso we identified that the protein is simultaneously zzso at zzso zzso and zzso Although the zzso of these three N sites is not zzso cellular growth is zzso zzso analysis predicts a zzso domain at the zzso This zzso affects neither the targeting of the zzso protein to the zzso nor its zzso although it is important for the zzso of the protein to the membrane and for its zzso The existence of a signal sequence at the zzso has been zzso However, deletion of this zzso zzso neither zzso to the zzso nor zzso but it is required for cell zzso Finally, we found that zzso is zzso to the zzso by an zzso zzso mechanism which depends on zzso
