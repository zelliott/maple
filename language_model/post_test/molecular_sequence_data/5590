Multiple binding sites for the zzso factors zzso and zzso within the zzso type 5 major late promoter have been identified by zzso I protection zzso In the zzso region of the promoter, both zzso and zzso interact with zzso sequences zzso the zzso zzso Two zzso binding sites are centered at zzso and zzso relative to the zzso initiation zzso zzso bound only to the zzso zzso zzso Several sites of interaction were also evident in the zzso region of the zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso with a sequence centered at zzso and zzso bound zzso to an additional site centered at zzso zzso of zzso or zzso activated expression from the major late promoter in transient expression zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sequences in the major late promoter suggested that a primary target of zzso zzso is the zzso sequences zzso the zzso zzso whereas zzso requires the zzso zzso sequence elements to stimulate gene zzso This zzso is enhanced by the zzso zzso zzso and evidence for interaction between zzso and both zzso factors was obtained by using an zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso also was observed in zzso studies using the complete zzso type 5 zzso as the zzso Increased levels of late zzso from both the zzso and zzso regions were observed when zzso or zzso expression plasmids were zzso with viral zzso zzso zzso of the major late promoter by zzso and zzso was detected irrespective of whether the viral DNA could zzso
