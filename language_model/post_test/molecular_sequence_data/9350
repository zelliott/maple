zzso zzso zzso and zzso are two major modifications of zzso zzso They play critical roles in various biological zzso especially in gene zzso Identification of protein zzso and zzso sites would be a foundation for understanding their modification dynamics and molecular zzso This work presents a method called zzso that incorporates protein sequence information, secondary structure and zzso acid properties to predict zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in whole protein zzso We apply an zzso scheme based on grouped weight and position weight zzso acid composition to extract sequence information and zzso properties around zzso zzso The prediction accuracy for zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso Feature analysis reveals that zzso is likely to occur at the zzso region and zzso prefers to occur at the zzso region of zzso The upstream zzso away from the central site may be close to zzso zzso in three-dimensional structure and have a significant influence on zzso while the positively charged zzso may have a significant influence on zzso The online service is available at zzso
