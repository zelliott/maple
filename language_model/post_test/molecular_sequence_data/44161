The diverse biological functions of zzso are zzso via membrane bound zzso zzso In order to identify and characterize potential zzso zzso zzso we have examined the specific zzso binding to the zzso human zzso cell zzso The zzso receptors expressed in zzso cells, like zzso have high affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the potency for zzso of zzso binding by zzso peptides parallels that of zzso expressed in a stable zzso cell zzso We confirmed that zzso is expressed in these cells by zzso We further determined the tissue expression patterns of zzso which is expressed in a variety of human zzso at a very low level, with the highest levels seen in heart, small zzso and zzso A species of approximately 70 zzso is recognized by zzso specific for zzso by Western zzso analysis and should allow future zzso of zzso protein zzso
