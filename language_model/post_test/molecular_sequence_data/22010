zzso a protein playing crucial roles in zzso zzso to form spirals around the zzso of zzso zzso and helps their zzso from zzso This zzso is known to be zzso by the zzso zzso domain zzso Here we have characterized the structural features of zzso zzso using a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso and dynamic light scattering experiments indicate that in solution, the zzso has an intrinsic tendency to zzso It forms large soluble zzso zzso mass zzso 600 zzso Interestingly, they exist in equilibrium with the zzso the equilibrium being largely in zzso of the zzso This zzso observed for the first time for zzso may have regulatory implications for zzso zzso From the circular zzso zzso the zzso are seen to have a high zzso zzso From zzso zzso analysis we have determined that about 30 zzso in the zzso units zzso the zzso are flexible, and these include a 17 zzso stretch near the zzso This contains two short segments with zzso zzso in an otherwise dynamic zzso zzso charged zzso zzso cause zzso of the zzso into zzso and interestingly, the zzso characteristics of the zzso are completely retained in the individual zzso The segments along the chain that are likely to form zzso have been predicted from five different zzso all of which identify two long zzso Surface zzso potential calculation for these zzso reveals that there is a distribution of neutral, positive and negative zzso suggesting that both zzso and zzso interactions could be playing important roles in the zzso core zzso A single point zzso zzso in one of the zzso inhibited zzso quite zzso indicating zzso a special role of this zzso and zzso a zzso though zzso contribution of zzso interaction in the association zzso
