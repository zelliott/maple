To search for zzso candidate genes regulated by zzso we isolated zzso 2 zzso by zzso zzso and zzso We also examined the effect of zzso and/or zzso individually or combined, on expressions of zzso 2 and its zzso zzso zzso in pregnant sheep zzso zzso zzso 2 is a zzso zzso protein which interacts with zzso to form a zzso zzso The zzso was indicated in the production of zzso through the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso Thus, zzso 2 and zzso could be the important players in zzso signaling and zzso production in zzso smooth zzso Twenty-two zzso were treated with vehicle zzso zzso zzso or 5 zzso zzso administered zzso twice a day for 2 days zzso zzso zzso or 100 zzso zzso administered zzso twice a day for 14 days zzso zzso zzso or zzso plus zzso with 100 zzso zzso administered zzso twice a day for 10 days zzso zzso 5) and then with vehicle for 2 days followed by zzso for 2 days (5 zzso administered zzso twice a zzso At 121 days of gestation age zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained under zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to isolate zzso expressed zzso from zzso zzso treated with zzso which was confirmed by western zzso at protein zzso zzso 2 and zzso interaction was validated by zzso and their expressions in zzso zzso were determined by western zzso zzso Data were analyzed by zzso A zzso clone from zzso library representing zzso expressed zzso in the pregnant sheep zzso with zzso treatment was identified as zzso 2 by sequence analysis and zzso zzso zzso 2 was present in both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was zzso only in zzso zzso zzso Both zzso 2 and zzso significantly increased in zzso zzso fraction after zzso or zzso plus zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso combined had a more profound effect on induction of zzso 2 than zzso zzso zzso 2 was zzso specifically by zzso zzso from the zzso This study indicates that zzso may play an important role in the control of zzso zzso by zzso protein expression associated with zzso and zzso signaling systems during zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso 2 in zzso plus zzso group supports our hypothesis that zzso stimulation is zzso by zzso zzso in the pregnant sheep zzso
