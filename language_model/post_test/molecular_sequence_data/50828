To investigate the tissue distribution of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in human tissue we produced affinity zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the human zzso Both zzso recognize a specific zzso band in zzso injected with zzso zzso but not in those injected with zzso or zzso 2, 4, 5 zzso This zzso band in zzso injected zzso is zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso but not zzso indicating that it is a zzso zzso A high cross zzso between the human zzso zzso and a 43 zzso zzso zzso band was identified in all zzso zzso and many human zzso However, the specific zzso band could be distinguished from the zzso band by zzso treatment which zzso zzso the zzso zzso Using these zzso we show that zzso is present as a zzso zzso protein in human brain with lower levels zzso in heart, zzso liver and a barely zzso level in zzso No zzso was detected in zzso from any of 3 skeletal muscle groups zzso We conclude that a major role of zzso in humans is as the brain zzso zzso zzso
