The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in double zzso The female zzso is composed of four specific cell zzso the zzso that attract zzso tubes, the egg cell and central cell which are fusion partners for the two zzso cells, and the zzso cells whose function is zzso As a resource for gene discovery and to help identify genes exhibiting zzso expression patterns, we constructed zzso libraries from female zzso and from egg cells of zzso and zzso more than zzso zzso These libraries represent diverse zzso potentially corresponding to zzso genes zzso and zzso from the female zzso and zzso genes zzso and zzso from the egg zzso In each collection, zzso of the zzso have no matches in databases and zzso zzso hypothetical zzso novel hypothetical proteins (not found within the female zzso zzso were identified among the egg cell zzso We examined 65 zzso by zzso and 19 genes that were potentially female zzso were zzso We used in zzso zzso to determine expression specificity for seven zzso one transcript was expressed both in the egg cell and in the central cell, one was expressed in the egg cell and zzso two were expressed in the central cell, two were expressed in the zzso and one was expressed in the central cell and the zzso Four of these zzso small, potentially zzso peptides that are dissimilar except for a zzso triple zzso motif near their zzso These zzso resources should prove useful for identifying female zzso or zzso zzso
