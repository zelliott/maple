We report the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso derived from a chicken zzso heat shock protein zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso contains zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region and zzso zzso of structural gene sequence zzso the first 85 zzso acids of the zzso The start site of zzso was determined by primer extension and zzso zzso Two zzso have been zzso The first zzso presents two features in common with the unique zzso of the zzso 83 of zzso its location just before the zzso initiation zzso and its length of approximately zzso zzso The zzso zzso region contains a zzso element, a zzso box and several putative zzso elements that might account for the zzso level of expression and zzso regulation of the zzso zzso analyses show that zzso 90 gene expression is zzso and heat zzso and that a full heat shock response requires the zzso of two distinct blocks of overlapping heat shock response zzso
