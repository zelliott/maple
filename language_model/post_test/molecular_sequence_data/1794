We report the cloning and characterization of both the zzso zzso and zzso clones zzso for a zzso translation zzso factor zzso from zzso The analysis of the deduced zzso acids of the zzso clone reveals the presence of putative transit zzso sequence and four zzso binding zzso and two zzso signature motifs in the mature zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso pea zzso was localized to zzso The steady state transcript level of pea zzso was high in leaves and not zzso in zzso The expression of this gene is zzso by zzso The differential expression of this gene in response to various zzso stresses showed that it is zzso in response to zzso and zzso and zzso in response to low temperature and salicylic acid zzso These results indicate that regulation of pea zzso may have an important role in plant adaptation to environmental zzso
