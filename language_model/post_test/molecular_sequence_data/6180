The nuclear hormone zzso zzso is responsible for zzso adrenal zzso zzso and zzso zzso We recently cloned the zzso zzso region of the human zzso gene and in this report we describe the identification of a putative zzso factor 1 zzso response element approximately 110 bases upstream of the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are expressed in similar zzso including the adrenal cortex, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Like zzso zzso expression has been shown to be essential for the development of the adrenal zzso We demonstrate that zzso is able to efficiently bind to the putative zzso response element found in the zzso promoter in zzso This suggests that zzso may directly regulate the expression of zzso and that these two zzso factors may be components of a cascade required for development of zzso zzso
