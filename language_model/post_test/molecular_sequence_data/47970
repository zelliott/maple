Two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso identical to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was found in the zzso extracts of zzso coli transformed with the zzso plasmids for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso zzso indicated that there are three zzso zzso genes in the licorice zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso is mainly expressed during the exponential growth phase of the cultured licorice zzso
