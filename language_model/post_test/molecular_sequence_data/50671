zzso contains proteins that inhibit the growth of calcium zzso zzso zzso and may prevent the formation of kidney zzso We have identified a potent crystal growth inhibitor in the zzso media from primary cultures of mouse kidney cortical zzso zzso media, incubated with the kidney cells for zzso zzso was zzso for crystal growth zzso zzso activity increased zzso by 24 zzso zzso activity was zzso from zzso media containing zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso A single band of molecular weight zzso zzso was seen after zzso gel zzso The sequence of the zzso 21 zzso acids of this protein matched that of zzso zzso a zzso initially isolated from bone zzso zzso raised to fusion proteins produced by plasmids containing the zzso or zzso portions of zzso zzso also zzso with the protein zzso from cell culture media on western zzso The effect of the zzso protein on the growth of zzso zzso was measured using a constant composition zzso A 50% zzso of growth occurred at a protein concentration of zzso zzso and the zzso constant of the protein with respect to zzso crystal was zzso zzso zzso zzso The concentration of zzso in mouse zzso measured using zzso raised to the zzso zzso was approximately 8 zzso We conclude that zzso is zzso by kidney cortical zzso cells and functions as a crystal growth zzso protein in zzso
