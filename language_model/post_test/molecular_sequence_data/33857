zzso has a dynamic geographic history because its zzso were periodically interconnected when sea levels fell during glacial zzso zzso on this geographic dynamism were environmental changes related to zzso zzso To investigate how tropical zzso responded to such changes, we studied the divergence and demographic history of two zzso rainforest zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso We sampled birds primarily from Borneo and the Malay Peninsula, which zzso the zzso zzso shelf, and zzso zzso DNA data with a variety of zzso and gene zzso zzso zzso divergence in both species occurred well before the last glacial zzso zzso before the most recent land zzso However, zzso gene flow occurred, and it was more pronounced in zzso zzso (a highly zzso zzso than in zzso zzso (an zzso zzso Despite current habitat continuity on zzso the population of zzso zzso in northeastern Borneo is substantially divergent from that on the rest of the zzso The zzso population experienced dramatic demographic zzso probably because of competition with the other population, which expanded from western Borneo after the zzso In contrast, the Borneo population of zzso zzso has little structure and appears to have experienced demographic expansion 16 zzso long after it had zzso from the Malay Peninsula population zzso zzso Malay Peninsula populations of both species have remained relatively zzso Overall, the most recent glacial period was not the chief zzso of the evolutionary dynamics of our study species, and in this respect, they are different from temperate zzso
