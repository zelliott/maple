Cellular zzso of zzso interference zzso as a mechanism to combat virus infection is thought to be restricted to plants and zzso In zzso zzso defenses are largely dependent on zzso zzso with the use of small zzso restricted to zzso zzso targeting of host zzso Here we demonstrate that incorporation of a primary zzso into a zzso virus results in the formation of a zzso zzso mature zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the viral zzso product zzso is indistinguishable from zzso zzso maturation and elicits zzso gene zzso albeit at a reduced zzso Furthermore, zzso impose zzso zzso and zzso interference on virus replication in a zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest the existence of a zzso zzso activity capable of processing zzso zzso and perhaps contributing to the cell's zzso zzso
