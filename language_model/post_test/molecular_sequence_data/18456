The so-called common zzso zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso is characterized by a unique composition of genes that are arranged in the following order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As reported here, the identification of the two new genes zzso and zzso resulted from the DNA sequencing of a zzso zzso region covering zzso zzso zzso and zzso The predicted zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins had the following respective zzso acid zzso lengths and molecular weights zzso 209 zzso Mr zzso zzso zzso Mr zzso zzso zzso Mr zzso and 262 zzso Mr zzso The 3' end of zzso overlapped the zzso end of zzso by 71 zzso Using zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso the expression of these genes was shown to be zzso by the zzso zzso and depended on zzso from a DNA region farther zzso These data and the adjacent location of all genes suggested the existence of a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso gene products shared about zzso sequence similarity with the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the family of zzso proteins that are constituents of bacterial binding zzso transport zzso By zzso zzso DNA regions zzso to zzso were detected in other strains of zzso Likewise, zzso and zzso genes were identified in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso Cervantes, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso host specificity for zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
