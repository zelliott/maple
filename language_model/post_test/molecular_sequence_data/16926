zzso zzso strain zzso a potent zzso zzso strain, contains three linear plasmids ranging in size from 330 to 1,100 zzso As part of a zzso sequencing project, we report here the complete sequence and characterization of the smallest and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is an zzso zzso containing large terminal zzso repeats with a tightly associated protein and a predicted open reading frame zzso that is similar to that of a zzso rep zzso The zzso zzso has 300 putative zzso almost zzso of which are predicted to have a zzso zzso Most of these are organized into three zzso One of the zzso clusters was predicted to include zzso degradation zzso zzso with this zzso zzso grew on zzso zzso or zzso as the sole carbon zzso The zzso carries three zzso zzso zzso zzso a finding consistent with the high number of zzso genes found in other zzso Two of the zzso genes appear to belong to novel zzso the third belongs to zzso family 116 but appears to belong to a novel class based on the predicted domain structure of its zzso zzso indicate that zzso also contains four putative zzso zzso zzso to have been acquired by horizontal zzso zzso sequence zzso 19 zzso zzso and a zzso that spans two zzso One of the zzso islands appears to zzso resistance to heavy zzso The zzso does not appear to contain any zzso zzso However, each of the three zzso clusters contains related genes that appear to be involved in zzso zzso
