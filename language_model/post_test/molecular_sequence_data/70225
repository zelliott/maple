Several hundred solid state zzso zzso zzso and chemical shift zzso were simulated for the zzso membrane zzso zzso and for an idealized zzso zzso zzso to several different secondary structures zzso and zzso and parallel and zzso zzso each at several tilt angles with respect to the zzso zzso The use of zzso oriented samples was zzso The results of these simulations zzso zzso Because of the zzso dependence of zzso zzso it is likely to prove difficult to successfully execute uniform zzso enrichment strategies to generate large numbers of zzso zzso structural zzso in oriented sample zzso studies of membrane zzso zzso There are a number of readily zzso specific zzso labeling schemes which can yield data patterns sufficient to identify local secondary structure for zzso segments of idealized proteins which are zzso by zzso 10 degrees with respect to the zzso zzso zzso The measurement of zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and/or zzso side chains of zzso zzso may prove effective as routes to long range zzso structural data zzso
