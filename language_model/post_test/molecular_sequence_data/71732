An zzso zzso acid zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned in zzso coli and the zzso sequence was zzso After expression of the gene in zzso coli the zzso was zzso to zzso and zzso The zzso was shown to be strictly zzso and exhibited the highest activity in the zzso of zzso zzso N zzso as zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso and charged zzso zzso acids were not accepted as zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso differs from all known zzso with respect to its zzso specificity although zzso acid sequence identity scores of zzso to other zzso have been zzso The zzso consists of two zzso of zzso zzso and has an zzso point of zzso The zzso of temperature and pH were determined to be 50 degrees C and pH zzso zzso At 37 degrees C the zzso was completely stable for several zzso
