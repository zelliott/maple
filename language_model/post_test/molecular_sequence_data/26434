The action of high-intensity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso laser radiation zzso zzso ca 10 zzso or ca 40 zzso on liquid zzso solutions of DNA is known to cause not only zzso but also zzso modification of zzso zzso The action of hot zzso on the zzso DNA results in zzso splitting of zzso zzso zzso at least some of the modified zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso The distribution of zzso along the DNA chain shows that the position of these zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso sequences zzso to those formed via zzso zzso as well as with zzso zzso The last zzso result from zzso reactions and occur much more efficiently than the direct zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso It has been shown with fragments of plasmids zzso zzso and zzso zzso length over 600 base zzso that the relative efficiency of zzso at zzso sites depends on the primary structure context and can differ by an order of zzso The highest efficiency of modification is observed when a zzso is 3' zzso to the zzso zzso at zzso zzso However, considerable variations in the modification efficiency were also found in these zzso
