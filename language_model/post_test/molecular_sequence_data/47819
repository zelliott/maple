zzso insect cell derived zzso zzso zzso particles zzso have been modified either by inserting zzso zzso derived peptides into the zzso precursor or by zzso the complete zzso zzso in the particle zzso To investigate the protective efficacy of these particulate zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso both zzso or zzso to zzso In addition, zzso zzso Forest viruses zzso expressing proteins corresponding to the zzso zzso were established and administered as live vaccines in combination with particulate zzso zzso induced specific zzso responses irrespective of the zzso zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could not be increased by booster zzso in this zzso zzso immune responses were detected following vaccination with zzso as well as zzso zzso A tendency towards stimulating both enhanced cell zzso as well as zzso immune responses was observed following zzso with zzso zzso Upon challenge with zzso all vaccinated monkeys became zzso However, animals, that were vaccinated with zzso presenting the complete zzso managed to clear virus faster than zzso zzso The observed virus elimination significantly correlated with an zzso zzso response and an accelerated appearance of zzso zzso zzso
