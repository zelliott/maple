The main zzso of the zzso drug zzso zzso zzso are the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso Both zzso are well-known protectors against DNA damage induced by zzso Using zzso zzso DNA and restriction fragments we show that they protect efficiently also in the case of fast zzso In zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso protects by scavenging of zzso and by zzso zzso (by H donation from its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protects by scavenging of zzso and, in the case of the zzso zzso DNA, by reducing the accessibility of zzso attack sites via the induction of packaging of DNA in zzso zzso zzso by circular zzso Because of this second zzso the zzso DNA is more efficiently protected by zzso than by zzso at concentration ratios zzso 1 zzso zzso Moreover, using sequencing gel zzso of zzso fragments of known zzso we show that the protection by the two zzso is zzso distributed along the DNA zzso with zzso zzso of protection and with unprotected zzso Based on presented molecular zzso results we explain the sequence dependence of zzso by structural variations induced by the binding of the zzso
