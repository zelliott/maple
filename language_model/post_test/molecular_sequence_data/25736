The mode of action of the zzso H activity from zzso was analyzed with a zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso H protein and zzso hybrid consisting of zzso harboring the zzso tract zzso and three complementary synthetic DNA zzso Upon incubation of this zzso zzso hybrid with the zzso zzso zzso a zzso pattern is observed that indicates zzso zzso H activity with some sequence specificity for the next to last zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso and one cut within the zzso The zzso H avoids zzso of G or A zzso During zzso DNA synthesis the zzso is zzso in a concerted action of zzso and zzso H zzso the zzso H exhibits zzso as well as zzso zzso The distance between the active centers of the zzso and zzso H zzso to 18 base pairs of the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA synthesis zzso exactly at the next to last zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso by means of the zzso H zzso
