Point zzso in the zzso genes of zzso clinical strains of zzso zzso isolated in Japan were detected by a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and restriction zzso length zzso analysis and by direct zzso Six types of zzso zzso were observed in 149 of the zzso strains zzso and zzso zzso were greater than zzso zzso for 147 of the 149 strains zzso These zzso were localized between zzso 84 and 88, and they were associated with zzso zzso Two types of silent zzso were also zzso Among these eight types of zzso three types are novel, zzso the zzso at position 84 zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Among zzso zzso strains with a zzso zzso and strains with a zzso zzso were zzso In contrast, few strains had zzso and zzso zzso All zzso tested showed greater than a fourfold decrease in their activities in terms of their zzso that inhibited 50% of strains tested for each zzso zzso in comparison with their zzso that inhibited 50% of strains tested for susceptible zzso Most of the currently available zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were ineffective against each zzso zzso containing a zzso or Val zzso showed high-level resistance to zzso and one containing a zzso zzso showed relatively low-level zzso Double zzso were associated with a higher level of resistance than single zzso
