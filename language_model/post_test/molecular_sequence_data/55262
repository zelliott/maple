As previously reported, the activity of the zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso channel is strongly zzso from the zzso side of the cell membrane by certain zzso zzso Here, the mechanism of action of one of the most potent zzso zzso acid zzso is zzso This compound, zzso 22 in the previous report zzso zzso 2005), zzso the activity of the channel by shifting its zzso relationship toward the more negative zzso zzso with zzso reduced the affinity of zzso a zzso zzso whereas that of zzso a small zzso zzso zzso was not significantly zzso zzso by these results, scanning zzso of the outer zzso of the zzso channel was launched to uncover the molecular zzso that affect zzso zzso zzso substitution of several zzso acid zzso in the zzso region and the zzso zzso of the channel decreased zzso by zzso zzso modeling and molecular dynamics simulation showed that some of these zzso formed a zzso binding pocket between two adjacent zzso in the outer zzso of the zzso Thus, it can be envisioned that zzso derivatives stabilize the open zzso of the channel by binding to the zzso clustered across the zzso part of the zzso zzso The present results indicate that the interface between different zzso of the zzso channel may play a critical role in the zzso of channel zzso zzso this interface represents a potential therapeutic target site for the regulation of zzso zzso
