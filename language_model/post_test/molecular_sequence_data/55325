zzso is one of the most abundant zzso modifications zzso required for various zzso zzso of proteins in a living zzso Although zzso recently in zzso this type of zzso is present across all three zzso of zzso In zzso two types of protein zzso linkages are more widespread zzso zzso linked, where a zzso zzso is attached to the zzso group of zzso and zzso linked, where a zzso zzso is attached to the zzso group of zzso For their biologically ubiquitous nature, significance, and technology applications, the study of zzso zzso is a fast emerging area of zzso Here we describe new Support zzso zzso zzso based zzso zzso developed for predicting zzso zzso with high accuracy in zzso protein zzso The models are based on zzso profile of patterns, composition profile of patterns, and zzso scoring zzso profile of patterns as training zzso The study employ an extensive zzso of 107 zzso and 116 zzso zzso extracted from 59 zzso characterized zzso of zzso This zzso includes validated zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and validated zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In view of the current understanding that zzso occurs on folded proteins in bacteria, hybrid models have been developed using information on predicted secondary structures and accessible surface area in various combinations with training zzso Using these models, zzso and zzso could be predicted with an accuracy of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso An evaluation of the best performing models with 28 independent zzso zzso confirms the suitability of these models in predicting zzso and zzso in potential zzso from aforementioned organisms, with reasonably high zzso A web server zzso implementing these models is available freely at zzso
