zzso zzso migraine zzso is a genetically zzso disorder in which three zzso zzso zzso and zzso are currently known to be zzso zzso is occasionally associated with other zzso symptoms such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso A unique eye zzso of zzso repetitive daily zzso zzso has also been reported to be zzso with zzso in a single Swiss zzso 

We report an additional family in whom the zzso had, in addition to zzso typical zzso In this family and the previously reported Swiss family, the whole coding region of the zzso gene was screened after exclusion of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso 

We identified two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso 24 and 23, respectively, segregating with the disease in all living affected zzso Both zzso were absent from 180 healthy Caucasian controls and were located in an zzso loop highly zzso throughout zzso 

We report new clinical data supporting zzso of familial zzso migraine and the new eye zzso of zzso repetitive daily zzso and two novel zzso zzso as the underlying genetic zzso in two unrelated zzso zzso encodes the zzso sodium channel zzso that is highly expressed in the zzso including the zzso This remarkably stereotyped new eye zzso has clinical characteristics of abnormal propagation of the retinal electrical signal that may be a retinal spreading zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso which alter zzso brain zzso may occasionally alter retinal cell zzso
