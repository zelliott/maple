The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is poorly expressed when cloned into zzso zzso zzso of the zzso construct leads to a strong expression of zzso in the zzso zzso To investigate the zzso events directing the increase in expression we constructed a zzso zzso fusion which facilitated the isolation of zzso by colony zzso From several independent zzso three point zzso could be zzso They were distinguished by the sequence position of their respective single zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso gene and the degree of enhancement of zzso activity of the gene zzso The influence of these zzso on zzso gene expression was zzso by zzso protection analysis which revealed that their effect was at the level of zzso
