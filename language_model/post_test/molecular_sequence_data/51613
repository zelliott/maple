A sensitive method was developed for the determination of trace amounts of zzso zzso in various zzso zzso zzso was zzso by subjecting it to reverse zzso in the presence of an internal standard zzso and then amplifying the resulting zzso by zzso chain reaction with a fluorescent zzso The tissue distribution of zzso zzso in mice was examined by this zzso chain reaction zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso is expressed in the brain, zzso and zzso but scarcely at all in other zzso including the zzso In mouse brain, zzso is mainly located in the zzso especially the zzso In adult male and female zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso in the zzso is known to participate in brain differentiation and sexual behavior, so changes in its zzso levels in the brain during development were zzso zzso zzso was first detected in the zzso fetus and was found to increase rapidly during the fetal and zzso zzso Its zzso levels in male and female brains reached zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso respectively, zzso days after birth and then gradually decreased to adult zzso These observations are consistent with previous data indicating that the marginal period of zzso zzso of sexual differences is within a week after birth and suggest that brain zzso may be important in sexual differentiation and zzso
