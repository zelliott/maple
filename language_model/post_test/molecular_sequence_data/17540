We present genetic and zzso evidence that the zzso region of zzso the zzso of zzso zzso gene transcription, is composed of a single domain in which the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Analysis of zzso zzso showed that both the DNA and zzso interactions functions of zzso are contained within an zzso 101 zzso acid zzso that can fold into a zzso domain zzso Studies of point zzso revealed that two basic zzso within this domain are required for efficient DNA binding although not for productive interaction with zzso zzso at these sites alter the specificity of zzso for two binding sites in the upstream zzso region, both of which are shown to be necessary for efficient zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the 12 zzso zzso in zzso showed that all 11 zzso within the minimal zzso domain are required for zzso to undergo a zzso zzso switch into an active zzso zzso A zzso zzso located outside the zzso domain, is not required for proper zzso The critical basic and zzso zzso of zzso are zzso thereby providing an unusual example of overlapping small zzso and DNA binding functions within a directly regulated zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso region of zzso is shown to contain a zzso zzso domain that is zzso distinct and functionally zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso
