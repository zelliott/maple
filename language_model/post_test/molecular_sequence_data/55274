The objective of this study was to investigate the zzso infection in zzso lions using zzso samples, based on microscopic analysis, zzso amplification of the zzso region of zzso DNA and sequence analysis of the zzso zzso analysis indicated the presence of eggs of zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso samples zzso and in one of these zzso zzso eggs of zzso zzso were also zzso In five of the zzso eggs were not zzso The presence of zzso zzso in all the infected samples was also confirmed by zzso amplification of the zzso of zzso zzso gene and five of these also showed zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infection was not observed in any of the zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso region indicated zzso to zzso similarity with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first molecular characterization of zzso infection in captive zzso lions from a zzso garden of zzso This study also indicates that zzso lions are more prone to infection either with zzso zzso or zzso zzso and the zzso is not host zzso
