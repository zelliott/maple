The zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso zzso of skeletal zzso The zzso is composed of two continuous yet zzso membrane zzso the free or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is made up of free zzso zzso enriched in zzso pumps, and zzso zzso zzso zzso enriched in zzso zzso channels, and contains zzso within its zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso zzso has zzso distinct regulatory roles in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso constitute a novel mechanism for achieving cell zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Here, targeting of alpha zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso within the zzso zzso II zzso was studied in transgenic skeletal muscle zzso of the adult rat zzso The zzso were zzso versions of alpha zzso and of a deletion zzso allowing their specific zzso against the zzso zzso Our results show that alpha zzso is largely localized at the free zzso and thus near the zzso zzso a protein that can be modulated by zzso zzso II zzso Only minor zzso was observed with the zzso zzso zzso channel, which is a potential zzso zzso II zzso In zzso cells, zzso alpha zzso is targeted to zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso targeting requires the zzso zzso region of alpha zzso An unexpected additional specific zzso that does not require the zzso was found in the nucleus, providing a first clue of how zzso zzso II can zzso its nuclear functions in skeletal zzso
