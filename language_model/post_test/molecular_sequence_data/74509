The zzso of zzso bacteria are zzso zzso consisting of a zzso crystal bounded by a zzso zzso that contains a distinct set of proteins with various zzso Because of their unique magnetic and zzso properties, zzso particles are potentially useful as magnetic zzso in a number of applications, which in many cases requires the zzso of functional zzso to the zzso zzso In this work, we studied the use of green fluorescent protein zzso as a reporter for the zzso zzso and expression of fusion proteins in the zzso zzso zzso by flow zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although optimum conditions for high zzso and zzso synthesis were mutually zzso we established zzso growth conditions, which supported growth, zzso zzso and zzso zzso formation at reasonable zzso Under these zzso conditions, we studied the zzso zzso and expression of the zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and zzso While all zzso specifically localized at the zzso zzso zzso displayed the strongest expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso from cells displayed strong fluorescence, which was sensitive to zzso but stable under a wide range of temperature and salt zzso In zzso our data demonstrate the use of zzso as a reporter for protein zzso under zzso conditions and the utility of zzso as an anchor for zzso display of zzso gene zzso
