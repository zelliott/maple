zzso assessment models meant to determine zzso of commercial marine fish failed to predict recent stock collapses due to zzso One flaw of assessment models is that they strongly rely on catch and zzso statistics, but largely ignore the genetic background of the studied zzso We examined population genetic structure of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and northeastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea to aid zzso management of this heavily fished small zzso zzso We found that zzso has a striking zzso control region, and zzso a zzso of zzso zzso of its zzso in 261 individuals collected off the coasts of Morocco zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Spain zzso zzso and Greece zzso High levels of zzso diversity rendered a rather unresolved NJ zzso The recovered tree had no zzso structuring except for the zzso of 13 individuals of zzso In contrast, individuals grouped together according to the presence or absence of a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso comparisons and molecular zzso analyses supported genetic differentiation between the population of zzso zzso of zzso and those of the Mediterranean Sea and Moroccan coast, with a contact zone around the Strait of zzso This result confirms the existence of two subspecies, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that were previously identified based on zzso and zzso zzso distribution analysis showed that zzso populations are expanding since the zzso Surprisingly, the population of zzso showed strong and statistically significant levels of genetic differentiation that could be related with isolation and genetic zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso population versus the rest including mismatch zzso and a zzso skyline plot suggest that the zzso population likely underwent an early genetic zzso The genetic zzso of the zzso population could have been responsible for the historical collapse of this zzso stock in the zzso
