A cloned zzso has been isolated by probing a sheep zzso zzso library using a synthetic zzso representing the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso confirms the zzso zzso between the zzso and the zzso family of zzso however, the sequence reported here differs at several points from previously reported zzso acid and zzso sequences for the zzso zzso translation of zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso is a major constituent of total zzso at this stage of zzso development, and Northern zzso confirmed that zzso zzso production occurred between days 13 and 22 after zzso This is consistent with the stage at which embryonic extracts are zzso on administration in zzso These and other data confirm that the zzso zzso zzso is an zzso and suggest that at least five zzso of this protein may zzso
