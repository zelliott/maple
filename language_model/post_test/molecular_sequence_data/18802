In this paper we characterize three zzso a zzso D zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is reported here for the first time and its activity was studied in several biological models including zzso or zzso transformed tobacco zzso Three zzso structure models of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were built by zzso modeling using the template structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso The depiction of their active site organization provides evidence of the global influence of the zzso on the formation of zzso instead of a unique zzso the zzso properties and zzso accessibility of the whole active site in zzso may explain the stabilization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed from leaves and zzso showed two patterns of zzso zzso and zzso were mainly expressed during early stages of flower development and, at these zzso transcript levels paralleled the zzso of the corresponding zzso products zzso D and zzso By contrast, the expression level of zzso was constant in leaves and zzso zzso analysis provided zzso results on potential zzso process leading to zzso diversification in zzso
