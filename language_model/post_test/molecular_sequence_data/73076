zzso is often necessary for protein activity or regulation and its efficiency is fundamental for the zzso The zzso structure of a large number of zzso consists of zzso tightly anchored to each other by exchanged arms or swapped zzso However, nothing is known about how the arms can be kept in a zzso zzso before such an zzso 

Upon examination of such zzso structures, we observe an extremely frequent occurrence of zzso zzso at the point where the arm leaves the zzso zzso alignment and zzso zzso confirm the importance of these zzso The conservation of these zzso at the hinge regions can be explained by the constraints that they impose on zzso zzso and zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso extended zzso of arms thus zzso zzso and may prevent interaction of the arms with the core of the zzso 

zzso zzso can be considered as zzso structure zzso The presence of a zzso should be considered when searching for a zzso of zzso with arm exchange and could be used to engineer synthetic zzso or to zzso a zzso to zzso equilibrium by zzso of this zzso zzso
