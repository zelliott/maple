An 85 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has one zzso and two zzso regions zzso and zzso which direct zzso zzso We have established zzso zzso producing zzso zzso against zzso alpha to study the zzso relationship of this zzso zzso mapping using a series of deletion zzso expressed in zzso coli showed that the zzso zzso bound to at least 5 distinct zzso regions, which were well dispersed on zzso alpha except for its zzso zzso zzso against zzso regions and zzso zzso against zzso regions zzso zzso alpha expressed in human cells and in zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso against the central part of zzso alpha failed to zzso zzso alpha efficiently; however, they could zzso zzso alpha zzso with deletion of either the zzso or the zzso zzso Similar results were obtained by zzso using zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso hindrance prevents binding of zzso zzso to the central part of zzso alpha where zzso is zzso The zzso may have a distinct function from zzso which is located at the zzso region and has been shown to mediate the binding of zzso to activated growth factor zzso
