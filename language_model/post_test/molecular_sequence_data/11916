To develop zzso that selectively recognize each of the alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso and to determine the expression and zzso of these zzso in the anterior segment of the human zzso 

Recent studies have shown that there are three zzso of the alpha zzso termed alpha zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to amplify portions of these receptors fused zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso The expressed fusion proteins were used to zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso the alpha zzso zzso in sections of human and rabbit zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and dot zzso zzso were used to determine which zzso were present in zzso from primary cultures of human zzso zzso zzso and rabbit zzso body zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso with the alpha zzso zzso showed that the zzso raised against the zzso fusion proteins specifically recognized their respective zzso zzso In the human zzso body, alpha 2 B and alpha zzso zzso were present in the zzso and zzso zzso In the rabbit zzso body, alpha 2A zzso also was zzso zzso chain reaction and dot zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso the alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso was present in human zzso and that zzso zzso all three zzso was present in the rabbit zzso 

Multiple alpha zzso zzso are expressed in the zzso zzso In the human, alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso whereas all three are present in the zzso This could be important with respect to animal models of glaucoma and to the development of drugs for lowering zzso zzso
