zzso 1 is a zzso zzso concentrated in zzso nerve zzso where it zzso a pool of zzso zzso implicated in synaptic zzso zzso Like other proteins with a role in zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso in resting zzso and zzso zzso by zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso 1 and regulates its function both in zzso and in intact zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso activity of zzso 1, whereas zzso by zzso zzso such zzso The activity of zzso 1 was also zzso by its interaction with zzso 1, its major binding partner at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is adjacent to the zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso acid to mimic zzso by zzso inhibited the interaction of zzso 1 with zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso may have an zzso role in the regulation of zzso 1 recruitment and activity, and therefore in the regulation of zzso zzso turnover at zzso
