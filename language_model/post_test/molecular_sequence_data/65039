A zzso zzso zzso marker that contains 32 zzso consisting of zzso zzso was developed for zzso ( zzso zzso Each zzso after amplification with zzso zzso was cloned to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of these clones were mixed and amplified with zzso zzso to construct the zzso zzso zzso All the zzso prepared in this study were zzso in both directions, using two types of forward zzso and one reverse zzso The sequencing results revealed that all the zzso in our zzso zzso marker had the correct length corresponding to the zzso zzso This marker can be used for more effectively typing zzso
