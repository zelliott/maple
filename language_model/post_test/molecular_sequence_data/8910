The switch from zzso to zzso is one of the most pivotal events in zzso undergoing sexual zzso However, the mechanisms orchestrating zzso initiation remain zzso particularly in zzso zzso plants are zzso with male and female spore genesis adopting different zzso zzso We show here that plant zzso mother cells contain a specific zzso initiation machinery through characterization of a rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso does not produce zzso in zzso but has the normal female zzso zzso molecular and zzso investigations demonstrate that zzso zzso are defective in the zzso entry of zzso cell zzso and in the differentiation of surrounding zzso cell zzso resulting in zzso filled with zzso cells instead of zzso Furthermore, analysis of zzso zzso double zzso reveals that due to the absence of zzso the cells in their zzso zzso center do not activate zzso cell cycle either, generating a similar zzso zzso to zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso which could interact with zzso zzso zzso These results suggest zzso entry in zzso is directed by an zzso zzso which requires zzso activity, and zzso regulation might play important roles in this zzso
