A novel zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a zzso aromatic zzso enrichment of zzso zzso from a zzso chemical zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso grew at zzso zzso zzso 37 zzso pH zzso zzso pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence showed that strain zzso was related zzso to members of the zzso zzso with sequence similarity of zzso The cellular fatty acids of strain zzso were zzso summed feature 3 zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso summed feature 9 zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso G, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contained zzso 7 as the major zzso The zzso of strain zzso was zzso and the main polar lipids were zzso and a zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a range of zzso characteristics that differentiated it from previously recognized zzso species, particularly its ability to use zzso as a sole carbon source for growth and its alkaline optimal pH for growth zzso zzso On the basis of these results, it is concluded that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso is zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso
