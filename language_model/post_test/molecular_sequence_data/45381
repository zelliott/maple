zzso zzso zzso is a large, zzso and migratory species of tuna that inhabits tropical and temperate marine waters zzso Previous studies based on zzso zzso data have shown that zzso zzso from the Atlantic Ocean are the most interesting from a genetic point of zzso Two highly divergent zzso zzso zzso (I and zzso coexist in the Atlantic zzso One is almost exclusive of the Atlantic Ocean whereas the other is also found in the zzso zzso zzso tuna from the Atlantic Ocean is currently managed as a single stock, although this assumption remains untested at the genetic zzso zzso genetic diversity was determined at the zzso control region to test the zzso hypothesis of no population structure in zzso tuna from the Atlantic zzso A total of 331 specimens were sampled from four locations in the Atlantic Ocean zzso zzso zzso Islands, and Gulf of zzso and one in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, zzso The reconstructed zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso I and II throughout the Atlantic zzso No apparent zzso zzso of the proportions of both zzso in the different collection sites was zzso zzso zzso tests and zzso zzso comparisons involving Atlantic Ocean zzso I and II were consistent with a single stock of zzso tuna in the Atlantic zzso zzso genetic analyses considering zzso independently supported gene flow within zzso II throughout the Atlantic Ocean, and within zzso I between Atlantic and zzso zzso The latter result suggests present zzso gene flow from the zzso into the Atlantic zzso Moreover, mismatch analyses dated divergence of zzso I and II during the zzso as previously zzso In addition, migration rates were estimated using zzso methods, and showed a net migration from Atlantic Ocean feeding grounds towards the Gulf of zzso the best-known zzso ground of Atlantic zzso zzso
