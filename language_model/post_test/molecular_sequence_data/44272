zzso from scorpion zzso constitute the most studied group of zzso of the zzso sodium channels, and yet, their toxic site has not been zzso We used an efficient bacterial expression system for zzso specific zzso acid zzso of the highly zzso zzso zzso from the scorpion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modified at tight turns, the zzso region, and other structurally related regions were subjected to zzso and structural zzso This approach highlighted both aromatic zzso and zzso and positively charged zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that zzso may interact directly with putative recognition points at the zzso site on the sodium zzso zzso are important for the spatial arrangement of the toxin zzso and zzso contribute to the formation of an zzso potential that may be involved in zzso of the zzso zzso The latter was supported by a zzso zzso zzso that restored a zzso effect caused by a zzso zzso The feasibility of producing zzso scorpion zzso with zzso toxicity was demonstrated by the substitution of the zzso zzso with zzso Altogether, the present study provides for the first time an insight into the putative toxic surface of a scorpion zzso affecting sodium channel zzso
