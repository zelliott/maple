zzso is a toxin zzso from the saliva of the assassin zzso zzso zzso Because of its similarity in sequence to zzso from another assassin zzso we did not assess its zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate by zzso means that zzso targets the zzso zzso calcium zzso We also determine the solution structure of zzso using two-dimensional zzso techniques, followed by distance geometry and molecular zzso The structure of zzso belongs to the zzso zzso knot zzso structural family zzso a compact zzso core from which four zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso We compare the structure of zzso with other zzso zzso blockers, analyze the zzso juxtaposition of key functional zzso and conclude that the recognition of zzso calcium channels by toxins belonging to the zzso structural family requires zzso located on two distinct areas of the molecular surface of the zzso
