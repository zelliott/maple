To construct the zzso expression zzso zzso to obtain zzso fusion protein of zzso 

Using zzso DNA zzso the full-length human zzso zzso was amplified by zzso from zzso zzso and the zzso product was added with zzso using zzso DNA zzso The zzso product of zzso zzso with the base A at its 3' end was zzso with zzso Easy zzso and transformed into zzso The correct zzso was identified by zzso and Sal zzso II zzso and named as zzso Two zzso were zzso and zzso to generate a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso which was directly zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identified by zzso zzso and named as zzso zzso and zzso were further zzso by zzso zzso I and Sal zzso II, zzso The zzso linear zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso using two pairs of zzso possessing different recognition sequences but producing compatible cohesive zzso The clone with the expected insert was selected using zzso I restriction analysis followed by sequence zzso The zzso zzso was transformed into zzso coli zzso which was induced by zzso The zzso protein possessed an zzso zzso sequence which could be used to purify the target protein by affinity zzso on a zzso zzso The fusion protein zzso was produced and confirmed by specific zzso activity in zzso 

zzso analysis showed that the zzso and the human zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso had identical sequence with designed zzso zzso and human zzso zzso sequence in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso confirmed successful expression and zzso of zzso fusion protein with specific activity of zzso zzso 

The zzso expression zzso zzso has been constructed zzso and the successful expression and zzso of zzso provides a basis for prevention and therapy of various disorders related to zzso zzso
