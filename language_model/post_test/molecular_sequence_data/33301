Human zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition by zzso expression of major zzso complex zzso class I and II molecules on the surfaces of infected zzso zzso to the zzso hypothesis, zzso cells are zzso to zzso by natural killer zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell function is zzso by a number of zzso immune evasion zzso which operate by delivering zzso signals to zzso cells and preventing engagement of zzso zzso One such zzso is zzso which is an zzso class zzso zzso zzso by clinical zzso and zzso strains of zzso zzso is known to zzso surface expression of zzso class zzso chain A zzso which is a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso interferes with zzso is zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso predominantly to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso mediates its zzso zzso while we propose that the zzso zzso domain is involved in its zzso zzso We also confirm that zzso zzso surface expression of full-length zzso zzso while having no effect on the truncated zzso zzso However, we demonstrate for the first time that zzso retains full-length zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, we propose that zzso interacts with nascent zzso en route to the cell surface but not mature zzso at the cell zzso Our data also demonstrate that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are involved in recognition and zzso zzso of full-length zzso zzso
