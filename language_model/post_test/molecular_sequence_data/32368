Resistance to zzso acid in zzso zzso often results from acquisition of the zzso zzso or from zzso in the gene zzso that encodes the drug target zzso factor zzso We now report further studies on the genetic basis of resistance to this zzso in the zzso Two zzso genes that zzso proteins exhibiting zzso zzso identity with zzso zzso resistance to zzso acid in zzso zzso One of these genes zzso zzso was subsequently detected in all zzso zzso clinical strains of zzso zzso tested that did not carry zzso or zzso in zzso and in strains of zzso zzso The other gene zzso zzso is carried by zzso zzso explaining the inherent resistance of this species to zzso zzso zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, resistance to zzso acid in clinical zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso species frequently results from expression of zzso zzso
