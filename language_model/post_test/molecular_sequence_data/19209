zzso channel dysfunction zzso diseases such as zzso hypertension, cardiac zzso and multiple zzso zzso that selectively inhibit zzso channels, zzso have provided invaluable information for zzso the contribution of different zzso channels to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso specificity comprises an important first step in zzso zzso drug discovery for these zzso Despite extensive functional and structural studies of zzso channel complexes, none have predicted the molecular basis of zzso zzso Here we show that by minimizing the differences in binding free energy between selective and zzso zzso we are able to identify all of the zzso of zzso specificity for zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Because these zzso zzso to unique features of the two types of channels, they provide a way to develop more accurate models of zzso channel complexes that can be used to design novel selective zzso zzso
