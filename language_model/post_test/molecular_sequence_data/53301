The zzso sequences of zzso zzso large zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been determined to construct their zzso zzso Based on these zzso the six zzso species were divided into two groups: three, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which produce zzso as a major zzso and the others, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which produce zzso C as a major zzso Among the three zzso species, only two zzso zzso were observed between the zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the sequence of zzso zzso was identical to that of zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are closely zzso Among the three zzso zzso species, only one zzso substitution was observed between those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that these two species are also closely zzso
