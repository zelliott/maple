Much of our understanding of the mechanisms of the zzso zzso and function of zzso zzso channels has its origins in investigations of sympathetic zzso In this article, we use molecular analyses to identify the three zzso channel alpha zzso that are the likely counterparts to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso channel currents observed in sympathetic zzso With a combination of zzso and exact zzso small regions of zzso channel alpha zzso sequences were amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso Although all five zzso channel alpha zzso genes were expressed in rat sympathetic zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso were the dominant zzso No novel zzso channel alpha zzso were identified in the regions selected for amplification, and we conclude that alpha zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso likely zzso respectively, zzso zzso and zzso channel currents of rat sympathetic zzso In addition, we show that zzso channel beta zzso beta zzso and beta zzso sequences are strongly represented in sympathetic zzso The results of this study also suggest that alpha zzso and not alpha zzso regulates zzso influx through zzso zzso channel zzso
