The major zzso complex zzso in humans and chimpanzees includes three classical class I zzso A, B and C, which zzso zzso expressed on the surface of all zzso zzso There are also several zzso class I zzso including zzso which have more limited zzso By analyzing published zzso we have shown that in zzso 4 and 5, A locus zzso from both humans and chimpanzees are much more similar to E than to B or C zzso whereas in zzso 2 and 3 zzso from all three classical class I zzso are much more similar to each other than any one is to zzso We propose that some 20 million years ago, zzso zzso led to the formation of a hybrid gene in which zzso 2 and 3 were derived from the original A locus and zzso 4 and 5 were derived from the E zzso The fact that such an ancient event can still be detected suggests that zzso zzso is rare in the zzso and does not significantly contribute to zzso zzso which is known to be extremely zzso The present finding, however, supports zzso idea that zzso in a gene may occasionally be replaced by those from another gene in the evolutionary zzso
