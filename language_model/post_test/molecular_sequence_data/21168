The third zzso of zzso zzso is zzso for numerous gene arrangements that form classical zzso in North zzso The zzso zzso zzso isolated from natural populations revealed changes in gene order that allowed the different gene arrangements to be linked together by zzso zzso representing one of the first cases where genetic data were used to construct a zzso Although the inversion zzso can be used to determine the relationships among the gene arrangements, the zzso data are unable to zzso the ancestral arrangement or the age of the different zzso zzso These are both important properties if one is to zzso the evolutionary forces responsible for the spread and maintenance of the zzso Here, we employ the zzso sequences of 18 regions distributed across the third zzso in zzso zzso zzso strains to test whether five gene arrangements are of unique or multiple origin, what the ancestral arrangement was, and what are the ages of the different zzso Each strain carried one of six commonly found gene arrangements and the sequences were used to zzso their evolutionary zzso zzso regions in the center of the zzso supported zzso of the gene arrangements, whereas regions at the ends of the zzso gave zzso that provided less support for zzso of the zzso either because the individual markers did not have enough zzso zzso sites or genetic exchange scrambled information among the gene zzso A data set where the genetic markers were zzso strongly supported a unique origin of the different gene zzso The inversion zzso of zzso zzso is estimated to be about a million years zzso We have also shown that the generated zzso is consistent with the zzso zzso of this zzso In addition, the data presented here support hypothetical as the ancestral zzso One of the youngest arrangements, zzso has one of the highest population zzso suggesting that selection has been responsible for its rapid zzso
