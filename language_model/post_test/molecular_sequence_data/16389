The zzso protein in zzso coli is associated with free zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso A zzso zzso is defective in zzso maturation and accumulates zzso zzso To study the interaction of zzso with the zzso and its involvement in zzso zzso zzso zzso acid substitution zzso were zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso for two adjacent zzso within the zzso zzso domain, showed a reduced binding to zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso had significantly lower amounts of zzso and also reduced levels of zzso relative to zzso compared to a zzso zzso A zzso in zzso which encodes zzso zzso suppressed the zzso and zzso zzso processing deficiencies of the zzso but not that of the zzso zzso A zzso in zzso which encodes zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso of both zzso zzso zzso zzso found in either zzso 31 or zzso of zzso zzso improved growth of both the zzso and zzso zzso However, they suppressed the zzso zzso processing zzso of the zzso zzso more efficiently than that of the zzso zzso zzso 31 and zzso are known to interact with zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso is known to interact with zzso A zzso but not a zzso protein bound strongly to zzso in zzso Thus, zzso likely zzso maturation of the region of the head of zzso that contains zzso and zzso as well as zzso 31 and zzso
