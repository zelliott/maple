Southern zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA with a specific zzso probe and sequence analysis of several zzso have revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by two zzso both of which are expressed in zzso zzso zzso The structural genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso the two zzso zzso have been isolated from a zzso zzso library and zzso by DNA sequence analysis, zzso bean zzso mapping and primer zzso The two genes each contain two zzso and zzso very similar zzso zzso from both genes have long zzso 200 zzso zzso untranslated leaders which are unusual in that they contain several zzso zzso upstream of the initiation zzso zzso analysis of zzso extracted from serial sections of developing zzso leaves reveals that the zzso genes are most actively transcribed in the zzso zzso while transcripts were zzso in green zzso
