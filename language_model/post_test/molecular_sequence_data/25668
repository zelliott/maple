zzso shift zzso were used to examine the binding of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso DNA zzso zzso binding was differentiated from zzso DNA association by zzso zzso zzso complexes below the zzso association constant and zzso demonstrating the effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the formation of zzso zzso With the linear zzso zzso all eight operator sites could be simultaneously bound by distinct zzso However, with circular zzso the eight operator sites were zzso by zzso only in the zzso circular state and not in the zzso closed circular zzso Under the experimental conditions used, there was no evidence of zzso zzso binding or loop zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso of DNA that occurs upon specific zzso binding was retained in zzso closed molecules and could modify other operator sites so as to make them unavailable for specific zzso
