The zzso zzso chains zzso of the zzso of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to contain zzso groups that link the non sugar zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 103 include zzso zzso in the main chain and thus resemble zzso zzso acids of zzso zzso The structures of the zzso were zzso using zzso zzso including two-dimensional zzso correlation zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso along with chemical zzso The structures determined are unique among the bacterial zzso and, together with the data obtained earlier, represent the chemical basic for zzso of zzso zzso Based on structural similarities of the zzso zzso and zzso relationships between the zzso we propose to extend zzso zzso zzso and zzso by including zzso zzso strains 16 and zzso
