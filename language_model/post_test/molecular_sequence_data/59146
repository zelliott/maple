We studied changes in the zzso expression following zzso cell death induced by treatment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso using human colon zzso zzso zzso An zzso cell death of zzso accompanied with typical DNA fragmentation was observed when the cells, were cultured zzso with zzso and zzso zzso In flow zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso was strongly and slightly zzso respectively, on the cell surface in accordance with the zzso When the zzso zzso activities of the zzso from the treated cells were examined relative to those from zzso cells, a zzso increase of zzso activities and a slight increase of zzso activities were observed, but little or no increase of zzso activity was zzso In Northern zzso analyses using zzso for zzso III, IV, zzso VI and zzso zzso strong zzso messages for zzso III, V and/or VI and a weak zzso message for zzso IV were detected in the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, in the treated cells, the messages for zzso III, V and/or VI were found to almost disappear and the zzso zzso message for zzso IV was observed to elevate zzso zzso we suggest that the strongly increased expression of zzso zzso found on the zzso cell surface might be involved in the process of zzso and that the enhancement of the zzso expression seems to result from the increased activity of zzso zzso mainly by the zzso IV zzso
