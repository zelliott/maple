zzso zzso constitute a major class of zzso for zzso zzso channels zzso The zzso have a zzso zzso ring with an zzso group at the zzso an aromatic zzso at the zzso and zzso at the port and zzso zzso Various zzso exhibit zzso or zzso activities, which were previously explained as stabilization or zzso respectively, of the closed zzso gate by the zzso zzso Here we report a novel structural model in which zzso and zzso activities are determined by different parts of the zzso zzso and have different zzso In our model, which is based on zzso Carlo zzso of zzso complexes, the zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso form zzso with side chains of the key zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We propose that these zzso which are common for zzso and antagonists, stabilize the zzso zzso with the open zzso zzso This explains why both zzso and zzso increase probability of the long lasting channel openings and why even partial disruption of the contacts eliminates the zzso zzso In our model, the zzso approaches the selectivity zzso zzso zzso of zzso may induce long lasting channel closings by zzso zzso binding to the selectivity filter zzso zzso have either zzso zzso or a hydrogen atom at their zzso and thus lack this zzso zzso The predicted orientation of the zzso core allows accommodation of long zzso in the domain interface or in the inner zzso Our model may be useful for developing novel clinically relevant zzso zzso
