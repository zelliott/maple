We identified two zzso zzso zzso in the human type II zzso zzso zzso zzso the first in zzso 6 of zzso II zzso zzso to zzso zzso in a male infant with zzso zzso and zzso raised as a male and no apparent zzso since zzso age, and the second in zzso 259 of zzso IV zzso zzso to zzso zzso in a male zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fourth degree zzso raised as a female and with zzso disorder since zzso zzso In zzso transient expression of zzso type II zzso complementary zzso of zzso zzso as well as zzso for comparison was examined by a zzso zzso and zzso of construct into zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed expression of similar amounts of type II zzso zzso zzso acid from the zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso complementary zzso Western zzso analysis revealed a similar amount of zzso zzso protein compared to zzso zzso from zzso cells, but neither zzso from zzso cells nor zzso or zzso zzso protein in zzso or zzso cells was zzso zzso activity in intact zzso cells using 1 zzso zzso as zzso in the medium after 6 h revealed relative conversion rates of zzso to zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and less than zzso activity by zzso zzso Using 1 zzso zzso as zzso the relative conversion rate of zzso to zzso after 6 was zzso by zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and no activity by zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso activity, despite its demonstration in the intact cells, was not detected in zzso of zzso cells or in zzso of zzso cells, suggestive of the relatively unstable nature of this protein in zzso possibly attributable to the decreased zzso zzso In the case of zzso and zzso zzso consistently zzso proteins in both zzso cells despite zzso zzso zzso acids indicate severely zzso proteins resulting in either no or very little zzso activity, and these data further substantiate the deleterious effect of a structural change in this predicted putative zzso domain of the zzso In conclusion, the findings of the in zzso study of zzso type II zzso zzso activities correlated with a less severe clinical zzso of zzso and a lesser degree of zzso ambiguity in the patient with zzso zzso zzso compared to a more severe clinical zzso of zzso and severe degree of zzso ambiguity in the patient with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso
