The concentration of zzso zzso required to inhibit the assembly or to induce the zzso of chick brain zzso zzso is markedly dependent upon the zzso protein zzso Analysis of this relationship shows that zzso zzso and zzso compete for common zzso sites, that zzso can bind 5-6 zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso of these sites is zzso to 20 zzso zzso zzso It is proposed that two molecules of zzso zzso interact with each of the three zzso sites of zzso and inhibit the zzso interaction by zzso two highly zzso basic zzso
