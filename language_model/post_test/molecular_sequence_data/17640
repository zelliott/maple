The development of zzso has an interesting biological zzso in that the numbers of zzso can increase from a normal paucity to very high levels, without a zzso increase in other zzso This suggests a unique controlling zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso all induce zzso zzso zzso is the only identified zzso specific for the zzso zzso This together with the fact that zzso can be detected in the serum of mice with zzso suggests that it may be a critical controlling zzso The mechanism of this control is not yet zzso It appears that a high proportion of zzso clones produce zzso even when isolated using zzso that do not induce zzso If zzso is produced in response to all zzso what is the basis for the biological specificity of zzso It is possible that the production of zzso by isolated zzso clones does not reflect the true biological situation, because there may be a selection process in the isolation of T cells that is not yet zzso In addition, zzso appears not to stimulate the production of precursors committed to the zzso zzso at least in zzso Thus, it would seem likely that other controlling mechanisms exist to generate the zzso Attempts to study this stage of zzso production are difficult to zzso The experiments are technically difficult, and conflicting results have been zzso zzso and zzso appear to have this activity in zzso but it is not clear how these factors could be active in the production of zzso precursors without also inducing increases in other zzso types, particularly zzso Another intriguing aspect of the biology of zzso is the activity on other cell types, particularly B cells in the zzso This activity as a zzso zzso precedes the identification of zzso as an zzso differentiation factor, and has been studied in considerable detail for many zzso However, if zzso is important in the production of zzso why are zzso not seen in all immune zzso An important insight into this problem has come from the observation that human zzso has no analogous activity on human B zzso If zzso is not active on human B cells, it raises questions about the biological role of zzso as a zzso in the zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
