In the past decade, traditional zzso zzso techniques have identified a plethora of interactions among soluble proteins operating within diverse cellular zzso The discovery of associations between membrane proteins by genetic approaches, on the other hand, is less well established due to technical zzso Recently, a zzso system was developed to overcome this barrier, but so far, this system has been limited to the analysis of known membrane protein zzso Here, we constructed unique zzso zzso libraries and provide details for implementing this system to screen for binding partners of a bait zzso in this case zzso zzso is a resident integral protein of the zzso zzso where it operates as a zzso or cargo zzso and regulator of zzso Here we describe a novel human member of the protein zzso zzso B zzso family, an integral protein of the zzso zzso membrane with four zzso alpha zzso as a zzso zzso zzso turns over rapidly through degradation by the zzso zzso Comparisons of mouse cells with a deletion of zzso or zzso with human zzso indicate that zzso is required to maintain zzso consistent with a zzso or quality control function for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
