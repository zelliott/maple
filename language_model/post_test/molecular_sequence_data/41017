The expression of the gene for zzso surface zzso zzso 118 in zzso zzso is activated by zzso a DNA segment containing the gene and 1-2 zzso in front of it to an expression site elsewhere in the zzso By zzso zzso protection and zzso zzso experiments we show here the presence of several minor transcripts in zzso zzso zzso zzso one of which covers the entire zzso zzso zzso of the sequence of the zzso terminal segment of zzso 118 zzso zzso zzso determined by primed reverse transcription, and the corresponding region of the 118 zzso zzso shows that the zzso terminal 34 zzso of the zzso are not zzso in the 118 zzso gene zzso with the remainder of the zzso We conclude that synthesis of a zzso zzso involves zzso of a much longer primary transcript, which may start outside the zzso zzso
