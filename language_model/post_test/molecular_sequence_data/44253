The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that interacts primarily with zzso Previous studies by others have shown that some forms of familial male precocious zzso are associated with zzso of the human zzso in the sixth zzso region that result in zzso zzso of the zzso This study demonstrates that a zzso corresponding to the lower portion of the sixth zzso region of the zzso can significantly activate zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso derived from zzso versus zzso zzso cells demonstrate that the stimulation of zzso by this zzso is due to an zzso of zzso As such, our data demonstrate a direct role for zzso region 6 of the rat zzso in zzso zzso and therefore raise the possibility that zzso in zzso region 6 of the zzso may directly affect the zzso of the zzso to zzso zzso these data are the first to demonstrate the ability of a zzso portion of a G zzso zzso in the absence of any contributions from an zzso loop region, to activate a G zzso
