zzso strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso gene was zzso zzso by targeted zzso were zzso The gene is one of the two potential zzso genes which have been found as a result of the zzso project with this zzso One of the zzso was characterized in zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso was absent in total zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso had little effect on the zzso of zzso in the isolated zzso complexes except for a zzso with an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso which was absent in the zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso confirmed that it was the translation product of zzso and further revealed a zzso of zzso zzso of zzso growth at different temperatures, the amount of zzso per cell, zzso electron transport rates with rates with various electron zzso the zzso of charge zzso between zzso and reduced zzso and the zzso ratio of zzso to zzso of the zzso were not significantly different from those of the wild zzso Furthermore, the zzso to zzso ratio of the zzso complexes isolated from the zzso was similar to that isolated from the wild zzso
