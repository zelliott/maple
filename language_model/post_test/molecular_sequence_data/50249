We have studied the mechanism of targeted zzso in zzso cells using a zzso zzso zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell zzso as a zzso Three structurally different targeting zzso with a zzso or a zzso or both, zzso zzso zzso in either a zzso or linear form, were zzso to the cells with a zzso zzso gene by zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were selected and analyzed to study the gene correction events of the deletion zzso Some half of 58 zzso clones obtained resulted from corrections of the deleted zzso zzso gene by either gene replacement or gene zzso a mechanism which is currently accepted for zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, the zzso sequence in the remaining half of the zzso remained zzso but their truncated end of the zzso gene in the incoming zzso was corrected by extending the end beyond the region of zzso to the target zzso the corrected zzso was then randomly integrated into the zzso This extension, termed end extension repair, was observed with all three zzso used and was as far as zzso zzso or more zzso It is evident that the novel repair reaction zzso by zzso zzso in addition to gene replacement and gene zzso is also involved in gene correction events in zzso zzso We discuss the model which may account for this zzso
