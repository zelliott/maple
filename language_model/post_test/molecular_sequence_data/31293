In DNA from a male patient of German and Polish ancestry who has zzso zzso zzso sequencing of all nine zzso and zzso boundaries corresponding to the coding region of the zzso zzso gene detected a zzso transition leading to the substitution of a stop signal for the zzso that normally determines a zzso at position 106 of the mature zzso zzso with zzso zzso at this position established that the patient was zzso for this zzso This zzso must lead to the synthesis of a sharply truncated zzso accounting for the zzso zzso noted in the zzso
