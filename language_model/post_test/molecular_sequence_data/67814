The zzso interference machinery has served as a zzso of zzso zzso since the divergence from zzso Although the basic components have a shared origin, zzso pathways directed by small zzso have evolved in diverse directions in different zzso zzso Micro zzso regulate zzso genes and play vital roles in plants and animals, but less is known about their functions in other zzso Here, we report, for the first time, deep sequencing of small zzso from the social zzso zzso zzso zzso from growing zzso zzso as well as from two zzso zzso stages was zzso zzso analyses combined with experimental data reveal the expression of zzso several of them exhibiting distinct expression patterns during zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of zzso in the zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso precursors generate zzso and, in most cases, zzso zzso whose zzso is dependent on the zzso protein zzso further supporting the presence of zzso in zzso zzso In addition, we find zzso processed from hairpin structures originating from an zzso as well as from a class of repetitive zzso We believe that these repetitive elements are sources for newly evolved zzso
