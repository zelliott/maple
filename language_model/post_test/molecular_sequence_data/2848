The DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene and its zzso regions was zzso The zzso gene contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 395 zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping experiments located the zzso start site of the zzso zzso The zzso sequence and the deduced zzso acid sequence for the zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso coli were zzso Although there are 279 zzso zzso most do not change the zzso acid zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso gene shows that there is an open reading frame upstream and an open reading frame downstream of the zzso The existence of the zzso transcribed upstream open reading frame zzso zzso was confirmed by the construction of an zzso zzso The zzso start site of zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso
