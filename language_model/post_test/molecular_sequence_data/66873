zzso zzso possess extremely truncated zzso Of 22 zzso 20 lack the entire zzso The zzso is necessary for the binding of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso translation system employs two different zzso factors named zzso and zzso Our previous study showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso binds specifically to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso acid zzso extension that is absent from zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are not zzso In this study, the recognition mechanism of zzso zzso by zzso was zzso Both modification interference zzso and primer extension analysis of zzso zzso complexes revealed that zzso interacts not only with the zzso zzso stem but also with the zzso This is the first example of an zzso recognizing the zzso of a zzso The binding activity of zzso was impaired by deletion of only 14 zzso from the zzso indicating that the zzso of zzso is required for its binding to zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso recognizes the zzso instead of the zzso by a mechanism involving its zzso zzso This study sheds light on the zzso of zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso
