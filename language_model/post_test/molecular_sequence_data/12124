We previously reported that leader zzso from zzso coli was extensively zzso by reaction with zzso with zzso and selective modification of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This indicated that one or both of these zzso zzso are important for the activity of the zzso In order to define further the role of individual zzso zzso in the activity of leader zzso zzso zzso studies were performed to replace each zzso zzso with zzso and/or zzso The replacements of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso hardly affected the zzso activity toward a synthetic zzso zzso and the ability to complement the temperature sensitivity of the zzso leader zzso in zzso coli zzso In contrast, the activity toward the synthetic zzso was significantly decreased by replacement of zzso with zzso or zzso The zzso values of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were reduced to zzso and zzso respectively, of that of the zzso zzso whereas the zzso values of these zzso zzso were almost identical with that of the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso ability in zzso coli zzso was lost zzso completely when zzso was replaced with zzso or zzso These results strongly indicate that zzso in leader zzso is important for the zzso mechanism and/or the construction of the active site structure of the zzso
