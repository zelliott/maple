The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pancreatic and zzso zzso factor 1 zzso could serve as a potential molecular target for the treatment of pancreatic zzso 

Cell zzso invasion capacity, and protein levels of cell cycle zzso were determined in human pancreatic cancer cells zzso with mouse zzso zzso alone or with zzso short hairpin zzso zzso and/or human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell growth and zzso were also evaluated in zzso in zzso zzso severe combined zzso mice receiving multiple treatments of intravenous zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso resulted in the significant increase of cell proliferation and invasion in zzso zzso but not zzso zzso This effect was blocked by knocking down zzso expression with zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells inhibited cell proliferation in zzso and suppressed tumor growth in zzso which was associated with increased tumor cell zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of the cell cycle with zzso of zzso D, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso 

zzso regulates cell proliferation and invasion in human pancreatic cancer zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso pancreatic cancer cell growth in zzso and in zzso zzso its use as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pancreatic zzso
