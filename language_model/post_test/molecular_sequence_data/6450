zzso a membrane protein of activated T cells, interacts with the B cell zzso zzso This interaction has been implicated in the rescue of zzso center B cells from zzso and in the rescue of zzso B zzso cells from zzso zzso In this report, we have demonstrated that the signal zzso by zzso acts upon zzso a zzso zzso zzso expression is strongly enhanced by zzso zzso engagement, while there is little or no induction by zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso is not significantly affected by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso but not sense zzso zzso for zzso can partially block this zzso zzso zzso This result suggests that the zzso of zzso by zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso rescue in zzso B zzso
