A zzso clone coding for an internal zzso of zzso zzso heavy chain was isolated from a zzso zzso human skeletal muscle zzso Six overlapping zzso zzso which span zzso heavy chain zzso and presumably interact with zzso were derived from this zzso fused to a zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso Three of the zzso were obtained by zzso zzso chain zzso which enables gene or zzso fragments to be amplified independently of zzso restriction zzso Initially, various experiments were carried out using a long zzso zzso heavy zzso fusion protein containing the 50 zzso zzso connecting region, the whole 20 zzso region and the short zzso 2 zzso This zzso fusion protein was chemically or zzso zzso in the same conditions as the native zzso zzso Whole and truncated forms of the zzso fusion protein were separated on zzso gels, zzso on zzso sheets and zzso They were then zzso in overlay experiments with zzso and/or zzso light chains in zzso zzso zzso were used to detect interactions between heavy chain fragments and zzso or light zzso We thus observed that one long heavy chain zzso zzso by zzso coli behaved like zzso or chemical zzso preparations made from native zzso zzso Two zzso fragments of the zzso fusion zzso which are soluble at low zzso strength, zzso with zzso in zzso Our results demonstrate that, in zzso overlay experiments with whole fusion zzso interactions seem to be due to the heavy chain fragment, not to the bacterial zzso All interactions were non zzso We further investigated the possible participation of the six zzso zzso fragments in contributing to the zzso zzso on the 50 zzso zzso regions of the human cardiac zzso The present zzso which enables the synthesis of any zzso zzso independent of any zzso site, is a powerful new tool for studying zzso relationships within the zzso zzso zzso
