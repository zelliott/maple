We describe an unusual element that activates the synthesis of short transcripts from a wide variety of zzso and small nuclear zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso III zzso This zzso of short transcripts zzso is located between positions -5 and zzso relative to the cap site in the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the total zzso activity of the different promoters is greatly increased, but the resulting additional zzso molecules are short, ending around position zzso zzso is not the zzso target zzso for zzso zzso however, because it relies entirely on cellular factors for activity, zzso may serve to provide abundant zzso targets for zzso zzso without a requirement for full-length viral zzso zzso
