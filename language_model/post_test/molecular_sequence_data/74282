Alternative zzso zzso site selection allows zzso to produce two zzso with opposite effects on zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and zzso by protein zzso C through specific zzso zzso zzso one of which is bound by zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso site is also enforced by zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso proteins and by zzso in cooperation with zzso zzso Here, we have characterized zzso elements that influence zzso to the zzso zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso Within a zzso region zzso located immediately upstream of the zzso donor site we have identified two elements zzso and zzso that stimulate zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to these elements and can shift zzso to the zzso zzso site of zzso in an zzso manner in zzso and in zzso The B3 region also contains an element that zzso the use of zzso This element is bound by zzso small nuclear zzso and contains two zzso zzso sites that can be used when the zzso zzso zzso site is zzso or the zzso elements are zzso zzso mutating the cryptic zzso zzso sites stimulates zzso to the zzso zzso Thus, zzso stimulates zzso to the downstream zzso zzso site of zzso thereby attenuating the repressive effect of upstream zzso zzso binding zzso
