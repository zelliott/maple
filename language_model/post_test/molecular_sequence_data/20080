Cell membrane zzso analysis is limited by inherent membrane zzso Conventional membrane protein extraction techniques use detergents, zzso and organic acids that require sample zzso or pH adjustment, and are associated with significant sample zzso We extracted membrane proteins from red blood cells zzso using methanol zzso zzso zzso and zzso and identified membrane proteins using zzso zzso coupled with zzso We show that organic zzso zzso and zzso methods have membrane protein analysis efficiencies comparable to zzso and are complementary for the recovery of both zzso and zzso zzso The mean grand average of zzso zzso value of identified peptides from the zzso method zzso was significantly higher than that of the zzso method zzso zzso zzso and zzso use of the organic zzso zzso and zzso increases the number of proteins identified, and the confidence of their zzso We show that this strategy is effective for shotgun membrane zzso zzso
