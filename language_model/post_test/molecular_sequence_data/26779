A zzso zzso strategy was employed to obtain four zzso of wheat zzso inhibitor zzso with the aim to produce inactive forms of this zzso The zzso were expressed in zzso coli as fusion proteins and, after the tag zzso were zzso to zzso Three zzso containing a single zzso at the sequence positions 49 or 50, were named zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso exhibited zzso activities comparable to that of the wild type zzso instead, zzso activity was zzso only for the zzso zzso A fourth zzso zzso containing a double zzso acid substitution at the inhibitor zzso site zzso was inactive against both zzso and zzso In order to investigate the interactions between the putative susceptible zzso and the zzso forms of zzso we performed zzso zzso experiments by zzso samples of the zzso with zzso and zzso zzso These experiments yielded information on the zzso complex formation, as well as on the timing of the zzso pattern of some of these zzso zzso modeling studies were carried out with the zzso models of the zzso and of their putative complexes with zzso and zzso In terms of zzso and zzso zzso networks, the observations made for each theoretical zzso complex were found to be fully coherent with experimental data zzso and zzso zzso and supplied specific zzso of interaction of each zzso with the zzso zzso
