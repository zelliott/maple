The zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is unusually zzso the large zzso zzso and small zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are only zzso of the length found in typical zzso and are even smaller than most of their zzso zzso zzso regulatory DNA and processed zzso sequences are similarly compact in zzso To shed light on the origins and implications of this zzso zzso the zzso sequence zzso the zzso zzso and domain I of zzso zzso was zzso Secondary structure analysis revealed that an zzso variable internal hairpin is partially zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso pairing with zzso zzso is zzso Previously characterized zzso zzso regions are extensively shortened within the zzso zzso in one case, a hairpin is precisely zzso The short sequences zzso the mature zzso zzso that are removed by zzso processing zzso and zzso are zzso our analysis suggests that the sequence zzso in a hairpin zzso may function as the processing zzso
