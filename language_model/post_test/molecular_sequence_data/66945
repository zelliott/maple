In this study, 4 overlapping fragments and 12 overlapping peptides of the zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso were expressed as zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins and used to probe a panel of 16 zzso protein zzso zzso zzso by zzso The minimal zzso sequence of the following seven zzso was determined by sequential deletion of terminal zzso acid zzso from each zzso zzso corresponded to zzso zzso corresponded to zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso against zzso Furthermore, a zzso containing this zzso cluster was recognized by zzso pig serum by Western zzso suggesting that zzso zzso represent an zzso region of the N zzso zzso alignment revealed that these zzso are well zzso among North American and European zzso of zzso These findings enhance our knowledge of the zzso structure of N protein and may facilitate the development of better diagnostic methods for zzso
