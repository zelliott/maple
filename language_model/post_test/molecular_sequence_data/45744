The nature of the factors leading to the conversion of the cellular prion protein zzso into its zzso zzso zzso is still matter of debate in the field of structural zzso The zzso structures of zzso zzso zzso from frog, chicken and turtle zzso zzso zzso zzso Perez, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (2005) zzso protein zzso structures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 102, zzso have provided some new and valuable information on the scaffolding elements that preserve the zzso zzso despite their low sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso The present molecular dynamics study of zzso focuses on the zzso properties of these proteins in comparison with the zzso zzso The data reveal new insights in the zzso zzso and focus on the implications for zzso folding stability and its propensity for zzso In addition, for the first time, a role in zzso the zzso zzso is suggested for a zzso zzso which is stabilized by the local zzso
