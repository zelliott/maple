zzso of protein zzso A zzso at discrete zzso sites zzso zzso and development in zzso Thus, zzso protein complexes may be involved in controlling these crucial biological zzso zzso of this proposition requires knowledge of zzso zzso proteins in the zzso We now report the discovery and characterization of zzso zzso a novel, zzso A zzso anchor zzso zzso zzso is a large zzso zzso zzso zzso protein that is zzso expressed in anterior zzso It binds regulatory zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso includes two zzso but zzso zzso sites zzso and zzso The B1 domain zzso zzso binds zzso approximately zzso more avidly than B2 zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso were exploited to demonstrate that the anchor protein is expressed in many cells in nearly all zzso throughout the lifespan of the zzso However, zzso is highly enriched and zzso positioned in zzso of zzso and in zzso portions of cells in gut and zzso The combination of zzso zzso binding activity with differential expression and polarized zzso is consistent with a role for zzso in creating target zzso for the reception of signals carried by zzso The zzso gene was mapped to the zzso region of the X zzso flies that carry a deletion for this portion of the X zzso lack zzso zzso
