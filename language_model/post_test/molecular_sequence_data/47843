The zzso zzso zzso zzso are a genetically zzso group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the zzso of zzso zzso in various zzso Progressive zzso with mental zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently recognized as a new zzso zzso zzso It is an zzso zzso disorder characterized by onset of generalized zzso between 5 and 10 years, and subsequent progressive mental zzso Here we report the zzso cloning of a novel zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso It encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso patients were zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso that was not found in zzso in 433 zzso We also cloned the mouse zzso zzso It displays zzso zzso identity with zzso conservation of the zzso zzso the human zzso and is localized to the same region as the motor zzso zzso zzso zzso a naturally occurring mouse zzso zzso zzso In zzso mice, we identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predicting a zzso and a truncated zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso in these zzso genes zzso zzso zzso in human and zzso and represent the first description of the molecular basis of a naturally occurring animal model for zzso
