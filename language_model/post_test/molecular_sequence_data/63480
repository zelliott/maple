zzso of zzso and zzso zzso has been found to enhance specifically the zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the role of the bacterial outer membrane in zzso zzso we zzso the activity of zzso zzso derived from the parent sequence zzso against several zzso coli strains and zzso zzso zzso bacteria, and zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and we also investigated the zzso zzso of the outer and inner membrane of zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria were distinctly less susceptible than the wild type zzso The patterns of zzso zzso of the outer and inner zzso coli zzso correlated well with the zzso activity, confirming that membrane zzso is a zzso effect of the peptides upon zzso zzso of zzso had no influence on the activity of the zzso parent zzso but the highly active zzso with three adjacent aromatic zzso required the complete zzso for zzso zzso Furthermore, differences in the activity of the parent zzso and its zzso sequence indicated zzso interactions with the zzso zzso zzso We suggest that, depending on the primary sequence of the zzso either zzso interactions with the fatty acid chains of zzso A, or zzso interactions disturbing the polar core region and interference with zzso interactions prevail in the zzso effect upon the outer membrane and thereby provide zzso accessibility to the inner zzso The results underline the importance of zzso and zzso zzso and their relative location for a high zzso effect, and the zzso function of the outer membrane of zzso zzso In addition to membrane zzso the data provided evidence for the involvement of other mechanisms in growth zzso and killing of zzso
