Fresh muscle tissue from six zzso deer from Southeastern Norway was examined for zzso zzso were excised and zzso classified by light zzso and some zzso were further examined by scanning electron zzso or DNA amplification and sequencing of the small zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were found and described by zzso and molecular zzso zzso zzso was found in all animals, whereas zzso zzso was found in only one zzso zzso zzso chain reaction identification was necessary for definitive species zzso since zzso of zzso zzso varied in surface structure and since zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso indistinguishable from zzso in other zzso zzso analyses based on complete zzso zzso gene sequences revealed a close relationship between zzso zzso and other zzso zzso species, whereas zzso zzso formed a zzso group with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso
