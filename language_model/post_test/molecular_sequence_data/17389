The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a protein zzso that is 58 % identical to the zzso factor A zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene was present in eight clinical zzso of zzso zzso When zzso was expressed on the surface of zzso zzso it promoted adherence to immobilized zzso and cell zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region A bound to immobilized zzso in a zzso manner and inhibited the adherence of both zzso and zzso strains of zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to immobilized zzso was also inhibited by rabbit zzso region A zzso and rabbit zzso region A zzso as well as by human zzso with a high level of zzso zzso zzso of the A zzso of zzso and zzso revealed that all of the zzso zzso implicated in binding to the zzso of zzso are zzso in zzso zzso zzso had a tenfold lower affinity for zzso suggesting that sequence differences that occur elsewhere in the zzso possibly in zzso E of domain zzso affect zzso zzso
