The zzso zinc cluster family of zzso regulatory proteins shares as zzso motif the zzso zinc zzso also known as the zzso zzso zzso This family includes zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso from zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso proteins were retrieved from databases by zzso to the zzso zinc zzso All were zzso and 56 were found in the entire zzso sequence of zzso zzso analysis suggests that 60 of the 79 proteins possess one or more zzso zzso regions succeeding the zzso zinc zzso Previous comparisons of zzso and seven other zzso zinc cluster proteins identified an additional region with weak zzso This region, designated the middle zzso region zzso was shown to be present in 50 of the 79 zzso Although reported zzso and deletion analyses suggest a role of zzso in regulation of protein activity, no function has yet been assigned specifically to this zzso We find that the family of zzso sequences is confined to zzso zinc cluster proteins and zzso that one zzso function is to assist the zzso zinc cluster in DNA target zzso
