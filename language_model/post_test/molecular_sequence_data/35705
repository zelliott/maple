The zzso protein of zzso zzso is a zinc zzso which has been shown to be a member of the bacterial neutral zzso zzso Its overall zzso structure is similar to that of zzso The zzso zzso structure of the zzso has been solved to high resolution in three different crystal zzso zzso zzso differences are observed in the protein in different crystal zzso In the absence of zzso and independently in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso the zzso is observed to have a relatively zzso zzso binding zzso while in the presence of zzso competitive zzso the active site zzso is zzso
