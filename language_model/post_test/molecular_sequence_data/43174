Although the La zzso binds to the 3' ends of all nascent zzso III zzso its function in zzso has long been zzso Although zzso zzso cells lacking the La protein zzso zzso are viable, cells containing a zzso that zzso the zzso stem of zzso require zzso for zzso We demonstrate that for the zzso zzso and other zzso zzso is required for the normal zzso removal of the 3' trailer zzso In cells lacking zzso the 3' trailer is removed by zzso Although maturation of the zzso zzso requires zzso introduction of a second zzso that restores base pairing eliminates the zzso We propose that binding by zzso zzso zzso in zzso that allow the 3' zzso zzso to zzso
