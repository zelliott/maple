zzso is an abundant zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso that contains a minor groove DNA binding motif called the zzso zzso In this report, we show that zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso on duplex DNA with a zzso greater affinity than to unmodified DNA with the same zzso Nevertheless, zzso bound to zzso DNA readily exchanges onto unmodified zzso zzso zzso and two-dimensional zzso on complexes of zzso and zzso zzso with DNA were employed to probe the mode of binding to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso requires a zzso zzso on zzso that promotes zzso of DNA by inserting into the zzso from the minor zzso We propose that zzso targets the zzso zzso by means of zzso by the zzso and that it can bind in either orientation with respect to the DNA zzso A zzso which also zzso between base pairs and functions in target selection on unmodified DNA, plays no apparent role in recognition of the zzso zzso Basic zzso acids within the zzso arm of zzso are required for zzso binding to the zzso zzso as well as to unmodified zzso zzso mediates its zzso by forming zzso zzso on DNA, and we find that zzso zzso are hypersensitive to zzso in comparison with the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso are slightly more resistant to hydrogen zzso and ultraviolet zzso zzso zzso appears to directly or indirectly function in zzso to enhance cellular resistance to zzso
