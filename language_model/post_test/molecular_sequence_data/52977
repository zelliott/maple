zzso zzso IV zzso which identify the regions essential for restoration of zzso activity to the zzso core complex of zzso zzso were generated and zzso Four zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had 100, 0, 0, and zzso of zzso activity of the zzso IV, indicating that zzso zzso are zzso zzso is associated with the core complex in the same manner as the zzso IV while zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not associate with the core complex, indicating that zzso IV requires its zzso zzso region zzso zzso for assembly into the zzso zzso Since zzso fusion protein has little zzso activity, some zzso in zzso zzso are required for zzso activity restoration after zzso IV is incorporated into the complex through the zzso zzso presumably by interaction with zzso b in the core zzso The interacting regions are identified as zzso zzso and zzso since zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had 95, 98, 53, and zzso of the zzso activity of the zzso zzso These two interacting regions are on the zzso side of the zzso membrane and closed to the DE loop and zzso G of zzso zzso zzso
