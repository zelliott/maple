One promising approach to cancer zzso involves the induction of phase II zzso metabolism zzso Since this approach requires drugs specifically intended to alter tissue gene expression patterns over long zzso it will be important to determine zzso which proteins are increased or decreased by treatment, and how such zzso may (or may zzso be related to the zzso zzso zzso We have employed two-dimensional zzso to detect and zzso gene expression effects of candidate zzso compounds in the zzso of treated zzso zzso an zzso of several phase II zzso affected a series of at least 26 zzso most of which were slightly decreased by zzso Several proteins were increased, the prime example being rat liver spot zzso which was induced more than zzso by zzso This protein was excised from multiple zzso gels and subjected to in zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso sequence zzso The resulting multiple zzso sequences match perfectly with the zzso sequence of rat zzso B1 zzso zzso zzso Using quantitative zzso of zzso from zzso gels, we compared a series of dose zzso zzso administration by zzso or in diet appeared equally effective, while recovery studies indicated a zzso of zzso days for disappearance of the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
