A combination of zzso computer modeling and zzso has been used to develop a structural model of a segment of the zzso zzso zzso termed zzso which is bound by zzso zzso In this model, the zzso zzso is located in a reverse hairpin loop that places key zzso important for zzso recognition and zzso zzso in a linear arrangement on the zzso zzso The zzso of the loop is stabilized by a zzso core which is critical for functional integrity of the zzso The proximity of the zzso and zzso zzso suggested that the zzso zzso could be zzso without diminishing zzso through replacement of these zzso with zzso and formation of a zzso zzso This prediction was confirmed zzso since the zzso zzso retained full zzso The model provides insight into zzso zzso functional diversity and the role of zzso to this region in neurological zzso
