The crystal structure of a zzso duplex zzso has been determined and refined to an zzso of zzso using X-ray data up to zzso A zzso The sequence zzso as a left-handed zzso double zzso with zzso base zzso There is one zzso duplex, a zzso zzso 71 water zzso and an unexpected zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This is the high-resolution zzso structure of a zzso zzso containing two AT base pairs in the interior of a duplex with no modifications such as zzso or zzso on zzso zzso This structure does not possess zzso zzso such as zzso zzso that are known to stabilize zzso The overall duplex structure and its crystal interactions are similar to those of the zzso form of the zzso zzso The spine of zzso in the minor groove is intact except in the vicinity of the zzso base zzso The binding of the zzso zzso in the minor grove of the zzso duplex appears to have a profound effect in zzso stability to a zzso zzso via zzso zzso and hydrogen bonding zzso The successive base stacking geometry in zzso is similar to the corresponding steps in zzso These results suggest that specific zzso such as zzso could serve as powerful zzso of zzso zzso in unmodified DNA sequences with AT base zzso This structure provides a molecular basis for stabilizing AT base pairs incorporated into an alternating zzso zzso
