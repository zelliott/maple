Between 59 and 60 zzso on the zzso coli genetic map, there is a highly zzso sequence of 29 base pairs, containing an zzso repeat of seven base pairs that appears 14 times, 32 or 33 base pairs apart, downstream of the zzso gene coding zzso About 24 zzso pairs downstream of the 14 repeats, a similar zzso sequence with a spacing of 32 base pairs appears seven zzso zzso sequences zzso with the zzso zzso were also detected in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso or zzso zzso
