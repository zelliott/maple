A novel method for the fragmentation of zzso and protein zzso at atmospheric pressure outside the mass zzso is zzso zzso zzso generated by zzso spray zzso zzso are carried through a heated coiled metal tube where they zzso zzso zzso of types zzso zzso and y are observed for peptides such as zzso II and zzso In the case of zzso zzso b and y zzso which preserve the zzso zzso groups are observed in the negative zzso mode, which is potentially useful in the location of zzso sites in proteins through chemical analysis of zzso The zzso zzso method extends to proteins such as zzso and zzso giving rise to zzso and other zzso zzso The most important feature of this method is that it also allows characterization of the neutral fragments arising from zzso zzso by use of zzso zzso discharge zzso This neutral zzso experiment is much easier to perform outside the mass zzso than as conventionally done, in zzso It yields increased structural information from the resulting mass zzso in both the positive and the negative zzso zzso
