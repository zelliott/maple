zzso zzso is a type II membrane zzso that zzso zzso active peptides at the cell surface thus regulating the local concentration of these peptides available for zzso binding and signal zzso In addition, the zzso zzso domain of zzso interacts with the zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso thereby regulating zzso signaling via zzso Thus, zzso serves dual functions in zzso and zzso signal zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso 6 within the zzso zzso zzso In zzso and cell culture experiments demonstrate that zzso 6 is efficiently zzso by protein zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso its interaction with zzso Interestingly, expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso abrogates the zzso effect of zzso on zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso Thus, our data demonstrate a regulatory role of zzso in the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso
