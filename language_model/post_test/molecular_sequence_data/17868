zzso of rat zzso zzso were zzso on zzso zzso gels and bands of zzso activity demonstrated by means of overlay zzso impregnated with zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristics of individual zzso bands were tested within the gels and after zzso and subsequent zzso from the zzso Some bands of activity were resistant to zzso by zzso of the gel with certain zzso but were subsequently found to be inhibited when tested with the same zzso after zzso These inconsistencies were influenced by the use of different zzso The results indicate that, though some useful screening information may be obtained by applying zzso to the gels, this system does not permit a reliable assessment of zzso characteristics which require subsequent zzso and zzso
