A new approach for the identification of zzso for the zzso of pharmaceutical proteins by affinity zzso is zzso The technique involves four zzso zzso of an appropriate site on the target zzso design of a complementary zzso compatible with the three-dimensional structure of the site, construction of a limited zzso zzso library of zzso zzso and solution synthesis of the hit zzso zzso zzso and application of the zzso for the zzso of the target zzso This strategy is exemplified by the zzso of a zzso human insulin precursor zzso from a crude zzso broth of zzso zzso
