Several bacteria of the zzso zzso zzso zzso produce 150 zzso zzso protein toxins referred as zzso zzso or zzso They associate with zzso companion proteins and form a complex termed zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibit zzso neurotransmitter zzso The cellular action of zzso can be depicted according to a zzso model : The zzso heavy chain mediates binding to specific receptors comprised of a zzso zzso and a zzso protein zzso for zzso type A, zzso for zzso type B), followed by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso recycling zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso of zzso the light chain of the zzso is zzso into the zzso Here, this zzso zzso one or two among three synaptic proteins zzso zzso and zzso As the three protein targets of zzso play major role in fusion of synaptic zzso at the release sites, their zzso is followed by blockade of neurotransmitter zzso zzso as the zzso receptors and zzso targets are present in all nerve zzso the zzso are not specific for zzso zzso zzso of their zzso action is mainly determined by the the zzso of the zzso light chain in the zzso zzso of new zzso which are zzso when the poisoned nerve terminals have recovered full zzso may lead to anticipated recovery of the poisoned nerve zzso
