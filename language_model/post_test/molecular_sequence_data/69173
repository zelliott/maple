We have analyzed base pairing interactions between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences during zzso zzso in a zzso in zzso zzso We constructed synthetic zzso genes with zzso that alter four bases zzso zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso 9 zzso zzso sequence zzso transient zzso of zzso cells with these zzso sequences cloned into a zzso expression zzso yielded high levels of the zzso zzso To test their function, we zzso a rabbit zzso gene containing one of two zzso zzso or zzso in the essential zzso zzso at the zzso end of the second zzso Certain zzso loop zzso activated novel zzso zzso sites only in zzso rabbit zzso zzso One novel site surprisingly resides in the first zzso its use is invariably coupled to zzso of a particular cryptic zzso zzso site in the second zzso All of the newly activated cryptic zzso zzso sites exhibit zzso with the zzso zzso loop in the zzso zzso zzso upstream of the cryptic site, extending previous results in zzso However, the register of the potential pairing is not identical at the various novel cryptic zzso zzso sites, indicating that the interaction between the zzso loop and the zzso zzso may be more flexible than previously zzso
