zzso of the human zzso zzso gene is activated in zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso factor 1 zzso is a nuclear factor whose DNA binding activity is induced by zzso in zzso cells, and zzso binds at a site in the EPO gene zzso that is required for hypoxic zzso of zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that zzso DNA binding activity is also induced by zzso in a variety of zzso cell lines in which the EPO gene is not zzso The composition of the zzso DNA binding complex and its isolated DNA binding zzso and the mechanism of zzso zzso appear to be similar or identical in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of reporter genes containing the EPO gene zzso is induced by zzso in zzso cells and zzso that eliminate zzso binding eliminate zzso These results provide evidence that zzso and its recognition sequence are common components of a general zzso cellular response to zzso
