zzso catalyze an important set of chemical transformations in zzso and zzso zzso have been made that catalyze a variety of additional zzso The possibility that zzso zzso or zzso can be made has only recently been zzso Specifically, it is unclear whether the absence of the 2' zzso renders DNA incapable of exhibiting efficient zzso activity, making it impossible to discover natural or create artificial DNA zzso 

We report the isolation by in zzso selection of two distinct classes of zzso zzso from a pool of zzso zzso Individual zzso from zzso zzso require both zzso and zzso to mediate zzso zzso Individual zzso from class II use zzso as the sole zzso Further zzso of a class II individual by in zzso selection yielded new zzso zzso that facilitate zzso zzso with rate enhancements exceeding 1 zzso zzso relative to the zzso rate of DNA zzso 

Despite the absence of 2' zzso zzso DNA can adopt structures that promote zzso zzso via an zzso zzso These results suggest that an efficient DNA zzso might be made to cleave DNA in a biological zzso
