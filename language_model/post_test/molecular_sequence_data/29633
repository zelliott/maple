In the course of trying to understand the zzso of zzso in relation to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a major zzso zzso has been found to bind zzso and with high affinity to a zzso cell surface protein of zzso zzso This interaction involves a single class of binding sites, which are zzso in nature, zzso and possibly involves zzso zzso activity was significantly enhanced by zzso an effect possibly zzso through zzso zinc zzso sequences on zzso zzso studies with zzso against zzso chains and specific peptides with adhesive properties revealed that the binding site was localized in one of the zzso zinc finger consensus sequences of B1 chain containing the specific zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, incubation of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso directed against the zzso zzso protein zzso induced zzso zzso of proteins with a molecular mass ranging from 115 to 130 zzso These studies suggest a role for zzso in the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso which may mediate one or more downstream zzso events necessary for establishment of zzso
