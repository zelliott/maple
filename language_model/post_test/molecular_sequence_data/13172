The effects of the zzso administration of a low dose of zzso for zzso days on the gene expression of zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso and zzso content in the zzso zzso were examined in zzso The simultaneous changes of protein and zzso content in the zzso were also zzso zzso was infused continuously into the zzso at a dose of 3 zzso per day, calculated to zzso to a dose of zzso zzso in zzso Seven days after the administration of zzso a liquid meal zzso zzso zzso was introduced into the stomach and changes in the zzso zzso content and plasma zzso concentration were zzso The level of zzso zzso in the zzso was significantly higher in rats treated with zzso than in control zzso The plasma zzso zzso the zzso content of the zzso zzso and the composition of pancreatic zzso did not significantly differ in rats treated with zzso and the zzso zzso In control rats, the administration of the liquid meal increased the plasma zzso concentration and significantly decreased the zzso zzso content in water zzso but did not affect the amount extracts in acid whereas the zzso of the meal did not cause any significant changes in rats treated with zzso These findings indicate that a low dose of zzso stimulates the gene expression of zzso without enhancing zzso release or exerting an effect on the zzso
