zzso zzso 2A zzso is a major zzso zzso that regulates a wide variety of cellular zzso The zzso activity and zzso zzso of zzso are determined by three distinct families of cellular regulatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso also known as zzso is the most diverse, consisting of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The gene zzso zzso has been designated as zzso and encodes three zzso spliced zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, conflicting zzso zzso have been reported in human zzso zzso The original zzso mapping placed the gene on zzso zzso whereas subsequent studies using radiation hybrid analysis localized zzso to zzso zzso In this study, by radiation hybrid zzso FISH analysis, zzso clone sequencing, and zzso analysis, we show that the functional gene zzso exists at zzso and gives rise to three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas a zzso zzso zzso zzso is present at zzso We also report the zzso organization of both the functional gene and the zzso
