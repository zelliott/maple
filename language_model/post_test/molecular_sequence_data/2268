We have constructed a zzso DNA expression library and screened it with zzso in order to clone the zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso This gene encodes a protein found at the base of the muscle zzso structures which attach zzso thin filaments to the zzso We report the complete sequence of the zzso zzso its zzso on the zzso zzso genetic map, and the finding that it encodes a protein with a sequence very similar to chicken zzso We also show that the difference in size between this zzso protein and chicken zzso is due in part to the absence from the zzso sequence of one of the three internal repeats found in the chicken zzso
