A full length zzso zzso the growth hormone zzso zzso of Chinese sturgeon was cloned in order to investigate the mechanism of growth hormone in regulating the growth of Chinese zzso The open reading frame of the cloned Chinese sturgeon growth hormone zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein of 611 zzso acids containing all the characteristic motifs of zzso By sequence zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso highly zzso in other species were zzso Using the zzso cell culture system, the function of zzso and the biological significance of the zzso acid substitution in zzso were zzso The promoter of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso was zzso upon stimulation of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells zzso expressing zzso were zzso to zzso by zzso In agreement with our previous report, Chinese sturgeon growth zzso protein zzso was detected in the culture medium of zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso binding motif in zzso to zzso significantly enhanced zzso biological function, whereas zzso of zzso zzso to Ala decreased its biological zzso The results demonstrated that the cloned zzso was of full biological function and the zzso could be generated through zzso of zzso These findings might provide new insights into thoroughly understanding the regulatory mechanism of Chinese sturgeon zzso
