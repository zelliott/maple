zzso clones zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso group of nuclear zzso zzso were identified by screening an adult female zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso acid zzso the largest member of the zzso group of nuclear receptors and also the largest nuclear zzso reported to zzso zzso retains a typical domain zzso of nuclear receptors exhibiting zzso sequence identity in the DNA binding domain and zzso sequence identity in the zzso binding domain compared with its zzso zzso contains a large zzso domain and hinge zzso zzso also contains a 100 zzso acid F domain, which is absent from its zzso zzso zzso is expressed in every stage of the zzso zzso life cycle, exhibiting an elevated expression level in zzso Western zzso analysis identified two forms of zzso protein in adult zzso Our in zzso DNA binding zzso showed that zzso binds to the zzso consensus hormone response element, suggesting a functional conservation among the zzso group members in terms of DNA binding zzso A zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso domain, F domain and zzso part of the hinge region in zzso when zzso to a zzso DNA binding domain, exhibited an autonomous zzso zzso zzso
