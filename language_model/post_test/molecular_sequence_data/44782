In the zzso cell, zzso stimulates zzso of a zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso of corresponding zzso and zzso zzso The regulation of this zzso gene is an important component of the zzso state induced by this zzso Given the ubiquitous nature of this regulation controlling zzso levels, the molecular basis for the zzso induction was further zzso zzso stimulation of the zzso cell causes the zzso of only two of the four known zzso zzso zzso and zzso The promoter controlling the expression of these two messages was identified and zzso An zzso zzso containing a coding zzso as well as zzso sequence of the zzso zzso was isolated from rat zzso libraries and zzso No zzso box was identified, but zzso regions were present upstream of the putative translation start zzso zzso protection and zzso analysis indicated the presence of at least two distinct cap zzso This zzso region had promoter activity when zzso both in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso promoter activity was contributed by regions upstream of both cap zzso zzso from this promoter was activated by zzso and zzso and elements responsible for zzso regulation were present upstream from the second cap zzso These data demonstrate that an zzso promoter that is zzso and zzso directs the expression of these truncated zzso zzso
