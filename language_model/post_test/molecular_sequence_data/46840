zzso zzso bean zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso alone is not zzso by its zzso zzso zzso zzso regardless of whether it is acquired from artificial diets or directly zzso into the zzso zzso The zzso virus contains all of the genetic information required for its infection cycle as it readily zzso in zzso zzso and zzso infected zzso zzso zzso that were zzso zzso using gold particles coated with intact zzso or viral zzso The bombarded plants not only developed the typical disease syndrome, thus indicating that zzso is the sole zzso agent of the disease, but also served as a source from which the virus was readily acquired and transmitted by zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso virus in zzso zzso suggests that zzso requires a helper factor zzso for its zzso transmission that is either zzso or absent in zzso virus zzso The requirement for an zzso was confirmed in zzso experiments using two distinct zzso of the zzso These experiments revealed that zzso transmitted the zzso virus isolate from artificial diets only when they had fed previously on plants infected with the other zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso which persisted to the same extent in zzso zzso as naturally acquired virus, was zzso when zzso had acquired the zzso from infected zzso This suggests that one of the functions of the zzso in the transmission process is to facilitate virus transport across the zzso zzso zzso
