zzso zzso D zzso has been proposed to be responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules to generate zzso zzso zzso which have growth zzso zzso We have cloned the mouse liver zzso zzso which has a sequence that differs from that previously isolated from a mouse zzso cell zzso Using a highly specific and very sensitive zzso protection zzso we found that the zzso expressed in zzso brain, zzso and zzso cells is identical to that isolated from zzso The expression of mouse zzso in liver shows a complex genetic regulation with a mouse zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso levels were higher in zzso old animals compared to older animals, and the zzso zzso levels increased in mice that developed insulin dependent type 1 diabetes zzso This suggests that the expression of liver zzso in mice is highly zzso
