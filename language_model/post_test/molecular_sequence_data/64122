zzso of the zzso family are widespread in animal zzso and have apparently infected them by horizontal zzso Most species carry only old defective copies of particular zzso zzso that have zzso greatly from their active zzso transferred zzso while a few contain young, very similar, and active zzso We report here the use of a zzso screen in bacteria to isolate somewhat zzso zzso copies from the European zzso zzso zzso that zzso functional zzso zzso and zzso coding sequences of zzso and zzso copies of zzso from the European honey zzso zzso zzso were zzso to examine their molecular zzso No selection for sequence conservation was detected in any zzso of a tree derived from these zzso not even on branches leading to functional zzso This agrees with the current model for zzso zzso evolution that expects neutral evolution within particular zzso with selection for function occurring only upon horizontal transfer to a new zzso Our results further suggest that zzso are not finely tuned genetic entities and that a greater amount of sequence diversification than had previously been appreciated can occur in functional copies in a single host zzso Finally, this method of zzso active copies can be used to isolate other novel active zzso without resorting to reconstruction of ancestral zzso
