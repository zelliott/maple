We have performed the first DNA molecular zzso analysis of giant zzso An approximately zzso zzso of the zzso large zzso zzso zzso was zzso for all eight species of giant clams and two species of an zzso zzso the edible zzso zzso The data were analyzed using a maximum zzso approach and a single most zzso tree was zzso The resulting zzso hypothesis indicates that the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso sister zzso zzso zzso is the sister zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso with these latter three zzso all being placed in a single zzso zzso zzso The number of recognized giant clam species has increased by one-third over the last two decades with the discovery of two rare new species having restricted geographic zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso These two species lack a known fossil record but exhibit greater genetic distances from sister zzso than do extant giant clam species pairs which are recognizable in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We propose that the two new species represent ancient zzso lineages of zzso zzso
