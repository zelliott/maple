The performance and the efficiency of several cellulose derivatives as a molecular zzso agent for the zzso zzso separation of DNA restriction fragments were zzso All fragments up to 12,000 base pairs zzso in the zzso DNA zzso were resolved using linear zzso zzso filled with a buffer solution containing zzso cellulose zzso and the separation was completed within 17 zzso zzso zzso cellulose zzso solutions are effective for the complete separation of small fragments zzso zzso of a zzso and a zzso digest of zzso zzso zzso A plate number of zzso zzso zzso plates per zzso was zzso The migration time and the resolution of DNA fragments were manipulated by varying several zzso such as the size zzso and the concentration of cellulose derivatives and the applied field zzso Some guidelines are presented for choosing these zzso depending on the size of the DNA fragments being zzso
