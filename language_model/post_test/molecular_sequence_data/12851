The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a highly active raw zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso reducing groups from zzso zzso containing both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso this industrially important alpha Amy was cloned as a zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso was determined, revealing an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso mature protein zzso with a calculated zzso of zzso The similarity between the zzso sequence of zzso and those of other alpha Amy showed four common zzso regions characteristic of the alpha Amy protein family: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence revealed significant zzso to the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso alpha Amy, various bacterial zzso zzso a zzso and the zzso of a zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso promoter and Northern zzso analysis showed the presence of a single zzso zzso The zzso signal zzso of the zzso protein efficiently directed its zzso into the medium when expressed in zzso
