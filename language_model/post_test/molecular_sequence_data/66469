The induction of zzso zzso genes controlled by the zzso function alternative zzso factor zzso is strongly impaired in a strain deleted for the zzso zzso gene and in a double knockout of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso soluble forms of the zzso zzso factor zzso are stabilized in a zzso minus strain as revealed by the green fluorescent reporter protein fused to the zzso of zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in the zzso region of zzso and zzso in these positions abolish induction of zzso zzso Following alkaline zzso a truncated zzso form of zzso is zzso in a strain expressing a triple zzso zzso zzso of zzso These data point to a mechanism where the zzso segment of zzso contains a cryptic zzso tag that is uncovered as a result of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso After zzso zzso is detached from the zzso this zzso tag becomes crucial for the complete degradation of zzso by zzso zzso and the release of zzso zzso plays a major role in this third zzso step of zzso degradation of zzso zzso of zzso green fluorescent protein as a zzso zzso protein reduces zzso induction of a zzso gene by a factor of about three, indicating that a zzso mechanism is able to tune the zzso stress response to the cellular zzso
