It is known that zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso of zzso mice are zzso of distinctive zzso zzso one of which is the individual zzso zzso that is represented by zzso or zzso to myeloma zzso In the present study, we established T cell line of zzso type which recognized the Id of zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso and investigated its specificity and zzso The T cell line, named zzso had a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and expressed zzso cell receptors zzso zzso proliferated in response to zzso in an zzso manner but did not respond to zzso which had substitution at zzso acids 100 and zzso We confirmed that zzso recognized zzso zzso using synthetic peptides corresponding to two serial zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso spanning the zzso zzso in the third zzso region zzso of the heavy zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso B cells which were isolated from zzso mice activated zzso but B cells from zzso mice did zzso zzso produced zzso zzso and zzso but did not produce zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited the growth of zzso myeloma cells zzso to the zzso mice in zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso T cells, zzso are involved in Id network and may play a role in zzso zzso is useful for analysis of the role of the zzso helper T cells in immune network because zzso zzso is frequently present on zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso
