zzso peptides derived from the human zzso protein zzso were produced in zzso coli as fusion proteins with human zzso zzso cultures transformed with the gene zzso the fusion protein were grown to a high cell density zzso and induced with zzso to initiate product zzso Fusion protein accumulated into zzso inclusion bodies and zzso zzso was released from zzso by acid zzso at an engineered zzso zzso zzso Acid zzso of zzso inclusion bodies at pH zzso followed zzso zzso and did not require prior inclusion body zzso in zzso or zzso Surprisingly, at pH zzso and 85 degrees C, cell zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso release occurred zzso zzso cultures were, therefore, adjusted to approximately pH zzso with zzso directly in the zzso and incubated at elevated zzso zzso which is soluble in the zzso zzso environment, was separated from the zzso material and zzso using column separation zzso zzso zzso was separated from the zzso zzso culture with zzso recovery and a final zzso purity of zzso zzso zzso prepared by zzso and solid phase synthesis methods demonstrated similar activity against zzso zzso in a broth zzso zzso
