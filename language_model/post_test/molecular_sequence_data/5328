We have previously reported the presence of zzso bound zzso linked zzso with unusually high degrees of zzso zzso zzso 7) in the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso To confirm this zzso we have prepared these zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso and TLC analysis revealed zzso up to zzso For both zzso zzso analysis confirmed the exclusive presence of zzso linkages in the pools of zzso with a zzso higher than 6 which presented an average zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso These results are important to consider in relation with the ability of these zzso zzso derived zzso to trigger zzso synthesis according to their zzso
