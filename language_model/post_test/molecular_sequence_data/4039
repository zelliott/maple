zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso inherited zzso cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germ line zzso in the zzso zzso coli gene zzso For zzso zzso timely identification of patients at risk is zzso Here, zzso assisted laser zzso zzso - time of flight - mass zzso zzso zzso is offered for an efficient molecular diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso 

The four most frequent zzso germ line zzso (three zzso one point zzso were zzso by zzso specific zzso and termination of extension zzso The extension products generated were analyzed by zzso 

Following zzso amplification and zzso specific primer extension reactions zzso allowed the zzso identification of zzso zzso acid fragments corresponding to distinct zzso or zzso even in duplex zzso zzso were confirmed by zzso 

Due to its high molecular resolution and zzso this method is highly suitable as an alternative for clinical zzso zzso
