The discovery of genetically distinct zzso in zzso zzso zzso Family zzso from widely separated geographic regions challenges the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso Family zzso and zzso are the primordial zzso hosts of zzso and also predicts that other zzso harbor zzso Recently, novel zzso zzso have been detected in zzso of the Family zzso including the Japanese shrew mole zzso zzso and American shrew mole zzso zzso We present new insights into the evolutionary history of zzso gained from a highly divergent zzso designated Nova virus zzso identified in the European common mole zzso zzso captured in zzso 

zzso alignment and comparison of the full-length zzso and zzso segments indicated moderately low sequence similarity of zzso and zzso at the zzso and zzso acid levels, respectively, between zzso and representative zzso and zzso zzso Despite the high degree of sequence zzso the predicted secondary structure of the zzso zzso protein exhibited the characteristic zzso zzso at the zzso end, and the zzso zzso typically found in zzso were well zzso zzso zzso using zzso and zzso methods, showed that zzso formed a distinct zzso that was zzso distant from all other zzso 

zzso identified zzso zzso by zzso and zzso support long-standing zzso relationships and suggest that ancestral zzso rather than zzso may have been the early or original zzso zzso
