The zzso gene from zzso zzso was cloned using zzso zzso zzso designed from zzso regions of zzso proteins from other zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso a putative zzso protein with zzso zzso acid sequence similarity to the zzso protein from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was induced by exposure to zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso box was identified in the region upstream of the zzso Since this zzso operator site is zzso in many zzso zzso gene regions from zzso bacteria, the results suggest that the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso gene also involves the binding of a zzso protein to this zzso
