zzso engineering of the zzso fold of zzso coli zzso has enabled conversion of this transfer zzso to a class II structure while retaining recognition properties of a class I zzso zzso The new zzso possesses the zzso variable zzso of zzso zzso zzso Enlargement of the zzso appears essential to maintaining a stable zzso structure in this species, while zzso of a base triple in the zzso zzso is critical for efficient zzso These data provide new insight into structural zzso distinguishing the class I and class II zzso zzso and demonstrate a marked sensitivity of zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso
