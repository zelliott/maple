We present a brief overview of the present knowledge on the structural and molecular properties of zzso II receptors and the various attempts to determine their primary structures, with special reference to our strategy for zzso zzso The strategy involves zzso labeling of the zzso with synthetic zzso zzso zzso followed by indirect affinity zzso on immobilized zzso The various applications of these zzso to the study of structural and molecular properties and to the cell biology of zzso II receptors are zzso
