As part of efforts to identify candidate genes for disease mapping to the zzso region, we have assembled a zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing eight tightly linked zzso These zzso and zzso were restriction mapped using eight rare cutting zzso with the goal of identifying zzso zzso One such island was identified by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso sites, and corresponded to the zzso linking clone zzso described zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing this zzso island was zzso and partially zzso A zzso search using the sequence obtained from either side of the zzso site identified an expressed sequence tag with zzso to the zzso periodic zzso protein 2 zzso Several zzso corresponding to the human zzso gene were identified and partially zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed a zzso transcript that was well expressed in all zzso zzso A zzso consensus of zzso zzso was zzso and an open reading frame potentially zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was zzso The predicted protein shows zzso identity and 57% similarity at the zzso acid level to the zzso zzso zzso which is a member of the zzso containing zzso and potentially encodes a zzso beta zzso The zzso gene is split into 21 zzso ranging in size from 53 to 516 zzso and spans an estimated 25 zzso The gene is transcribed in a zzso direction, with its zzso end mapping approximately 195 zzso zzso to the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso Four single zzso zzso were identified using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions of the protein based on zzso to other members of the zzso family are zzso
