The zzso acid composition of zzso zzso proteins and protein segments characteristically differs from that of ordered zzso This observation forms the basis of several disorder prediction zzso zzso however, usually perform worse for smaller proteins (or zzso than for larger zzso We show that the regions of zzso acid composition space corresponding to ordered and zzso proteins overlap with each other, and the extent of the overlap (the zzso zzso is larger for short than for long zzso To explain this finding, we used two-dimensional lattice model proteins containing zzso zzso and charged zzso and revealed the relation among chain zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso Because the number of chain zzso zzso grows with chain zzso a larger fraction of longer chains can reach a zzso ordered state than do shorter zzso The amount of information carried by the zzso acid composition about whether a protein or segment is zzso grows with increasing chain zzso Smaller proteins rely more on specific interactions for stability, which limits the possible accuracy of disorder prediction zzso For proteins in the zzso zzso size can determine order, as illustrated by the example of two-state zzso
