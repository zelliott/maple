Control of zzso C virus zzso infection could be influenced by the timing and magnitude of zzso T cell responses against individual zzso We characterized zzso T cells targeting seven Pan zzso zzso class zzso zzso during primary and secondary zzso infections of a zzso All zzso zzso zzso bound multiple human zzso zzso indicating the potential for overlap in zzso targeted by both zzso Some human zzso class II molecules efficiently zzso zzso production by zzso zzso T cell zzso Moreover, one zzso zzso designated zzso zzso overlapped a helper zzso that is presented by multiple zzso molecules in humans who spontaneously resolved zzso zzso Resolution of primary infection in the zzso was associated with an initial wave of zzso T cells targeting a limited set of dominant zzso including zzso A second wave of zzso zzso T cells targeting other zzso zzso appeared in blood several weeks later after virus replication was mostly zzso During a second infection 7 years later, zzso T cells against all zzso appeared in blood sooner and at higher zzso but the pattern of dominance was zzso In zzso primary zzso infection in this individual was characterized by T cell populations targeting two groups of zzso class zzso zzso that differed in frequency and zzso of appearance in zzso The zzso nature of the zzso T cell response, if broadly zzso to other zzso chimpanzees and humans, could be a factor governing the outcome of zzso zzso
