A zzso model has been generated for the zzso domain of zzso a component of an zzso K channel, based on the zzso structure of the bacterial channel zzso Analysis of the zzso and zzso surfaces of the model reveals them to be compatible with the known features of membrane proteins and zzso channels, zzso The zzso zzso model was used as the starting point for zzso molecular dynamics simulations in a zzso zzso zzso The overall drift from the model structure was comparable to that seen for zzso in previous similar zzso zzso analysis of the interactions of the zzso channel model with zzso zzso and water molecules during these simulations suggests that concerted zzso motion of zzso zzso and water through the selectivity filter zzso This is similar to such motion observed in simulations of zzso This suggests that a zzso mechanism is zzso between different K channel structures and may be robust to changes in simulation zzso zzso of zzso and zzso suggests some degree of flexibility in the zzso thus complicating models of zzso selectivity based upon a rigid zzso
