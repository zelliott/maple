African green monkeys zzso infected by zzso zzso virus zzso zzso are resistant to zzso zzso zzso exhibit levels of zzso similar to those described during zzso human zzso virus type 1 zzso and zzso infections in humans and zzso respectively, but contain lower viral loads in their zzso zzso We addressed the potential role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in viral zzso In previous studies, it has been shown that human zzso and zzso zzso allow transmission of zzso and zzso to T zzso Here, we looked at the ability of zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso to interact with zzso We show that zzso cells are present mainly in the zzso and often within the zzso and/or zzso of zzso zzso zzso We describe the isolation and characterization of at least three zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is 92 and zzso identical to the corresponding human and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is characterized by the lack of the fourth motif in the repeat zzso This deletion was also detected in the zzso gene derived from thirteen animals belonging to five other African monkey species and from four zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite three- to zzso modifications compared to zzso zzso allows transmission of zzso to T zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressed at least 100,000 zzso molecules and were able to transmit zzso to T zzso At a low zzso of infection zzso 50% tissue culture zzso zzso viral transmission by zzso zzso was mainly zzso zzso The present study reveals that zzso from a natural host species of zzso has the ability to act as an efficient attachment and transmission factor for zzso and suggests the absence of a direct link between this ability and viral load levels in zzso zzso
