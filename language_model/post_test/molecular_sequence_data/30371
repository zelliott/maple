zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was investigated by comparing zzso and a synthetic zzso zzso zzso & Anderson (1983) zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso In several zzso the activity ratio was higher when zzso with zzso as the zzso this result was obtained in control zzso and also in those incubated with agents known to increase zzso zzso The effect of these agents to increase the activity ratio was more clearly demonstrated with zzso zzso The higher activity ratios observed with zzso are due to: zzso measurement of zzso not zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso by zzso during the zzso zzso When zzso were zzso in buffers without zzso lower activity ratios were found, zzso to the zzso zzso being zzso removed from the zzso zzso We conclude that the measured activity ratio more faithfully reflects that in the tissue when zzso is included in the homogenization buffer and zzso is used in the zzso This was confirmed in experiments where zzso zzso protein zzso was added to the tissue before zzso and no zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso
