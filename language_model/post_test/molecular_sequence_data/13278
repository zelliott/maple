Crystal structure of the complex of zzso with zzso zzso was determined using direct X-ray zzso zzso The zzso state of the complex is similar to that determined earlier for free zzso zzso of it is the zzso bracelet shape stabilized by six zzso zzso hydrogen bonds of 4 zzso 1 zzso The zzso zzso is located in an inner zzso charged zzso cavity formed by six zzso oxygen atoms of zzso zzso The observed differences in zzso angles of the complex and free are caused by readjustment of the geometry of the zzso cavity to the size of the zzso bound during zzso
