zzso of the zzso acid sequence containing a large number of internal symmetry zzso were identified in the primary structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso product of zzso by means of a comparative analysis of zzso acid zzso roots zzso The highest density of zzso segments was discovered in the zzso zzso zzso segment which is responsible for the zzso zzso in the membrane and contains a zzso zzso and is one of the central zzso and zzso zzso segments of zzso zzso acid sequences zzso and zzso on the one hand, are structurally similar to zzso proteins zzso and so, may participate in formation of the zzso zzso zzso that interacts with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and, on the other hand, they are able to form some zzso These data agree with the supposition about evolutionary conservation of the zzso structures in molecular segments of zzso which determine their functional zzso The graphic method of the zzso sequence analysis suggested by the authors has permitted identifying repeating zzso sequences of zzso zzso acids in the zzso zzso They are a result of DNA sequence zzso and zzso in zzso Moreover, two long segments zzso and zzso possessing (after alignment of their zzso acid zzso zzso identical and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso were found in the zzso region of zzso These data, probably, testify to zzso of the zzso zzso coding these zzso
