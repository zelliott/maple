zzso zzso is a pediatric zzso tumor that is often difficult to distinguish from other small zzso zzso The zzso and zzso gene zzso that result from zzso zzso in this tumor provide potential molecular diagnostic zzso To apply these molecular markers to commonly available archival material, we used reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso methodology to develop an zzso capable of identifying zzso and zzso fusion transcripts in zzso zzso zzso Use of a control zzso for zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso was successfully isolated, zzso and amplified in 15 of 16 archival zzso zzso of zzso results for the zzso and zzso zzso with standard molecular zzso of paired frozen material revealed that all eight cases of known zzso zzso were correctly identified and distinguished as zzso or zzso The seven cases of known zzso zzso showed no evidence of either zzso These results indicate that we have developed a molecular zzso that accurately identifies the fusion transcripts characteristic of zzso zzso in archival zzso This zzso will be useful for diagnosis and for retrospective zzso zzso zzso
