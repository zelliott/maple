The zzso zzso zzso zzso I) is an assembly of approximately 26 different zzso In zzso and zzso seven of its zzso are the products of genes in the zzso DNA, and zzso of these genes have been found previously in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso although their function in the zzso is zzso The remainder of the zzso of the zzso complex are nuclear gene products that are imported into the zzso amongst them the 49 zzso zzso a component of the zzso zzso of the zzso In the present work, the zzso sequence of this protein has been determined, and this has been used to design two zzso of synthetic zzso each containing 32 different sequences 17 bases zzso These zzso have been used as zzso zzso to isolate zzso clones from a bovine zzso The DNA sequences of these clones have been determined and they zzso the mature 49 zzso zzso with the exception of zzso acids 1 and zzso The protein sequence of 430 zzso acids is closely related to those of proteins that are zzso in open reading frames zzso present in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Only one zzso is zzso and the sequences provide no indication that the 49 zzso protein contains zzso zzso These zzso are found in the single copy regions of zzso DNA in close proximity to four of the zzso of the zzso zzso genes that zzso zzso of complex zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
