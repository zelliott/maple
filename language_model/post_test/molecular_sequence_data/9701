We used partially zzso zzso and a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify the zzso sequences of zzso recognized by zzso and to study the specific effect of zzso on this zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso I zzso analysis showed that zzso binds a region of zzso which spans 92 zzso and contains three copies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso up to 100 zzso had no effect on the binding of zzso to zzso The zzso zzso protection zzso in zzso and in zzso showed that bases zzso zzso zzso and zzso form direct contacts with zzso in the absence of added zzso in zzso these bases were protected but became exposed to zzso in a zzso zzso zzso these bases were protected in zzso by the zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso but not zzso removed the protection of zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso Exposure of intact cells to 100 zzso zzso but not zzso exposed zzso The zzso effect of zzso in zzso was observed at 20 zzso and was pH dependent, vanishing below pH zzso In contrast to zzso zzso was exposed to zzso by the zzso only in zzso suggesting a requirement for another factor existing only in zzso for this zzso We suggest that zzso is both sensor and zzso of the zzso signal and that it regulates zzso expression by undergoing a zzso change upon zzso binding which zzso the zzso contact zzso
