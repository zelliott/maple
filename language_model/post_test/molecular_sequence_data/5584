This paper reports the establishment of a model for zzso host zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso E6 zzso zzso of zzso virus strain zzso were analyzed for their zzso and genetic zzso The zzso zzso was well adapted for reproduction in bank zzso but not in cell culture, while the zzso E6 strains zzso to much higher efficiency in cell culture but did not zzso zzso bank zzso zzso of the consensus sequences of the respective viral zzso revealed no differences in the coding region of the S zzso However, the zzso regions of the S gene were found to be different at positions 26 and zzso In one additional and independent adaptation experiment, all analyzed zzso clones from the zzso zzso zzso were found to carry zzso at position zzso of the S segment, just 3 zzso downstream of the zzso observed in the first zzso No differences were found in the consensus sequences of the entire M segments from the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The results indicated different impacts of the S and the M zzso segments for the adaptation process and selective advantages for the zzso that carried altered zzso sequences of the S zzso We conclude that the isolation in cell culture resulted in a zzso and zzso altered zzso
