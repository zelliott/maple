zzso zzso is a widely found and important zzso in zzso The kidney is a major zzso organ of which the zzso zzso play a crucial role in the maintenance of zzso zzso functioning via salt and water zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, the zzso of zzso is the first identified and the most abundant member of zzso family, affecting the zzso affinity of zzso in the zzso Based on DNA zzso analysis, the expression levels of zzso gene are markedly increased upon zzso zzso Combined with zzso analysis using the zzso database, we identified an unnamed protein with 145 zzso zzso of which the zzso involved the zzso sequence similar to zzso and zzso and thus, named as zzso However, the role of zzso protein in the regulation of zzso expression in the kidney has not been zzso In this study, we found that the zzso and protein levels of zzso were significantly increased upon zzso zzso zzso data revealed that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso the functional zzso of zzso using short hairpin zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our study offers novel insight into the potential function of zzso in promoting zzso activity upon zzso challenge in zzso zzso
