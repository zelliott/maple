Proper distribution of immune cells in the zzso is a prerequisite for successful zzso and subsequent zzso but zzso signals that govern such events have not been well zzso In the present study, the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso protein 10 zzso zzso was identified from a zzso zzso study between zzso zzso zzso from Day 17 pregnant and Day 15 zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso expression and the involvement of zzso in the recruitment of immune cells were then zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that large amounts of zzso zzso were present during zzso attachment to maternal zzso and early zzso zzso zzso was localized to zzso distributed in the zzso zzso of pregnant but not zzso zzso This finding was supported by the discovery of zzso zzso expression in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso cells, or zzso zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso zzso by the zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso manner, but the expression of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso was most zzso by zzso In a zzso zzso migration of peripheral blood zzso cells was zzso by the addition of zzso zzso culture zzso and the effect was significantly reduced by zzso with an zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso regulated by zzso zzso regulates recruitment and/or distribution of immune cells seen in the early pregnant zzso
