After infection of a sensitive host temperate zzso may enter either a zzso or a zzso zzso leading to new zzso assembly or zzso as a zzso zzso The decision about which zzso to enter is centered in the genetic switch of the zzso In this work, we explore the zzso genetic switch of zzso zzso through experiments and statistical mechanical zzso We examine the activity of the zzso promoter zzso at different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and compare the effect of zzso on zzso in the presence or absence of the zzso zzso protein expressed from the zzso promoter zzso We find that the presence of large amounts of zzso prevents repression of the zzso promoter, zzso that zzso works as an zzso We compare our experimental data with simulations based on previous mathematical zzso of this zzso Good agreement between data and simulations verify the model of zzso repression of zzso By including zzso in the simulations, we are able to discard a model that assumes that zzso and zzso do not interact before binding together at the DNA to repress zzso The second model of zzso repression assumes the formation of a zzso complex in the zzso We suggest that a zzso complex may exist in different forms that either prevent or invoke zzso repression, introducing a new twist on mixed feedback zzso
