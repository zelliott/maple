zzso plays a central role in the regulation of cellular zzso underlying various human zzso zzso We have demonstrated previously that zzso (a zzso underlying human T cell zzso zzso interacts with zzso and functions as an zzso zzso zzso With the aim to develop an zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that a zzso which spans the zzso site, binds to zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity and its downstream biological zzso Indeed, we demonstrated that a zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso encompassing the zzso strand of human zzso zzso with zzso and specifically inhibited its zzso zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance studies suggested that interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso caused zzso changes on the variable loop 1 of zzso the locus zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso domain prevented zzso binding and hence inhibited membrane zzso and zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited not only cellular proliferation and zzso in zzso but also in zzso tumor growth without any adverse zzso The roles of zzso which possesses a zzso domain, in zzso signaling were well zzso zzso zzso zzso create an attractive target for zzso zzso However, no effective zzso specific for zzso have been zzso zzso which zzso association of zzso with zzso is the first zzso to demonstrate specific zzso zzso zzso zzso This observation will facilitate the design of specific zzso for zzso a core zzso survival factor underlying various human zzso zzso
