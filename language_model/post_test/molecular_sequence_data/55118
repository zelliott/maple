Fluorescent tagging of viral particles by genetic means enables the study of virus dynamics in living zzso However, the study of zzso entry and zzso by this method is currently zzso This is due to the lack of replication competent, zzso fluorescent zzso Here, we report on viable zzso zzso carrying zzso insertions of the small zzso protein zzso fused to fluorescent proteins zzso The zzso were inserted into an internal position which allowed the production of viable, zzso labeled zzso which zzso with wild type zzso in cell zzso Fluorescent particles were readily zzso by several zzso Moreover, in a spread zzso labeled zzso accumulated around the nucleus of the newly infected cells without any zzso viral gene expression suggesting normal entry and particle zzso These zzso were used to record particle dynamics by zzso zzso during zzso zzso with high spatial as well as zzso zzso From the resulting tracks we obtained not only mean track zzso but also their mean square zzso and diffusion zzso With this key information, we were able to describe particle behavior at high detail and discriminate between particle tracks exhibiting directed movement and tracks in which particles exhibited free or anomalous zzso
