A zzso zzso designated zzso zzso was isolated from callus culture derived from the leaf zzso of zzso zzso This gene contains an open reading frame zzso the protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with high zzso to zzso zzso zzso from various plant zzso An appreciable increase in the zzso level of zzso was zzso observed by the exposure of the cell culture to zzso zzso The expression activity of the gene was also elevated when the cells were treated with zzso extract and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and its translate play roles in zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses of zzso zzso and zzso functions as an important zzso zzso in these zzso This set of the results would support our hypothesis that the zzso of zzso evoked by the zzso of zzso zzso concentration is an essential early event in zzso zzso responses of higher plant zzso
