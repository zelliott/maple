zzso type I zzso from extremely zzso zzso zzso positive zzso of zzso We showed that reverse zzso from zzso zzso breaks the DNA at specific sites and zzso binds to the zzso zzso In 30 out of 31 sites located in zzso DNA fragments, zzso occurs at the sequence zzso is any zzso The same rule was previously shown to hold for zzso DNA breakage by zzso zzso zzso The relative zzso zzso at different sites depend on zzso and zzso We discuss the possible zzso and zzso role of the above specificity of the bacterial zzso zzso
