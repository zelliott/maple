Acute coronary syndromes zzso are associated with zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to study the protein expression level associated with zzso zzso stress, zzso and cell survival in zzso obtained during an zzso zzso from 42 coronary zzso patients, divided into patients admitted within zzso after the onset of chest pain zzso zzso zzso and patients with stable coronary zzso disease zzso zzso were analyzed using zzso The expression levels of proteins involved in cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2, zzso zzso and two zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso and even the expression and activity of zzso were significantly reduced in zzso from zzso patients compared to zzso zzso Moreover, reduction in the expression of proteins associated with cell survival such as zzso zzso zzso type 1 was also observed in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Principal component and zzso zzso analysis suggested the existence of factors zzso expressed in the zzso zzso associated with acute coronary zzso In zzso these results suggest the existence of circulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso during the acute phase of a coronary zzso
