zzso of zzso zzso have two zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso by the nuclear genes zzso and zzso zzso As a first step in studying the zzso function of these two zzso we compared the expression of zzso and zzso in different plant zzso in response to hormonal treatments, and upon treatment with zzso and zzso The zzso transcript and active zzso were detected only in young leaves of mature zzso The zzso transcript was more abundant in young compared to old leaves, but the zzso activity was higher in mature and zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited a different expression pattern upon treatment with zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment caused a decrease in abundance of both zzso although the dose dependency of this decrease zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase of zzso zzso whereas the zzso transcript level was zzso higher than the zzso These differences in expression might explain why both zzso zzso zzso zzso are needed, particularly under stress zzso
