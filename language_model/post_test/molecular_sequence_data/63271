zzso molecules are important for attracting immune zzso cells to localized areas of viral zzso One such cellular mechanism zzso this response is the zzso zzso zzso While zzso zzso virus expresses multiple products to inhibit zzso during infection, the attenuated deletion zzso zzso lacks this zzso However, introduction of the zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso will re-establish the parental zzso As the zzso protein is unique to zzso we characterized it to zzso its mechanism to quell an inflammatory zzso It was discovered that the zzso protein possesses motifs characteristic of zzso zzso an zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso retention and retrieval zzso and zzso zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso protein was demonstrated to be zzso zzso and expressed early during zzso Furthermore, zzso microscopic analysis revealed that the zzso protein zzso with cellular zzso zzso zzso location also affects zzso protein zzso the elimination of the zzso leader sequence from the zzso protein compromised both its zzso location and its ability to inhibit zzso zzso zzso There is only partial zzso zzso when a second zzso zzso protein lacking potential zzso zzso retention signal is zzso However, this zzso deleted zzso protein is compromised in its ability to inhibit zzso zzso zzso of the zzso location of the zzso proteins provides important insights for its function in future zzso
