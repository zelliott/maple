In complex with the zzso zzso the natural product zzso zzso signal zzso events required for zzso to S phase cell cycle progression in zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso first implicated the zzso and zzso proteins as targets of the zzso zzso We report here that the zzso protein is membrane associated and localized to the surface of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein contains readily zzso zzso zzso zzso activity attributable to either a zzso intrinsic activity or to a zzso zzso tightly associated with zzso zzso we find that zzso stimulates zzso binding to zzso zzso but not to a zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso binding does not markedly inhibit the zzso zzso activity associated with zzso but does cause a zzso of zzso from the zzso surface, which may zzso the zzso zzso zzso activity of its in zzso zzso Several additional findings indicate that zzso zzso is important for zzso function and, conversely, that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso is an essential, highly zzso component of a signal zzso zzso regulating cell cycle progression zzso from zzso to zzso
