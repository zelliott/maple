We identified the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that converts zzso acid to zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso from bovine zzso and an approximately zzso zzso preparation containing a major zzso candidate component was subjected to mass zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso recognized by T cell zzso a protein with unknown function highly expressed in cancer cells and zzso was identified by 18 peptides covering zzso of the zzso zzso expression of zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso activity in zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso cells produced zzso zzso chains with zzso of zzso zzso zzso units, as compared with zzso for zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso were zzso clustered in blocks, as in naturally occurring zzso zzso Given the discovered identity, we propose to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a functional designation, zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso present in normal zzso although with marked quantitative zzso It is highly zzso to part of the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso genetically linked to bipolar zzso zzso also contains a putative zzso zzso zzso domain and thus may be involved in zzso zzso zzso The functional relation between zzso zzso and cancer is unknown but may involve known zzso zzso interactions with growth factors, zzso zzso or zzso zzso
