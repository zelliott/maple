A rapid method has been developed for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso B1 in water and plasma utilizing zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso The unusual structure of the zzso means that they do not zzso as readily as linear peptides and as a result of their low zzso efficiency, traditional zzso analyses were not able to reach the levels of detection required for the zzso of zzso in plasma for zzso zzso zzso analysis showed zzso zzso zzso zzso in the concentration range zzso zzso with a limit of detection of zzso zzso (9 zzso in zzso This paper highlights the zzso of zzso mass zzso for the rapid and sensitive zzso of peptides in biological samples without the need for extensive extraction zzso
