We describe two approaches to cloning and zzso gene 42 of zzso zzso which encodes the early zzso zzso zzso In Bochum a library of zzso fragments of zzso zzso DNA cloned into zzso was screened with clones known to contain parts of gene zzso Two overlapping fragments, each of which contained one end of the zzso were zzso at a zzso site and joined, to give a zzso containing the entire zzso In zzso a zzso zzso of zzso DNA, believed to contain the entire zzso was cloned into zzso and shown to express the zzso at low zzso The cloned zzso bore an amber zzso in gene zzso From the DNA sequence of gene 42, the cloned gene was converted to the zzso zzso by zzso zzso Both zzso fragments were cloned into the zzso expression system and found to be substantially zzso zzso zzso zzso from one of the zzso strains had a turnover number similar to that of the zzso isolated earlier from infected zzso In addition, the zzso 20 zzso acid zzso matched precisely the sequence predicted from the gene zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso bears considerable zzso with that of zzso zzso of either host or T4 zzso The gene 42 zzso sequences of zzso zzso and zzso were determined and found to code for zzso acid sequences nearly identical to that of T4 zzso
