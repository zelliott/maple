zzso zzso is the most common zzso fish on the Brazilian zzso Apart from the involvement with defense against zzso the possible contribution of skin zzso components to the development of injuries caused by zzso fish species has not been zzso Thus, the present study was conducted to gain a better understanding of the zzso and protein components of fish skin zzso and the sting zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Our results show that sting zzso and skin zzso have distinct constituents that distinguished them like structural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle and protein binding present in sting zzso and like zzso 3 zzso 2 and energy zzso proteins in skin zzso But in a group of common 13 proteins we identified and isolated a zzso zzso The zzso zzso caused more harmful effects, such as zzso zzso zzso and changes in the zzso wall diameter, and the protein zzso produced a typical inflammatory process in zzso zzso And finally we showed for the first time the presence zzso in sting zzso and skin zzso of zzso zzso using zzso and also we zzso this protein in the sting zzso zzso shows inflammatory action, working at different doses inducing an increase in the number of zzso rolling and adhering to the zzso
