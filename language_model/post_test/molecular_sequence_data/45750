Until now, in the absence of direct zzso evidence, the cause of the zzso of Athens has remained a matter of debate among scientists who have relied exclusively on zzso zzso to introduce several possible zzso A mass burial pit, unearthed in the zzso ancient cemetery of Athens and dated back to the time of the plague outbreak zzso 430 zzso has provided the required skeletal material for the investigation of ancient microbial zzso 

To determine the probable cause of the zzso of zzso 

zzso pulp was our material of choice, since it has been proved to be an ideal DNA source of ancient zzso zzso through its good zzso durability and natural zzso 

Six DNA zzso targeted at zzso parts of the agents of plague zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anthrax zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso disease zzso zzso failed to yield any product in zzso reactions of DNA samples isolated from three ancient zzso On the seventh such attempt, DNA sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified providing clear evidence for the presence of that zzso in the dental pulp of teeth recovered from the zzso mass zzso 

The results of this study clearly zzso typhoid fever as a probable cause of the zzso of zzso
