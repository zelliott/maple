In zzso zzso zzso encodes the principal zzso zzso for translation of zzso zzso and controls pigmented zzso production by the presence of zzso zzso in the genes zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso of both zzso C and zzso acid production, zzso also contains a zzso zzso and was expected to exhibit zzso A cloned zzso zzso DNA zzso containing a sequence showing zzso identity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to restore zzso production and zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the closely related zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso resulted in the expected zzso defective zzso but unexpectedly had no effect on zzso zzso zzso analysis showed no difference in the levels of zzso transcripts in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso ruling out any effect of elevated levels of the zzso zzso Furthermore, when compared to the zzso strain, the zzso zzso showed no differences in the levels of zzso suggesting that the single zzso zzso in zzso is zzso zzso The role of zzso context in zzso dependence is zzso
