zzso that bind either zzso small nuclear zzso zzso zzso or the zzso stem and loop of zzso zzso zzso were selected from a zzso zzso acid zzso display zzso An experimental system, including an affinity selection method, was designed to identify primary zzso zzso sequences without bias to known zzso acid sequences and without incorporating zzso binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso were used to evaluate the binding of zzso by zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso were determined from the foreign insert DNA zzso and peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso were chemically zzso zzso affinities for the zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso were analyzed successfully using zzso and circular zzso zzso These zzso demonstrate the feasibility of rapidly zzso zzso and initiating the analyses of small peptides that bind to zzso in an effort to define better the chemistry, structure, and function of zzso zzso
