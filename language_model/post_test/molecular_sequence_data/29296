Open reading frame zzso 50 protein is capable of zzso the entire zzso cycle of zzso zzso zzso zzso but its mechanism of action is not well zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso 50 protein activates two zzso zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso by binding to closely related response elements located approximately 60 to 100 zzso zzso upstream of the start of zzso of the two zzso The zzso sequence zzso zzso from the zzso promoter zzso zzso a response to zzso 50 protein in both zzso cells and B cells in the absence of other zzso zzso The responsive region of DNA can be transferred to a zzso minimal zzso zzso point zzso showed that a span of at least 20 zzso is essential for a response to zzso 50 zzso However, a minimum of six positions within this region were zzso The related zzso responsive element in the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso shares 20 zzso zzso with the comparable region of zzso The divergence is primarily at the 3' zzso The DNA binding domain of zzso 50 zzso encompassing zzso acids 1 to zzso fused to a zzso zzso domain from zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso can mediate zzso of reporter zzso bearing these response zzso Most importantly, zzso zzso can induce zzso zzso and zzso transcripts in zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in human cells binds specifically to duplex zzso containing the responsive regions from zzso and zzso These zzso complexes were zzso by zzso to zzso zzso zzso without a zzso tag also bound to the response zzso There was a strong correlation between DNA binding by zzso 50 and zzso zzso zzso within zzso and zzso that impaired zzso by zzso 50 or zzso zzso also abolished DNA zzso Only one of eight related complexes formed on zzso and zzso zzso was due to zzso zzso The other complexes were due to cellular zzso Two zzso zzso promoters are activated by a similar mechanism that involves direct recognition of a zzso response element by the DNA binding domain of zzso 50 protein in the context of related cellular zzso
