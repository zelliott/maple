We have designed a zzso zzso zzso three-way junction zzso zzso constructed from three zzso zzso based on the same subset of sequences used for the zzso zzso zzso three-way zzso characterized previously zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The junction differs primarily in the assembly of the branch point and the ends of the zzso The three zzso can each fold into a zzso zzso linked by a zzso zzso loop, each containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso On lowering the pH (between 6 and zzso the extensions mutually associate to one of the other zzso via zzso zzso hydrogen zzso zzso this process results in the formation of the branch point and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso three-way junction is characterized by gel zzso circular zzso zzso melting, and differential scanning zzso The junction zzso zzso unfolding in two distinct temperature zzso In the temperature range 15 to 50 degrees C loss of zzso base pairing results in the zzso of the three-way zzso Between 55 and 95 degrees C the resulting zzso undergo further successive zzso The overall zzso unfolding zzso and zzso changes associated with the loss of zzso base pairing are approximately equal to the sum of the zzso and zzso changes associated with the zzso of the zzso base pairing in the isolated arms zzso zzso zzso zzso It is apparent from these results that in the proximity of the branch point the structure is not zzso or zzso This result is contrary to the results obtained for the zzso zzso three-way and for three-way junctions constructed from zzso zzso zzso Complete folding of the junction requires either high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso
