zzso zzso viruses zzso are zzso zzso present in most if not all nonhuman zzso zzso zzso and other African monkey species are known to harbor zzso yet there is presently no data in regard to their genetic zzso Here we studied zzso from zzso as compared to other zzso isolated from a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso By Western zzso analysis, the gag precursor proteins zzso were detected from all zzso In addition, the envelope zzso from a zzso isolate zzso were comparable in size to the zzso precursor zzso the exterior zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso as detected by lentil zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso amplified products from pol and zzso regions of each zzso demonstrated a close relationship among zzso zzso while zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso clustered zzso The zzso viruses only varied by zzso among each other in the zzso zzso however, as much as zzso variation was noted when compared to the other African monkey zzso To determine the prevalence rate of zzso in our zzso zzso we employed both Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso gag precursor proteins were seen in 7 of 10 zzso however, none were positive by zzso suggesting that these infants were virus negative and that their zzso were maternal in zzso Only one juvenile zzso and all adults zzso were infected with zzso Taken together these results suggest that zzso have arisen and zzso along with the evolution of their natural zzso Furthermore, the high prevalence rates to zzso seen in adult zzso strongly suggest a sexual or oral routes of zzso
