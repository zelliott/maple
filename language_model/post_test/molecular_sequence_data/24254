zzso bacteria produce zzso zzso that envelope single domain zzso zzso Although many proteins are present in this zzso zzso zzso five are specific to this zzso A zzso zzso designated zzso is the most abundant of the zzso zzso and to establish its function we cloned and zzso its gene from zzso zzso zzso This was achieved by determination of the zzso zzso acid sequence of the protein following two zzso zzso gel zzso and sequencing of the gene was performed by gene walking using anchored zzso chain zzso zzso contains a putative zzso binding motif zzso zzso zzso with a zzso tag, was expressed in zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso protein could bind zzso and showed zzso zzso zzso was the preferred zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that a novel protein specifically localized on the magnetic particle zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein showed similar characteristics to small zzso involved in the formation of zzso zzso Furthermore, addition of the zzso inhibitor zzso also inhibited magnetic particle zzso suggesting that zzso is required for magnetic particles zzso
