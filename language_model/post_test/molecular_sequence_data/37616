In a previous publication we identified a novel human zzso protein that was related to zzso a zzso regulated zzso protein from the central nervous system of zzso Here we demonstrate that both the human and the mouse zzso possess two closely related zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso The two genes share zzso sequence identity at the zzso and zzso identity at the protein zzso The corresponding proteins appear to constitute a separate family within the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso zzso are widely expressed in human and mouse zzso and show a very similar distribution zzso The human zzso gene is located on zzso zzso the human zzso gene on zzso zzso zzso related species including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also possess two zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso harbor only one zzso zzso while zzso do not seem to contain zzso The high conservation of the zzso sequences between zzso related organisms indicates an important role for zzso and zzso in a fundamental zzso
