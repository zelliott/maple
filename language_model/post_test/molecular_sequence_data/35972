We have isolated a novel zzso from zzso zzso that encodes a protein composed of zzso zzso with an estimated zzso of zzso and a deduced molecular mass of zzso zzso The first 20 or so zzso acids are zzso and resemble a signal zzso The rest of the zzso is composed of a zzso zzso There are 30 repeats, of which 23 are full zzso Part of the consensus sequence derived from the repeats has some similarity to the loop of the zzso type zzso zzso Evidence is presented that a fusion protein of this novel protein with zzso can bind zzso Northern zzso indicates a single transcript of zzso zzso (the same size as the zzso zzso translation of the zzso gives a protein that zzso on zzso with an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso The protein is processed into a smaller, zzso form zzso zzso when translated in the presence of canine pancreatic zzso zzso This suggests that the protein is targeted across the zzso zzso membrane in zzso and is the first report of a signal sequence from zzso zzso We propose that the zzso obtained encodes a novel zzso protein that is either zzso or resident in the zzso system of zzso zzso and call it the zzso zzso
