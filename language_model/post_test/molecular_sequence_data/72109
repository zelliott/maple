Transport of proteins along the zzso zzso is primarily achieved by zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso of 27 zzso zzso and of 28 zzso zzso zzso nomenclature zzso and zzso respectively), are important trafficking membrane proteins between the zzso zzso and the zzso and between zzso zzso Here, we present the human zzso and zzso zzso zzso They zzso predicted proteins of 212 and 250 zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping analyses reveal that human zzso is located on zzso zzso and zzso on approximately zzso The zzso location of zzso near a locus implicated in familial essential hypertension and its known function in trafficking indicate that it is a potential candidate gene for this zzso
