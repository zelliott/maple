zzso zzso 1 zzso or zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso involved in development and zzso of skeletal zzso Previously, we have demonstrated that zzso zzso shows zzso differential zzso expression during zzso With the aim to identify putative contributing zzso DNA variation we zzso the zzso upstream region of the gene in the respective breeds zzso and zzso We found two single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We focused our investigation on the zzso zzso because in zzso analysis and knowledge about the regulation of zzso suggested an effect of this zzso on a zzso binding protein beta zzso responsive zzso zzso 

Using zzso mobility shift zzso we demonstrated that, similar to human zzso the 3' terminal end of the first zzso of zzso zzso harbors a zzso binding site and showed that this binding site is zzso affected by the zzso G zzso zzso of 48 fetuses per breed revealed that the G zzso zzso exclusively in zzso fetuses with a frequency of 57 zzso Using real-time quantitative zzso we showed that, consistent with its negative effect on a zzso zzso element, the G zzso tends to decrease zzso abundance of zzso in the fetal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, we showed that the zzso zzso leads to ubiquitous zzso zzso of the first zzso by generating a de zzso and zzso a cryptic zzso zzso zzso zzso spliced transcripts comprise about half of the zzso messages expressed by the G zzso Both zzso zzso zzso differ from the native transcript by insertions in the leader sequences which do not change the reading frame of zzso 

At the 3' terminal end of the first zzso of the zzso zzso we identified a unique, zzso functional zzso zzso This zzso affects the function of the zzso gene at the DNA level by affecting a zzso binding site and at the zzso level by zzso zzso zzso of the first zzso and thus represents an interesting zzso to study zzso effects of zzso zzso
