We report the ability of zzso zzso to directly transcribe zzso templates in zzso We have made use of this finding to develop a zzso protocol for amplification of zzso zzso The method was shown to require only zzso amounts of total cellular zzso as starting zzso A zzso was developed in which zzso can be extracted from one drop of blood or 1000 cultured cells, and analyzed for the expression of a specific zzso
