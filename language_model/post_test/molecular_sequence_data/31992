We amplified zzso protein gene zzso of zzso cloned it into a zzso expression zzso and expressed it in zzso zzso A pair of zzso was designed based on the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso gene in zzso The target gene zzso from zzso liver tissue was amplified by zzso zzso by zzso the target gene zzso was zzso into an expression zzso of zzso The zzso construct was subsequently transformed into zzso coli zzso zzso This construct was verified by restriction zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso zzso a new zzso protein with the expected relative molecular mass of 24 zzso zzso The result was identified by zzso zzso zzso zzso includes zzso zzso zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso coding 182 zzso zzso
