zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso which is implicated in a number of zzso reactions in the biological zzso Here we report on the isolation of the gene zzso for a novel zzso zzso from the wild zzso rice, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was confirmed by functional zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso with that of the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed distinct differences in a stretch of 37 zzso zzso between zzso acids 174 and zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso protein demonstrated a zzso character in zzso compared with the zzso zzso protein as with those zzso from the native source or an expressed zzso zzso zzso protein wherein zzso acids zzso have been zzso Analysis of the salt effect on zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins revealed that the structure of zzso protein is stable toward salt zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso rendered transgenic tobacco plants capable of growth in zzso zzso zzso with retention of approximately zzso of the zzso competence with zzso increased zzso production compared with zzso zzso zzso protein isolated from zzso zzso showed zzso property in zzso confirming functional expression in zzso of the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of a zzso zzso from any zzso
