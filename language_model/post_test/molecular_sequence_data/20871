Human zzso virus 2 zzso infection is characterized by a slower disease progression and lower transmission zzso The molecular features that could be assigned as directly involved in this in zzso zzso remain essentially unknown, and the importance of zzso as a model to understand zzso of zzso infection has been frequently zzso The early events of the zzso replication cycle involve the interaction between viral envelope zzso and cellular zzso the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso usually zzso or zzso Despite the importance of these two zzso receptors in human zzso virus 1 zzso entry into cells, we have previously shown that in some zzso zzso individuals, a viral population exists that is unable to use both zzso and zzso The goal of the present study was to investigate whether possible regions in the zzso gene of these viruses might account for this zzso From the molecular characterization of these zzso genes we could not detect any correlation between zzso loop sequence and viral zzso In contrast, it reveals the existence of remarkable differences in the zzso and zzso regions of the surface zzso including the loss of a putative zzso zzso Moreover, in the zzso zzso some unique sequence signatures could be detected in the central zzso and second zzso repeat zzso Some of the zzso affect zzso zzso and may affect the zzso and/or the dynamics of envelope zzso complex, including the zzso association and the zzso of viral entry zzso
