The zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso activity isolated from zzso human lung zzso and zzso human zzso cell lines, and from rat brain zzso cells in primary culture was zzso The identification and zzso of the zzso products were performed using zzso zzso mass zzso linked to zzso zzso The effect of chronic zzso treatment of the cells (5 zzso on zzso zzso was also zzso It was found that major products generated from zzso were the zzso peptides zzso and zzso The pattern of zzso zzso was quite similar for all three cell zzso However, different proportions of the formed peptides were zzso The zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso in a manner suggesting competition of the two peptides for the same zzso zzso zzso treatment of the cell cultures resulted in a substantial increase in the zzso activity, leading to higher levels of the major fragments and zzso of zzso and the shorter peptides zzso zzso Since the effect of zzso treatment of the cells was blocked by zzso it is likely that it was zzso zzso Taken together, the findings suggest that a zzso zzso the activity of which is increased by chronic zzso treatment of the cells, is responsible for the zzso of zzso with fragments zzso and zzso being the major zzso
