zzso zzso zzso elicits egg laying and rejection of courting males in zzso zzso zzso Little is known about the genes that specify the underlying zzso circuits and mediate this switch in female sexual zzso 

Here we show that the zzso gene involved in zzso zzso provides an essential component to the SP zzso We have isolated viable zzso of the vital zzso gene that abolish zzso expression from a zzso promoter resulting in the absence of the largest transcript of this complex zzso zzso zzso and zzso restricted expression of zzso revealed a requirement for zzso early in the development of zzso zzso nerve zzso zzso to rescue the SP zzso In viable zzso zzso these ascending zzso three per abdominal and seven per zzso zzso fail to zzso the central zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting and the response to zzso Furthermore, zzso in zzso zzso is required to elicit the SP zzso 

Together with the former finding of SP binding to zzso nerves , these results suggest that zzso modification of sensory input switches female sexual behavior from the virgin to the zzso zzso
