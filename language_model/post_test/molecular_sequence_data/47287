We report that the zzso zzso coli DNA zzso can support the growth of zzso zzso strains deleted zzso for zzso or doubly for zzso plus zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso led to the identification of seven zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are essential for zzso in zzso and for in zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso uniquely resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso at five other positions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not affect in zzso zzso and had either no effect or only a modest effect on zzso in zzso The zzso and zzso zzso increased the apparent K zzso zzso (to 45 and 76 zzso zzso over that of the zzso zzso coli zzso (3 zzso These results are discussed in light of available structural data on the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We observed that zzso cells containing only the zzso acid Chlorella virus DNA zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting only of the zzso core zzso are relatively zzso in the repair of DNA damage induced by zzso zzso or treatment with zzso whereas cells containing only zzso zzso are defective in DNA zzso This suggests that the structural zzso unique to zzso zzso are not essential for zzso growth, but may facilitate DNA zzso
