The notion of an zzso world has been introduced for a zzso scenario that is dominated by zzso molecules and their properties, in particular their capabilities to act as templates for reproduction and as zzso for several zzso and zzso reactions of zzso and zzso This notion is used here also for simple experimental zzso which are well suited to study evolution in the test zzso In molecular evolution experiments fitness is determined in essence by the molecular structures of zzso zzso Evidence is presented for adaptation to environment in zzso zzso zzso based molecular evolution experiments have led to interesting zzso in zzso commonly called zzso molecular zzso which make use of zzso zzso strategies in order to zzso new pharmacological compounds and other advanced materials on a biological zzso zzso in zzso replication leads to formation of zzso zzso called zzso An increase in the error rate zzso the zzso zzso There exists a sharply defined threshold beyond which zzso breaks down and evolutionary adaptation becomes zzso Almost all zzso viruses studied so far operate at conditions close to this error zzso zzso and error thresholds are important for an understanding of zzso virus evolution, and they may help to develop novel zzso zzso Evolution of zzso molecules can be studied and interpreted by considering secondary zzso The notion of sequence space introduces a distance between pairs of zzso sequences which is tantamount to counting the minimal number of point zzso required to convert the sequences into each zzso The mean sensitivity of zzso secondary structures to zzso depends strongly on the base pairing zzso structures from sequences which contain only one base pair zzso or zzso are much less stable against zzso than those derived from the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequences in thus more difficult than zzso in the world of natural zzso sequences with four zzso This fact might explain the usage of four bases in the genetic language of zzso Finally we study the mapping from zzso sequences into secondary structures and explore the zzso of zzso shape zzso We find that zzso zzso connecting zzso sequences with identical structures go very frequently through entire sequence zzso zzso folding into common structures are found everywhere in sequence zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
