zzso zzso A zzso is a surface exposed zzso protein present in most zzso zzso strains and involved in zzso cell zzso and zzso The expression of zzso is controlled by zzso zzso regulator zzso a member of the zzso family, which binds to the zzso promoter and strongly zzso the zzso of zzso It was recently demonstrated that the zzso activity of zzso was attenuated by zzso acid zzso a natural zzso released in human zzso thus leading to the zzso of zzso in zzso To zzso the mechanism of regulation of zzso by zzso we used zzso exchange mass zzso in association with in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show here that zzso binds at the interface between the zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso state of zzso without inducing large zzso changes in the zzso zzso The zzso predicted to be in contact with zzso were further selected for zzso to assess their in zzso and in zzso functions in zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is critical for zzso and reveal that zzso plays a key role in the mechanism of regulation of zzso by zzso zzso our data suggest that the mechanism of regulation of zzso by zzso mainly involves the stabilization of the zzso in a zzso incompatible with DNA zzso
