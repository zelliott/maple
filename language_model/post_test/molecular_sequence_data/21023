A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso stem zzso using zzso exchange and gel zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was a zzso of zzso Da zzso as determined by gel zzso and zzso The zzso activity of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso has not been reported for other zzso Also, the zzso mass zzso zzso confirmed that there is no match result of similar plant zzso for zzso indicating zzso may be a novel plant zzso zzso showed marked zzso activity against various viruses in cell zzso zzso zzso was also found to exhibit remarkable zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso specially induced zzso cell zzso in zzso manner as evidenced by zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso Moreover, due to both zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso was also found to play the important role in the potential zzso mechanism of zzso When the zzso site was fully inhibited by zzso zzso was abruptly decreased and zzso phenomenon in zzso cells was not observed, suggesting a significant correlation between zzso activity and the zzso zzso
