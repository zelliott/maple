zzso zzso virus zzso causes zzso pulmonary syndrome zzso with a high rate of mortality in humans who are infected by the transmission of virus from the natural zzso zzso In humans, zzso T zzso zzso specific for zzso appear to play an important role in the zzso of zzso There is a correlation between the zzso of zzso zzso and the severity of zzso zzso In order to create a mouse model to study the role of zzso T cells in zzso T cell responses to zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso mice zzso zzso with zzso DNA or zzso zzso virus expressing zzso N protein were zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were recognized by zzso T cells in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, two of these zzso are located in the central region of the zzso N zzso where several human zzso zzso zzso have been defined in zzso virus and zzso zzso lines specific for these four zzso were zzso to corresponding zzso virus zzso but only one of them was zzso to zzso virus zzso These results will enable the analysis of the roles of zzso in zzso of zzso in experimental mouse models of zzso
