To explore the evolutionary dynamics of genes in the major zzso complex zzso in zzso zzso we have amplified complete sequences of the zzso second zzso and third zzso zzso of class II beta chain genes of zzso The pattern of zzso substitution in the zzso site of sequences cloned from three zzso and zzso divergent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blackbirds zzso zzso and house zzso zzso zzso reveals that class II B genes of zzso are subject to the same types of diversifying forces as those observed at zzso class II zzso By contrast, the tree of avian class II B genes reveals that zzso relationships have not been retained as in zzso zzso and that, unlike class II genes in zzso genes in zzso and chickens have had very recent common ancestors within their respective zzso Thus, whereas the selective forces diversifying class II B genes of birds are likely similar to those in zzso their long-term evolutionary dynamics appear to be characterized by much higher rates of concerted zzso
