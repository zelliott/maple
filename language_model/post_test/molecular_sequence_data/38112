The mechanisms of chronic disease and recovery from relapses in experimental zzso zzso zzso an animal model of multiple zzso are zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso may play a role in termination of the inflammatory zzso One zzso of zzso is the passive cell death or zzso death by zzso pathway, which is under the control of the zzso family of zzso To investigate the role of passive cell death zzso in zzso we used mice with transgenic expression of the long form of the zzso gene zzso targeted to the zzso zzso We found that mice transgenic for zzso have an earlier onset and a more chronic form of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso This was not due to an expanded zzso cell zzso zzso peripheral zzso from zzso transgenic mice showed increased proliferation and zzso production to zzso zzso in zzso compared with zzso from zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated increased cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso transgenic central nervous system zzso compared with zzso There was also a decreased number of zzso cells in the zzso of zzso transgenic mice when compared with zzso at all time points zzso This is the first report of an zzso disease model in zzso transgenic zzso Our data indicate that the passive cell death zzso is important in the zzso of chronic zzso These findings have implications for understanding the zzso of multiple sclerosis and other zzso zzso
