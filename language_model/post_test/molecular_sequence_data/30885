Three members of the zzso gene family have been identified in human zzso libraries zzso zzso and zzso We compared the DNA binding properties of the zzso and zzso proteins zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso I zzso zzso bound to most of the zzso binding sites zzso including the zzso binding site, zzso in the zzso virus zzso 40 zzso in which the most frequent sequence was zzso The zzso site was an zzso element dependent on zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso that used the zzso or zzso expression zzso Some sites in the zzso zzso including the zzso site, had high affinity with zzso but little or no affinity with zzso in which the most frequent sequence was zzso The zzso site was an zzso element dependent on zzso and a very zzso dependent on zzso Our results showed that zzso is a zzso zzso like zzso and that although zzso and zzso have similar sequence specificity for DNA binding some sequences were recognized by zzso zzso
