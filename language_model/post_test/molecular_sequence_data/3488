zzso zzso block the rat skeletal muscle sodium channel zzso with high affinity by binding to specific zzso in the zzso However, human zzso zzso channels, which are resistant to block by zzso have these same pore zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso techniques to investigate which zzso determine zzso zzso Exchange of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of rat zzso with zzso zzso the corresponding zzso in zzso reduces the sensitivity of zzso by approximately zzso and largely accounts for the differential sensitivity of zzso and zzso to both zzso and zzso To determine whether zzso zzso zzso might contribute to the resistance of zzso channels to zzso we exchanged zzso in this zzso that differed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso the corresponding zzso in zzso and zzso reduced the zzso sensitivity of zzso by approximately zzso The zzso zzso however, only reduced zzso sensitivity of zzso by approximately zzso demonstrating that zzso and zzso have distinct interactions with the zzso zzso Our data indicate that naturally occurring zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso contribute to the zzso sensitivity of sodium channels to zzso Because zzso and zzso are not part of the zzso binding site for zzso these zzso zzso probably influence the accessibility of the toxin to the binding site within the pore and/or the stability of the zzso zzso Our results should aid the development of toxins that block specific zzso sodium channel zzso
