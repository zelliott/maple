zzso of the immune response is an established feature of certain zzso zzso is an inflammatory zzso released by the urinary tract zzso after contact with zzso zzso coli during urinary tract infection and is crucial for proper zzso of immune zzso Nevertheless, persistently high levels of zzso are associated with zzso and zzso In this study, we tested twelve zzso strains for their ability to influence zzso release from zzso zzso We evaluated how strains from different zzso species could regulate zzso in human zzso zzso cells, either resting cells or cells zzso challenged with zzso zzso zzso A majority of the tested species altered zzso release from the zzso cells after 24 hours of zzso Most species increased zzso release, whereas a few zzso efficiently suppressed zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso While strong zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso were unable to degrade zzso in the zzso environment, effects on zzso zzso were evident for selected zzso Although zzso zzso was affected by zzso the influence on zzso transcript did not correlate to the impact on zzso zzso zzso analysis based on a zzso zzso zzso of the tested zzso and their effect on zzso revealed some linkage to specific zzso zzso Testing the zzso nature of zzso can prove important when selecting new zzso zzso Moreover, we believe that zzso and zzso similarities could be used to zzso the traits governing such zzso
