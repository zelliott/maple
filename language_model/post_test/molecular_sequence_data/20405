zzso surveys based on zzso methods have revealed that tidal flat sediments are environments with extensive microbial zzso Since most of zzso in nature cannot be easily cultivated under general laboratory conditions, our knowledge on zzso dwellers in tidal flat zzso is mainly based on the analysis of zzso zzso community analysis based on the zzso zzso gene and other zzso markers has been widely used to provide important information on the role of zzso but it is basically an indirect means, compared with direct sequencing of zzso zzso In this study, we applied a zzso zzso approach to characterize zzso zzso from tidal flat zzso Two zzso zzso libraries based on zzso were constructed from tidal flat zzso zzso A survey based on zzso of selected zzso clones resulted in the identification of clones containing zzso bacterial and 16 zzso zzso in which majority were of zzso zzso Two zzso clones containing large zzso zzso were completely zzso using the shotgun zzso Both DNA zzso contained more than 20 genes zzso putative proteins which implied their ecological roles in tidal flat zzso zzso analyses of evolutionary zzso proteins indicate that these clones are not closely related to known zzso whose zzso sequence is known, and genes in tidal flat may be subjected to extensive lateral gene transfer, notably between zzso zzso and zzso This is the first report demonstrating that direct sequencing of zzso gene library is useful in underpinning the genetic makeup and functional roles of zzso in tidal flat zzso
