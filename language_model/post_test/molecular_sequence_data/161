zzso proteins are a family of zzso zzso zzso proteins playing zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso major zzso zzso p zzso and its zzso zzso p zzso were found highly expressed in the fruit skin at the pit zzso stage, when fruits zzso lose their zzso to the zzso pathogen zzso zzso To investigate the possible role of the two zzso p 1 zzso in plant defense, the zzso proteins were expressed in zzso coli and zzso Light scattering experiments and circular zzso zzso showed that both proteins are zzso in solution with secondary structures typical of zzso zzso Even though the proteins do not display direct zzso activity, they both act as zzso a function possibly related to zzso The zzso activity is different for the two zzso and only that of zzso p zzso is affected in the presence of the zzso zzso suggesting a zzso correlation between zzso p zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso p zzso was evaluated using zzso zzso zzso which provided information on the zzso and on the zzso parameters of the zzso The structural architecture of zzso p zzso and zzso p zzso was obtained by zzso zzso and the differences in the binding pockets, possibly accounting for the observed difference in binding activity, were zzso
