Five zzso zzso were generated against the zzso zzso zzso All zzso react with different zzso of the zzso family, as well as zzso proteins from different species, albeit with differential zzso zzso mapping showed all five zzso clustered in the vicinity of the zzso zzso zzso Although thought to be an essential part of the zzso site, zzso binding to that domain does not affect zzso activity in zzso or the capability to specifically associate with other cellular zzso Based on a detailed dissection of the zzso a comparative analysis of secondary structure predictions indicates a common structural motif in that region, which is highly zzso amongst protein zzso of the zzso as well as the zzso zzso
