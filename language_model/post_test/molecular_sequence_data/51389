A zzso clone that encodes zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor from rice, was isolated and expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso using an expression zzso under the control of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The construct zzso zzso zzso a fusion protein containing 11 zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso of the bacterial protein zzso 10 and 79 zzso of zzso lacking 23 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso constituted approximately zzso of the total bacterial protein mass and was zzso in a single step by zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso toward zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso was comparable with that of the naturally occurring protein isolated from zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso from seven species of stored product insects was inhibited from 18 to zzso by zzso whereas the same activity was inhibited from 14 to zzso by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of stored product insects apparently contain both zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the relative amounts vary with the zzso When fed to the red flour zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso in the diet suppressed growth approximately zzso relative to that of the control group of zzso
