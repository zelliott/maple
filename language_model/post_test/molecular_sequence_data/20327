Avian influenza viruses of the zzso zzso have caused multiple outbreaks in domestic poultry and represent a significant threat to public health due to their propensity to occasionally transmit directly from birds to zzso In order to better understand the cross species transmission potential of zzso viruses in nature, we performed biological and molecular zzso of an zzso virus isolated from zzso in Canada in zzso 

zzso analysis that the zzso gene of the zzso zzso virus shares zzso identity with the highly zzso avian influenza zzso zzso virus isolated from a human case in British Columbia, Canada in zzso The zzso zzso virus was able to replicate in quail and zzso and transmitted efficiently in quail but not in zzso Interestingly, although this virus showed preferential binding to zzso of zzso receptors with zzso acid zzso linked to zzso in an zzso linkage zzso it zzso to high zzso in cultures of primary human airway zzso zzso cells, comparable to an avian zzso influenza virus with zzso zzso linkage receptors zzso In addition, the virus zzso in mice and zzso without prior adaptation and was able to transmit partially among zzso 

Our findings highlight the importance and need for systematic in zzso and in zzso analysis of avian influenza viruses isolated from the natural zzso in order to define their zzso zzso
