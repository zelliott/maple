zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso complex and its major linear B cell zzso corresponding to the region zzso has been found to be the initial target of the zzso response in patients with systemic lupus zzso This sequence contains one zzso and two zzso zzso acid zzso which can potentially be modified zzso by zzso or zzso zzso The aim of this study was to develop an zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso detection and to investigate the changes in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso when it is zzso zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the unmodified form of the zzso its zzso form, and a form with both zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso coating conditions were investigated and it was found that the use of highly zzso surfaces increase the efficiency of the zzso as well as the sensitivity of the method for zzso zzso zzso All peptides were tested by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against 119 zzso from patients with primary zzso syndrome, systemic lupus zzso and zzso arthritis with zzso zzso 20 zzso from patients with systemic diseases without zzso immune zzso as well as against 65 zzso from normal zzso A large proportion of the tested zzso reacted against all three zzso zzso although with a preference for the unmodified form of the zzso In conclusion, zzso modifications of the major zzso zzso B cell zzso can alter the zzso zzso
