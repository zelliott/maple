zzso zzso is a member of a group of pathogens that colonize the zzso of the host gastrointestinal tract via attaching and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which causes zzso zzso zzso in mice, is used as an in zzso model system for the clinically significant zzso pathogens zzso and zzso zzso zzso These bacteria all contain a zzso island called the locus of zzso zzso zzso which encodes a type III zzso system that is designed to deliver zzso proteins into zzso host zzso These zzso are involved in the zzso of host zzso cell functions to the benefit of the zzso In this study we used zzso strains to determine the effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso in the mouse zzso In addition, we identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso outside the zzso whose zzso is also dependent on a functional type III zzso zzso zzso strains with each of the zzso investigated were found to be zzso by zzso bacteria in zzso experiments in zzso although the effects of zzso and zzso were only zzso In zzso experiments, we found that zzso zzso and zzso are not required for efficient colonization of the mouse colon or for the production of zzso In contrast, strains producing zzso and zzso had significant colonization defects and resulted in dramatically reduced levels of zzso and they exhibited very different growth dynamics in mice than the zzso strain zzso
