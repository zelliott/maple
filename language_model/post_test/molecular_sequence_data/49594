zzso disease, a zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso is due to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso channel, zzso The zzso crystal structures of two bacterial zzso channels zzso have recently been established, thereby allowing us to construct a model for zzso and further examine the role of its zzso 

The data regarding 49 zzso zzso were zzso Thirty-four zzso that predicted absent or truncated channels were zzso The remaining 15 zzso (one zzso zzso and 14 zzso zzso 12 of which have been studied zzso were zzso The zzso sequence was aligned with the zzso zzso and zzso coli sequences and used to map the zzso zzso onto a three-dimensional zzso 

zzso is a zzso zzso with each zzso consisting of 18 zzso None of the zzso zzso involved the zzso zzso selectivity zzso but 12 of the 15 zzso were found to be clustered at the interface of the two zzso Six of these zzso occurred in two of the zzso that either form part of the interface or lie in close proximity to the zzso and three other zzso that did not lead to complete loss of zzso zzso were at the edge of the zzso 

These results demonstrate a crucial role for the interaction between the two zzso at the interface of the zzso zzso
