To develop an animal model for zzso zzso zzso targeted gene disruption in embryonic stem zzso cells was used to generate a zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso of the mouse zzso zzso zzso cells containing this zzso were used to generate zzso animals that transmitted the zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso animals display a severe zzso with approximately zzso dying within 1 week from zzso zzso zzso protection analysis of the zzso zzso did not detect any normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso from zzso mice included zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the bases of the zzso enlargement of zzso cells, and the presence of zzso in the zzso or between the zzso Changes were also present in the zzso zzso of the zzso and the minor zzso zzso where zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso material were zzso zzso of zzso cells that may be secondary to nutritional zzso and mild inflammation in the main pancreatic duct were present in the zzso of zzso zzso No changes were noted in the zzso zzso liver, or male zzso tract of zzso animals, and zzso males were zzso zzso zzso mice showed defects in zzso zzso transport both in zzso and in cultured fetal zzso zzso Thus, an additional mouse model for zzso has been generated that should prove useful for the understanding of the zzso and the development of treatments for zzso
