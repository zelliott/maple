The zzso for the green fluorescent protein zzso of zzso zzso has been expressed in transformed cells of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the cloned and zzso zzso produced major effects on its spectral zzso characteristics with an increase in pH enhancing the zzso zzso of the zzso more than zzso Finally, molecular zzso of zzso by zzso correlation zzso in a minimal target volume of 1 zzso yielded a zzso diffusion zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso equivalent to a zzso radius of zzso for a zzso zzso protein of zzso
