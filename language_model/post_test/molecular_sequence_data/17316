zzso reverse zzso zzso has been characterized in the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso has now been identified in the zzso rice zzso zzso zzso on the basis of its predicted zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso At least five alternatively spliced transcripts of the rice zzso zzso gene were zzso The full-length zzso protein shares structural features with zzso of other species, including a calculated molecular size of 144 zzso an zzso point of zzso and zzso sequence zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso clusters with zzso and is more related to the human and mouse zzso than to those of zzso and zzso zzso consistent with the evolutionary relations among these zzso zzso activity was abundant in shoot zzso and cultured cells but was low or absent in leaves or roots of rice plants, whereas similarly spliced zzso transcripts were detected in all zzso examined and cultured zzso Similar to mouse and human zzso zzso zzso contains two putative zzso sites for zzso zzso zzso of a rice cell extract with zzso or with protein zzso 2A zzso or inhibited zzso activity, respectively, whereas zzso did not affect the activity in zzso cell zzso In addition, the zzso activated the zzso in a leaf zzso The mechanism of zzso regulation in rice thus appears to differ from that in zzso (which is zzso predominantly at the level of zzso zzso possibly reflecting the zzso distance between zzso and zzso
