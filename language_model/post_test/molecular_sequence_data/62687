We present a zzso zzso that can be used to analyze the generic mechanisms involved in zzso zzso Our approach is based on energy calculations for the full set of base sequences that can be threaded onto the DNA within a zzso zzso It is able to reproduce experimental consensus binding sequences for a variety of DNA binding proteins and also zzso well with the order of measured binding free zzso These results suggest that the crystal structure of a zzso complex can be used to identify all potential binding zzso By analyzing the energy contributions that lead to base sequence zzso it is possible to zzso the concept of direct versus indirect recognition and to identify a new concept describing whether the zzso interaction and DNA deformation terms select optimal binding sites by acting in zzso or in zzso
