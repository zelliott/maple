zzso and skates are representatives of the earliest zzso with an immune system based on zzso zzso They possess a unique zzso gene organization consisting of 15 to zzso individual zzso zzso each with one zzso two zzso one zzso and one set of constant region zzso The present study attempts to understand how multiple zzso genes are regulated with respect to zzso initiation and to targeting during zzso zzso The linkage of three zzso zzso genes was determined, and zzso zzso zzso studies in a zzso animal were used to examine any relationship between relative gene position and likelihood of zzso Our results show that one to three zzso genes are activated independently of linkage or zzso position and the data best fit with a probability model based on the hypothesis that zzso zzso occurs as a sequence of trials within the B zzso In the zzso cell set, two closely related zzso zzso and zzso rearranged at similar zzso and their membrane forms were expressed at similar levels, like in other young zzso However, older animals displayed a bias in favor of the zzso zzso which suggests that although zzso at zzso and zzso was randomly initiated during primary repertoire generation, the two very similar zzso sequences appear to be zzso expressed with age and exposure to zzso We performed zzso zzso zzso on B cells from an zzso individual to study zzso zzso zzso targeting and found that zzso like zzso zzso occurred independently among the many shark zzso
