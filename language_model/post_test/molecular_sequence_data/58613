We have isolated 48 zzso artificial zzso zzso clones from a 4 zzso zzso region of human zzso zzso zzso by the markers zzso Within this region, we have assembled a zzso zzso zzso across the zzso zzso containing 42 zzso As a first step toward completing the detailed zzso map of the region, we have mapped 9 gene sequences and 10 expressed sequence zzso Fifteen zzso zzso repeat markers and 17 novel zzso sites from the region are also zzso The mapping of zzso simple tandem repeat markers has permitted the integration of existing genetic and physical maps of the zzso Together these maps provide a valuable resource for fine structure mapping and DNA sequencing across the region as well as for the identification of disease gene zzso and the isolation of novel coding zzso
