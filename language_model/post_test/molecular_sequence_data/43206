The zzso gene zzso is expressed in a complex pattern during cell division and plant development in zzso zzso Plants transformed with the zzso reporter gene placed under the control of the zzso 263 zzso of the promoter are able to express zzso activity in dividing zzso This expression is modified when a zzso motif is zzso In order to clarify the zzso regulation of this zzso we zzso positively regulating sequences in this zzso promoter by zzso zzso zzso zzso We observed that the zzso element gave rise to only weak zzso bands but that a new zzso zzso directs formation of numerous, distinctive, strong and zzso specific shifts with nuclear extracts prepared from various different zzso stages and from dividing zzso Point zzso within this motif abolish formation of the zzso complexes and reduce promoter activity in transient expression zzso This novel putative zzso element, which we called the zzso present 12 zzso upstream of the zzso element, thus seems also to be critical for zzso promoter zzso
