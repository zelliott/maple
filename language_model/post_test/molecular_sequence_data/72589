The zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso is considered to be an important factor in the zzso potential of this zzso in destructive zzso zzso Multiple forms of closely related zzso zzso are present in the culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso in which the zzso alpha chain is associated with a second beta chain which functions as a zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso with reduced zzso compared to the other two zzso The zzso sequence of the alpha chain of all three forms is zzso suggesting that all these zzso may arise by differential processing of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso In the present study we constructed a zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso by zzso gene zzso and characterized the residual zzso zzso zzso activity of the resulting zzso Loss of zzso expression led to the abolition of zzso zzso and zzso but the total zzso activity in the zzso of this strain was reduced by only zzso zzso The remaining activity was composed of two novel forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which appeared to be structurally and zzso almost identical to zzso and zzso respectively, except for two zzso acid differences in the zzso at position 8 zzso and position 17 zzso and with respect to their stability to high zzso Confirmation that zzso and zzso are the products of a zzso locus zzso was obtained by cloning and sequencing the zzso which showed the predicted zzso in the deduced zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso and zzso are produced by zzso expression and a maturation zzso which can give rise to a zzso and an zzso or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso the products of zzso are exported into the culture zzso in the absence of zzso expression and these forms may also contribute to the zzso potential of this zzso in destructive zzso
