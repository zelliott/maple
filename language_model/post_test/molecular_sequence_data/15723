We have previously described a novel zzso DNA transfer process that occurs in zzso zzso To identify donor genes required for transfer, we have performed a zzso zzso zzso we report here that zzso a putative zzso is essential for efficient DNA zzso zzso analyses predict that zzso contains a signal zzso necessary for the zzso targeting to the cell envelope and a metal zzso binding zzso the likely zzso site for zzso zzso Using targeted zzso we demonstrate that each of these motifs is necessary for DNA transfer and that zzso is located in the cell zzso The requirement for transfer is specific to the donor zzso an zzso knockout zzso in the recipient is still zzso in transfer zzso The activity of zzso is zzso among zzso zzso from both zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso can complement zzso donor zzso suggesting that the zzso recognize and process similar zzso zzso constitute a significant proportion of the zzso cell wall, but despite their zzso very few have been assigned an zzso We discuss the potential role of zzso in DNA transfer and the implications of the conservation of zzso activity in zzso zzso
