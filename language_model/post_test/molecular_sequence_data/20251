zzso and zzso are two examples of zzso outer membrane import proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso iron zzso by the zzso zzso and serves as a zzso for zzso a toxic bacterial zzso and a toxic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulates zzso of an zzso zzso five zzso zzso zzso transport zzso Properties of zzso zzso selected according to the zzso crystal structure are zzso zzso zzso in the zzso box, the zzso and the zzso are rather zzso zzso box zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso some zzso are suppressed by zzso in zzso zzso studies have not revealed a zzso diffusion pathway, and tolerance to zzso in the region linking the zzso box to the hatch does not disclose a mechanism for how energy transfer from the zzso membrane to zzso changes the zzso of zzso such that bound zzso are released, the pore is opened, and zzso enter the zzso or how surface zzso change their zzso such that zzso zzso bind zzso and release their DNA into the zzso The zzso and zzso crystal structures do not disclose the mechanism of these zzso but they provide important information for specific functional zzso zzso is also a regulatory protein that zzso a signal from the cell surface into the zzso The interacting zzso of the proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso have been zzso zzso zzso transport not only iron and vitamin zzso but also other zzso of very low abundance such as zzso across the outer zzso zzso regulation of the transport genes may occur similarly to that of the zzso transport zzso
