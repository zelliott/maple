A Type zzso zzso system zzso is required for zzso growth in zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso binds to zzso and has a critical role in the zzso We have now solved a crystal structure of zzso to further our understanding of this zzso This structure revealed an zzso zzso zzso formed by zzso and the zzso domain of zzso which is linked to a novel zzso domain of zzso zzso by a zzso zzso The zzso domain has structural zzso with zzso zzso zzso in certain bacterial toxins and binds zzso with a zzso constant in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamics were used to identify an extended zzso binding site on zzso and the resulting model was tested by zzso and binding zzso Based on the data, we suggest that zzso binds to zzso where it may interact with, or perhaps zzso a protein in the zzso when zzso is zzso
