The zzso free radical initiated zzso sequencing zzso fragmentation behavior of zzso peptides with an zzso and zzso zzso bond was investigated using zzso tandem mass zzso zzso zzso peptides included four peptides with an zzso zzso zzso bond, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and two peptides with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso radical zzso zzso zzso which was generated through the release of a zzso radical from zzso peptides upon initial zzso zzso produced a large number of zzso backbone fragments in which the zzso or zzso bond was readily zzso The observed zzso backbone fragments included zzso zzso zzso or zzso which indicates that the zzso zzso fragmentation mechanism plays an important role in zzso mass zzso zzso application of the zzso linked zzso peptides further showed that the zzso or zzso bond was selectively and zzso zzso followed by zzso backbone zzso In the zzso mass zzso the loss of zzso or zzso was also abundantly zzso On the basis of these findings, zzso fragmentation pathways for peptides with a zzso bond are zzso For the zzso of the zzso bond, the abstraction of a hydrogen atom at zzso by the zzso radical is proposed to be the initial radical zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso at zzso is suggested to lead to zzso bond zzso which yields zzso zzso zzso fragments or the loss of zzso or zzso
