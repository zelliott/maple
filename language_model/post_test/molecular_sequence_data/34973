zzso nuclear zzso L zzso zzso is an abundant zzso protein implicated in many zzso including zzso processing, zzso export of zzso zzso internal zzso entry zzso translation, and zzso zzso It contains four zzso recognition motifs zzso that bind with CA repeats or zzso zzso In this study, surface zzso resonance zzso zzso revealed that all four zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso Furthermore, we zzso the crystal structures of zzso L zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso all adopt the typical zzso zzso except for an unusual fifth zzso in zzso zzso and zzso interact intimately with each other mainly through zzso surfaces, leading the two zzso to face opposite zzso zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance zzso results suggested that the zzso of zzso and zzso are accessible for zzso zzso zzso gel shift zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso together with zzso and dynamic light scattering zzso demonstrated that zzso L zzso zzso zzso looping when binding to two appropriately separated binding sites within the same target zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding studies with in zzso target zzso suggested that zzso zzso zzso looping may occur in zzso Our study provides a zzso explanation for the dual functions of zzso L in alternative zzso regulation as an zzso or zzso
