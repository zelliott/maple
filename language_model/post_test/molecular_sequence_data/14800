To demonstrate the zzso evolution, the molecular characteristics of the motif of zzso protein zzso site and the varieties at the zzso binding sites of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso avian influenza zzso sequence alignment and zzso analysis were performed by zzso zzso zzso zzso The results revealed that the zzso zzso zzso viruses originated from zzso and zzso all the zzso zzso zzso viruses from mainland China belonged to zzso and formed multiple zzso through complicated zzso while other zzso zzso zzso isolated from other countries in zzso American and European such as Korea, Japan, Alberta, Austria, Switzerland, Iran, belonged to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso acids at positions zzso 190, and 226 of the zzso binding sites of zzso group zzso had highly zzso zzso E and Q zzso In contrast with zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso from mainland China, the zzso acids had N at positions zzso A, zzso or V at 190, L or Q at zzso which was the same as the zzso zzso zzso from mainland zzso Most newly isolated zzso zzso zzso in zzso Province in Southern China had L at position 226 emphasized the higher risk of zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso
