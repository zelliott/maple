zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was isolated by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso analysis revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein with zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein shows extensive zzso to zzso zzso from various organisms, with an overall identity of zzso to the zzso from zzso zzso The zzso gene has two major zzso zzso located at zzso zzso and zzso zzso relative to the zzso translation start zzso The gene is expressed on ethanol medium only in zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso carrying a zzso deletion lack the ability to zzso zzso zzso A zzso deletion zzso does not grow on ethanol medium and lacks any zzso zzso zzso A strain lacking the gene zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks the ability to grow on zzso carbon zzso This implies that zzso zzso does not contain additional zzso catalyzing either of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that neither zzso nor zzso are subject to zzso zzso However, the respective zzso from zzso zzso are efficiently zzso when expressed in zzso zzso Thus, despite the extensive sequence similarities of the zzso involved, zzso zzso metabolism in the two zzso displays distinct regulatory zzso
