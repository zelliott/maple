zzso modification by zzso zzso and zzso zzso is one of the most important mechanisms regulating a wide range of cellular processes in zzso Through zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso the zzso modification of proteins by multiple zzso zzso can regulate many different cellular functions such as transcription, zzso processing, signal zzso and cell zzso To better understand zzso and its functions, zzso approaches have been developed to purify and identify more protein zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso binds to zzso chains containing four or more zzso In this study, immobilized zzso fusion protein was used to zzso zzso proteins from Chang liver zzso The zzso proteins were then identified with zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso potential zzso zzso were zzso From these zzso 19 potential zzso sites on 17 potential zzso were zzso These potential zzso zzso are mainly related to important cellular functions including zzso translation and zzso Our results provide helpful information for further understanding of the relationship between zzso machinery and different cell zzso
