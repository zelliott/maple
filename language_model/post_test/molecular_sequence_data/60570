The zzso binding proteins zzso I and II play a major role in zzso zzso in which they are found localized to the zzso of the zzso zzso Here we report on zzso I zzso isolated by gene zzso in zzso The original zzso and reconstructed versions of the original, as well as zzso I zzso are unable to form zzso zzso under zzso zzso The zzso bodies that do form when cells are grown on bacterial lawns lack the one- and two-dimensional zzso so apparent in wild zzso These two zzso and the proposed structural basis for them suggest that zzso I functions in zzso and zzso in addition to its role in zzso
