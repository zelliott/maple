The expression of the zzso genes in 46 zzso zzso cells that zzso zzso directed to the zzso zzso zzso especially zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso was analyzed by Northern zzso of zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso for nine zzso gene zzso Different zzso tended to express zzso genes of the same family when the zzso zzso had the same or similar zzso zzso zzso the zzso genes of the zzso family zzso 1) were zzso expressed in the zzso directed to various zzso that have zzso alpha (or zzso zzso 2-3 and/or zzso linkage zzso the most common linkage of zzso acid zzso in the zzso of higher animals, and the zzso directed to zzso zzso also expressed mainly the zzso genes of the zzso family zzso In contrast, the five zzso directed to various zzso with zzso alpha 2-6 linkage were exclusively zzso by the zzso genes of zzso family zzso 2, zzso and three zzso directed to zzso with a zzso alpha zzso linkage all expressed genes of zzso family zzso 6, zzso The zzso family usage was largely correlated with the linkage of zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso zzso but was not correlated at all with the difference in the fine zzso toward the core neutral zzso chain, to which the zzso acid zzso were zzso These findings suggest that the zzso gene family in these zzso zzso is selected, depending primarily on the linkage of the zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso these zzso form the zzso sugar zzso in the respective zzso zzso
