zzso of the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes was examined in various human zzso including muscle, zzso liver, zzso zzso stomach and zzso The gross level of zzso expression of zzso and zzso genes was estimated by Northern zzso zzso chain reaction was used to detect zzso expressed at low levels in these zzso zzso expression of alternatively spliced zzso gene transcripts was also determined by zzso chain zzso The results indicated that alternative zzso of zzso gene transcripts was controlled in a zzso zzso
