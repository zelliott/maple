zzso proteins are zzso exchange factors for zzso zzso that are activated by zzso zzso These proteins activate zzso zzso and zzso but not the highly related zzso zzso At present, there is no available information to explain this zzso selectivity at the structural zzso Here we show that the selection of zzso proteins zzso is achieved at two different zzso On one hand, zzso proteins zzso some zzso of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to assure the specific binding to its zzso In addition, these exchange factors need a second structural signal located in the zzso region of zzso proteins zzso zzso to promote proper zzso zzso These results identify the zzso acid zzso that allow the discrimination of the zzso family zzso from zzso and, in addition, demonstrate that the zzso of specific zzso zzso by these zzso requires two zzso events, binding and subsequent zzso reaction, whose zzso are determined by two separate regions of zzso zzso
