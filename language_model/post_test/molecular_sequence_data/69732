We have reported previously that zzso zzso of human pancreatic zzso zzso unlike the zzso zzso zzso was buried and zzso to classical zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was lost after the labeling of the above two zzso groups with the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso may play an important role in the zzso process zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For the present experiments, we selected dog pancreatic zzso zzso zzso it for the first time, and zzso guinea pig pancreatic zzso zzso which both contain a buried zzso group but no accessible zzso zzso The single zzso of zzso and zzso reacted only with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its labeling was correlated with a rapid zzso zzso Although it is zzso remote from the zzso zzso the zzso group of pancreatic zzso when chemically labeled, was found to be responsible for the loss of their zzso zzso The presence of a bulky zzso chain, linked by a zzso bond to the zzso may have prevented the critical zzso loop zzso zzso movement by zzso hindrance and consequently disturbed the formation of the zzso zzso Thus, pancreatic zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso can be said to be due to the prevention of a productive induced zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso reacting with the essential zzso of the zzso active zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
