Hint protein zzso appear in zzso and in the zzso region of zzso and zzso animal zzso zzso zzso Hint zzso are responsible and sufficient for zzso of their zzso zzso In zzso proteins the Hint domain zzso its zzso from the zzso domain of the zzso protein by attaching a cholesterol zzso to zzso We identified two new types of Hint zzso Both types have active site sequence features of Hint zzso but also possess distinguishing sequence zzso The new zzso appear in more than 50 different proteins from diverse bacteria, including zzso species of humans and plants, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso These new zzso are termed bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in variable protein regions and are typically flanked by zzso that also appear in zzso proteins such as zzso zzso and calcium binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso sequences suggests that they were positively selected for in different zzso We cloned two zzso zzso of different types and showed them to be zzso One of the zzso efficiently zzso itself from its zzso flank and could also zzso its two zzso in zzso coli and in a cell free zzso We discuss several possible biological roles for zzso zzso including zzso and post zzso modification for generating protein zzso
