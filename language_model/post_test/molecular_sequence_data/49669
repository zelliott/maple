A gene zzso a putative zzso zzso named zzso which is a zzso of the major zzso zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is transcribed in zzso zzso zzso and its expression is modulated during cellular zzso The zzso zzso protein has a modular structure with three zzso an zzso domain, especially rich in zzso zzso Pro and zzso zzso resembling a zzso zzso a central domain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso domain of unknown zzso A zzso zzso zzso devoid of its zzso domain, was expressed in zzso zzso It exhibited zzso activity on the zzso of several zzso bacteria, including zzso zzso Though showing sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso in order to evaluate the role of the zzso zzso does not appear to be involved in cell separation but contributes to cellular zzso
