A zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and interrupts host physiology for zzso survival and zzso Identification of zzso factors would be helpful to understand the zzso zzso This study focused on identification of a zzso protein found only in plasma of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed after zzso zzso acid sequencing of the zzso protein and used to clone the corresponding gene from the zzso zzso zzso by a zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Two zzso genes were cloned and identified as zzso and zzso respectively, due to the identical size zzso zzso acid zzso of the predicted open reading zzso in which they shared zzso acid sequences in both terminal regions, but varied in internal zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that both genes were located on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso revealed that both genes were mostly expressed at the late zzso period, which was further confirmed by an zzso zzso using zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein was produced from zzso cells via a zzso expression zzso The zzso zzso protein could enter zzso of zzso zzso and were localized in the zzso Along with the sequence similarities of zzso with zzso initiation factors, their putative biological role has been discussed in terms of the host translation zzso zzso
