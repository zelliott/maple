zzso organisms zzso are widespread obligatory predators of other zzso zzso Their detection by zzso methods is complicated as their replication is totally dependent upon the availability of an appropriate zzso Because zzso do not form zzso dominant groups within microbial communities, zzso zzso tools also generally fail to detect zzso We designed sets of zzso zzso zzso that specifically target zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso were combined, yielding partial zzso zzso zzso This simple method that allows specific in zzso zzso detection of zzso was applied to the soil zzso zzso organisms were also isolated from the same soil and the zzso and prey range of the zzso zzso zzso zzso retrieved using five different potential zzso exhibited eight different zzso of prey zzso and formed nine operational zzso units zzso These zzso were affiliated with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso the known zzso zzso In comparison, 15 zzso including 10 that were not detected by the zzso approach were obtained using the specific zzso in a zzso zzso The occurrence of a complex zzso community suggests that zzso occurs on a much wider range of prey than can be detected by the classical zzso zzso
