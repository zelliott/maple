zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso zzso pneumonia, which affects pig farms worldwide, causing heavy economic zzso In the infection process, this zzso is exposed to zzso oxygen species zzso from its own metabolism or generated by the host as one of the strategies used to neutralize the zzso Although the presence of classical zzso zzso would be expected in zzso zzso important genes directly related to protection against zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have not been identified by sequence zzso in the zzso sequence zzso Among the few identified zzso zzso genes coding for proteins possibly involved with suppression of zzso damage, one zzso coding for a zzso zzso has been zzso The sequence and zzso analyses zzso in this study indicate that zzso is closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso although it has only one zzso in its zzso The zzso coding DNA sequence was cloned and expressed in zzso coli to produce a zzso zzso zzso which was zzso and used to zzso mice and produce an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso extracts with this zzso demonstrated that zzso is expressed in all three tested strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicate that zzso forms zzso as has been established for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso system was used to zzso the activity of zzso showing that it can protect DNA from zzso damage and may play an essential role during zzso
