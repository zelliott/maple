The family zzso includes human and animal zzso zzso viruses zzso with extensive genetic zzso The zzso diversity among zzso has never been zzso Using zzso zzso zzso virus zzso as a model, we describe here the first investigation of the zzso relationships among different zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the respective putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso real-time zzso the combined zzso and zzso profile of zzso infection in pigs was determined and compared with that of zzso zzso is likely not associated with zzso zzso disease zzso because both the viral loads and zzso levels were not different between affected and unaffected pigs and because there was no synergistic effect of concurrent zzso zzso We did observe a higher correlation of zzso zzso levels between zzso and zzso than between zzso or zzso and zzso zzso in these zzso zzso potential zzso zzso To confirm this, rabbit zzso against the putative zzso proteins of zzso zzso or zzso were generated, and the zzso relationships among these zzso were analyzed by an zzso and by an zzso zzso zzso using zzso cells zzso with one of the three zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate zzso zzso between the two zzso zzso and zzso but not between the two species zzso or zzso and zzso Furthermore, an zzso 1 human zzso zzso did not react with any of the three zzso zzso These results have important implications for an understanding of the diversity of zzso as well as for the zzso and vaccine development of zzso
