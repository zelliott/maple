zzso and zzso two main red flower zzso never occur together in the same zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso has been well zzso the zzso genes and the regulatory mechanism of the zzso zzso are still zzso We cloned two zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso that may be involved in the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso and zzso showed approximately zzso zzso to each zzso The promoter regions of zzso and zzso were isolated by inverse zzso and analyzed using PLACE zzso Some putative zzso zzso and environmental zzso zzso factor binding sites were detected in the zzso and zzso promoter zzso zzso patterns of zzso and zzso in suspension cultures of zzso zzso were investigated by zzso zzso The transcripts of zzso were found in both zzso red cells and zzso white cells, suggesting that not only the expression of zzso but also the supplementation of zzso might be a regulatory step for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
