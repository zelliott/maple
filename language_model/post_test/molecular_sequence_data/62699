The potential prostate cancer zzso gene zzso has a zzso zzso zzso (which we call zzso for zzso of zzso We have explored the biological role of this gene using zzso to reduce gene zzso We found that worms subjected to zzso zzso are zzso and zzso The zzso results from a drastic reduction in zzso proliferation and zzso arrest of zzso zzso We found that zzso is required for zzso zzso seen with zzso in three different zzso suggesting zzso may be generally required for zzso zzso We also found that reduction of zzso by zzso suppresses the zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso in zzso and that this suppression is likely to be zzso This is the first demonstration of a biological role for this class of proteins in a complex zzso and adds important information when considering the role of zzso in prostate zzso
