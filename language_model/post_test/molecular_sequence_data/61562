zzso of filtered zzso by the kidney zzso is essential for retaining high levels of zzso in body zzso of marine zzso To zzso the mechanisms of zzso zzso we examined the distribution of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the kidney of the dogfish zzso zzso We isolated a zzso zzso a zzso that is zzso to the zzso zzso cloned from another dogfish species, zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in the zzso while low levels of expression were detected in the brain and zzso In the dogfish zzso each zzso makes four turns and zzso repeatedly between bundle zone and zzso zzso In the bundle zone, the resulting five zzso segments are arranged in a zzso loop zzso zzso using specific zzso raised against the cloned zzso revealed that, among the zzso zzso the zzso is expressed exclusively in the final segment of the bundle zone, zzso in the collecting zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast to the limited zzso of zzso the transport zzso zzso is distributed in the zzso membrane of numerous zzso segments both in the zzso zone and the bundle zzso However, in the collecting zzso zzso zzso was not zzso The present study suggests that the collecting zzso is responsible for the zzso of zzso in the marine zzso zzso Other zzso segments may contribute to production of a driving force for zzso diffusion of zzso through the zzso
