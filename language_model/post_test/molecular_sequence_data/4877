The effect of zzso secondary structure on the zzso of DNA synthesis zzso by zzso zzso was determined using a 66 zzso zzso template containing a stable 12 base pair hairpin zzso Prior to reaching the hairpin structure, the primer zzso by zzso was fast and the zzso of zzso was not affected by the presence of the secondary zzso Once within the regions of template secondary structure, zzso was much slower and zzso paused at five distinct sites zzso zzso & Johnson, zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso submitted for zzso zzso analysis of single zzso incorporation at the pause sites showed zzso occurred by both a fast phase zzso zzso and a slow phase zzso zzso during a single binding zzso The zzso zzso suggests that the DNA zzso are initially bound in both productive and zzso states at the zzso site of zzso The zzso bound DNA is slowly converted into a productive state without zzso from the zzso At the pause sites, the zzso zzso of the fast phase are small zzso while the zzso of the slow phase are large zzso In contrast, only the reaction at the fast phase was observed at the zzso sites and the zzso zzso were large zzso although the zzso incorporation rates zzso zzso are similar to the fast phase rates at the pause zzso These indicate that DNA zzso were bound predominantly zzso at pause sites and zzso at zzso zzso However, the overall binding affinity of DNA zzso was measured by the zzso double filter binding zzso binding affinity at both pause sites and zzso sites was similar zzso zzso This indicates that zzso are bound tightly at the large binding zzso of zzso although they may not be zzso bound at the zzso active zzso These results and those reported elsewhere zzso zzso & Johnson, zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso submitted for zzso are consistent with a model in which, at pause sites, zzso zzso remains bound to DNA zzso waiting for the melting of the next stem base pair of template secondary zzso Upon melting of the stem base pair, zzso to fill the open template site is fast and largely zzso allowing zzso to read through the stable hairpin zzso
