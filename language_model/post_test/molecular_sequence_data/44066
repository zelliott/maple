Nuclear zzso are thought to play an important role in zzso and zzso of the nucleus during zzso Here, we describe a zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting from a P element zzso into the first zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso animals showed a severe zzso including zzso in development, reduced zzso sterility, and impaired zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed that reduced zzso zzso expression caused an enrichment of nuclear pore complexes in zzso zzso zzso and in nuclear envelope zzso In several cells, particularly the densely packed zzso of the central nervous system, defective nuclear envelopes were observed in zzso All aspects of the zzso zzso were rescued upon P zzso zzso transformation with a zzso zzso zzso These data constitute the first genetic proof that zzso are essential for the structural organization of the cell zzso
