We have reported that a novel zzso binding zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso and was zzso from the zzso to the nucleus in a zzso zzso zzso works as an zzso of human zzso cell differentiation upon induction of zzso To characterize the expression or functional importance of zzso the zzso DNA of mouse zzso was cloned and zzso Both mouse and human zzso zzso the latter of which was retrieved from a human DNA database, comprise five zzso spanning about 11 zzso To characterize the promoter of the mouse zzso zzso a series of deletion zzso of the region upstream of the first zzso was linked to the zzso zzso and their zzso activities were measured in human zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that zzso was essential for zzso expression in both cell lines and that zzso is also necessary in zzso zzso zzso in both cell lines and zzso only in zzso cells were identified as proteins binding to these sites by a mobility shift zzso Furthermore, it was found that zzso zzso zzso expression zzso with zzso in zzso expressed insect cells and that both proteins were associated in zzso zzso
