A new zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from an activated sludge reactor showing enhanced biological zzso removal zzso The new isolate was a slowly growing zzso and was capable of accumulating large amounts of zzso zzso from zzso taken zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso The new isolate contained zzso acid zzso in the cell zzso Complex fatty acid patterns with zzso zzso zzso zzso and four other minor saturated or zzso zzso fatty acids were zzso The isolate contained a high zzso zzso content zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequence placed the isolate in the high zzso zzso group with zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the closest relatives zzso similarities are 93 and 92 zzso zzso These three organisms shared common features in zzso but strain zzso could be differentiated from the other species by its zzso type zzso fatty acid zzso carbon source zzso profile and zzso zzso On the basis of these findings, it is proposed that a new zzso and species, zzso zzso should be created for the new zzso the type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
