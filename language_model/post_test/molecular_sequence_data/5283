zzso N zzso is the major cell surface zzso for group 1 zzso In this study, we have isolated and characterized a zzso zzso zzso and shown that the zzso of human embryonic kidney cells with this zzso renders them susceptible to infection with the zzso coronavirus zzso infectious zzso virus, the human coronavirus zzso zzso and the zzso coronavirus zzso zzso zzso zzso By using zzso zzso zzso assembled from zzso and zzso zzso we have shown that, zzso to the human zzso zzso a region within the zzso part of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso acids zzso is essential for its zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, by comparing the relevant zzso human and zzso zzso zzso we were able to identify a zzso stretch of eight zzso acids that are more closely related in the zzso and human zzso proteins than in the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we converted this stretch of zzso acids within the zzso zzso zzso to the corresponding zzso of the human zzso zzso These changes were sufficient to convert zzso zzso into a functional zzso for zzso zzso and thus define a small number of zzso that are critically important for the zzso zzso zzso function of human zzso
