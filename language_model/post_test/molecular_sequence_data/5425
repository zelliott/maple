zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso consisting of highly zzso zzso zzso and variable regulatory zzso The regulatory zzso reside in either the zzso or the zzso depending upon the zzso The rat zzso zzso zzso lacks the regulatory domain, but the rat liver and the bovine heart zzso contain zzso zzso in the zzso and the zzso zzso In order to determine whether the regulatory zzso can be zzso we have constructed zzso zzso in which the zzso or the zzso tail of the zzso zzso was replaced with that of either the liver or the heart zzso The substitution with the zzso of the liver zzso zzso resulted in a small change in the kinetic properties of zzso zzso but that with the heart zzso increased the zzso zzso zzso without affecting the zzso The substitution with the zzso of the heart zzso had little zzso The zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso fivefold as in the liver zzso but did not affect the zzso zzso unlike the liver zzso All these zzso zzso were more zzso zzso than the wild type zzso zzso zzso was more sensitive to the zzso These results suggest that the zzso of the liver zzso could interact with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso regulating the zzso activity but was unable to affect the zzso zzso These differences could be explained by the large differences in net charges of the terminal zzso
