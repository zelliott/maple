zzso proteins zzso are zzso by the limb zzso zzso gene and define a family of related gene products regulating establishment of embryonic zzso In this study we establish that chicken and zzso zzso proteins interact directly with zzso family zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding is zzso by the zzso domain present in zzso proteins and the zzso binding surface of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proteins from zzso cells shows that these proteins associate in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso confirms the zzso nuclear zzso of zzso zzso but unexpectedly identifies a population of zzso proteins associated to cellular zzso This population of zzso proteins zzso with zzso zzso proteins at both plasma and zzso zzso These studies indicate that the zzso zzso proteins interact with signal zzso zzso by association to zzso zzso family zzso
