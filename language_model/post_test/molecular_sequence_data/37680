The CD zzso loop region of the zzso II reaction center protein zzso contains zzso involved in oxygen zzso Since detailed structural information about this region is zzso an zzso zzso zzso approach was used to investigate zzso relationships in this vital region of zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso The CD loop coding region contains close to 100 zzso and for effective zzso it was subdivided into four regions of seven to eight zzso A zzso selection protocol was employed such that all zzso that were selected contained a functional zzso zzso In this way, conservation patterns of zzso along with numbers and types of zzso acid zzso zzso at each position for each set of zzso would indicate which zzso in the CD loop may play important structural and functional zzso zzso of this study have substantiated the importance of zzso previously studied by zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso and have identified other previously unremarkable zzso in the CD loop (such as zzso zzso and zzso that cannot be replaced by many other zzso In addition, the zzso of the CD loop was further tested using deletion and zzso substitution zzso in zzso This showed that the length of the loop was important to its function, and in two cases, zzso could accommodate zzso sequences from zzso which forms a zzso with zzso in zzso II, but not the other way zzso This study of the CD loop in zzso provides valuable clues regarding the structural and functional requirements of the zzso
