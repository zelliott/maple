zzso storage disease type III zzso is caused by a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients are found to have deficient zzso activity in both muscle and liver, and also zzso zzso in the liver, but not in zzso To determine the molecular basis of zzso zzso in zzso and to zzso the mechanism for control of zzso expression of zzso we previously cloned and zzso the human muscle zzso zzso Here we report the isolation and zzso sequence of liver zzso zzso and the tissue distribution of the zzso zzso The zzso form of human liver zzso zzso zzso 1) contained 400 zzso of zzso untranslated region, zzso zzso of coding region, and zzso zzso of 3' untranslated zzso The liver zzso zzso sequence was identical to the previously published muscle sequence zzso 5) for most of the zzso except for the zzso end, in which the liver sequence zzso completely from the muscle zzso The divergence began with the zzso start point and extended 82 zzso downstream from the translation initiation zzso Six zzso of zzso zzso were identified and zzso from liver and zzso These zzso differed only at the zzso zzso zzso distribution studies showed that liver, kidney and zzso cells expressed predominantly zzso 1; whereas muscle and heart expressed not only zzso 1, but also zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, 3 and zzso Defining zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important step toward understanding the molecular basis of zzso zzso in zzso
