Fluorescent zzso that facilitate zzso sensitive detection of small molecules are crucial tools in the areas of zzso and zzso However, construction of fluorescent zzso with desired zzso that is, detection zzso and concentration ranges for zzso zzso from zzso receptors is not a straightforward zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso was converted to a fluorescent zzso sensor without chemically zzso the zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and a zzso modified with a zzso group formed a stable fluorescent zzso complex that showed an increase in the zzso intensity upon binding to zzso The strategy to convert the zzso zzso zzso to a fluorescent zzso sensor was applied to generate fluorescent zzso zzso libraries by using a pool of zzso zzso obtained from the in zzso selection of zzso zzso and a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso screening of the fluorescent zzso library based on the zzso zzso intensity changes in the absence and presence of the zzso afforded fluorescent zzso or zzso sensors with zzso zzso varying from 390 to 670 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso intensity changes in the presence of increasing zzso of zzso allowed zzso analysis of the fluorescent zzso library, which provided zzso sensors responding at wide concentration ranges of zzso The zzso strategy using the modular zzso zzso reported here enables tailoring of a fluorescent sensor for a specific zzso without knowledge of detailed structural information for the zzso zzso
