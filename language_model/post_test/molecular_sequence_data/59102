A clone for an zzso early zzso zzso zzso gene has been isolated from a wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso The transcript of this gene was only expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and developing zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso showed a direct and positive correlation with an increase of the plant hormone, zzso acid zzso in developing zzso zzso Treating cultures with an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso suppressed not only zzso zzso but also the appearance of the zzso gene transcript and the ability of zzso to form zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene may act as a molecular marker for zzso zzso because zzso zzso is accompanied by the increased expression of the zzso transcript that zzso with the differentiation of zzso zzso in wheat zzso zzso
