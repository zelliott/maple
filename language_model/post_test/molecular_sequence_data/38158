zzso protein zzso driven by a crude zzso extract from zzso coli, has been applied to the preparation of proteins containing zzso zzso acids at specific zzso We have developed methods for zzso zzso and zzso within a crude zzso coli zzso by an zzso treatment and for digesting most of the zzso within the zzso extract without essential damage to the zzso zzso In the present study, we applied these methods to the substitution of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso With 10 zzso zzso the translation efficiency was higher than that with the other tested zzso and the zzso efficiency was zzso The zzso zzso was translated in the presence of an zzso zzso zzso mixture and zzso and/or zzso The results suggest that a good portion of the translation products are zzso at all of the seven positions originally occupied by zzso or zzso
