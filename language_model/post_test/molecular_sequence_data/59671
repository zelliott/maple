zzso cultures of zzso human zzso contain zzso but structurally altered copies of the viral zzso The presence of these sequences is required for expression of properties associated with the transformed zzso including zzso The integrated viral sequences in an zzso line of zzso human zzso have been found to be contained on two zzso fragments of about zzso and zzso zzso In the larger zzso the viral sequences were present as two zzso repeated zzso fragments containing the viral zzso region with zzso zzso that affect zzso function, the origin of replication and T zzso binding site zzso The viral early gene promoter in one zzso gave rise to an zzso fusion transcript comprised of a short portion of the viral early gene leader sequence and the zzso human zzso The smaller zzso consisted of full-length zzso containing a zzso zzso in the zzso portion of the zzso T zzso a region involved in the regulation of viral host zzso
