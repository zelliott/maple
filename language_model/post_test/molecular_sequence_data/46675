Human zzso zzso and its zzso on mouse zzso 13 contain candidate genes for an inherited human neurodegenerative disorder called spinal muscular zzso zzso and for an inherited mouse zzso to infection with zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso regions also have unusual repetitive organizations that create practical difficulties in mapping and raise interesting issues about the evolutionary origin of the zzso In an attempt to analyze this region in detail, and as a way to identify additional candidate genes for these diseases, we have determined the sequence of 179 zzso of the mouse zzso zzso We have analyzed this sequence using zzso searches and various zzso prediction programs to identify potential zzso Since these methods can generate zzso zzso zzso our alignments of the mouse sequence with available human zzso sequence allowed us to discriminate rapidly among this collection of potential coding regions by indicating which regions were well zzso and were more likely to represent actual coding zzso As a result of our analysis, we accurately mapped two additional genes in the zzso zzso that can be tested for involvement in the zzso of zzso While no new zzso candidates emerged, we have identified new genetic markers that exclude zzso as an zzso zzso In addition to providing important resources for studying zzso and zzso our data provide further evidence of the value of sequencing the mouse zzso as a means to help with the zzso of the human zzso sequence and vice zzso
