zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which causes disease by zzso plant cell wall degrading zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso production is regulated by zzso the zzso zzso sensing zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso which reports on zzso zzso Here we show that these two signals form an integrated coincidence circuit which ensures that metabolically costly zzso synthesis does not occur unless the population is simultaneously zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was defective in both zzso and zzso production, and nutritional supplementation of wild type cultures (which suppresses zzso zzso also suppressed zzso and zzso zzso There was a substantial overlap in the zzso of a zzso deficient zzso zzso and of a zzso defective zzso zzso zzso zzso especially with regards to zzso zzso Random zzso zzso revealed that disruption of zzso was sufficient to restore zzso production in the zzso zzso zzso We found that the ratio of zzso protein to its zzso zzso zzso was modulated independently by zzso and zzso While zzso predominantly controlled zzso by modulating zzso levels, zzso exerted regulation through the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
