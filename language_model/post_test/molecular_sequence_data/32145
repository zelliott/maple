The DNA sequence of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was determined and six zzso were zzso The largest zzso encodes a putative replication initiation protein zzso which shares zzso sequence similarity with the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso recently isolated from zzso suggesting that zzso might replicate via a zzso zzso Using zzso as the only zzso zzso a shuttle zzso zzso was constructed and successfully transformed into zzso zzso zzso Based on this in zzso system, the minimal zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso It is composed of the zzso gene plus zzso zzso upstream and zzso downstream zzso zzso the putative replication origin of zzso and that of zzso contain different types of sequence zzso and these two plasmids exhibit distinct host preference for zzso and zzso zzso
