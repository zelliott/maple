zzso molecules and in particular the nuclear zzso zzso play an important role in molecular zzso With the advent of increasingly zzso substitution models in systematic research, the incorporation of zzso information became a realistic option zzso zzso of character zzso As a zzso consensus structures of zzso zzso zzso molecules have become available through extensive comparative analyses and zzso zzso Despite extensive research in zzso zzso consensus zzso zzso secondary structures focusing on zzso have not yet been zzso In this study, we compiled a representative zzso zzso data set of 261 sequences and zzso a specific consensus zzso zzso zzso Our search for zzso structural motives relied on a combined approach of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso model deviates from the zzso zzso model in a number of zzso Additionally, in several zzso the zzso sequences did not support a single consensus zzso We provide consensus structures of these sections of single zzso zzso thus zzso the adaptation of the consensus zzso model to zzso zzso zzso The zzso catalog will foster the application of zzso structure models in zzso analyses using the zzso zzso zzso and it will improve the realism of substitution models and the reliability of reconstructions based on zzso zzso
