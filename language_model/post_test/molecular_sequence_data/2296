zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activities were previously reported to be regulated during development, but the underlying molecular events are zzso In addition, little is known about zzso zzso We cloned and zzso a complete mouse zzso zzso zzso of sequences from zzso human, zzso and guinea pig zzso indicated that the rates of evolution of zzso human, and bovine zzso are quite low, but guinea pig zzso has evolved several times faster than the zzso zzso mouse zzso and rat zzso zzso were used to study zzso zzso tissue distribution and zzso regulation in the zzso Northern gel analysis revealed the presence of a single zzso zzso zzso zzso species in liver, but not in other zzso including adrenal and zzso A single zzso zzso zzso zzso species was detected in zzso fat, heart, zzso muscle, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not in adult zzso liver, zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the following relative amounts of zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso heart, zzso zzso zzso muscle, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adult liver, zzso The same quantitative analysis was used to study zzso zzso levels during zzso There was little zzso variation in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels were detected at the earliest time points studied for both zzso and zzso zzso In heart, however, zzso zzso was detected at low levels 6 days before birth and increased zzso as the animals grew to zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
