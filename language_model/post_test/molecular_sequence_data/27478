Finding significant zzso sequence motifs in zzso zzso can be divided into three types of tasks: zzso supervised motif finding, where a sample of motif sequences is used to find other similar sequences in zzso zzso zzso motif finding, which typically relates to the task of finding regulatory motifs and protein binding sites and zzso exploratory motif finding, which aims to identify potential functionally significant sequence motifs as those that are unusual in some statistical zzso This article provides a conceptual overview for each type of task, a brief description of basic zzso used in their solution, and a review of selected relevant software available zzso
