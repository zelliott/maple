zzso vines rely on bees for zzso transfer between zzso separated male and female individuals and require synchronized flowering to ensure zzso zzso zzso compounds, which are important cues for insect zzso attraction, were studied by dynamic zzso sampling in the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its male zzso zzso zzso volatile levels showed a profile dominated by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These two compounds were zzso by all floral zzso and could be observed throughout the day, with lower levels at zzso The zzso zzso was also detected in flowers but was zzso predominantly during the day and only from zzso zzso Using a functional zzso approach, two zzso zzso zzso genes were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and transient in zzso data combined with analysis by zzso gas zzso revealed that one zzso produced primarily zzso and small amounts of zzso whereas the second zzso produced primarily zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso showed that both zzso were localized in the zzso the site for zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that both zzso genes were expressed in the same zzso and at the same times as the corresponding floral zzso The results indicate that two genes can account for the major floral zzso zzso observed in both male and female zzso zzso zzso
