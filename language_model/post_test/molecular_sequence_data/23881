zzso zzso zzso is a common disorder of iron zzso A rare zzso of the disease, juvenile zzso is an zzso form which is caused by zzso in a recently identified zzso called zzso or zzso A previous report based on Northern zzso showed human zzso zzso expression only in the skeletal muscle, liver and zzso 

In this study we analyzed the expression of zzso zzso in a number of human and mouse zzso by a sensitive reverse zzso chain reaction zzso We also studied the expression of zzso protein in mouse zzso using Western zzso A zzso rabbit zzso was raised against a synthetic zzso which was designed based on the predicted sequence of human and mouse zzso zzso 

Human zzso zzso expression was detected in the liver, heart, zzso zzso descending zzso zzso and skeletal zzso Mouse zzso that were positive for expression included brain, liver, heart, zzso stomach, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso skeletal muscle, zzso and zzso By Western zzso zzso protein expression was detected in the mouse liver, heart, zzso brain and zzso 

The facts that zzso protein is expressed in the liver and zzso in the zzso gene induce zzso iron zzso point to a possibility that zzso protein may zzso iron transport in zzso The wide expression of zzso as shown in the present study suggests that its role in regulating iron allocation could be extended to other zzso beyond the zzso
