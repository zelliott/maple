zzso is a small family of flowering plants (65 zzso with an extensive fossil record extending back to the Early zzso Within zzso zzso is remarkable because of its zzso zzso species in the zzso and 44 confined to the zzso a long zzso zzso between its stem age (Early zzso and the beginning of the extant radiation zzso zzso Is this gap real, reflecting low diversification and a recent radiation, or the signature of zzso Here we use zzso data, zzso molecular dating, diversification zzso and zzso ancestral area reconstruction to investigate the timing, zzso and mode of diversification in zzso Our results, based on analyses of zzso and nuclear sequences for 40 species, suggest that the zzso of zzso and the zzso stem lineages were widespread in the zzso in the Late zzso High extinction rates, possibly associated with zzso zzso zzso may have been responsible for the low extant diversity of the zzso Crown group zzso originated zzso zzso Ma and zzso South America from the north during the zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso This coincided with an increase in diversification rates, probably triggered by the zzso of the Northern zzso from the zzso zzso This study illustrates the advantages of combining zzso zzso and zzso data to reconstruct the zzso evolution of an ancient zzso for which the extant diversity is only a remnant of past zzso It also shows the difficulties of zzso patterns of lineage diversification when incomplete zzso sampling is combined with high extinction zzso
