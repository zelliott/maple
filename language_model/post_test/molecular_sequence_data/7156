zzso of the zzso zzso gene in a rat zzso zzso cell line, zzso transformed by the zzso zzso and zzso genes seems to be caused by the induction of a negative regulator, zzso which binds to three zzso sequences in the promoter zzso Nakamura, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These are the zzso stretch and two zzso boxes consisting of the zzso stretch with one internal C zzso zzso The recognition sequences of zzso and zzso zzso overlap in these zzso zzso To analyze the mechanism of the zzso zzso was zzso by DNA affinity zzso and its molecular mass was estimated to be about 30 zzso The promoter was modified by substituting the sequence zzso with zzso or zzso in these zzso zzso leaving the zzso motif intact, and by replacing the zzso motif by the T zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso fusion genes carrying the base substitution in one or more of these zzso sequences both in zzso and in zzso revealed that the base substitution in any zzso sequence results in reduction of promoter activity, although the downstream zzso box zzso plays a primary zzso The addition of zzso severely inhibited the activities of the zzso promoters carrying the zzso zzso in zzso while the promoters carrying the zzso zzso were zzso The binding affinity of zzso and zzso to each of the zzso zzso analyzed by gel shift zzso indicated that zzso binds strongly to the zzso moderately to the zzso stretch, and zzso to zzso while zzso binds strongly to zzso moderately to zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso and the zzso stretch was inhibited by zzso while binding to zzso was zzso These results indicate that zzso gene zzso is inhibited in zzso cells primarily by exclusion of zzso binding to zzso by zzso and that zzso is a new class of zzso negative zzso
