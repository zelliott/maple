To investigate the role of zzso in protein zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso revealed an open reading frame of 536 zzso acids coding for a zzso zzso zzso with 55 to 57% sequence identity to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Like these zzso zzso zzso zzso has an zzso domain with a highly zzso zzso site and a zzso zzso zzso Differing results regarding the zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso is important but not essential for growth, but it was zzso that at least one zzso zzso gene is zzso zzso with zzso deleted grow about six times more slowly than wild type; faster-growing zzso still growing much slower than wild type, appeared quite zzso In zzso delta cells, no zzso alkaline zzso zzso precursor was zzso zzso to develop another reporter zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso were zzso For zzso an zzso precursor was detected in zzso delta but not in zzso cells, suggesting that its zzso was defective in the zzso delta zzso These results confirm an in zzso rule for zzso in protein zzso in zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso or an zzso zzso has functions not shared by zzso and show that, as in zzso zzso and zzso zzso reporter molecules differ in their dependency on zzso for zzso
