zzso zzso binding protein 2 zzso is a basic protein that contains a DNA zzso binding zzso The mechanism by which the highly positive charge of zzso and its ability to bind zzso DNA contribute to the specificity of its binding to zzso has long remained zzso In this paper, we show that zzso binds to zzso in a very similar way to zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso However, its binding specificity strongly depends on DNA zzso We also observed that as with zzso zzso this binding is independent of the core zzso zzso zzso tail and is not affected by zzso zzso
