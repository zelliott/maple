Six zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have previously been described from zzso based on zzso zzso In order to validate and expand the species descriptions, the complete small zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso and used to genetically zzso the six zzso The aim was to reveal possible genetic variation in the zzso zzso gene within each zzso species, between the species from zzso but also between the zzso species and related zzso species zzso in other zzso Muscle tissue from the heart and zzso was sampled from 18 adult zzso zzso at a field zzso in northern zzso zzso were excised from the tissue and classified into one of the six known zzso species based on their zzso Two zzso of each of the six species from two different animals were randomly selected for further DNA zzso The complete zzso zzso gene was amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso and subsequently zzso The complete zzso zzso gene sequences were used to compare the six species with each other and with other previously zzso zzso species retrieved from zzso There was little sequence variation between two zzso of the same species, but the six species differed from each other by zzso deletions and single zzso zzso zzso mainly located in variable regions of the zzso The identity between the six species from zzso was approximately the same as when other zzso species using a different intermediate host were compared with each zzso This study supported previous findings of zzso being the intermediate host for at least six zzso species and the results also indicated the existence of certain zzso positions within the zzso zzso gene that are unique to zzso species with a canine definitive zzso
