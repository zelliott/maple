We have identified a mouse gene zzso a zzso protein zzso that shares zzso with members of the zzso protein zzso class of zzso zzso zzso acid sequence shows that this protein shares significant zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contains four predicted zzso zzso zzso signature zzso and, although similar in size, is distinct from zzso (also identified as zzso zzso or zzso which contains three zzso zzso zzso With zzso as the zzso zzso zzso is shown to accelerate the zzso of the zzso zzso bond with a zzso efficiency similar to other family zzso This zzso activity is inhibited by zzso and zzso but is not sensitive to zzso zzso Based on Northern zzso analysis, zzso zzso transcripts are present in zzso zzso heart, brain, and zzso A zzso zzso raised against a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso from zzso cells and demonstrate that zzso is a zzso In addition, zzso labeling experiments show that zzso is also a zzso These results suggest that zzso is a new zzso family zzso
