zzso proteins are the zzso components of the zzso box protein zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report a structural relationship between zzso a component of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is known to catalyze the zzso of zzso protein zzso and the inhibitor of zzso zzso protein but also functions as an zzso of zzso zzso zzso We identify zzso as an zzso binding partner and show that this interaction requires an zzso domain present in both proteins that we term the zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain reveals a novel zzso zzso and zzso analyses are used to map regions of the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso and required for zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso interaction with zzso and also block zzso zzso zzso of zzso does not affect zzso levels arguing against zzso being a zzso for zzso We present a model for zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso
