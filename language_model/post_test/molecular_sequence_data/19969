Using an approach based on zzso chain reaction zzso we examined the diversity of zzso zzso zzso genes present in 160 marine zzso zzso representing 142 zzso We obtained zzso zzso domain zzso products from 99 zzso zzso representing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso similarity searches and zzso analysis of 29 marine zzso sequences revealed zzso predicted to zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso analysis of an alignment of the zzso sequences from zzso zzso revealed no unique motifs in this zzso However, several zzso positions were apparent between zzso zzso acid zzso as compared with either reducing or zzso zzso zzso of these positions in the context of a zzso three-dimensional protein structure highlighted their potential use as zzso zzso zzso Evaluating zzso sites was necessary to obtain zzso domain fragments from putative zzso while maintaining a level of sequence information adequate to properly zzso and characterize zzso
