zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso alignment revealed a region with a zzso zzso motif near its zzso which zzso to a zzso structural motif of known zzso zzso To verify whether some of these zzso zzso are important for the zzso zzso these three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were individually replaced by zzso using zzso zzso The secondary structures of these zzso as measured by circular zzso zzso did not show remarkable differences as compared with the wild zzso The zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso for both Basic zzso and zzso were increased about three and twofold over that of the wild type, respectively, whereas the zzso value of zzso zzso were decreased about zzso These results suggest that these three zzso zzso are involved in the interaction with both zzso and zzso for the zzso activity of zzso
