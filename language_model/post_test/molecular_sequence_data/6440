zzso rat zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso to an apparent zzso This expression system was constructed using zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso coding 99 zzso acids in the zzso were deleted and zzso coding zzso in the zzso were zzso zzso was carried out using zzso affinity zzso and zzso Blue zzso column zzso zzso was achieved zzso over the crude zzso coli extract with a yield of about zzso The zzso zzso demonstrated a single band on zzso gel zzso The zzso showed no distinct zzso spectrum in the visible zzso The properties of zzso were compared with those of rat liver zzso zzso The requirement of the zzso the zzso fraction or zzso zzso and zzso c zzso the pH dependency for zzso activity, and the sensitivity to zzso seen with both zzso suggest that zzso has properties very similar to rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were formed by zzso in a completely zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso and of zzso to zzso
