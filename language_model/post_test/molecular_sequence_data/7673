zzso B cell zzso disorders are frequently sensitive to zzso zzso To assess the zzso zzso gene expression in B zzso zzso possibly responsible for this sensitivity, we developed a sensitive zzso zzso for the three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso B and T zzso from 11 blood donors were separated by magnetic beads and tested with this zzso The zzso zzso was the most abundant zzso and was detected in all B and T cell zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso in zzso normal donors, either in B or T zzso zzso alpha was very stable from donor to zzso and was highly correlated between B and T cells of the same individual zzso zzso zzso There is no correlation between the three zzso and between each zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso B zzso disorders (20 zzso 3 zzso chronic zzso zzso were tested with the same zzso An average decrease of 57% of the zzso zzso expression was noted in the zzso cells of these patients zzso zzso zzso with no differences between the zzso and treated zzso The zzso alpha and zzso zzso levels did not differ from normal B zzso but the proportion of patients with no zzso expression of zzso zzso is lower than in the control zzso Interestingly, the low content of zzso zzso in zzso could explain the frequent sensitivity of this disease to zzso zzso
