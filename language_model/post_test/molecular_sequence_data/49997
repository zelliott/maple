The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been analyzed by the Z curve zzso The Z curve is a three-dimensional curve that uniquely represents a given DNA zzso Based on the known behaviors of the Z zzso for the zzso whose replication origins have been identified, the analysis of the Z curve for the zzso of zzso zzso strongly suggests that the large zzso has two replication origins, zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are located at two sharp zzso of the Z zzso These two regions are next to the zzso genes and contain multiple copies of stretches of G and C, zzso zzso and zzso which may also be regarded as direct and zzso zzso Based on the above analysis, a model of replication of zzso zzso with two replication origins and two zzso has been zzso The experimental confirmation of this model would constitute the first example of multiple replication origins of zzso which will finally provide much insight into the understanding of replication mechanisms of zzso organisms, including zzso In addition, the potential multiple replication origins of the zzso zzso zzso are suggested by the analysis based on the Z curve zzso
