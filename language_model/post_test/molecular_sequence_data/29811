Novel zzso in the zzso and zzso genes were identified in a large-scale screen for zzso that affect cell expansion in early zzso zzso zzso from both types of zzso were zzso swollen with greatly reduced levels of zzso zzso the principal structural component of the cell zzso Because zzso was previously shown to zzso a zzso zzso of cellulose zzso the similar zzso of zzso and zzso zzso suggests that the zzso swollen zzso of zzso zzso is largely due to their cellulose zzso zzso cloning of the zzso gene and zzso zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso encodes zzso I, the zzso that zzso the first step in zzso zzso zzso The strongly reduced cellulose content of zzso zzso indicates that zzso zzso are required for cellulose zzso Because cellulose zzso zzso zzso do not appear to be N zzso the zzso requirement apparently resides in other zzso of the cellulose zzso zzso zzso cellular processes other than zzso zzso zzso and the formation of protein storage zzso appear unaffected in zzso zzso Thus in zzso cells, like zzso zzso trimming is apparently required for the function of only a small subset of zzso
