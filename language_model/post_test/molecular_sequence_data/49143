The neurodegenerative disease zzso Type C2 zzso results from zzso in the zzso zzso gene that cause zzso high cholesterol zzso in zzso We find that zzso zzso a zzso soluble zzso binds cholesterol specifically with a much higher affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso than previously zzso zzso and zzso studies identified single zzso acid changes that prevent both cholesterol binding and the restoration of normal cholesterol levels in zzso zzso The zzso acids that affect cholesterol binding surround a zzso pocket in the zzso protein structure, identifying a candidate zzso zzso On the basis of evolutionary analysis and zzso three other regions of the zzso protein emerged as important, including one required for efficient zzso
