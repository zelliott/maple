zzso proteins B and C zzso and zzso together with zzso are important constituents of pulmonary zzso and of preparations used for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso which include other zzso zzso like the zzso zzso zzso in contrast to other zzso is zzso and a zzso zzso and its mechanism of action is not zzso A model of the three-dimensional structure of one zzso zzso was generated from the structure of zzso zzso determined by nuclear magnetic zzso and the zzso zzso was formed by joining two zzso via the zzso zzso bond zzso After energy zzso zzso hydrogen zzso pairs were formed between the strictly zzso zzso zzso and zzso which creates a central zzso region located in between two clusters of positively charged zzso The structural features support a function of zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso an zzso analogue and zzso B (which zzso zzso zzso but is structurally unrelated to zzso exhibit in zzso surface activity which is indistinguishable from that of analogous zzso containing zzso instead of zzso zzso This suggests an avenue for identification of zzso zzso that can be used in synthetic zzso for treatment of zzso
