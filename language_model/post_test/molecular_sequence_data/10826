The current AIDS pandemic represents the uneven spread of multiple genetically related zzso (A to zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso E in southeast Asia and zzso C in sub-Saharan Africa are expanding faster and are likely of greater global significance than the zzso B zzso prevalent in the United States and zzso While many studies have focused on genetic variation among structural zzso we chose to conduct a comparative analysis of the long terminal repeats of zzso E and zzso C zzso and report zzso differences in zzso copy numbers and zzso as well as divergent zzso in response to the cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso and viral zzso This study is the first to identify functional distinctions in promoter architecture between zzso zzso and raises the possibility that regulatory divergence among the zzso of zzso has zzso Divergent zzso regulation may explain some of the zzso observed differences in transmission and zzso and underscores the need for further comparative analysis of zzso zzso
