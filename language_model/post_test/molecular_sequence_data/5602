zzso of zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that is required for proper bud site selection at 26 degrees C and for bud emergence at elevated zzso We show here that the zzso growth zzso of zzso zzso cells can be suppressed by increased dosage of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso together with its structural zzso zzso are required for cell size and shape control, bud site selection, bud zzso zzso zzso organization, zzso zzso zzso and mating projection formation in response to mating zzso Each protein contains a zzso zzso zzso motif and each interacts in the zzso zzso with the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso a key regulator of polarized growth in zzso The zzso motif of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso are required for this zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso and zzso play positive roles in the zzso signal zzso pathway, probably as zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies with a functional green fluorescent zzso fusion protein indicate that this protein is concentrated at the zzso bud site of zzso cells, at the bud tip and zzso neck of zzso cells, and at cortical sites on zzso cells that may zzso future bud sites in the two progeny zzso The ability of zzso to associate with zzso is important for its function but is apparently not essential for its zzso zzso
