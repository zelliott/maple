We detected an interaction of the zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso region of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso This interaction was repeat length dependent and specific to zzso the zzso did not interact with the repeat carrying a section of zzso 1 nor with the zzso zzso or zzso zzso The interaction was confirmed using zzso zzso coli zzso zzso human and rat zzso protein which pulled full-length zzso out of zzso rat brain and in pull-down zzso The zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso receptors such as the zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso and other nuclear receptors including zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of this repression appears to be through the formation of a complex of zzso proteins including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have used zzso and zzso zzso in zzso studies and find that in zzso disease zzso zzso and zzso the cellular zzso of these proteins is exclusively zzso whilst in control brain they are localized in the nucleus as well as the zzso zzso zzso also occurred in a subset of zzso positive zzso zzso The zzso of zzso proteins in HD brain may alter zzso and be involved in the pathology of the zzso
