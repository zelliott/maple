A zzso gene zzso was identified in the zzso zzso zzso and cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was most specific for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a low turnover rate zzso zzso zzso The zzso has been classified as a member of family 1 of zzso zzso zzso alignments and zzso modeling showed an apparent conservation of its active site region with, zzso two unique active site zzso zzso and zzso These zzso are an zzso and zzso zzso in all other known family 1 zzso which interact with the zzso zzso and equatorial zzso group of zzso zzso The unique zzso of zzso zzso zzso were introduced in the highly active zzso zzso of zzso zzso and vice versa, yielding two single and one double zzso for each zzso In zzso both zzso zzso and zzso increased the specificity for zzso and reduced zzso rates zzso In contrast, zzso zzso showed zzso increased zzso rates and zzso increased affinity for the zzso of zzso In combination with inhibitor studies, it was concluded that the zzso zzso participate in the zzso binding of zzso with an equatorial zzso group, but contribute most to zzso zzso The unique activity profile of zzso seems to be caused by an altered interaction between the zzso and zzso of the zzso and a specifically increased affinity for zzso that results from zzso
