We propose that the different zzso zzso levels of zzso are controlled through differential premature termination of transcription, and are modulated by the relative strength of zzso zzso zzso We present the complete set of sequences covering the leader zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso A zzso analysis of the two now complete sets of these sequences of strain zzso and zzso shows that, in contrast to the previous theory, differences amongst zzso of zzso zzso between the leader and the zzso regions are not sufficient to determine the zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso infected zzso Neither can the accessibility of the interacting regions on the leader and the negative stranded zzso as revealed by secondary structure analysis, explain the zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso itself, on the other hand, could be responsible for observed zzso levels gradually increasing with gene zzso Relatively slow new initiation events at zzso regions are proposed to block zzso of passing transcripts which, via temporary zzso can cause premature termination of zzso This effects longer transcripts more than shorter zzso
