zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso from zzso zzso This zzso can reside either in the zzso or the zzso its zzso distribution is influenced by zzso factors, and its nuclear import zzso with changes in zzso synthetic zzso To identify sequences responsible for the nuclear import of zzso we zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso with expression zzso zzso various zzso zzso fused to green fluorescent zzso zzso of wild type zzso with or without fusion to green fluorescent protein resulted in a predominantly zzso pattern of fluorescence, similar to the distribution of native zzso in primary zzso zzso Within the zzso protein is a sequence zzso that closely resembles a zzso nuclear zzso zzso Studies using deletion zzso indicated that this region was necessary for nuclear import of zzso Analysis of zzso containing specific zzso acid zzso within this sequence confirmed that it was this sequence that was necessary for nuclear import of zzso and that a specific zzso zzso was critical for this zzso As nuclear import of zzso may regulate zzso production, natural or induced zzso in this zzso nuclear zzso sequence may also be important in affecting zzso zzso
