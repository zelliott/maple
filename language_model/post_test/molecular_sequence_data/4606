We previously reported that copper zzso from zzso rat zzso cells was blocked by a brief exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso suggesting the possible involvement of a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In this report, we show that copper zzso from zzso cells, a zzso cell line established from rat adrenal zzso is also inhibited by zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that both zzso and zzso cells express a zzso of the zzso gene zzso as detected by zzso with zzso designed from a mouse zzso and confirmed by sequence analysis of the amplified zzso An expected zzso zzso representing the zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso the heavy zzso domain of zzso were amplified from a zzso extract of zzso and zzso zzso zzso data revealed that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso cells were an identical match to a similar zzso from zzso zzso Both fragments zzso a 229 zzso zzso that had a zzso sequence zzso to mouse zzso In addition, 880 zzso from the zzso zzso of the two cell lines were identical and zzso a zzso zzso zzso with zzso sequence zzso to mouse zzso These data establish that a zzso zzso zzso is expressed in rat zzso and zzso cells and strongly support the hypothesis that both zzso and zzso are involved in maintaining zzso zzso in the central nervous zzso
