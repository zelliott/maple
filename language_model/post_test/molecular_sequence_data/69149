We used the zzso chain reaction zzso to study which zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso life cycle may be blocked following treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso a zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso and able to inhibit the productive infection of zzso cells by zzso The presence of viral zzso was investigated and found in zzso zzso zzso cells 30 zzso after viral exposure; the full-length viral DNA was found at 24 h zzso We also found integrated forms of viral DNA at 24 h zzso However, the integrated zzso was zzso inactive in zzso zzso cells, as demonstrated by the absence of spliced zzso zzso The lack of zzso zzso under zzso zzso treatment was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso of viral gene zzso accounts for the lack of progeny zzso in culture zzso of cells treated with this zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso blocks viral production from chronically infected cells and restores zzso zzso expression on zzso cells containing an integrated zzso We found this effect to be zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that zzso zzso treatment is efficient on different zzso and zzso virus zzso These results may have major implications for the treatment of zzso
