zzso and zzso stress leaves zzso in the plant zzso in the form of zzso modified zzso Using a mass zzso approach, we identified 126 zzso and 12 zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly from zzso I zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso complexes and 140 zzso products of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso While a high number of zzso sites were found in proteins from four zzso complexes indicating that the zzso belongs to one of the prominent zzso protein modifications in zzso apparatus, zzso acid zzso products were determined mostly in zzso and to a lower extent in zzso Exposure of plants to light stress resulted in an increased level of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in proteins of zzso reaction center and the zzso complex, as compared to low light zzso In contrast, the level of zzso and zzso of these zzso acid zzso strongly decreased for all zzso proteins of zzso under the same zzso Based on these data, we propose that zzso modifications of proteins by zzso oxygen and nitrogen species might represent an important regulatory mechanism of protein turnover under light stress conditions, especially for zzso and its antenna zzso
