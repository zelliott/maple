The structure of bovine growth hormone releasing factor zzso consisting of 44 zzso acids has been studied in CD and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso in conjunction with molecular zzso Since zzso does not have an ordered structure in water alone, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to induce considerable zzso structures, which zzso to a zzso content of approximately zzso as determined by circular zzso zzso The secondary structure was obtained from nuclear zzso enhancement and zzso zzso zzso constant in zzso zzso zzso zzso structures consistent with zzso data were generated by using distance geometry zzso A set of 267 zzso distances derived from nuclear zzso effect correlation zzso zzso experiments and zzso zzso were zzso From the initial random zzso 50 distance geometry structures with minimal violations were selected for further zzso The 14 best structures were obtained after simulated zzso calculation with energy zzso The structure of zzso in zzso zzso solution was characterized by one zzso zzso zzso two poorly constrained zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees, zzso zzso zzso degrees, zzso zzso zzso degrees, zzso zzso zzso zzso connected by the segments of less defined structures in zzso and zzso flexible zzso determined from zzso cross zzso between zzso segment zzso zzso and tail zzso zzso zzso The obtained structure will play an important role toward the understanding of the structural and functional role of the zzso
