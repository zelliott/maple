We report on a mouse specific zzso zzso separation system for separating zzso proteins from high and moderate abundance proteins in mouse zzso When applied in tandem with a mouse zzso column that removes the seven most abundant proteins in zzso the zzso column captures more than 100 additional moderate abundance zzso thus allowing significant enrichment of zzso proteins in the zzso zzso A side-by-side comparison of results obtained from zzso analyses of zzso samples from zzso and zzso columns revealed a nearly zzso improvement in the overall zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins was also zzso as evidenced by a more than zzso increase in the coverage of zzso growth factors, and other zzso zzso Moreover, the tandem zzso are zzso zzso and allow effective identification of protein abundance differences from zzso zzso Considering the overall zzso and increased sensitivity using the zzso separation system, we anticipate broad applications of this strategy for zzso discovery using mouse zzso
