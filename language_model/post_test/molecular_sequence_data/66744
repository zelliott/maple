Brain development and aging is a complex process involving zzso differentiation and zzso zzso zzso changes in these processes can help to understand the mechanisms of brain development and maintenance as well as neurodegenerative zzso The research reported here is a contribution to the zzso Brain zzso Project mouse pilot zzso zzso frozen zzso mouse brain zzso three different zzso stages zzso day 16, zzso day 7, and zzso days zzso were processed by using zzso zzso A total of 1999 spots were matched between all zzso Of these, 206 spots were zzso expressed between the different zzso 122 spots were highest in intensity in embryonic stage zzso 26 highest in the juvenile group zzso and 58 spots highest in zzso the adult zzso The results show a pattern of zzso zzso Based on the expression patterns we tentatively suggest that proteins involved in the establishment of primary structures in the brain are expressed highest in the embryonic zzso zzso involved in the development of the brain are expressed highest in the juvenile phase and proteins that make zzso of the brain possible by delivering energy are expressed highest in the adult zzso
