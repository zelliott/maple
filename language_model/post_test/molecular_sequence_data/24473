The cellular zzso for zzso A avian zzso and zzso virus zzso is zzso which contains a motif related to repeats in the low density zzso zzso zzso zzso binding repeat zzso and which is necessary for viral zzso As observed with zzso repeats of zzso the 47 zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso requires calcium during zzso folding to form the correct zzso bonds, and calcium enhances the structure of correctly oxidized zzso as well as its ability to bind the viral envelope protein zzso However, solution nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicate that, even in the presence of excess zzso zzso exists in an ensemble of zzso Nonetheless, as reported here, the structure of the zzso zzso solution zzso closely resembles that of other zzso repeats, with identical zzso binding zzso and zzso calcium zzso The location of zzso and other critical zzso on the surface suggests a region of the zzso necessary for zzso binding and to mediate zzso events important for zzso cell zzso
