The complete structural characterization of the zzso a zzso constituted of 338 zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved both at the protein and zzso level by exploiting mass zzso zzso The zzso of the primary structure, the definition of the zzso pattern, the assignment of zzso sites and the investigation of zzso pattern were zzso This analysis revealed the occurrence of zzso only at zzso modified by zzso zzso zzso the protein resulted to be zzso with zzso zzso The data obtained on both the zzso and zzso zzso in the cold zzso constitute the first description of the zzso pattern in zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso system in zzso organisms might have similarities as well as differences with respect to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso pairings were eventually identified as zzso and zzso with zzso showing a free zzso zzso These data suggest that a common folding motif might occur within the entire zzso family in which the second zzso is linked to the third one with the fourth and fifth joined zzso
