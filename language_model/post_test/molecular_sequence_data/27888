The activity of an zzso and the zzso of a zzso can be affected by an unusual protein zzso Specifically, zzso modification of zzso zzso and Ras protein requires an intermediate of the cholesterol zzso zzso This modification is apparently essential for biological zzso Studies of zzso zzso blocked in zzso zzso demonstrated that the membrane association and biological zzso of the zzso zzso protein require zzso a precursor of zzso and other zzso such as zzso zzso Furthermore, drugs that inhibit zzso zzso blocked the in zzso action of zzso derivatives of human Ras protein in the zzso zzso zzso The same drugs and zzso also prevented the zzso processing and zzso of zzso zzso a zzso that is zzso Thus, the zzso requirement for Ras zzso may indicate that attachment of a zzso zzso zzso to Ras proteins is necessary for membrane association and biological zzso These observations establish a connection between the cholesterol zzso zzso and transformation by the zzso zzso and offer a novel pharmacological approach to zzso and possibly controlling, zzso zzso zzso
