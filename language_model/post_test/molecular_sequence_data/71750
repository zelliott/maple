We recently reported an association between loss in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso of T zzso In this study, the possibility that zzso serves as a direct zzso for activated zzso was zzso Here, we report that two zzso zzso which are putative recognition sequences for zzso zzso and are present in the zzso acid sequence of the zzso are zzso in zzso zzso T zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso zzso was inhibited in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso including the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also inhibited in zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso of zzso activity, zzso or zzso zzso zzso In zzso translated zzso was zzso in a similar fashion by zzso zzso or zzso in a zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso no zzso of in zzso translated zzso was zzso These results suggest that the loss of zzso zzso previously associated with zzso immune dysfunction and more recently associated with zzso zzso of T zzso is zzso by a direct degradation of the zzso by activated zzso This is the first report of involvement of zzso in degradation of the zzso zzso
