Excess iron results in an increase in the translation of zzso zzso and a decrease in the stability of zzso zzso zzso zzso These coordinate regulatory events are zzso by similar zzso motifs that exist within the zzso untranslated region zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso We have referred to these motifs as zzso elements zzso The zzso from both transcripts interact with a zzso protein that we have called the zzso protein zzso The activity but not the amount of the zzso is dependent on the cellular iron zzso The zzso basis for the altered activity of the zzso appears to be the zzso zzso of one or more zzso in the zzso The zzso is a zzso to zzso zzso protein that has been zzso to zzso by zzso affinity zzso and the zzso corresponding to the zzso has been zzso zzso zzso our data support a model in which the interaction between the zzso and the zzso zzso results in zzso of translation, and similar interaction with zzso zzso can protect the transcript from rapid degradation zzso by a rapid turnover zzso within the zzso
