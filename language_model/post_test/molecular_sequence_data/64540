Across evolution, the signal recognition particle zzso targets zzso proteins to zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso has been extensively studied in zzso and zzso little is known of this system in zzso In the following, membrane association of zzso the zzso signal recognition particle zzso and zzso a central component of the signal recognition zzso was addressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso or zzso were combined separately or in different combinations with zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso and examined by zzso zzso to differentiate between soluble and zzso zzso Such studies revealed that both zzso and the zzso zzso domain bound to zzso zzso zzso in a manner unaffected by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that in zzso zzso association is zzso through the membrane zzso Indeed, membrane association of zzso was also detected in intact zzso zzso zzso The contribution of the zzso domain to zzso binding in zzso zzso may be zzso given the low number of basic charges found at the start of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso proteins (the region of the protein thought to mediate zzso association in zzso Moreover, zzso but not the zzso domain, was shown to mediate membrane association of zzso zzso zzso a protein that did not otherwise interact with the zzso
