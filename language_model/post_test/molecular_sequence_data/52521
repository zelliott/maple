zzso factors belonging to the zzso binding protein zzso family have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression during growth, zzso zzso and zzso zzso is relatively common in the zzso of zzso gene expression and, for the human and zzso zzso it is known that zzso zzso mechanisms zzso It is therefore essential to investigate the zzso of additional zzso genes from a wider range of different species to gauge the degree of zzso or otherwise, which zzso As an important step towards this goal, we report here the cloning and the zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso and analysis of its promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso acts as a zzso zzso Although several motifs that are characteristic of zzso genes are zzso in the zzso zzso including the basic region, zzso zzso and zzso zzso two regions have been identified that are specifically absent in the zzso and bovine zzso The zzso promoter is active in both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso cell lines, induced by the zzso zzso and zzso by mechanisms that are potentially different from those described for the rat zzso These results suggest that, in common with zzso the zzso genes may also be subject to zzso by distinct zzso zzso
