zzso zzso infections of zzso zzso cells select cellular zzso that inhibit viral zzso within the zzso zzso zzso cells support zzso growth when infection is initiated with infectious zzso particles zzso which are zzso in zzso zzso formed following zzso of viral zzso zzso However, zzso cells do not support growth of zzso indicating that these cells have a zzso in zzso zzso To better understand mechanisms by which viruses use the zzso zzso to enter cells, we defined steps in zzso replication blocked in zzso cells selected during persistent zzso zzso zzso of zzso after zzso to parental and zzso cells was assessed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso to a fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso cells did not differ in the capacity to zzso zzso or distribute them to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso the zzso pH was determined and found to be equivalent in parental and zzso zzso In both cell types, zzso localized to zzso zzso zzso The capacity of parental and zzso cells to support zzso of zzso zzso was assessed by monitoring the appearance of zzso zzso following zzso of zzso viral zzso Within 2 h after zzso to parental cells, zzso of viral zzso proteins was observed, consistent with formation of zzso However, in zzso cells, no zzso of viral proteins was detected up to 8 h zzso Since treatment of cells with zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso we used zzso analysis to assess the expression of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso In contrast to parental cells, zzso cells did not express the mature, zzso active form of the zzso The zzso in zzso L maturation was not associated with zzso in zzso L zzso was not zzso by zzso L zzso and did not affect the maturation of zzso B, another zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that persistent zzso infections select cellular zzso that affect the maturation of zzso L and suggest that zzso in the expression of zzso zzso can zzso viral zzso
