zzso zzso causes severe respiratory tract infections in patients with zzso zzso zzso We have been examining zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso To study the zzso zzso interaction at the molecular level, we have constructed a zzso zzso bank in a clinical isolate of zzso zzso zzso zzso and identified zzso resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso were enriched by zzso the zzso bank over 18 zzso zzso Of 900 individual zzso isolated from this enriched pool in a zzso zzso zzso we identified 85 putative zzso that were resistant to zzso In this study, we have characterized one of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was poorly zzso zzso possessed a zzso zzso in a gene zzso a protein with zzso to the zzso proteins of several species of zzso We have called this gene zzso for required for zzso by zzso zzso is one of two zzso zzso in zzso zzso This zzso zzso was zzso both on zzso plates and in visual examination of wet zzso The zzso zzso was partially zzso by providing the zzso gene in trans and fully zzso when both zzso and zzso were zzso A zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso and zzso gene products are required for the efficient zzso of zzso zzso by zzso
