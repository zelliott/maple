zzso in zzso a tumor zzso zzso are one of the most common genetic zzso of human zzso The relationship between zzso gene zzso and ultraviolet zzso light has been demonstrated in skin zzso of zzso zzso In this study, zzso DNA from 12 skin zzso was screened for zzso in zzso 5 to 9 of this gene using the zzso chain zzso strange zzso zzso zzso analysis followed by DNA zzso DNA samples were obtained from 8 zzso cell zzso zzso 1 from an zzso zzso 1 from a patient with zzso cell zzso syndrome, 1 from a patient with zzso zzso and 1 from a zzso and 4 from primary sporadic zzso on zzso damaged skin, and from 4 zzso cell zzso zzso 1 from a burn scar, 1 from a patient with zzso zzso and 2 from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was detected in only 1 case of SCC which had arisen from zzso zzso The zzso occurred at zzso 159 in zzso 5 with a zzso to CCC zzso substitution resulting in an zzso acid change of zzso to zzso This zzso does not zzso to results of zzso zzso studies reported in the zzso Our findings imply that, although zzso gene zzso and zzso exposure play an important role in the zzso of some skin zzso they are not zzso especially in skin zzso that develop from underlying skin zzso
