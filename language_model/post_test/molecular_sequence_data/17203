Most zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes to create a vast repertoire of zzso sensor molecules on their B and T zzso zzso While the organization of these genes exhibits substantial variation between species, one common theme is that, in almost every case, there is at least one variable region with a highly diverse zzso region and often much less diversity elsewhere in the binding zzso Whereas with zzso zzso this skewing of diversity zzso well with the need to recognize diverse peptides bound to zzso zzso this cannot explain why this same pattern is evident in zzso zzso or zzso zzso Instead we have zzso that in the primary repertoire, all or most zzso receptors have a zzso binding site, in which diverse zzso zzso act as a highly zzso specific zzso whereas other zzso bind in a largely opportunistic zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso then acts to improve the zzso to a given zzso and increase zzso zzso A test of this model in mice engineered to have a very limited V region repertoire shows that primary zzso can be generated that are highly specific for distinct zzso yet identical in sequence except for their zzso zzso Furthermore, very high affinity zzso can be raised by repeated zzso showing that zzso zzso can mold these low affinity zzso into high affinity zzso Thus, the wide variations seen in V region zzso amongst zzso is likely to be of lesser importance than the preservation of one or more diverse zzso zzso
