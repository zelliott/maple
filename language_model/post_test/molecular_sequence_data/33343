The zzso fatty acids zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso are major factors affecting the quality of plant oils for human health, as well as for zzso and other renewable zzso These zzso are essential fatty acids for animals and plants, but also are the source of zzso trans fats during the processing of many zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in developing seeds by the zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso on the membrane zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The reactions and zzso involved in this metabolism are incompletely zzso zzso Here we show that a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso is a major reaction for the transfer of zzso into PC for zzso and also for the reverse transfer of zzso and zzso into the zzso synthesis zzso The zzso zzso zzso transfer of the zzso zzso from PC to zzso and zzso of zzso reduces zzso and zzso zzso in seed zzso by zzso Our discovery of zzso is important for understanding zzso metabolism in plants and other organisms, and provides tools to modify the fatty acid compositions of plant oils for improved nutrition, zzso and other zzso
