To test the hypothesis that growth and zzso of the adult zzso involves a zzso zzso of retinal development, the patterns of zzso differentiation were investigated in the developing zzso as well as growing and zzso adult zzso of a zzso zzso the winter zzso Only one zzso of type zzso (a zzso cone zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso and a corresponding zzso visual zzso was zzso In zzso zzso there was no evidence for any other cone zzso or zzso zzso rod zzso zzso or rod visual zzso In contrast, a rod zzso zzso and three cone zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso (adult) zzso and these zzso were consistent with the observed repertoire of visual zzso During zzso retinal growth and zzso cones were always produced before zzso but the different cone types were apparently produced zzso suggesting that cone differentiation mechanisms might change after zzso The results support the hypothesis that zzso differentiation during growth and zzso of the adult zzso involves a zzso of mechanisms that control the sequence of zzso production during retinal zzso
