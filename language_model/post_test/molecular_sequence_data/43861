We isolated the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and analyzed the coding region and its zzso zzso analyses of the zzso coding region and the zzso protein sequence in data sets containing 47 other zzso sequences show zzso to be a member of the zzso zzso radiation in agreement with zzso DNA sequence zzso Four of the five zzso zzso zzso are relatively short zzso zzso and occupy novel positions in a zzso of zzso zzso containing 56 distinct zzso The fifth zzso has a length of zzso zzso and occurs also in zzso genes from green algae and the zzso zzso
