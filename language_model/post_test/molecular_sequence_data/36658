Recent studies have revealed the presence of a new group of zzso zzso the zzso in the human zzso as well as in human zzso zzso The zzso are structurally related to sequence segments residing in the zzso zzso gamma or zzso of zzso In this study we have applied zzso zzso mass zzso zzso to zzso the sequence of a zzso zzso isolated from the zzso fluid of patients with cerebrovascular zzso The zzso was used in conjunction with zzso Y zzso and results indicated that this procedure proved to be a powerful tool for rapid sequence zzso The recovered zzso was thus found to be identical with the sequence zzso of the above mentioned zzso zzso
