The zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the first step in zzso cap zzso zzso consists of three zzso as zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso segment that is zzso for zzso in zzso and for zzso function in zzso zzso a zzso segment from zzso 230 to 275 that is zzso for zzso but essential for zzso function in zzso and zzso a zzso domain from zzso 275 to zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso binds in zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso to form a zzso S complex that we zzso to be a zzso consisting of two molecules of zzso and one zzso of zzso The more extensively truncated protein zzso which cannot support cell growth, sediments as a zzso and does not interact with zzso An intermediate deletion protein zzso which supports cell growth only when zzso sediments principally as a discrete zzso zzso S zzso zzso These data zzso the segment of zzso from zzso 230 to 275 in regulating zzso and in binding to zzso zzso data support the existence of a zzso domain zzso the zzso domain of zzso to zzso zzso the zzso growth zzso of zzso zzso is suppressed by zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso cluster zzso zzso is suppressed by zzso of zzso and zzso 15 other zzso zzso with zzso changes mapping elsewhere in the protein are not suppressed by zzso zzso Finally, we show that the in zzso function of zzso is completely restored by fusion to the zzso domain of the mouse capping zzso We zzso that the need for zzso binding by zzso zzso zzso can by zzso when the zzso zzso domain is delivered to the zzso zzso II zzso complex by linkage in zzso to the zzso zzso
