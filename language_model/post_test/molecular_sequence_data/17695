zzso zzso binding protein zzso is a zzso molecular weight zzso cell protein capable of inducing an experimental zzso zzso zzso in susceptible animal zzso The occurrence of serum zzso against human zzso or bovine zzso zzso was investigated in patients with zzso and healthy zzso A sensitive zzso detected zzso in approximately 50% of patients and controls, without apparent differences in the mean level, zzso or zzso and irrespective of the origin of the zzso Although the correlation zzso less than zzso between zzso and zzso levels in zzso zzso suggested the presence of zzso zzso these zzso also contained zzso specific for either the human or the bovine zzso The only difference between patients and controls was the greater ability of zzso in zzso zzso zzso less than zzso to recognize a synthetic zzso of zzso which zzso severe zzso in zzso We conclude that zzso to zzso occur naturally in man and are not increased in patients with zzso
