The establishment of zzso zzso is a prerequisite for successful pregnancy, which is controlled by a complex zzso zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that have emerged as important regulators of gene zzso However, the contribution of zzso in zzso zzso is still zzso Here we used zzso monkey as an animal model and compared the zzso zzso expression profiles during zzso zzso phase and zzso zzso phase by deep zzso A set of zzso expressed zzso were identified, 8 of which were selected and validated using quantitative zzso To facilitate the prediction of their target zzso the zzso was also determined using tag sequencing of zzso zzso Surprisingly, about 50% of the zzso genes expressed in the zzso monkey zzso exhibited alternative zzso Of special interest, the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is necessary for zzso zzso processes an ultra long zzso zzso zzso along with a short zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso sequences of zzso are poorly zzso between primates and zzso suggesting a zzso zzso binding zzso We further demonstrated that zzso is a valid target of zzso in zzso monkey and human but not in zzso whereas the regulation of zzso by zzso is zzso zzso Additionally, we found that zzso regulates zzso expression through a zzso long zzso zzso immediately downstream of the zzso zzso Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso and presents intriguing zzso regulatory roles of zzso
