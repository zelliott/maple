The beta gamma complex of zzso regulates zzso independently of the G alpha zzso such that upon zzso G proteins give may signal downstream along one or both zzso The G beta 5 zzso exhibits much less zzso with other G beta zzso zzso zzso and is zzso expressed in zzso The G beta 5 zzso exhibits novel properties in its zzso of zzso pathways such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso type II when compared to G beta zzso Recently specific native complexes between G beta 5 and the regulator of G protein signaling zzso zzso zzso and between G beta zzso (a zzso zzso with a 42 zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated from different retinal zzso Such findings are not accounted for by current models as only the G alpha zzso and not G beta had been previously implicated in zzso protein zzso These recent novel observations further reinforce the view of G beta 5 as a unique and highly specialized G protein zzso
