zzso zzso zzso was isolated from waters of zzso zzso and the zzso gene was cloned using a zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso and zzso zzso were found to zzso proteins of 325 zzso and 344 zzso with a molecular mass of 35 zzso and 37 zzso zzso The zzso gene was cloned and expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso as an inclusion body, which was subsequently zzso by zzso and then zzso using zzso zzso After being zzso the zzso was zzso by incubation at zzso in the presence of a 1:10 zzso ratio of zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso was observed at a temperature of 35 degrees and pH zzso when zzso zzso zzso was used as a zzso however, zzso of the activity observed at 35 degrees was still remaining at 0 degrees zzso The stability of the zzso zzso at low temperatures indicates that it is a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was activated by zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso and zzso inhibited zzso Additionally, zzso zzso 20 increased the zzso activity by zzso but zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the zzso activity by zzso and zzso zzso
