zzso of zzso zzso was identified as a zzso zzso of the putative zzso zzso zzso by the segment polarity gene fused in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is viable, shows a maternal effect and displays no zzso by zzso zzso zzso are often found associated to zzso zzso zzso but two zzso groups can be clearly zzso By using a differential zzso screening method, we have cloned the zzso region and identified zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso Two classes of zzso with similar zzso patterns, including a maternal contribution, are zzso in the zzso Transformation experiments clearly assigned the zzso function to one of these zzso units while the other one can be most likely assigned to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso end of the zzso zzso mapped within the 3' untranslated region of the zzso transcribed zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso which contains a zzso sequence and shows no significant zzso with known zzso zzso analysis shows that proper development requires a fine tuning of the genetic doses of fu and zzso both zzso and zzso These results, together with previous genetic and molecular data, suggest that fused and zzso of fused could act through a competitive zzso modification of a common target in the zzso signaling zzso
