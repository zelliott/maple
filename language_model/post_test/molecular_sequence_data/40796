zzso recognition of zzso proteins is well zzso yet zzso recognition of zzso by proteins remains largely unknown, despite their importance in zzso maturation zzso zzso zzso that act on zzso zzso zzso zzso information by the zzso zzso of zzso Here, we report the solution structure of the zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso bound to a zzso zzso zzso the zzso editing site of zzso The structure provides a molecular basis for how zzso recognize the shape, and also more surprisingly, the sequence of the zzso The unexpected direct zzso of the zzso primary sequence by zzso is achieved via the minor groove of the zzso and this recognition is critical for both editing and binding affinity at the zzso site of zzso More generally, our findings suggest a solution to the zzso paradox faced by many zzso proteins that are involved in zzso regulation of gene zzso
