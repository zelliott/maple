A respiratory defective pet zzso zzso delta zzso of zzso zzso deficient in zzso was transformed with the zzso construct zzso This zzso contains the entire zzso gene with only a single base pair change zzso confined to the putative second zzso translation initiation zzso While transformation of the zzso deficient zzso with zzso resulted in an zzso of zzso activity in the zzso of the transformed strain, zzso activity in the zzso remained negligible his result indicated that the zzso zzso zzso is zzso exclusively from the second translation initiation zzso of zzso zzso of zzso of the zzso ends of zzso transcripts confirmed that the zzso gene zzso two distinct species of zzso These data provide strong evidence for the synthesis and targeting of two zzso zzso
