A zzso previously zzso transcript for the zzso gene zzso the beta zzso of spinach zzso zzso zzso has recently been identified in zzso In this report we show that this transcript is present in zzso and its zzso end is at the translation start zzso When zzso in zzso using spinach zzso zzso zzso the zzso end of this novel transcript is located at the beginning of the second zzso of the zzso coding zzso Although this zzso transcript lacks an untranslated leader region, it is an abundant zzso in zzso and is associated with crude zzso zzso as are the four larger zzso zzso In zzso synthesis of the zzso transcript does not occur for a zzso DNA in which the zzso region of the promoter is zzso
