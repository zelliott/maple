A zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was constructed by substitution of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (except its signal zzso for the counterpart of zzso zzso A3 zzso zzso To acquire high-level zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso a series of zzso signal peptides were zzso The activity of zzso which was directed by an artificial zzso signal zzso zzso zzso from zzso into growth zzso reached zzso zzso after zzso zzso indicating that signal zzso zzso appears to be critical for early stages in zzso zzso By zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso property zzso showed that the common zzso for zzso were 70 degrees C and pH zzso The residual activity of zzso at 90 degrees C for 10 zzso was zzso of its maximum activity, which was almost similar to that of zzso (90 degrees C, 10 zzso zzso This constructed shuttle expression zzso with a novel signal zzso exhibited its zzso for high-level production of zzso proteins from zzso zzso Moreover, the high-level zzso zzso with relatively high zzso could be a potential candidate for feed industrial zzso
