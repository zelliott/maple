We report sequences for nuclear zzso from the zzso fish zzso and six zzso These include two zzso zzso and zzso one zzso two zzso and the zzso zzso Combining these results with earlier data on zzso zzso zzso and various zzso the following conclusions on zzso evolution can be zzso First, all zzso zzso resemble in size the zzso zzso zzso Second, all zzso described previously for zzso birds and zzso as well as the first zzso of a fish, characterized here, show a cluster of 7 to 12 zzso zzso in the tail zzso Since this zzso cluster is absent from all zzso zzso including that of the zzso zzso it was acquired with the zzso zzso The larger zzso zzso of differentiated cells must have arisen subsequently by gene zzso and zzso of an extra zzso This extra zzso of the zzso zzso is the only major change in domain organization in zzso zzso zzso Third, the three zzso of the zzso and zzso genes zzso in position to the last three zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus the entirely different gene organization of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes seems to reflect evolutionary zzso which probably also accounts for the fact that zzso zzso has the most diverse zzso zzso Finally we discuss the possibility that two zzso types, a zzso expressed one and a zzso regulated one, arose independently on the zzso and zzso zzso
