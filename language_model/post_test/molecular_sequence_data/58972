The molecular recognition between zzso and zzso I was zzso zzso I and zzso can be zzso to an active electron transfer zzso zzso and mass zzso analysis of zzso peptides indicate that the two negative patches zzso in plant zzso are zzso with zzso zzso of a domain near the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of these negative to zzso patches of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, reveals the first patch to be essential for the zzso interaction in the electron transfer complex with zzso I and the second one to lower the zzso zzso The domain in zzso not found in zzso is predicted to fold into two zzso zzso The interacting zzso zzso lines up six zzso on one side which may guide a fast one-dimensional diffusion of zzso and provide the zzso attraction at the attachment site, in addition to the zzso interaction in the area where the electron is transferred to zzso in the reaction center of zzso zzso This zzso interaction is likely to increase the electron transfer rate by more than two orders of magnitude in plants as compared with zzso Our data resolve the controversy about the function of zzso
