The zzso stage from which stems the zzso B cell population in zzso zzso zzso is zzso An approach to answering this question is provided by the sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso variable region zzso genes from zzso for evidence of zzso zzso together with a zzso zzso As zzso zzso of zzso V region genes occurs in zzso center B cells, zzso zzso zzso genes are found in zzso center B cells and their zzso 

zzso V zzso region genes from 10 zzso sporadic and endemic zzso cell lines (9 zzso and 1 zzso zzso and three zzso endemic zzso biopsy specimens were amplified by zzso chain reaction and zzso In addition, zzso region gene sequences from these cell lines were zzso 

All zzso cell lines and the three biopsy specimens carried zzso zzso V region zzso The average zzso frequency of rearranged V zzso genes from eight zzso cell lines established from sporadic zzso was zzso A higher frequency zzso was found in five endemic cases (three biopsy specimens and two zzso cell zzso 

The detection of zzso zzso in the rearranged V region genes suggests that both sporadic and endemic zzso represent a zzso zzso originating from zzso center B cells or their zzso Interestingly, the zzso frequency detected in sporadic zzso is in a range similar to that characteristic for zzso B cells in the human peripheral blood and for zzso zzso zzso center B cells, whereas the zzso frequency found in endemic zzso is significantly zzso
