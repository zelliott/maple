Peanut zzso is a significant health problem because of the zzso and potential severity of the allergic zzso zzso zzso from patients with documented peanut hypersensitivity reactions and overlapping peptides were used to identify the zzso zzso on the major peanut zzso zzso h zzso At least zzso different linear zzso zzso located throughout the length of the zzso h 1 zzso were zzso All of the zzso were 6-10 zzso acids in zzso but there was no obvious sequence motif shared by all zzso Four of the peptides appeared to be zzso zzso zzso in that they were recognized by serum from more than zzso of the patients tested and bound more zzso than any of the other zzso h 1 zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed that single zzso acid changes within these peptides had dramatic effects on zzso zzso The identification and determination of the zzso capabilities of core zzso acids in zzso on the zzso h 1 protein will make it possible to address the zzso and zzso mechanisms regarding peanut hypersensitivity reactions specifically and food hypersensitivity in zzso
