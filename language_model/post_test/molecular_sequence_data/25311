zzso protein is a 10 zzso protein which binds zzso and zzso zzso zzso with high zzso The concentration in liver is 2-4 times the zzso zzso zzso has much greater affinity for zzso than zzso zzso from bovine heart and liver is unable to compete with zzso zzso zzso and zzso membrane in binding zzso zzso whereas zzso effectively extracts zzso from all those zzso Previously published results on the effect of zzso on zzso metabolism need to be reevaluated due to possible contamination with zzso Recently it was discovered that zzso is identical to a putative neurotransmitter zzso binding zzso The possibility therefore exists that zzso has more than one zzso
