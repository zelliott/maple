zzso injury triggers zzso and zzso zzso of smooth muscle cells zzso culminating in vessel zzso zzso response factor zzso and its zzso zzso play a central role in the control of smooth muscle zzso by regulating the expression of zzso zzso We show that zzso and zzso regulate a zzso zzso zzso cluster zzso zzso and zzso To assess the functions of these zzso in zzso we systematically deleted them zzso and in combination in zzso Mice lacking both zzso and zzso are viable and do not display overt abnormalities in smooth muscle zzso although they show a significant reduction in blood pressure due to reduced vascular zzso zzso however, zzso formation in response to vascular injury is profoundly zzso in mice lacking these zzso due to disarray of zzso stress fibers and diminished migratory activity of zzso These abnormalities reflect the regulation of a cadre of zzso of zzso activity and zzso dynamics by zzso and zzso Thus, zzso and zzso act as integral components of the regulatory network zzso zzso controls zzso zzso and zzso switching of zzso during vascular zzso
