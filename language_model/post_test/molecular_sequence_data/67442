Although sequencing of zzso tuberculosis zzso lead to better understanding of zzso units and gene functions, interactions occurring during zzso initiation between zzso zzso and promoters is yet to be zzso Different stages of zzso initiation include promoter specific binding of zzso zzso zzso initiation and promoter zzso We have now analyzed these events with four promoters of zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The promoters differed from each other in their rates of open complex formation, zzso promoter clearance and zzso zzso The equilibrium binding and kinetic studies of various steps revealed distinct rate limiting events for each of the promoter, which also differed markedly in their characteristics from the respective promoters of zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso at zzso promoter was enhanced in the presence of initiating zzso and decreased in the presence of zzso zzso a pattern typically seen with zzso promoters studied so zzso The zzso promoter of zzso zzso on the other hand, was not subjected to zzso zzso zzso The marked differences in the zzso initiation zzso seen with zzso and zzso promoters of zzso zzso and zzso tuberculosis suggest that such species specific differences in the regulation of expression of the crucial zzso genes could be one of the key zzso contributing to the differences in growth rate and lifestyle of the two zzso Moreover, the distinct rate limiting steps during zzso initiation of each one of the promoters studied point at variations in their zzso zzso
