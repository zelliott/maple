The group of dominant zzso zzso zzso disorders characterized by clinically similar forms of zzso muscle zzso is genetically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease) is linked to zzso the gene zzso the major muscle zzso channel, localized on zzso zzso In contrast, dominant zzso sensitive to zzso are caused by point zzso in zzso on zzso zzso the gene for the alpha zzso of the adult skeletal muscle sodium zzso No linkage or molecular genetic data are as yet available on zzso zzso characterized by milder symptoms and later onset of zzso than in zzso disease, and absence of muscle zzso We report a zzso zzso substitution for a family with dominant inheritance previously diagnosed to have zzso zzso Thus, this disorder appears as a zzso of zzso disease due to zzso leading to low clinical zzso In addition, we report a novel zzso zzso zzso for a typical zzso zzso In another family previously diagnosed as having zzso disease, we unexpectedly found a zzso 14 zzso deletion known to cause zzso zzso and a rare zzso zzso
