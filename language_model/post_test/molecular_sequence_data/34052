zzso small zzso and zzso body zzso zzso function in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso processing, and zzso zzso zzso zzso one of four essential protein components of zzso zzso zzso forms a core zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso that binds to zzso zzso zzso Crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso have revealed how the protein components interact with each other and with the zzso zzso However, in place of zzso zzso zzso zzso contain zzso which binds specifically to an zzso zzso motif absent from zzso zzso zzso while zzso binds a broader range of zzso zzso We report solution zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso which reveal that zzso exhibits two major zzso in solution due to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The equivalent zzso is in the zzso zzso in all reported structures of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso has the expected zzso fold, but the solution structures of the major zzso of zzso with trans zzso and of zzso with zzso zzso reveal that zzso zzso zzso affects the positions of numerous zzso at the zzso and zzso binding zzso An zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso also zzso the association of zzso with zzso zzso expressed in zzso We propose that zzso plays a key role in the assembly of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso in a stable zzso zzso complex and positioning the protein backbone to interact with the zzso zzso
