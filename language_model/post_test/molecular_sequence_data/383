In a zzso screen of the zzso mouse strain zzso we describe an earlier and more potent zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso compared with the classical zzso strain zzso The zzso correlated with increased activity of the zzso zzso axis as well as zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The trait was mapped to the zzso zzso which contains zzso a gene previously implicated as sustaining the late phase of zzso zzso In the zzso zzso signaling network, zzso promotes early nuclear factor zzso zzso activity and is essential for the zzso of zzso zzso We identify a deletion in the zzso promoter of the zzso zzso zzso leading to an increased ratio of zzso to zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso is an essential component of the early zzso response in zzso mice and show a distinct zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in this model zzso In addition, they demonstrate that studies in zzso divergent model organisms are essential to complete dissection of signal zzso zzso
