Our laboratory has identified at least two types of vascular smooth muscle cells zzso that exist in canine arteries and zzso type 1 cells, located in the media express muscle specific proteins but do not zzso in culture; and type 2 cells, located in both media and zzso do not express muscle specific protein but zzso in zzso Plasma membrane zzso zzso have been implicated in proliferation zzso The present study examines the expression of zzso zzso and zzso domain zzso zzso in these two types of canine zzso zzso protein was found in both type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso were developed for canine zzso zzso domain zzso zzso We cloned and zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso from canine zzso zzso 2 and 3 were not zzso Freshly isolated type 1 cells expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso while freshly isolated type 2 cells expressed zzso and zzso Upon placement in culture, type 2 cells originating from either carotid artery or zzso vein demonstrated a zzso zzso of zzso zzso Treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso produced zzso zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest a role for zzso zzso in regulating zzso zzso which may be important in the control of zzso zzso zzso
