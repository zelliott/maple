The zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently discovered to contain a general zzso protein zzso zzso Central to this zzso is zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is involved in the transfer of an zzso from a zzso zzso carrier to the zzso side chain of proteins within the zzso zzso sites zzso where zzso and zzso can be any zzso acids except zzso Using a library of zzso zzso and a quantitative zzso in zzso zzso we assessed the zzso acids at each position of the consensus zzso sequence for their impact on zzso efficiency, zzso the sequence zzso was found to be the optimal zzso zzso In the context of a full-length folded zzso the differences between variations of the zzso sequences were found to be consistent with the trends observed from their zzso counterparts, though less dramatic because of additional zzso In addition to characterizing the zzso preferences of zzso we also assessed the selectivity toward the zzso zzso Interestingly, despite recent reports of relaxed selectivity toward the zzso zzso zzso was not found to be capable of utilizing zzso donors such as zzso which is the minimum zzso for the zzso OT zzso
