The DNA repeat region of zzso the gene zzso a group A zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso into an zzso coli zzso expression zzso The expressed protein product displayed the same zzso properties as the full-length zzso protein expressed from zzso The zzso full-length zzso protein was found to compete with zzso protein A or zzso protein G for binding to beads coated with human zzso These results are consistent with earlier studies suggesting that the binding sites on human zzso for protein A, protein G and the type II zzso protein from group A zzso are located at the interface of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
