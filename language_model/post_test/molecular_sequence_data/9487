zzso group zzso proteins are zzso zzso zzso zzso and act together in three zzso complexes, zzso repressive complex 1 zzso zzso repressive complex 2 zzso and zzso repressive complex zzso to repress zzso of the target zzso Here, we identified zzso target genes in zzso zzso with zzso zzso using zzso expression screening based on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso which represent the distinct zzso As a result, the expressions of 29 genes were zzso after knocking down 4 zzso zzso zzso there is a significant overlap between targets of zzso zzso out of zzso and zzso zzso out of zzso and among these, 190 genes function as regulator factors playing important roles in zzso We also found that zzso as well as zzso can interact with other zzso components examined in this zzso Further detailed analysis revealed that the zzso of zzso containing zinc finger domain is involved in the interaction between zzso and zzso Moreover, the zinc finger domain in zzso contributes to its zzso function and zzso zzso of zzso is able to promote zzso repression by zzso zzso including zzso zzso Loss of zzso expression causes zzso of zzso into the zzso zzso we provide evidence of a functional link between zzso and zzso and propose two zzso repression mechanisms requiring only zzso associated with zzso or a whole set of zzso zzso
