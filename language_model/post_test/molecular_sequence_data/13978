The structure of the synthetic zzso zzso has been determined to a resolution of zzso A and refined to a final R factor of zzso The volume of the unit cell is significantly smaller by zzso than the original Drew and zzso parent zzso zzso zzso zzso Wing, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Dickerson, zzso zzso (1981) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 78, zzso The double zzso is in a different position in the unit cell, rotated by zzso degrees, and translated by zzso A around the zzso axis with respect to the parent zzso The zzso arrangement of zzso characterized by double hydrogen bonded zzso minor groove zzso remains zzso The molecular geometry exhibits several significant changes that are related to the changed position of the zzso and the presence of two mismatched base pairs with zzso Both zzso are found in a symmetrical zzso zzso and the zzso groups are in zzso zzso The zzso pattern of the structure is different and can be related to changes in the minor groove zzso An incorrect model that was zzso to the parent zzso could be refined to a low R zzso zzso of the refinement and of the geometry that are indicative of incorrect structures have been zzso
