zzso is a class II zzso element derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso and is notable for its unusually long zzso terminal zzso repeats zzso The zzso and zzso genes are transcribed from a common promoter, designated zzso that is subject to negative regulation by zzso The zzso of zzso each contain a zzso sequence that can be aligned with the zzso to zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso and an adjacent zzso sequence that binds zzso This unique juxtaposition of zzso and zzso binding sites suggests that zzso may regulate the binding or zzso activity of zzso The results of the present study indicate that zzso in addition to functioning as a zzso zzso and as a zzso zzso is required for zzso binding to the zzso of zzso
