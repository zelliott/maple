zzso templates for zzso zzso synthesis are rich in A or U zzso in comparison to templates for zzso zzso zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso zzso synthesis by the zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso is more efficient if the template contains an zzso template sequence near the initiation site zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations led us to examine the effects of zzso changes near the zzso initiation site on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in barley zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the template for zzso synthesis had only modest effects on zzso replication in barley zzso zzso with changes to the zzso zzso and zzso template zzso accumulated zzso zzso at levels similar to the the zzso zzso However, zzso at positions adjacent to the initiation zzso in the templates for zzso and zzso zzso zzso synthesis significantly decreased zzso zzso For example, changes at the third template zzso for zzso zzso synthesis resulted in zzso zzso at between 18 and zzso of the zzso level, and zzso in the third template zzso for zzso zzso resulted in zzso at between 7 and zzso of the zzso zzso The effects of the zzso generally decreased as the zzso occurred further from the initiation zzso These findings demonstrate that there are different requirements of the template sequence near the initiation zzso for zzso zzso zzso in plant zzso
