A zzso region from one species of the segmented zzso zzso of zzso disease virus zzso was amplified from total zzso acid extracts of diseased plants by reverse zzso with zzso followed by amplification with zzso DNA zzso zzso Other zzso regions zzso 150 zzso and c zzso zzso were also amplified from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was only zzso when the viral zzso template was boiled and zzso with zzso or random zzso zzso The reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to yield only the 150 zzso zzso from the zzso template under the conditions zzso The level of sensitivity of zzso for zzso zzso zzso was 100 zzso approximately zzso more sensitive than detection with zzso DNA zzso
