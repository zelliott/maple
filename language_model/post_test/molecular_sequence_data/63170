Rapid evolution of snake zzso genes by positive selection has been reported previously but key features of this process such as the targets of selection, rates of gene zzso and functional diversity of toxins generated remain zzso This is especially true for closely related species with divergent zzso We describe the evolution of zzso gene sequences isolated from zzso DNA from four zzso of zzso zzso which feed on different zzso We identified four to seven distinct zzso zzso in each zzso and zzso analyses suggest that these sequences represent a rapidly evolving gene family consisting of both zzso and zzso zzso with high rates of gene gain and zzso Strong positive selection was implicated as a driving force in the evolution of these protein coding zzso zzso coding for zzso acids that make up mature proteins have levels of variation two to three times greater than those of the surrounding zzso zzso zzso zzso likelihood models of coding sequence evolution reveal that a high proportion zzso zzso of all zzso in the mature protein fall into a class of zzso with an estimated zzso zzso ratio of at least zzso An analysis of selection on individual zzso identified nine zzso as being under strong zzso zzso zzso positive selection, with a disproportionately high proportion of these zzso found in two functional regions of the zzso protein zzso zzso and putative zzso zzso This is direct evidence that diversifying selection has led to high levels of functional diversity due to structural differences in proteins among these zzso Overall, our results demonstrate that both gene gain and loss and protein sequence evolution via positive selection are important evolutionary forces driving zzso divergence in zzso proteins in closely related species of zzso zzso
