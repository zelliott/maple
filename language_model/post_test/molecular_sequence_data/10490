The structure of the zzso zzso domain of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso determined by zzso zzso shows structural zzso to the winged zzso zzso family, a motif found in a diverse class of proteins including both gene regulators and gene organizers from zzso and zzso zzso data on DNA binding by intact zzso are used as constraints to position the domain on its DNA target and to derive a model for the zzso complex using the known structure of the zzso zzso The structural independence of the zzso fold may be important for zzso zzso proteins that contact extended DNA regions with imperfect match to consensus zzso a feature of many zzso zzso
