zzso alpha zzso inhibitor in human plasma has 12 more zzso zzso than zzso zzso The first zzso is the zzso at position 28, downstream from the zzso of the zzso The zzso sequence predicts that the site zzso upon formation of the mature inhibitor is a typical zzso recognition zzso The mature inhibitor zzso zzso and the previously reported, and presumably zzso form with zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in plasma in about equal zzso They both form a stable complex with zzso Recent studies on a zzso alpha zzso inhibitor suggest that the 12 additional zzso have functional implications zzso zzso Nakamura, zzso and Aoki (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso
