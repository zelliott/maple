The human blood group A and B zzso zzso are highly zzso and the zzso of four critical zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Met, and zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to change the zzso specificity from a blood group A to a blood group B zzso To carry out a systematic study, a synthetic gene strategy was employed to obtain their genes and to allow facile zzso zzso forms of a zzso zzso A and a set of hybrid zzso A and B zzso were expressed in zzso coli in high yields, which allowed them to be zzso characterized extensively for the first zzso A functional hybrid zzso zzso zzso was able to catalyze both A and B zzso with the zzso being zzso higher for the A zzso Surprisingly, even a single zzso acid replacement in zzso A with the corresponding zzso from zzso B zzso zzso zzso produced zzso with zzso A activity only, but with very large zzso increases in the zzso and increased zzso The increases observed in zzso are among the largest obtained for a single zzso acid change and are advantageous for the zzso scale synthesis of blood group zzso
