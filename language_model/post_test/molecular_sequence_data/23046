zzso A, isolated from the sea zzso zzso zzso possesses an zzso potent zzso effect in zzso and it is one of the promising candidates as an zzso zzso This zzso is known to zzso zzso and inhibit the zzso of zzso by forming a zzso complex with zzso zzso The first complex structure of zzso A was determined via a zzso X-ray analysis at a zzso A zzso As expected, zzso A binds to a zzso zzso composed of zzso 1 and 3 of zzso by zzso its zzso tail part into the zzso zzso as do the other reported zzso zzso zzso zzso this complex structure shows the specific structural features around the zzso zzso revealed as an important zzso of zzso A for zzso against zzso zzso Combining this result and our previous one, the zzso should strongly relate to the specific biological activity of zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso
