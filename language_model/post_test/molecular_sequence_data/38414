We have analyzed the zzso zzso mechanisms implicated in cell survival and show here that zzso deprivation zzso zzso cell death but does not zzso zzso or zzso zzso Since zzso expression is insufficient to ensure cell survival in the absence of zzso we speculate that additional molecules replace the zzso role of zzso and zzso in an alternative zzso zzso Cell death is associated with zzso zzso and zzso expression blocks zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acts as a survival factor in the absence of growth zzso To characterize the zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso we cloned the promoter of this zzso zzso of the promoter showed no zzso box element but did reveal binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gels showed that zzso specifically zzso zzso and zzso binding activity and that zzso of these binding sites zzso the zzso zzso promoter activity, suggesting that these zzso factors are important in zzso promoter zzso zzso deprivation zzso zzso of zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso both of which are proteins involved in the formation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso family proteins zzso the promoter and restores zzso expression in the absence of zzso zzso Taken together, these data describe a new biological role for zzso and define the regulatory zzso implicated in zzso zzso
