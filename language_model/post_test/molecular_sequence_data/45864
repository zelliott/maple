zzso zzso requires the coordinated assembly of a complex of zzso collectively known as the zzso at the zzso division zzso zzso is a zzso component of the zzso in bacteria with cell walls, suggesting that it plays a role in synthesis and/or zzso of zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso region of zzso comprises three discrete zzso that we designate zzso zzso and gamma from the N to C zzso The zzso is zzso to the zzso membrane and zzso with the zzso zzso domain that was proposed previously to function as a molecular zzso The zzso has a unique zzso fold, with no zzso counterpart, and we show that it zzso between two discrete zzso via zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso We propose that this zzso might zzso zzso interactions of the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is zzso in the absence of other zzso zzso but we show that it is critical for zzso zzso
