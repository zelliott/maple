zzso in zzso can be achieved by plasma membrane zzso which is dependent on zzso ring zzso zzso presumably couples these processes by interaction with both the plasma membrane and the temporary zzso ring component zzso In addition, an zzso ring independent zzso zzso exists in zzso We here identified zzso a key component of the alternative pathway, as a novel interaction partner of zzso The zzso zzso rich part of zzso binds the zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso with truncated proteins lacking either of these zzso zzso do not display any severe zzso but are zzso zzso demonstrating their crucial role in zzso zzso of zzso leads to an zzso ring independent recruitment of zzso to the bud neck, further supporting the significance of this interaction in zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso in a zzso or an zzso deletion not only restores zzso but also the recruitment of zzso to the bud zzso We propose that zzso is part of an zzso ring independent zzso pathway, which acts as a rescue mechanism to recruit zzso to the bud zzso
