The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is largely protected against zzso (except for about 1 zzso on the N zzso in the zzso zzso this zzso resistance is often used to zzso successful zzso of zzso into isolated zzso in zzso In this paper we show that this zzso resistance is exhibited by zzso zzso complex of zzso II zzso but not by zzso zzso in which about 5 zzso on the N zzso of zzso are zzso off by zzso When a zzso version of zzso that is unable to zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso is inserted into isolated zzso it gives rise to only the shorter zzso zzso product indicative of zzso zzso We conclude that more of the zzso domain of zzso is zzso in zzso than in zzso zzso and that this difference in zzso sensitivity can be used to distinguish between zzso assembled in zzso zzso or zzso The data presented prove that upon zzso of zzso into isolated zzso at least part of the protein spontaneously binds zzso to form zzso which then is assembled in zzso The dependence of the zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso on the zzso state of the newly formed zzso justifies caution when using a zzso zzso to verify successful zzso of zzso into the zzso
