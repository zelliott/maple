A highly zzso T4 zzso zzso was fused to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso coupled zzso zzso for zzso We demonstrate that the zzso fused zzso is sufficiently rigid relative to the zzso to facilitate zzso without zzso zzso or the use of a stabilizing zzso G zzso or protein fused to the 3rd zzso zzso This approach adds to the protein engineering strategies that enable zzso studies of zzso alone or in complex with a signaling zzso
