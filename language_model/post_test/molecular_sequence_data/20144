The molecular mechanisms of the immune system against virus in shrimp are not well known, despite its economic importance as an aquaculture zzso In this investigation, a zzso gene (named as zzso zzso was obtained from zzso zzso shrimp, which exhibited high zzso with zzso 6 of other zzso The zzso zzso having zzso activity, contained characteristic signatures of zzso proteins with 6 zzso binding zzso and 5 zzso specific zzso However, the zzso protein exhibited a very different zzso site zzso at its zzso from most of other zzso The zzso gene was zzso expressed in shrimp zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso gene was zzso in zzso shrimp, suggesting that the zzso protein might play an important role in shrimp immune response against virus zzso This discovery might contribute better understanding to the molecular events involved in shrimp as well as zzso immune zzso
