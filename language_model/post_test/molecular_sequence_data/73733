A new genetic locus associated with zzso zzso zzso was previously identified by zzso zzso with zzso This locus maps approximately 160 zzso from the genes zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso and yet insertions zzso result in loss of these proteins and a zzso zzso zzso prompting the designation zzso locus zzso In the current study, passage of zzso in the absence of zzso selection resulted in loss of the zzso a zzso protein profile, and a zzso zzso zzso the correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso revealed open reading frames zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso arranged in tandem and flanked by a zzso and a zzso zzso suggesting a single zzso unit, the zzso zzso The zzso end of zzso zzso was mapped by primer extension, and a likely promoter was identified just zzso The product of each zzso was identified by using zzso prepared against fusion zzso The previously characterized surface protein zzso is zzso by zzso while the 190,000 Mr zzso protein zzso is a product of zzso zzso with sizes of zzso and zzso Mr and unknown function were identified for zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso predict a zzso highly characteristic of a zzso zzso and five zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso probably forms zzso in zzso which is consistent with a structural role in zzso Each zzso zzso mapped to zzso but affected the levels of all products of the zzso zzso zzso is thought to form a zzso zzso formerly designated zzso and examination of an zzso deletion zzso confirms that zzso is a product of the zzso zzso
