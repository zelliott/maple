The nuclear envelope is zzso located between the zzso and zzso and, as such, can play a major role in controlling cellular activity by regulating the exchange of zzso between these two zzso The nuclear pore complexes, which are located within circular areas formed by fusion of the inner and outer zzso of the zzso represent the primary, if not the zzso exchange zzso Individual pores are able to function in both protein import and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso occurs by either passive diffusion or facilitated transport through central channels within the zzso The functional size of the diffusion channel is approximately 9 to over 12 zzso in diameter depending on the cell zzso The zzso of the transport channel varies as a function of the number and effectiveness of the specific nuclear targeting signals contained within the zzso zzso The maximum diameter of the channel can be over 26 zzso zzso exchanges can be regulated either by zzso differences in the properties of the transported zzso zzso size and signal zzso or zzso changes in the properties of the pore complexes, which can effect both diffusion and zzso
