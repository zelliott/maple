zzso zzso proteins inhibit expression of the zzso gene but activate expression of the zzso zzso Both effects are zzso by zzso elements zzso the binding sites for members of the zzso zzso factor zzso By a process that is independent of the zzso gene product, zzso zzso between different zzso factors: in zzso binding of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso is totally blocked by zzso while, in contrast, there is no zzso of zzso binding to the zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the DNA binding domain of zzso is not involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso does, however, cause zzso of the zzso domain of zzso which is likely to be responsible for the enhanced zzso zzso by zzso zzso through zzso zzso
