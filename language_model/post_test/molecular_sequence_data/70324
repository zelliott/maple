In this report we describe the construction of a zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso linking the steroid zzso zzso and zzso syndrome zzso zzso on zzso Four human zzso libraries were screened initially with sequences from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and later with zzso from zzso 10 of the zzso gene and the end zzso of a zzso clone zzso to fill the zzso Fifteen clones were isolated and the sizes of their human zzso were determined by zzso gel zzso followed by Southern zzso with labeled total human zzso zzso between the zzso clones were evaluated using more than 20 DNA zzso including the screening zzso the end fragments, and the zzso products of the zzso zzso The extent of overlapping between the clones was further determined by long-range restriction zzso In combination with our previously reported zzso zzso around zzso and zzso a total of 2 zzso of zzso have been isolated in zzso zzso These clones will facilitate the isolation of new genes and the characterization of deletions and zzso which occur at very high frequency in this region of the human X zzso
