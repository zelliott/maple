zzso acid sequences for more than 60 plant zzso zzso are deposited in databases, but the zzso structure of only 4 plant zzso have been zzso thus, the gap between the reported sequences and structures of plant zzso is zzso zzso the structure of plant zzso is essential to fully understanding the function of these proteins in plant zzso zzso the actual protein structure by experimental methods zzso by X-ray zzso requires considerable protein material and is zzso thus, this type of work is limited to few laboratories around the zzso In zzso zzso methods to predict the zzso structure of proteins from zzso acid sequences have been implemented and are helping reduce the zzso zzso Thus, in zzso methods are useful tools for predicting the zzso structure of several plant zzso from zzso acid sequences deposited in zzso In this chapter, we describe a method for predicting and analyzing the structure of a rice zzso from the template structure of native rice zzso This method is based on a comparative modeling method that uses programs from the zzso zzso
