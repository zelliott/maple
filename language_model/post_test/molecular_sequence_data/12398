Human zzso zzso zzso was shown by zzso zzso to bind two molecules of zzso L and S and zzso with high zzso By contrast, binding of a second zzso of zzso H was much zzso The zzso binding zzso was confirmed by zzso monitored by loss of zzso activity and by zzso zzso zzso The zzso of binding of zzso L and S and zzso showed the two zzso binding sites to have association rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these kinetic zzso with previous data for intact zzso and its separated zzso indicate that the zzso site is also the zzso site and is present on domain 3, whereas the zzso zzso site is on domain zzso These results also indicate that there is no appreciable zzso hindrance for the binding of zzso between the two binding sites or from the zzso light zzso
