The formation of a new human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been detected during the routine testing of a European Caucasian blood and potential stem cell donor and his zzso zzso typing of the donor with two zzso chain reaction - sequence specific zzso zzso systems yielded zzso zzso zzso typing of the family members including zzso typing of zzso in both directions after zzso amplification showed that the zzso had most likely formed by a double crossover event in zzso 2 of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso containing the new zzso was most probably derived from the father, who was typed as zzso and zzso The comparison of the sequences of the paternal zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso 2 sequence of the zzso showed that it had most likely formed through an zzso of at least the sequence part zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso We suppose that the zzso sites are located in the sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso At the protein level, more than 50% of the zzso structure of the zzso chain is replaced by a zzso sequence with the exchange of several zzso zzso zzso typing of the zzso showed zzso However, one zzso zzso of five zzso zzso reacted positive, which might indicate residual zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso that are most similar to zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso with at least four zzso acid differences in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is a new zzso with unique properties compared with other known zzso zzso with regard to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
