zzso c zzso zzso the terminal zzso of the zzso electron transport chain, is regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso ratio, and zzso zzso Of particular interest is the zzso zzso which has been hypothesized to keep the zzso membrane potential at low healthy values zzso zzso thus preventing the formation of zzso radical zzso which have been implicated in multiple degenerative zzso It has been proposed that the zzso zzso is switched on by the protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso The goal of this study was to identify the zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso of zzso We report the mass zzso identification of four new zzso sites in bovine heart zzso The identified zzso sites include zzso in zzso II, zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso With the exception of zzso in zzso zzso the identified zzso sites were found in zzso samples with and without zzso zzso zzso making zzso of zzso zzso a candidate site enabling zzso zzso We therefore zzso that additional zzso may be required for the zzso zzso and that these sites may be easily zzso or difficult to identify by mass zzso
