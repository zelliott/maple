Juvenile Huntington disease zzso zzso by onset of symptoms before the age of 20 with rigidity and intellectual decline, is associated with a predominance of affected zzso In order to investigate the molecular basis for the observed parental effect, we have zzso the zzso zzso repeat within the HD gene in 42 juvenile onset cases from 34 zzso A highly significant correlation was found between the repeat length and age of onset zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and it was determined that the sex of zzso parent was the major influence on zzso expansion leading to earlier zzso Neither the size of the parental upper zzso the age of parent at conception of juvenile onset child, nor the zzso sex zzso a significant effect upon zzso zzso zzso pair analysis of zzso repeat zzso however, revealed a high correlation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Furthermore, analysis of nuclear and extended families showed a familial predisposition to juvenile onset zzso This study demonstrates that the sex of zzso parent is the major influence on zzso expansion and clinical features in juvenile Huntington zzso
