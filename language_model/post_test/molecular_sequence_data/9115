Based on Huffman tree method, we propose a new zzso graphic representation of protein zzso This representation can completely avoid loss of information in the transfer of data from a protein sequence to its graphic zzso The method consists of two zzso One is about the zzso codes of 20 zzso acids by Huffman tree with zzso acid zzso The zzso acid frequency is defined as the statistical number of an zzso acid in the analyzed protein zzso The other is about the zzso graphic representation of protein sequence based on the zzso zzso Then the applications of the method on ten zzso genes and seven zzso coli strains are presented in zzso The results show that the proposed model may provide us with some new sights to understand the evolution patterns determined from protein sequences and complete zzso
