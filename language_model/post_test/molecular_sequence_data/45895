A new methodology for distinguishing between specific and zzso zzso complexes in zzso zzso mass zzso zzso is zzso The method involves the addition of an appropriate reference protein zzso which does not bind specifically to any of the solution zzso to the zzso solution containing the zzso and zzso of zzso The occurrence of zzso zzso binding is monitored by the appearance of zzso zzso + zzso complexes in the zzso mass zzso Furthermore, the fraction of zzso undergoing zzso zzso binding provides a quantitative measure of the contribution of zzso binding to the measured zzso of protein and specific zzso zzso As a result, errors introduced into zzso association constants, zzso as determined with zzso by zzso zzso binding can be zzso The principal assumptions on which this methodology is based, zzso that the fraction of proteins and protein complexes that engage in zzso zzso binding during the zzso process is determined by the number of free zzso molecules in the offspring droplets leading to gaseous zzso and is independent of the size and structure of the protein or protein complex, are shown to be generally zzso The application of the method for the determination of zzso for two zzso complexes, under conditions where zzso zzso binding is zzso is zzso
