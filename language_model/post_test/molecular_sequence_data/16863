Comparative analysis of recently zzso zzso zzso has uncovered extensive variation in zzso element zzso zzso diversity, and zzso The TE profile in the zzso zzso zzso is more similar to that of zzso zzso than to human or zzso in that zzso zzso exhibit low overall zzso high family diversity, and zzso in the zzso It has been suggested that selection against the deleterious effects of zzso zzso between zzso has structured the TE profile in zzso and zzso but not in zzso We test this hypothesis by measuring the sample frequency of 48 zzso TE insertions in the zzso of the green spotted zzso zzso zzso We estimate the strength of selection acting on recent insertions by analyzing the site frequency spectrum using a zzso zzso We show that in contrast to zzso zzso TE insertions in zzso are selectively neutral and that the low copy number and zzso distribution of zzso in the zzso zzso must be caused by regulation by means other than zzso selection acting on recent zzso zzso of regulatory processes governing TE profiles should take into account factors such as effective population size, zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso
