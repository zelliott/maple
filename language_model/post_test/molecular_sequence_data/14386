In the present work, we report a novel class of zzso zzso zzso originated from the zzso soil zzso zzso zzso zzso with structural and zzso properties not observed previously in zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso sequence from zzso zzso zzso zzso with low similarity to other characterized zzso family of zzso was zzso zzso analysis showed that it belongs to a distinct zzso class not previously described and restricted only in soil bacteria, called the zzso class zzso This zzso zzso as zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli and its structural and zzso properties were zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso exhibits significant zzso activity against the common zzso zzso zzso as well as very high zzso activity towards organic zzso The crystal structure of zzso was determined at zzso zzso resolution in complex with zzso zzso Although zzso adopts the zzso zzso fold, sequence and structural characteristics distinct from previously characterized zzso were zzso The absence of the classic zzso essential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from all other zzso zzso of known structure and zzso zzso zzso showed that instead of the classic zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso an zzso network, and a bridge of a network of water molecules may form the basis of the zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis, structural information, and zzso zzso in combination with kinetic analysis showed that zzso zzso and zzso are additional important zzso for the zzso zzso efficiency and zzso
