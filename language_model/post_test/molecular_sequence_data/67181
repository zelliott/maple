zzso zzso zzso provides a mechanism to decode information located in two overlapping reading frames by diverting a proportion of translating zzso into a second open reading frame zzso The result is the production of two zzso the product of standard translation from zzso and an zzso fusion zzso Such programmed zzso is commonly zzso as a gene expression mechanism in viruses that zzso zzso cells and in a subset of cellular zzso zzso secondary structures, consisting of zzso or zzso located downstream of the shift site often act as zzso of zzso Here, we demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso can functionally mimic these zzso structures to induce zzso zzso zzso when zzso downstream of the zzso site, zzso zzso zzso shifting of the zzso into the zzso reading frame is highly efficient in both rabbit zzso zzso translation reactions and in cultured zzso zzso The efficiency of zzso zzso at this site is responsive to the sequence context zzso of the shift site and to zzso zzso
