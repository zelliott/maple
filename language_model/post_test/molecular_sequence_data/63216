We have characterized the adaptations of zzso zzso to a rarely captured event in the evolution of its impact on host zzso transition from chronic zzso zzso zzso to gastric zzso defined the impact of these adaptations on an intriguing but poorly characterized interaction between this zzso and gastric zzso stem zzso zzso zzso were obtained from a single human host zzso with a single dominant strain before and after his progression from zzso to gastric zzso during a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated from two zzso one zzso the other zzso The zzso strain was less fit in a zzso transgenic mouse model of human zzso and better able to establish itself within a mouse gastric zzso zzso cell line zzso that supports bacterial zzso zzso comparisons of the zzso of zzso and a control mouse gastric zzso cell line revealed that, upon infection, the zzso strain regulates expression of zzso signaling and zzso zzso and tumor zzso genes associated with development of gastric cancer in humans, in a manner distinct from the zzso zzso The effects on zzso zzso zzso some of which were confirmed in zzso mice, together with observed changes in the bacterial zzso are predicted to support aspects of an zzso between this zzso and gastric stem zzso These results provide insights about how zzso zzso may adapt to and influence stem cell biology and how its zzso residency could contribute to gastric zzso
