We describe a family of repetitive sequences found in viruses infecting the brown zzso zzso zzso Previously we have demonstrated that the zzso zzso of viruses infecting one zzso zzso isolate exist as two size classes of 160 and 179 zzso zzso sequences within these zzso were first demonstrated based on the anomalous zzso among five zzso fragments from zzso virus zzso zzso analysis of one of those fragments, zzso revealed the presence of zzso direct zzso The restriction maps of the zzso zzso fragments in the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso size classes show that these repeats are not widely zzso rather they are confined to a small region of each virus zzso We estimate the number of these repeats in the zzso zzso to be about 109 and in the zzso zzso to be about zzso In the zzso zzso the repeats are contained within a zzso region, about zzso of that virus zzso and in the zzso zzso the repeats are contained within a zzso region, about zzso of the zzso The difference in repeat numbers can account for zzso of the size difference between the two size classes of the zzso zzso
