zzso are known to be potentially important regulators of early zzso processes in zzso birds, and zzso In this study we report the expression of the zzso zzso including those that make up zzso the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso type II in several in zzso systems that model early zzso embryonic development, namely embryonic stem zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso cells, and their differentiated zzso In addition, we examine the expression pattern of these factors in different stages of the mouse zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha and beta A zzso is restricted to certain differentiated cell types, while beta B zzso are expressed in both differentiated and zzso zzso Our results further indicate a change in the expression pattern of zzso zzso during early development from beta B at the zzso stage largely to beta A in zzso zzso This is similar to the expression pattern at equivalent stages of zzso and chick zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso is altered by the induction of differentiation of zzso zzso and zzso cells by several factors, including zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels are not influenced by differentiation in these cell zzso The results of this study demonstrate that the zzso zzso and zzso but not the zzso zzso type II, are zzso expressed during early zzso development and suggest that the different forms of zzso are involved in the regulation of different zzso zzso
