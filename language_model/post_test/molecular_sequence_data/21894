The zzso zzso and molecular zzso of the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso waters of the Yellow Sea, zzso zzso China, were investigated using microscopic observations of live and zzso specimens and by small zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The novel species could be distinguished by the following features: an zzso elliptical body, in zzso size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zone consisting of about 36 zzso three zzso one zzso one zzso two zzso and usually two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso complex composed of zzso pairs of zzso only, terminating in zzso zzso four or five zzso zzso two types of zzso cortical zzso four to nine zzso zzso zzso and one to three zzso and a zzso zzso positioned at zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso has been regarded as rather diverse, which was confirmed by the zzso processes of this novel zzso The most noteworthy feature of zzso zzso was that the zzso retained almost the entire parental zzso zone except for a few zzso zzso that were renewed in zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence information clearly zzso this isolate from its zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated, with high statistical support, that zzso zzso zzso as a sister lineage to the zzso zzso and hence belongs to the core part of the order zzso
