As part of an effort to characterize the spatial and functional relationships among genetic elements within the amplified zzso zzso zzso domain in Chinese zzso cells, we have used a variation of the differential zzso approach to identify zzso clones whose genes are zzso with zzso in the zzso cell line, zzso zzso Our initial screen was successful in zzso both zzso and zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on Northern zzso blots to abundant zzso and zzso zzso transcripts which differ in the lengths of their 3' untranslated zzso The clone zzso contains a zzso open reading frame but does not appear to be related to any members of the protein or zzso acid sequence zzso A second larger zzso zzso zzso was isolated that is transcribed from the same gene as zzso but contains only a small zzso portion of the open reading zzso zzso may, therefore, represent either a zzso intermediate or an zzso transcribed from a cryptic zzso zzso zzso to zzso from the zzso domain shows that zzso is zzso by a gene approximately 34 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is less than 4 zzso from an zzso zzso The 3' end of the zzso gene lies approximately 75 zzso downstream from the zzso gene and approximately 25 zzso downstream from the zzso replication initiation site, and the zzso polarity is opposite to that of the leading strand of zzso Thus, both the zzso and zzso genes are exceptions to the theory that zzso proceeds in the same direction as the leading strand of the replication zzso
