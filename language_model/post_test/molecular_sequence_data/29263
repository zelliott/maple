The zzso clones zzso for growth hormone zzso of an Indian major carp zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso library constructed from the zzso zzso extracted from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was amplified by zzso and used as probe to screen the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones zzso zzso were isolated and zzso The sequence contains zzso zzso region followed by an zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso region of 521 zzso The zzso shares about zzso identity with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity with zzso sequences of other zzso The zzso zzso of zzso has been cloned into expression zzso and zzso protein has been over expressed in zzso coli and zzso as a soluble zzso The zzso zzso was cloned into a zzso zzso with zzso injection of in zzso transcribed zzso zzso into zzso zzso has resulted in zzso expression confirming the cloned zzso zzso is functional in fish and the zzso element could be effectively used in fish for zzso expression of foreign zzso
