A gene zzso a carrier protein for zzso and zzso was cloned into zzso coli K-12 strain zzso by using the zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso is probably identical to a gene recently cloned from zzso coli B zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso DNA zzso containing zzso was zzso into the expression plasmids zzso and zzso and its product was identified by a zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter coupled system zzso zzso and zzso zzso Richardson, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso as a zzso with an apparent mass of 38 zzso A portion of the zzso zzso was associated with the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso was zzso It contained an open reading frame capable of zzso a highly zzso zzso of 395 zzso zzso containing four possible zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was increased zzso and zzso respectively, in strains containing zzso zzso zzso zzso was insensitive to the concentration of zzso and was inhibited by zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso is a structural gene for a carrier protein of the zzso zzso zzso transport zzso
