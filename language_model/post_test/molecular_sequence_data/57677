Seven zzso viruses were derived from a Scottish strain of zzso ill virus using a virus zzso zzso zzso zzso None of the zzso was neutralized and zzso zzso confirmed that they did not bind to this zzso Four zzso showed reduced mouse zzso compared with parent virus and two zzso failed to induce protective immune responses in mice challenged with virulent zzso encephalitis zzso The zzso with the lowest zzso showed poor or zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the envelope zzso gene of each of the seven zzso was determined and the deduced zzso acid sequence was compared with parent zzso For each zzso only a single zzso acid zzso change was detected and all the zzso acid zzso occurred within zzso acid positions 308 to zzso A change from the zzso acid zzso to zzso at zzso acid position zzso which represented a potential zzso site, was the most effective substitution in reducing mouse zzso The results demonstrate the importance of critical sites within the envelope zzso as zzso of virus zzso
