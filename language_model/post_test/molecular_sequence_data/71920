We investigated the role of zzso in the trafficking of human zzso receptors zzso and the effect of zzso trafficking on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells demonstrated a modest level of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, upon zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was dramatically enhanced and zzso of receptors to zzso coated zzso and zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was selectively promoted by zzso of zzso while zzso zzso zzso was only slightly zzso by zzso of either zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on the zzso of any zzso zzso either in the presence or absence of zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso of dominant negative zzso However, zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was not affected by either zzso or zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso growth factor, zzso acid, and zzso receptors was also zzso by zzso In zzso our data suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso is both zzso and zzso However, zzso does not appear to be required for zzso zzso growth factor, zzso acid, or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
