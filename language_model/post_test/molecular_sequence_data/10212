zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by binding of a zzso zzso analog results in the formation of a 20 A channel connecting the active site for zzso zzso in one domain with the zzso site in a second zzso This zzso channel permits transfer of the zzso intermediate between the two active zzso zzso of zzso may be a common mechanism for zzso zzso nitrogen transfer and for coordination of zzso at two distinct active sites in complex zzso The zzso A crystal structure of the active zzso of zzso also provides the first description of an intact active site for the zzso zzso family of zzso synthesis and salvage zzso Chemical assistance to zzso is provided primarily by the zzso and zzso by the zzso in the proposed zzso zzso Different zzso and zzso modes of zzso zzso binding to the zzso active site are revealed in the active zzso of the zzso and in a zzso zzso zzso
