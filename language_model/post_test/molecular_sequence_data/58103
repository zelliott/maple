The eighth component of human complement zzso is a serum protein consisting of three chains zzso zzso and zzso and zzso by three different zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are closely linked on zzso zzso whereas zzso is located on zzso zzso In the serum the beta zzso is zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso beta zzso suffer from zzso zzso infections such as zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification with primer pairs from the zzso zzso sequences was used to amplify all 12 zzso zzso zzso No difference regarding the zzso sizes was observed in a zzso zzso patient compared with a normal zzso zzso direct sequence analysis of all zzso zzso products from normal and zzso zzso individuals was carried zzso As a cause for zzso beta zzso we found a single zzso exchange in zzso 9 leading to a stop zzso An zzso zzso system was designed to detect the normal and the zzso zzso zzso Using this approach as well as zzso typing of the zzso zzso located in zzso 11, five families with 7 zzso zzso members were zzso The zzso was not found to be restricted to one of the two zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was observed in all families investigated and can therefore be regarded as a major cause of zzso beta zzso in the Caucasian zzso In addition, two zzso zzso patients were found to be zzso for the zzso zzso The molecular basis of the zzso without this point zzso also causing zzso has not yet been zzso
