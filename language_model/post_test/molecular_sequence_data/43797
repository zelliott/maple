The zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso A study of a barley zzso zzso indicated that zzso itself is transcribed by a zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular nature of the zzso zzso zzso and mechanisms of the zzso regulation of zzso expression have not been zzso Using an in zzso transient zzso system for gene expression in zzso the zzso region of zzso from zzso zzso in zzso of cultured zzso tobacco cells was zzso A series of deletion analyses of the zzso region indicated that there were two positive and one negative regulatory regions for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of zzso among several plant species revealed the existence of three zzso motifs in these zzso
