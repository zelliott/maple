The zzso cell envelope zzso of terminally differentiated human zzso is a complex structure consisting of several defined protein zzso The zzso is the most zzso component of the zzso due to zzso by zzso bonds as well as zzso bonds that are formed by the action of zzso zzso We have recently determined that zzso is the major component of zzso We now have isolated and characterized its gene and showed that it has a simple structure with a single zzso We also show that the zzso gene maps to position zzso which, zzso is similar to the location of the zzso and zzso zzso Human zzso in 26 zzso and consists of three long zzso rich sequence zzso that contain zzso peptides and which form the novel zzso loop zzso These are zzso by zzso rich zzso involved in zzso zzso The zzso zzso are thought to be involved in organization of zzso proteins and maintenance of the flexibility of the zzso By use of zzso zzso we have found that human zzso consists of two zzso size zzso due to sequence variations in the second zzso loop domain only, and these zzso segregate in the human population by normal zzso zzso Furthermore, there are multiple sequence zzso within these two size class zzso due to various deletions of 12 zzso (4 zzso zzso in the major loop of this zzso loop zzso In order to study the expression and role of zzso in the formation of zzso we have isolated and zzso zzso and zzso clones zzso the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
