In this zzso we present the determination of zzso sites in synthetic zzso formed by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso using zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso The zzso laser zzso analyses of the zzso zzso of the zzso having a zzso ratio of zzso zzso and zzso revealed only three zzso sites, on the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso gave complementary structural information and was shown to maximize the number of recognized zzso zzso Here, we report identification of 20, 27 and 33 zzso sites using zzso analysis of a series of synthetic zzso with a zzso ratio of, respectively, zzso zzso and zzso We also tentatively propose that all the zzso zzso zzso are located mainly near the outer surface of the zzso
