The molecular complex formed by the zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso This mechanism appears to be common to all types of cell, zzso that fundamental zzso modes of zzso regulation are exploited by zzso The present paper describes a novel zzso zzso regulated by zzso that contains an zzso domain and may thus constitute a zzso relevant zzso zzso site zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is particularly enriched in the cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso where it is localized to zzso zzso indicative of an important role in zzso zzso
