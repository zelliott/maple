A subset of patients harboring zzso in the zzso gene suffer from zzso zzso zzso zzso a familial heart disease that is not accompanied by any clinical signs of skeletal muscle zzso As the muscle zzso zzso of zzso is not expressed in these patients, the absence of skeletal muscle symptoms has been attributed to expression of the brain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso but not zzso muscles of zzso zzso The zzso mechanism of zzso B and zzso promoter zzso is not known but it has been suggested that the zzso muscle zzso from zzso 1, zzso may be important in this zzso Previous studies have shown that the presence of the zzso is essential for a significant increase in zzso B and zzso promoter activity in skeletal muscle cells in zzso Here, we demonstrate that the mouse zzso zzso promoter drives expression of a zzso reporter gene specifically to the zzso zzso cell layer but not to skeletal or cardiac muscle of transgenic zzso However, if the mouse counterpart of zzso is present in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoter is now activated in skeletal muscle, but not in cardiac zzso Our findings provide in zzso evidence for the importance of the zzso muscle zzso sequences in zzso the zzso zzso promoter in skeletal zzso Furthermore, they provide support for the model in which muscle zzso like zzso activate the zzso B and zzso promoters in skeletal muscle, but not in cardiac muscle, of zzso zzso
