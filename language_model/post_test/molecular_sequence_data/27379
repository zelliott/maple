The mouse zzso tumor virus zzso is unique from other zzso in having multiple viral zzso which can be regulated by hormones in a tissue specific zzso This unique property has lead to increased interest in studying zzso replication with the hope of developing zzso based zzso for human gene zzso However, it has recently been reported that related as well as unrelated zzso can zzso each other's zzso raising safety concerns towards the use of candidate zzso zzso for human gene zzso zzso using a trans zzso zzso we looked at the ability of zzso zzso to be zzso and zzso by an unrelated zzso zzso monkey virus zzso that has zzso assembly process similar to that of zzso 

Our results revealed that zzso and zzso zzso could be zzso by the zzso virus particles zzso suggesting that zzso between two genetically distinct zzso can take place at the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso could not be zzso further indicating a block at zzso events in the zzso life zzso To further confirm that the specificity of zzso was zzso by the packaging sequences zzso we cloned the packaging sequences of these viruses on expression plasmids that generated zzso zzso Test of these zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso was primarily due to the recognition of zzso by the zzso virus zzso 

The results presented in this study strongly argue that zzso and zzso are zzso in their ability to zzso each other's zzso suggesting potential zzso interactions among divergent zzso zzso proposing that these interactions are more complicated than originally zzso Furthermore, these observations raise the possibility that zzso and zzso zzso could also zzso providing zzso for exchanging genetic zzso
