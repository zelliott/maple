zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso preparation of zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso The complete coding sequence for zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso in length zzso zzso zzso zzso It showed zzso zzso at the zzso level and zzso zzso at the zzso acid level with bovine zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso shares common structural and functional elements with their counterparts from the other zzso zzso tree showed that zzso zzso was clustered into the zzso group, together with those of cattle and zzso which was distinct from the other zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate expression of the zzso in different zzso of sheep in order to determine the characterization of this zzso in zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso expression was detected at all the detected zzso with the exception of zzso
