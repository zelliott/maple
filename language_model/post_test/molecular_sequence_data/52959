A zzso acid region mediates the core zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso core domain is zzso in zzso zzso but in the presence of zzso three zzso segments are zzso Two of these putative structural zzso have been tested in different combinations with regard to zzso potential in zzso and binding capacity to the zzso in zzso The results show that whereas single zzso are not zzso active, any combination of two or three zzso is zzso with zzso zzso having the highest zzso However, proteins containing one, two, or three segments bind zzso and zzso zzso protein with similar zzso A single segment is thus able to bind a target factor but cannot zzso target genes zzso The results are consistent with models in which zzso zzso are comprised of short zzso zzso that allow multiple interactions with zzso Our results also suggest that an increased number of zzso may not result in zzso higher affinity but instead that the concentration of binding sites is increased, which gives rise to a higher association zzso This is consistent with a model where the association rate for zzso factor interactions rather than the equilibrium constant is the most relevant measure of zzso zzso
