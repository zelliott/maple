The zzso of zzso zzso with zzso acid gives a zzso zzso with * representing a zzso linkage connecting the two zzso zzso The incorporation of this zzso in zzso sequences show only moderately lowered zzso values when zzso with a complementary DNA relative to the unmodified DNA zzso zzso no zzso or zzso structure could be detected in DNA duplexes with an internal zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso causes complete stop on DNA zzso and on zzso III zzso
