The zzso zzso is broadly represented in a variety of environments as reported during microbial molecular zzso This study represents the first attempt to analyze the diversity of zzso in Roman zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso gene sequences were used to confirm the affiliation within different zzso zzso The results showed zzso belonging to zzso 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10 in the analyzed zzso The presence of zzso sequences in zzso zzso in Roman zzso suggest they could participate in this negative process, most likely in cooperation with other microbial zzso
