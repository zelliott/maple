In an attempt to develop a zzso experimental model of bacterial infection in zzso zzso oysters taken from very zzso zzso suffering natural mortality outbreaks were used in zzso trials under laboratory zzso From these trials, a collection of zzso strains was isolated from moribund and healthy zzso In a second step, strains were zzso tested for zzso by means of injection into healthy zzso This screening revealed a span of zzso among isolated strains from none to zzso When pooling injected zzso results suggest increased zzso zzso strains may have zzso action leading to higher zzso zzso mortality rates in experimental zzso Although the study initially aimed to develop a simple experimental model, a complex of interactions emerged between several bacterial strains during the zzso process in their zzso zzso zzso strains provide a suitable model of experimental disease for further studies and better understanding of bacterial interaction and zzso in zzso zzso
