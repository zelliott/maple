zzso sequence determination of the coat protein zzso of the alfalfa mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso revealed a small number of point zzso of which only one results in the replacement of an zzso zzso the zzso zzso at position 126 is replaced by an zzso zzso zzso transcribed in zzso from a zzso 7 zzso 4 clone directed the production in zzso of a zzso which shows the same altered zzso mobility in zzso gels as the zzso 7 coat zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso open reading frame revealed some base changes, but none of these lead to changes in the primary structure of the zzso The zzso sequence of zzso 7 zzso 3 was analyzed by zzso zzso At least three different types of zzso leader sequences were found, indicating considerable zzso at the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that the low abundance of zzso zzso particles in zzso 7 virus preparations might be due to malfunctioning of the zzso zzso of zzso 7 zzso 3 during zzso
