zzso zzso abound in zzso zzso including tandem repeats and regions with significantly biased zzso acid zzso We assessed the functional importance of zzso biased sequences in the zzso zzso using an evolutionary analysis of zzso zzso open reading frame zzso families from three zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso conservation was measured by the zzso acid sequence zzso and by the ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso between pairs of zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso families contained one or more long (at least 45 zzso zzso islands as defined by a measure based on the Shannon information zzso zzso islands were generally less zzso than zzso as a zzso on average they were 50% more variable in zzso acid sequences and 50% higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences outnumbered zzso zzso sequences by a ratio of 10 to zzso zzso differences between zzso zzso fit well to a selectively neutral zzso model of sequence zzso We therefore used the zzso model to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the 33 most zzso zzso sequences were overrepresented by those zzso zzso acid binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso While a few zzso zzso islands were known functional zzso zzso zzso zzso most were zzso We discuss how comparative zzso of closely related species can be employed further to distinguish functionally important, zzso zzso sequences from the vast majority of such sequences likely maintained by neutral zzso
