Previously, we found a zzso zzso zzso to be expressed at high levels in a zzso zzso breast cancer from a 41-year-old woman who also developed zzso zzso The sequence of a human zzso clone zzso selected by zzso zzso with zzso is reported zzso It was zzso identical to zzso and gave the same restriction fragments as total zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with a zzso truncated in zzso Data from two similar zzso clones and sequences found in zzso are also zzso zzso between them gave a rather complete picture of the zzso human zzso zzso zzso Work with zzso cell hybrids and FISH localized zzso to zzso 6, band zzso close to the zzso zzso The zzso role of zzso in breast cancer remains zzso Nevertheless, the zzso 20 zzso old zzso sequences enabled the definition of common and unique features of type A, B, and D zzso zzso In zzso zzso has no intervening sequences between zzso and zzso zzso unlike extant zzso zzso zzso possibly an ancestral zzso zzso of the zzso showed it to be present in all zzso zzso but gave a zzso tree different from trees made from other zzso zzso indicating a distinct zzso of zzso A zzso zzso sequence in the zzso zzso of some zzso envelope genes suggested a zzso zzso
