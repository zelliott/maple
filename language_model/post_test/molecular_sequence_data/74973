The zzso of zzso class II molecules in man is particularly evident when comparisons between population groups are zzso This study describes a zzso zzso commonly present in the American black zzso Unlike the Northern European population in which almost all zzso individuals are zzso approximately 50% of zzso American blacks express a zzso undefined zzso zzso zzso DNA restriction zzso analysis with the use of several unrelated individuals and an zzso family has allowed us to identify unique zzso zzso and zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso size, the zzso alpha genes of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are similar as are the zzso beta genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, a zzso beta gene zzso has been identified which is associated with some zzso zzso including the American black zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis has revealed a zzso alpha gene and a zzso beta gene which is similar to that previously described for a zzso zzso zzso It is zzso that zzso between zzso alpha and zzso beta genes and between the zzso and zzso zzso has generated the various zzso zzso and has played an important role in creating diversity in the zzso zzso
