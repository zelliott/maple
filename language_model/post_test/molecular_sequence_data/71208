We isolated and characterized the rat gene zzso zzso protein zzso a putative zzso G protein zzso The zzso start site was mapped by primer zzso The putative promoter region lacked a zzso sequence but contained a potential zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were identified by zzso of rat brain zzso potentially generating either the full length or an zzso zzso Only the full-length protein was zzso in all mouse zzso zzso zzso of the conceptual translation product of the rat zzso gene with those from human and zzso clones shows a striking conservation in the zzso region of zzso from these zzso This contrasts with the relatively low degree of zzso between zzso and zzso in this region, suggesting a functional role for this portion of the zzso zzso Finally, we mapped the human zzso gene by zzso analysis of zzso cell hybrids and the Stanford zzso radiation hybrid zzso The human zzso gene zzso is located on zzso 9, linked to the zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso zzso
