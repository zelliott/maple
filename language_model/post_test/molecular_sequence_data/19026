Human activity has been shown to considerably affect the spread of dangerous zzso and pathogens zzso zzso strict regulations of international trade exist for particularly harmful zzso zzso zzso zzso which is not subject to regulations, is a plant pathogen frequently found on a broad range of host species, both in natural and artificial zzso It is supposed to be native to Europe while resident populations are also present in the zzso We characterized a zzso sample of zzso from Europe and the US and conducted zzso migration, and population genetic analysis of sequence and zzso data, to determine the pathways of spread and the demographic history of this zzso We found zzso zzso populations to be moderately diverse but not geographically zzso High levels of gene flow were observed within Europe and zzso from Europe to the zzso zzso analyses revealed a signal of a recent expansion of the global zzso zzso zzso Our study shows that zzso zzso has most likely been spread around the world by nursery trade of diseased plant zzso In particular, zzso zzso was introduced into the US from zzso International trade has allowed the pathogen to colonize new environments and/or zzso resulting in population zzso
