The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind zzso through their zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso proteins through the zzso zzso repeat in their zzso zzso zzso Here we identify zzso as a zzso for the zzso of all these zzso and map the binding site on the zzso zzso to zzso type III repeats, which zzso to the zzso zzso site on zzso In the zzso domain, the zzso zzso is flanked by zzso growth factor zzso repeats and a complement regulatory zzso zzso In zzso these are subject to alternative zzso To investigate if these zzso zzso affect the zzso zzso zzso zzso we produced zzso proteins corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins containing the zzso zzso showed different affinities for various zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso The presence of an zzso motif enhanced the affinity of interaction, and in particular the zzso zzso containing both zzso motifs had significantly higher affinity for zzso such as zzso and zzso The zzso for this zzso zzso was shown by reverse zzso to be expressed in human zzso Our findings suggest that alternative zzso in the zzso zzso domain may be a mechanism for modulating interactions and zzso zzso zzso
