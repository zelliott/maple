The zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso which have a zzso in zzso of the outer chain attached to the zzso core zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso 11, zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso neutral zzso released by zzso and zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso causes a complete loss of the zzso outer chain, although the PA zzso zzso and zzso in which one or two zzso zzso attached to the zzso zzso zzso core zzso zzso were also zzso Analysis of the delta zzso zzso strain zzso released from total cell zzso revealed that the delta zzso zzso zzso eliminates the zzso attached to the core and accumulates predominantly a single zzso zzso species zzso suggesting a potential use of this strain as a host cell to produce zzso containing zzso high zzso type zzso The delta zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulated zzso and zzso in total cell zzso confirming the lack of outer chain addition to the incomplete zzso zzso and the leaky zzso of the zzso zzso All the results suggest that the zzso gene encodes an zzso that is functional in the initiation of zzso outer chain addition to the zzso core zzso zzso and zzso in zzso
