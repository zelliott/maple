The zzso gene of zzso zzso has been zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contained twelve highly zzso zzso and showed 50, 47, 44 and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso soybean zzso zzso human colon zzso protein zzso and a putative open reading frame zzso downstream of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, in the aligned zzso zzso lacking zzso were viable and displayed no obvious decrease in their growth zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed that zzso exists as a single copy in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso produced a zzso transcript which was highly expressed under sulfur zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to turn over with a zzso of approximately 15 zzso which may contribute to the regulation of zzso zzso function, and reached its zzso level in about 22 h after zzso
