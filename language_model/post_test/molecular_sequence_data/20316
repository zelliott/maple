The aim of this study was the zzso zzso and zzso characterization of a zzso zzso zzso identified in a child with zzso zzso 

Lens material from surgery was collected and used for zzso zzso zzso DNA was prepared from blood obtained from the zzso and her zzso zzso amplified DNA fragments were zzso and characterized by restriction zzso zzso protein distribution was studied by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of functional channels was assessed by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso examination showed that the zzso suffered from bilateral white, diffuse zzso but the parents were free of lens zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso product produced from lens zzso showed that the zzso was zzso for a zzso transition at position zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the exchange of zzso for zzso at position 247 of zzso zzso The zzso was confirmed in the zzso DNA, but it was also present in the unaffected zzso When expressed in zzso cells, both wild type zzso and zzso formed gap junction zzso Both zzso and zzso induced gap zzso currents in pairs of zzso zzso 

Although the zzso substitution has previously been suggested to cause zzso our zzso zzso and zzso data suggest that this zzso more likely represents a rare silent, zzso zzso
