We report the design, zzso and characterization of a short zzso trapped in a zzso zzso This zzso zzso was zzso by a zzso zzso which was obtained by replacing an zzso zzso main chain i and i + 5 hydrogen bond with a zzso zzso Our studies highlight the nucleation zzso as a key factor contributing to the relative instability of the zzso and allow us to estimate fundamental zzso transition parameters for this zzso
