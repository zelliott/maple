A novel zzso human zzso zzso species D was isolated from the stool of a zzso patient in Japan and genetic characterization was performed by sequencing variable regions between zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso base gene and zzso 1 and 2 in the zzso gene showed zzso identity with that of the recently identified zzso Although we observed greatest identity for the entire zzso gene sequence with that of zzso we noted even greater similarity between the partial zzso sequence of the zzso region 4 and that of zzso Furthermore, the zzso gene and early region 3 sequences were completely identical to that of zzso These results suggest that the strain is a novel zzso related to zzso and zzso
