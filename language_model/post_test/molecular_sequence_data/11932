zzso zzso serves as a zzso for several zzso For zzso zzso virus 1 zzso zzso virus, and bovine zzso 1, zzso C zzso have been shown to mediate the binding to zzso zzso zzso It has been assumed that zzso C of zzso zzso plays a similar role in zzso entry, but this has not been established zzso We first determined, using zzso zzso that zzso is a zzso zzso To examine the role of zzso in zzso infection, we constructed a zzso deletion zzso zzso In contrast to results obtained for the other alpha zzso we found that the zzso virus showed no loss in specific binding activity zzso zzso or specific zzso zzso compared to the parental zzso zzso Moreover, while zzso zzso show a marked lag in the rate of viral zzso the zzso virus did zzso We did find that zzso like zzso protects virus from zzso zzso These results suggest that, in contrast to zzso zzso does not play the key role in viral zzso The major role of zzso may be to protect virus from zzso zzso We speculate that zzso differences in the contribution of zzso to viral binding may contribute to zzso differences in cell zzso
