zzso zzso is a key zzso for the induction of zzso immune zzso Recently, functional zzso in zzso zzso were found to be associated with zzso to several zzso zzso Similarly, variation in zzso might be involved in zzso to Crohn's disease zzso a chronic inflammatory zzso disorder associated with high zzso zzso We searched for additional zzso in zzso and zzso a large cohort of CD zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso were tested for zzso zzso were analyzed using the zzso transmission zzso test zzso and by zzso zzso A novel zzso was strongly associated with differential expression of zzso However, no association with zzso to CD was seen for this and other zzso The high level of conservation is consistent with the key regulatory role of zzso The lack of association with zzso makes it unlikely that this gene is directly involved in the zzso to zzso
