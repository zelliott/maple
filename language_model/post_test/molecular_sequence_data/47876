We have investigated the role of zzso zzso in zzso organizing center zzso positioning using zzso interference zzso in zzso zzso to zzso the product of the zzso heavy chain gene zzso Analysis with zzso differential interference contrast zzso and indirect zzso revealed that zzso migration and zzso separation failed in one cell stage zzso zzso zzso These zzso were also observed when the zzso components zzso or zzso were depleted with zzso Moreover, in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to remain in proximity of the male zzso When zzso heavy chain function was diminished only partially with zzso zzso separation took place, but orientation of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for multiple aspects of zzso positioning in the one cell stage zzso zzso zzso In conjunction with our observation of zzso zzso distribution at the periphery of zzso these results lead us to propose a mechanism in which zzso zzso anchored on the nucleus drives zzso zzso
