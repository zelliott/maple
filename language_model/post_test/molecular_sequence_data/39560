zzso analyses of the beta zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of barley zzso zzso zzso revealed that mature protein was not zzso zzso processed and suggested the correction of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the data bank that was confirmed by DNA zzso Six zzso of the zzso zzso beta zzso with zzso ranging from zzso to zzso were resolved by two-dimensional zzso zzso Mass zzso analyses indicated that the six zzso differ in their zzso degree, which was confirmed by the disappearance of more zzso forms after incubation with the protein zzso zzso Six zzso and/or zzso were detected as zzso among them the zzso zzso that is also zzso in the beta zzso of human zzso The results are discussed in relation with the proposed regulation of the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso
