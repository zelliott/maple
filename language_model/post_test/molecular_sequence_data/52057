Human serum was found to contain an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso production by human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso of the serum activity by zzso exchange zzso molecular sieve zzso and zzso zzso zzso yielded material zzso pure with a molecular weight of 17 zzso by zzso zzso acid sequencing revealed the zzso inhibitor to be zzso zzso a zzso zzso There was a zzso reduction in the production of spontaneous zzso activity in zzso zzso after zzso with 10 zzso zzso zzso was subsequently found by zzso to inhibit zzso zzso production by cells of the human zzso leukemia line zzso by zzso zzso zzso whereas a less striking but still significant zzso of zzso zzso beta production was also zzso zzso of zzso zzso correlated with increased zzso zzso synthesis in both zzso cells and zzso Furthermore, zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso functions by zzso processing of newly zzso zzso for zzso This novel zzso effect of zzso on the production of zzso activity suggests a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso
