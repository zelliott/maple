A zzso DNA fragment, which may function as an zzso point to the nuclear zzso for human zzso 1 and 2, also functions as an autonomously replicating sequence zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In the present report we show that this DNA zzso contains both bent DNA and an zzso rich region which appear to be associated with the zzso zzso More interestingly, DNA sequence analysis shows that the spatial distribution of these features is zzso similar to that found in the zzso zzso zzso
