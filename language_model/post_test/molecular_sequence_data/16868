The zzso zzso play a critical role in a great number of cellular adhesive interactions during the immune zzso We describe here the isolation and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso common to the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence reveals a zzso protein with 80, 81, 83, 96 and zzso identity with its zzso zzso human, bovine and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso sequences emphasizes the functional importance of the zzso zzso zzso domain, and included metal zzso zzso zzso motif and confirms that of the zzso zzso Moreover, comparisons of zzso versus zzso zzso sequences allowed the identification of 16 potential zzso sites that could be held responsible for the unique zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso is known to be the major respiratory disease among zzso whereas it is not zzso for other zzso an observation that has been attributed to a specific interaction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the data provided here offer the possibility to explore new avenues in studies based on the zzso model and provide key information for future studies aimed at zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
