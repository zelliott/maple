To examine the role of the zzso gamma chain in the assembly and zzso of this zzso zzso we zzso a series of zzso zzso with truncated gamma zzso terminating between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso from altered zzso complementary zzso in cultured Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso of the culture media demonstrated that only those zzso with gamma chain longer than zzso zzso were zzso and that the concentration of zzso decreased with the length of the gamma chain, from zzso zzso for normal zzso to zzso zzso for gamma zzso zzso zzso of cell zzso showed that all zzso gamma chains were zzso although the levels varied zzso For zzso longer than zzso zzso levels decreased with length but remained near zzso In contrast, expression of the 4 zzso with zzso zzso or less was about zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso level was independent from chain zzso Western zzso analyses showed that zzso expressing zzso with zzso zzso or more contained species comparable to the known zzso in zzso zzso including zzso For shorter zzso these zzso were not zzso We conclude that zzso near the zzso of the gamma chain are essential for zzso zzso and more specifically, that zzso is zzso We propose that the loss of zzso zzso zzso the structure of gamma chain, preventing assembly of zzso and zzso zzso essential zzso in the assembly of normal zzso
