The zzso factor zzso is one of the most studied components of the translation machinery zzso to its abundance and possible role in other cellular zzso zzso mediates the correct zzso of the zzso on the A site of the zzso in a zzso zzso We have previously described an zzso DNA sequence in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso In this paper we describe the DNA sequence and zzso organization of zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed that zzso is organized as a 2 zzso tandem zzso The zzso probe recognized a zzso zzso zzso from zzso in Northern zzso A clone containing the first copy and a half of the zzso tandem repeat was isolated by screening a zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that the isolated clone zzso presented the same zzso profile as that of a zzso zzso The partial sequencing of clone zzso spans zzso zzso in zzso which has two open reading frames separated by a putative zzso zzso The zzso and the predicted zzso sequence of the first coding region presented approximately zzso identity with other zzso zzso zzso The sequence also displayed the four consensus motifs corresponding to the zzso site zzso zzso zzso and zzso Computer analysis of the sequence of both coding regions revealed three divergent zzso which generated two changes at the zzso acid zzso One was found to be located in the zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso gene sequence showed potential regulatory elements such as zzso tracks, zzso sequences and zzso forming zzso
