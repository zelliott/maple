We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso protein from tobacco crown zzso tumor zzso which was induced by the zzso genes of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso transcripts was high in zzso callus as well as in zzso zzso In normal tobacco plants, the transcript levels were high in roots, and low in zzso whereas virtually no transcript zzso was found in flowers or zzso In leaves, however, zzso transcript zzso was induced by mechanical zzso These results show that zzso expression is zzso regulated and induced by zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso encodes a putative 16 zzso zzso that is apparently composed of 3 structural zzso two zzso regions separated by a zzso zzso The zzso zzso displays similarity to a number of proteins in its zzso zzso but is unique in its zzso domain which, in the corresponding zzso of the zzso zzso are mostly zzso Since both zzso and zzso proteins are generally reported to be mostly cell wall zzso the zzso gene may be involved in shoot and root formation and in zzso process by zzso cell wall zzso
