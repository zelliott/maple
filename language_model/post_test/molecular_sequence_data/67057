In humans, zzso of the zzso receptors zzso and zzso are responsible for numerous zzso However, signaling mechanisms involving these receptors are less well characterized in zzso than in zzso To obtain zzso relationship information on human zzso and zzso we expressed these human receptors in zzso Schneider 2 zzso We show here that, as its zzso counterpart, human zzso is able to repress the signaling zzso in the absence of zzso zzso In response to zzso human zzso is able to release zzso zzso zzso suggesting that human zzso is expressed in a functional state in zzso zzso We also provide experiments showing that human zzso when expressed in Schneider cells, is able to bind the zzso zzso suggesting that it is expressed in a native zzso zzso Furthermore, contrary to zzso zzso human zzso does not interact with the zzso zzso 2 and thus is unable to zzso the zzso zzso Moreover, cell surface fluorescent labeling suggest that human zzso is enriched at the Schneider 2 plasma membrane in response to zzso These results suggest that human zzso is expressed in a functional state in zzso cells, where it zzso a regulation of its zzso comparable with its zzso zzso Thus, we propose that the upstream part of the zzso zzso involving zzso interaction with zzso regulation of zzso by zzso and zzso enrichment at the plasma membrane is highly zzso between zzso and zzso in contrast, signaling downstream of zzso is zzso
