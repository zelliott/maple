zzso is an essential zzso motor protein that binds to zzso or membrane proteins and the zzso and promotes the zzso or membrane integration of these zzso zzso is subject to a protein zzso form of regulation, zzso its translation is elevated during zzso zzso A novel mechanism that promotes this regulation involves zzso pausing within the gene upstream of zzso zzso The zzso zzso pause prevents formation of an zzso zzso that normally blocks zzso zzso zzso The duration of this pause is controlled by the rate of zzso of nascent zzso which in turn depends on its signal zzso and a functional zzso We characterized the zzso zzso signal zzso and found that zzso within the zzso region specifically affect the zzso zzso pause and zzso regulation, while zzso in the zzso core region affect zzso zzso as well as zzso pausing and zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis of the 3' end of zzso allowed us to identify a zzso region that is required to promote the zzso pause that appears to be operative at the zzso zzso Together, our results provide direct support for the zzso zzso pause model of zzso regulation, and they pinpoint key sequences within zzso that promote this important regulatory zzso
