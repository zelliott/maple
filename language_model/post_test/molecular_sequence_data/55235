Human zzso zzso is a multitasking zzso binding protein involved in zzso regulation by recognizing zzso and zzso elements placed at the zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso The modular architecture of the zzso which consists of two zzso zzso recognition motifs zzso in tandem spaced from a third one by a zzso shuttling zzso controls the stability of many zzso targets, as well as their translation zzso A higher level of regulation comes from the fact that both zzso and function of zzso are strictly regulated by zzso Here, we report how the zzso stability of zzso is decreased by the presence of zzso indicating that both zzso are interacting in zzso In addition, even though no significant structural changes are observed among zzso of zzso zzso mimicking zzso species, slight differences in stability are zzso which may explain the zzso binding activity of zzso
