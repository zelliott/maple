zzso zzso is a multilayered dead tissue protecting plant mature stems and roots and plant healing zzso from water loss and zzso zzso cells are made impervious by the deposition of zzso onto cell zzso Although zzso deposition and cork formation are essential for survival of land plants, molecular studies have rarely been conducted on this zzso Here, we address this question by combining suppression zzso zzso together with zzso zzso using as a model the external bark of the cork tree zzso zzso from which bottle cork is zzso A suppression zzso zzso library from cork tree bark was prepared containing 236 independent zzso zzso showed significant zzso to database sequences and they corresponded to 135 unique zzso Out of these zzso zzso were classified as the main pathways needed for cork zzso Furthermore, zzso could be related to regulatory zzso To identify genes more specifically required for zzso zzso cork expressed sequence tags were printed on a zzso and subsequently used to compare cork zzso to a zzso tissue such as wood zzso Based on the results, a list of candidate genes relevant for cork was zzso This list includes genes for the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso such as components of the fatty acid zzso complexes, zzso cassette zzso and zzso among zzso Moreover, a number of regulatory genes induced in cork have been identified, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors with putative functions in zzso identity and cork zzso
