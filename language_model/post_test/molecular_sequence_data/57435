Both human and bovine zzso zzso 2 (the second zzso have been zzso separately with human zzso zzso and the structures of these zzso complexes have been determined and refined (R zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso resolution using X-ray zzso zzso The zzso interact with zzso at a site that has previously been proposed to be the zzso binding zzso The latter is a highly zzso surface near the zzso zzso of zzso abundant in zzso and zzso zzso These form salt bridges with zzso side chains of zzso zzso zzso unexpectedly, the negative groups of the zzso zzso to an enlarged zzso center of the zzso binding site of zzso binding zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The zzso motif is zzso in zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso center of the zzso binding site region has an zzso zzso zzso but zzso is zzso However, the folding of zzso 2 is different from that of zzso zzso 1 and other zzso the second outer loop possesses a distorted zzso zzso and the hairpin zzso of the second inner loop zzso at zzso and zzso by 60 zzso zzso is located on a turn of the zzso which causes it to project into zzso space in the zzso zzso complex, thereby devastating any zzso of the zzso center of the zzso binding zzso Since zzso 2 has not been reported to bind zzso it most likely has a different inherent folding zzso for the second outer loop, as has also been observed to be the case with zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The movement of the zzso zzso is most likely a zzso change accompanying zzso which reveals a new zzso zzso flexibility in zzso The zzso zzso complex is only the second cassette zzso domain structure to be determined for a zzso blood protein and only the third zzso interaction to be described among such zzso the others being factor zzso without a zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso 1 with a zzso domain and a zzso
