The zzso gene of zzso zzso was zzso zzso and localized to the right arm of zzso zzso close to the zzso It encodes a predicted zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a calculated molecular mass of 36 zzso and an zzso point of zzso zzso open reading frames very similar to zzso are present in two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene product has significant sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the large zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso itself zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso do not functionally replace each other, since an zzso strain is completely zzso Judging from its predicted mass, zzso point and zzso acid zzso zzso does not zzso to any zzso component zzso identified so far in zzso zzso and also differs from all known zzso proteins by the low zzso usage bias of its zzso
