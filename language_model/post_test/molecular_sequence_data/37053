The T box and S box zzso termination control systems are widely used for control of gene expression in zzso bacteria, but are rare in zzso zzso Both of these systems can be recognized in zzso data because of high conservation of primary sequence and structural zzso The T box system regulates a variety of zzso zzso zzso while the S box system is dedicated to genes involved in zzso zzso While both systems involve gene regulation at the level of premature termination of transcription, the molecular mechanisms employed are very zzso In the T box system, expression is induced by stabilization of an zzso structure in the leader by interaction with the zzso zzso zzso this prevents formation of the competing zzso zzso allowing synthesis of the full-length zzso zzso of zzso leader features results in loss of zzso In the S box system, the zzso form of the leader is the more stable zzso A competing zzso must be stabilized by an unknown factor during growth in zzso to prevent formation of the zzso thereby allowing formation of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso leader elements results in zzso zzso
