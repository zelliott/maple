zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze zzso at zzso zzso centers and are important for drug, zzso and zzso zzso zzso In human liver, human zzso zzso is the most abundant zzso zzso and is known to contribute to the zzso clearance of a variety of clinical zzso The purpose of the current study was to express and compare the dog zzso zzso zzso to zzso A full-length zzso zzso was obtained from liver by reverse zzso chain zzso Using a zzso expression system in zzso zzso insect cells, zzso was expressed to protein levels of zzso zzso as determined by liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso catalyzing zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso showed values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Human zzso was observed to catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso with respective zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso being the highest zzso zzso Finally, Western zzso analysis indicated protein expression levels of zzso in pooled dog liver and lung zzso to be 27 and 9 zzso zzso In zzso zzso appears to be a functional zzso expressed at appreciable levels in liver, but one with some kinetic properties that are substantially different from its human zzso zzso
