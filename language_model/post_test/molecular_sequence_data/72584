zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso reduce zzso zzso zzso by as much as a factor of 300 on zzso III but less than a factor of 4 in the intervals tested on zzso I and zzso To gain insight into the function of this zzso (or zzso specific zzso of zzso we have cloned and zzso the zzso zzso zzso crosses with zzso disruption zzso placed the zzso gene 6 zzso from zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso accumulated zzso at 2-3 h after induction of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis of these transcripts revealed eight zzso The spliced zzso is predicted to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids with only very limited zzso to reported zzso The transient zzso of zzso transcripts and the zzso of zzso zzso suggest that the novel zzso gene product acts early in zzso to activate zzso zzso on zzso zzso
