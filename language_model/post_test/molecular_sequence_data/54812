In zzso zzso the zzso zzso a zzso zzso affects the expression level of the zzso gene through binding to its promoter zzso The zzso promoter region zzso zzso to zzso has been found by in zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso results and in zzso analysis to be important for the DNA binding of zzso zzso supplementation prevented the DNA binding of zzso to the zzso promoter region and triggered an increase of the zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso analyses of the zzso promoter region found zzso critical for zzso binding zzso located at position zzso C at position zzso and A at position zzso of the zzso zzso in that zzso Another zzso zzso zzso was also demonstrated to bind to the zzso promoter zzso This binding was zzso to positions zzso to zzso on the zzso zzso zzso has only one putative binding domain located at positions zzso to zzso but this region exactly overlapped with the binding region located from positions zzso to zzso for the binding of zzso within the zzso zzso thus, if zzso bound with the zzso promoter first, the binding of zzso was not observed in this zzso However, if zzso bound to the binding domain located at positions zzso to zzso first, zzso could bind other binding sites located at positions zzso to zzso within the zzso zzso Finally, this study suggests that zzso can affect zzso binding to the zzso promoter region, as protein binding is dominated by the protein most able to do zzso
