zzso perceive a large number of airborne chemicals as zzso components mainly through the zzso It is thought that detection of the zzso by specific receptors is followed by a zzso zzso that zzso the zzso organ from accumulating zzso In zzso a number of zzso zzso are involved in the metabolism of foreign chemicals zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serve to transfer reducing zzso to zzso zzso We isolated zzso and zzso clones coding for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The largest zzso of zzso zzso in length contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids that includes the putative zzso zzso zzso is a single copy gene as shown by zzso Southern zzso and maps to the zzso map position zzso on the second zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso sequences revealed a gene structure that is split into at least six zzso The zzso protein sequence is almost identical with that of house fly and remarkably zzso when compared to zzso and zzso zzso expression is high in zzso and antennae as compared to adult heads, adult bodies and zzso High expression in antennae may reflect the putative function in zzso zzso
