zzso zzso breakdown as well as increased expression in cancer cells and tumor zzso zzso cells make zzso zzso 2 zzso an attractive target for cancer zzso By taking advantage of zzso properties, an zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso alone is extremely toxic to cells and zzso immediate cell zzso but becomes inactive when coupled with zzso The incorporation of the zzso target sequence into the zzso was used as a means for targeting tumor zzso In zzso the zzso zzso showed strong zzso activity against cancer cells with high zzso zzso zzso 145 prostate cancer cells and zzso zzso cancer zzso The zzso exhibited very little zzso activity against normal zzso that displayed low zzso zzso These data demonstrate the zzso specificity of the zzso zzso In zzso the size of tumors injected with the zzso zzso was significantly smaller as compared to zzso zzso zzso due to its tumor targeting capabilities as well as its zzso properties in zzso and in zzso the zzso zzso displays the potential for use in cancer zzso
