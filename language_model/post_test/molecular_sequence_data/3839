All publicly accessible microbial zzso databases were searched for the occurrence of genes zzso proteins zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso in order to reveal the capability of zzso not belonging to the zzso to zzso zzso Among 65 zzso zzso genes zzso to zzso were found in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso a protein zzso to zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso I zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso to zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso 587 was amplified by zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso downstream of the zzso promoter and introduced into zzso zzso The zzso strain of zzso coli expressed zzso activity at up to zzso zzso protein and accumulated zzso to up to zzso of the cellular dry matter, indicating that zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso 587 is functionally zzso In zzso zzso strain zzso 587 itself, zzso accumulated to up to zzso of the total protein under zzso conditions, and zzso zzso activity was zzso which indicated the function of zzso as a storage compound in this zzso
