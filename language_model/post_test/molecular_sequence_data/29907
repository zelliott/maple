A full-length zzso zzso of zzso disease virus has been zzso zzso zzso in zzso by means of a zzso zzso promoter inserted in front of the zzso led to the production of infectious particles upon zzso of zzso zzso These particles were also found to be highly infectious for primary bovine kidney cells as well as for baby zzso The difficulty in cloning the zzso disease virus zzso tract in zzso coli was zzso by joining two separate cloned parts, representing the S and L fragments of the zzso and, in a second step, inserting a zzso zzso zzso sequences of up to 25 zzso zzso did not lead to the production of zzso zzso containing zzso tracts long enough to permit virus replication were first established in zzso zzso One of these zzso could also be maintained in zzso coli and was used to produce infectious zzso in zzso The length of the zzso sequence in this zzso zzso was 32 zzso However, the zzso tracts of two zzso viruses found in zzso zzso cells were 60 and 80 zzso long, zzso zzso mechanisms leading to the enlargement of the zzso tract during virus replication are zzso
