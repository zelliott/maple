This study has assessed the zzso efficacy of five zzso zzso peptides in an in zzso zzso zzso The five zzso zzso peptides and controls of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso zzso were administered to primary cortical zzso cultures prior to zzso acid zzso All five zzso zzso peptides and zzso provided significant zzso from zzso acid induced zzso cell zzso zzso acid exposure induced zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cultures, with zzso zzso of zzso reduced by administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso peptides did not reveal the presence of any secondary zzso however two peptides shared zzso zzso sequence zzso As a result, truncated sequences were designed and zzso to identify the active region of the zzso All truncated peptides were significantly zzso following zzso acid and zzso zzso We have shown for the first time the zzso efficacy of full-length and truncated zzso zzso peptides in zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso The identification of therapeutic targets, such as the zzso complex, is an important step for the development of pharmaceuticals to reduce zzso loss in disorders with a prevalence of zzso cell death such as zzso cerebral zzso and traumatic brain zzso
