A general strategy is described for the de zzso design of zzso In this strategy the sequence locations of zzso and zzso zzso were specified zzso but the precise identities of the side chains were not constrained and varied zzso This strategy was tested by constructing a large collection of synthetic genes whose protein products were designed to fold into zzso bundle zzso Each gene zzso a different zzso acid zzso but all sequences shared the same pattern of polar and zzso zzso zzso of the expressed proteins indicated that most of the designed sequences folded into compact zzso zzso Thus, a simple zzso code of polar and zzso zzso arranged in the appropriate order can drive zzso chains to collapse into zzso zzso zzso
