The zzso are widely zzso downstream targets of the activated zzso zzso that have been directly implicated in many aspects of zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso stability, and consequently play an essential role in regulating cell shape, migration, zzso and zzso We have determined that the single closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for several aspects of zzso including maintaining the integrity of the zzso cortex, zzso zzso of nurse cell zzso zzso of nurse cell contents into the zzso establishment of zzso zzso and the trafficking of zzso zzso zzso These defects are associated with abnormalities in zzso zzso dynamics and appear to be zzso by multiple downstream zzso of activated zzso that have previously been implicated in zzso zzso regulates at least one of these targets, the membrane zzso zzso zzso via a direct zzso that is required to promote zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso The collective zzso defects associated with zzso zzso reveal its essential role in multiple aspects of proper zzso formation and suggest that zzso defines a novel class of zzso zzso that function as key regulators of several distinct zzso processes required for proper tissue zzso
