Although human DNA zzso beta zzso pol zzso shows zzso identity with rat DNA pol beta at the zzso acid level, it is zzso expressed in zzso zzso coli relative to the rat zzso The mechanism of this suppression was zzso zzso protein labeling and steady state zzso analysis showed that mature human DNA pol beta protein is relatively stable in zzso coli and the levels of human and rat DNA pol beta zzso were comparable indicating that the human DNA pol beta expression is suppressed at the zzso zzso By systematic expression analysis of a number of zzso genes composed of human and rat zzso two strong zzso suppression regions were mapped in the human DNA pol beta zzso one was named zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso at position 4 and the other, termed zzso is located between zzso 153 and zzso Since substitution of the rat zzso zzso with synonymous zzso showed strong effects upon the expression level, we propose that the zzso zzso at the zzso coding region plays a role in modulating zzso
