The evolutionary adaptations of functional genes to life at low temperatures are not well zzso in marine and fresh water zzso zzso has been shown to affect the functional characteristics of fish muscles, with changes in the zzso of zzso and zzso activity being associated with zzso heavy chain zzso zzso composition and the structure of the surface loop zzso Two zzso products spanning zzso 1 and 2 of a zzso gene from an Antarctic zzso zzso zzso were zzso and compared with those of a temperate zzso zzso zzso slow and fast zzso from lobster zzso zzso and a cold water zzso zzso zzso revealing specific differences between the species, possibly related to zzso type and habitat zzso The loop 2 region from zzso zzso zzso was cloned and used for Northern analysis of total zzso from the other zzso The cloned zzso zzso zzso specifically to a zzso transcript, in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso for lobster slow zzso and zzso zzso to muscle zzso from all species, demonstrating that a distinct zzso zzso is expressed in the Antarctic zzso as opposed to the temperate zzso The zzso and zzso sequence differences in loop 2 region suggest that this may be a site for muscle adaptation to enable function at the low temperatures found in the Southern zzso
