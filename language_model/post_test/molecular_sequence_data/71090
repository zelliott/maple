The zzso zzso zzso A structural gene zzso of the zzso important zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and disrupted to prevent zzso retention in the zzso compartment and to redirect the zzso flux into the zzso Cloning was achieved by zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso derived form zzso sequences of the zzso proteins from zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso comprises zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence is highly similar to that of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with 89, 87, and zzso identity, respectively, and shows about zzso identity to the zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso however, where disruption of the zzso gene was zzso zzso and to zzso zzso where viable zzso could not be isolated, disruption of the zzso gene in zzso zzso did not cause a lethal zzso zzso of the zzso gene led to complete zzso of zzso into the medium instead of retention in the zzso zzso as observed in the wild zzso
