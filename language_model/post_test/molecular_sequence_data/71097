An zzso Group VI zzso zzso zzso zzso that does not require zzso for zzso has recently been cloned from three zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso has been cloned from human zzso lines that contains a zzso acid insert not present in the zzso zzso but human cells have not previously been observed to express zzso active zzso zzso other than the zzso zzso We have cloned zzso species that zzso two distinct zzso zzso from human pancreatic zzso zzso and a human zzso zzso zzso One zzso is an zzso protein (short zzso of human zzso zzso and the other an zzso protein zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso are also observed in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are both zzso active in the absence of zzso and inhibited by a zzso zzso suicide zzso but zzso is activated by zzso whereas zzso is zzso The human zzso gene has been found to reside on zzso 22 in region zzso and to contain 16 zzso represented in the zzso zzso zzso 8 is not represented in the zzso transcript, indicating that it arises by an zzso mechanism of alternative zzso The zzso acid sequence zzso by zzso 8 of the human zzso gene is zzso and shares a consensus motif of zzso with the zzso middle zzso zzso of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso of zzso species zzso two active zzso zzso with distinguishable zzso properties in two different types of human cells demonstrated here may have regulatory or functional implications about the roles of products of the zzso gene in cell zzso zzso
