zzso zzso of zzso modified peptides and proteins is of key importance in the understanding of an array of biological zzso zzso is a zzso modification that regulates many cellular zzso zzso of zzso depend on whether a single zzso or zzso chain is added to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso through which the zzso chain is formed is also critical for biological zzso zzso methods are therefore required to identify sites of zzso zzso both in the target protein and in zzso Here, we demonstrate the suitability of zzso transform zzso zzso resonance zzso mass zzso in conjunction with activated zzso electron capture zzso zzso zzso or infrared zzso zzso zzso for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was generated in zzso zzso zzso of zzso species contain modified peptides in which the zzso zzso zzso zzso are retained on the modified zzso zzso zzso infusion zzso zzso of the digest and comparison with an in zzso digest enables identification of modified peptides and therefore sites of zzso Fifteen sites of zzso were identified in zzso and four sites in zzso zzso were confirmed by zzso zzso or zzso The zzso modification is stable and both tandem mass zzso techniques are zzso providing extensive sequence coverage and retention of the modification on backbone zzso
