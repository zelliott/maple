Previously, we reported the high resolution zzso structure of the hairpin zzso structure formed by the zzso strand of the insulin zzso of repeat zzso zzso located upstream of the human insulin zzso Here, we report structural studies on the zzso strand of this insulin zzso First, we show by high resolution zzso that zzso forms a hairpin zzso with zzso zzso pairs zzso to as the hairpin zzso 340 zzso distance constraints uniquely define the nature of hairpin folding and the pattern of zzso zzso Second, we show by one-dimensional zzso zzso and molecular modeling studies that zzso forms an zzso folded hairpin with zzso zzso zzso Third, we demonstrate by in zzso replication studies that several such hairpin zzso are present in long zzso zzso zzso even in the presence of their complementary zzso Finally, we discuss structural and biological significance of the hairpin zzso formed by the zzso strands of the insulin zzso
