zzso zzso zzso and zzso are members of the zzso zzso of nuclear receptors and mediate most zzso of zzso zzso Several naturally occurring zzso zzso of each zzso have been identified in the human brain, yet the biological significance of these zzso zzso in the brain remains zzso In the present study, we exploit the unique structural differences of the human zzso zzso zzso to determine the functional significance of individual zzso zzso in the zzso We previously established that full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso activity in zzso cells in the absence of zzso By contrast to the zzso zzso zzso the human zzso zzso zzso used in the present study contain varying length zzso of zzso 8, which encodes for the zzso zzso Our results reveal that, in zzso cells, each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activated promoters zzso by a zzso zzso response element and zzso promoters zzso by zzso zzso sites via zzso zzso From these data, we conclude that the zzso zzso the zzso region and F domain, is not essential for the zzso properties of human zzso Taken together, these studies show that zzso zzso zzso are zzso active and also provide novel insight into the contributions of the functional zzso of zzso towards zzso zzso zzso at various promoters in zzso zzso
