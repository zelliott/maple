zzso evolution is believed to be male driven because the greater number of germ cell divisions per generation in males increases the opportunity for errors in DNA zzso Since the Y zzso zzso replicates exclusively in zzso its genes should also evolve faster than X or zzso zzso In addition, zzso the overall zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso is of great importance as a large alpha m implies that zzso zzso events play a relatively small role in zzso A small alpha m suggests that the impact of these factors may, in fact, be zzso In order to address this problem, we have analyzed the rates of evolution in the zzso zzso common zzso genes from three different zzso human, and zzso The zzso genes were chosen because the X and Y copies are highly zzso well zzso in evolution, and in all probability functionally zzso zzso comparisons and analysis of synonymous zzso in approximately zzso of the zzso coding region of the zzso genes reveal that the zzso copies are evolving approximately zzso times faster than their X zzso The zzso zzso ratio alpha m was estimated to be zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso evolution is male zzso However, the ratio value is far smaller than suggested in earlier works, zzso significance of zzso zzso events in zzso
