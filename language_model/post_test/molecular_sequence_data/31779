A zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits extraordinary zzso resistance and produces zzso not only zzso but also zzso The zzso and zzso zzso exhibited the same zzso zzso that is, they exhibited the zzso activity characteristic of a zzso zzso their heat zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso and very high zzso zzso In addition, zzso gene analysis indicated that the zzso possessed the sole zzso 1 zzso gene corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso into the zzso zzso In addition to zzso and zzso zzso the inner circumference of the cells showed the zzso of zzso in the zzso growth phase, which was observed by zzso zzso using an zzso against the zzso zzso of the zzso The cells demonstrated higher zzso activity in the zzso growth phase than in the exponential growth zzso The zzso localized in the inner circumference can be zzso by treatment with zzso zzso Thus, the localized zzso is not tightly bound to the inner circumference of the cells and may play a role in the zzso defense of the cells under low zzso zzso
