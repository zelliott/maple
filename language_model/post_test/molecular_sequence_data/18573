In this work, we have developed a method that uses zzso exchange zzso of zzso of zzso coupled with mass zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso in zzso This method relies on differences in zzso reaction rates of zzso and zzso His zzso Using several model peptides and zzso we find that all zzso His zzso have substantially lower zzso reaction rates in the presence of the zzso The vast majority of zzso His zzso undergo no significant changes in zzso reaction rates when their zzso is compared in the presence and absence of zzso Using this new approach, we then determined the zzso binding site of zzso a protein associated with zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso of His zzso is a promising new method for identifying zzso zzso in zzso
