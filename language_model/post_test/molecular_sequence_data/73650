The zzso zzso sequences of nine strains of green sulfur bacteria zzso were determined and compared to the four known sequences of zzso and to sequences representative for all zzso zzso The sequences of the zzso strains were consistent with the secondary structure model proposed earlier for zzso zzso strain zzso zzso values zzso zzso and zzso values zzso zzso indicate a close zzso zzso among the green sulfur zzso As a group, these bacteria represent an isolated branch within the zzso zzso In zzso a similar zzso does not always reflect a close zzso zzso While zzso zzso is a zzso trait of zzso significance, gas zzso formation occurs also in zzso related zzso zzso composition is not an indicator of zzso zzso since very closely related species contain different zzso and zzso Two different molecular zzso techniques for the rapid differentiation of zzso species were zzso The zzso zzso fragments of several species could not be separated by zzso zzso gel zzso In contrast, all strains investigated during the present work gave distinct zzso patterns when dispersed repetitive DNA sequences were used as targets in zzso The latter technique is, therefore, well suited for the rapid screening of isolated pure cultures of green sulfur zzso
