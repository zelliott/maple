The zzso zzso was originally identified as an abundant zzso zzso of chemically transformed zzso human zzso This abundant protein is normally expressed only in zzso suggesting that it may play a role in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso T zzso by high-resolution two-dimensional gel zzso produced eight internal zzso zzso An zzso probe corresponding to one of the zzso was used to clone zzso from transformed human zzso that zzso the seven other zzso predicted for human zzso zzso and characterization of two cloned zzso revealed the existence of two zzso but closely zzso zzso of zzso which is expressed in zzso and transformed zzso and zzso which is expressed in normal cells of solid zzso and transformed zzso The zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a diverse variety of human tumor cell lines, suggesting that it may be involved in the zzso process of some solid human zzso
