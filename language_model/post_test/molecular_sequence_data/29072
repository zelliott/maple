zzso expansion of B cells and plasma cells, producing zzso against zzso zzso can be found not only in different zzso diseases, such as peripheral zzso zzso but also in zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso of chronic zzso zzso zzso as well as in zzso conditions including zzso zzso of zzso significance zzso About 50% of patients with zzso have serum zzso against peripheral nerve zzso but the specific role of these zzso remains zzso The aims of the study were to zzso and zzso zzso B cell clones from peripheral blood of patients with zzso by selection of cells bearing specific membrane zzso for zzso protein zzso using beads coated with zzso zzso magnetic beads were used for selection of cells, which subsequently were transformed by zzso zzso The specificity of zzso zzso was tested by zzso Two of the clones producing zzso zzso were selected and zzso The magnetic selection procedure was repeated and new clones zzso The cells were zzso positive, although the expression declined in zzso over zzso The zzso zzso were of zzso zzso The zzso belonged to the zzso gene family with presence of zzso zzso The zzso reacted with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and showed no evidence for zzso in contrast to other zzso zzso clones included in the study as zzso The expanded clones expressed zzso and zzso which is compatible with properties of zzso zzso The zzso selection technique was successfully used for isolation of zzso protein zzso zzso The cell lines may provide useful tools in studies of zzso zzso zzso and zzso diseases, including aspects of zzso by these cells followed by T cell zzso
