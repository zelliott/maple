zzso zzso of type I zzso zzso is a promising approach for the generation of new structural derivatives of zzso natural zzso A target of this approach has been to change the zzso units incorporated into a zzso backbone to alter the structure and activity of the natural zzso One limitation to these efforts is that only four zzso units were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso carrier protein zzso The chemical attributes of these zzso units are quite similar, with the exception of the potential hydrogen bonding interactions by the oxygen of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the incorporated zzso units are not easily modified by using simple chemical approaches when zzso zzso is coupled to zzso zzso We recently proposed the existence of two additional zzso units, zzso and zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso These zzso units offer unique possibilities for zzso zzso and zzso chemistry because of the introduction of free zzso and zzso zzso into a zzso zzso Here, we present the zzso and mass spectral evidence for the formation of these zzso zzso This evidence shows the formation of zzso zzso units for zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso formation involves zzso typically found in zzso zzso zzso
