Two zzso clones representing zzso highly expressed in pea root tips, were isolated by zzso differential zzso zzso protection analyses showed different patterns of expression of these two messages in several pea zzso zzso analysis showed that the first zzso zzso has zzso zzso with a previously isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it has an additional 30 zzso at the 3' end which is absent in zzso suggesting possible multiple zzso sites in the same zzso The second zzso zzso encodes a deduced zzso zzso protein of 185 zzso acids with an zzso point of zzso The putative zzso domain of the zzso protein showed zzso zzso identity with zzso zzso of 28 zzso pea zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It has 9 repeating motifs of zzso In the zzso domain, there are four zzso repeating motifs of zzso which may be involved in zzso zzso and zzso Southern zzso analysis of nuclear DNA shows that zzso belongs to a zzso zzso
