zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso rod considered an important emerging pathogen among zzso zzso zzso patients worldwide and among zzso zzso This increased prevalence remains zzso and to date no environmental zzso has been zzso The aim of this study was to identify potential reservoirs of zzso zzso in hospital, zzso and outdoor environments and to compare the zzso with clinical zzso From 2011 to 2012, 339 samples were collected in zzso university hospital, in healthy zzso homes in the Dijon area, and in the outdoor environment in Burgundy zzso water, zzso and zzso We designed a protocol to detect zzso zzso in environmental samples based on a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso supplemented with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso testing, zzso analysis by zzso gel zzso and zzso sequencing were performed on the zzso A total of 50 strains of zzso zzso were detected in hospital zzso zzso domestic (9 zzso and outdoor (8 zzso samples, mainly in hand washing sinks, showers, and zzso Most of them were resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso sequencing revealed a wide diversity among the zzso with 35 zzso and 18 zzso of zzso Interestingly, 10 zzso from hospital environment were zzso related to clinical zzso previously recovered from hospitalized patients, and one domestic isolate was identical to one recovered from a zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso is commonly distributed in various environments and therefore that zzso patients or zzso patients are surrounded by these zzso
