zzso is a widely expressed protein that is very large in size and that has all the attributes of a zzso zzso and organizing element of the zzso It displays a zzso structure, versatile binding activities, and zzso zzso that enable it to strengthen cells against mechanical stress zzso Moreover, zzso gene defects in zzso cause zzso zzso zzso zzso a severe skin blistering disease with muscular zzso Here we report the analysis of the zzso organization of the rat zzso gene and the identification of several different zzso on the zzso zzso We show that of 35 coding zzso identified, 4 serve as alternative first zzso zzso into the same successive zzso 2, which is the first of 7 zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso protection mapping of transcripts containing 3 of the identified 4 alternate first zzso revealed their zzso in rat zzso zzso cells and in a series of different rat zzso that we zzso zzso variations in expression levels of first zzso indicated the possibility of zzso promoter zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso 31 zzso 3 zzso which encodes the entire rod domain of the zzso were identified in a variety of rat zzso This study provides first insights into a complex zzso gene regulatory machinery with similarities to that of zzso
