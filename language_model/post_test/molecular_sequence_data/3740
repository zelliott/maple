The essential zzso zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso III zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso box binding protein zzso and zzso are the other zzso of this zzso zzso zzso analysis defined three segments of zzso that are essential for zzso A central segment, zzso zzso acids zzso to zzso was found to be zzso and cells making zzso that was split within this segment, at zzso acid zzso are zzso zzso of zzso conditional viability by zzso zzso and zzso identified functional interactions of specific zzso segments with zzso and zzso zzso A zzso deletion near essential segment I was zzso lethal with zzso of zzso a dominant zzso zzso in the second zzso repeat motif (out of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso The analysis also identifies a connection between zzso and zzso processing of Pol III zzso zzso zzso library screening identified zzso as the specific zzso zzso of very slow growth at 37 degrees C due to deletion of zzso zzso acids zzso to zzso zzso zzso a Pol III transcript, is the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which trims zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso of zzso was found to be zzso in zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso with the highly resolved Pol III zzso system in zzso was also diminished when zzso zzso Delta zzso replaced zzso zzso Physical interaction of zzso P with zzso was demonstrated by zzso and pull-down zzso
