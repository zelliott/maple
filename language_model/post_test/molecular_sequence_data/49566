Previously, we isolated a zzso zzso capable of binding to a zzso zzso protein and stimulating protein zzso activity of the zzso protein in zzso Both of them were found to zzso in the plasma zzso and cell zzso Here, we report the zzso effects of zzso zzso expressed zzso in the cultured carrot and zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso 121 zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso At early zzso stage, the transgenic callus grew rapidly compared to the wild callus in both zzso Cell proliferation of in zzso cultured zzso carrot callus was apparently affected with the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso from zzso bean and zzso bean were cloned by zzso and zzso The zzso sequences deduced from the zzso sequences are zzso among zzso species, particularly, the sites of zzso zzso are highly zzso This zzso sequence reflects the importance of zzso bonds required for the zzso zzso to perform its zzso Three zzso structure of the zzso zzso determined by zzso zzso suggests that this zzso is a zzso scaffold containing three zzso and the specific binding activity to the zzso protein and zzso effect on the protein zzso could be attributed to the spatial arrangements of zzso zzso at the zzso surface of zzso zzso of zzso zzso The importance of these zzso for the zzso zzso to bind to the zzso protein was indicated by zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and the zzso protein is involved in cellular signal zzso of the zzso
