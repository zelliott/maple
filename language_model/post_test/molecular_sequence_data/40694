G zzso receptors zzso are critical factors in regulating zzso zzso infection and zzso in zzso In this study, various zzso strategies were applied to identify zzso proteins from the zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The putative zzso were distributed over 13 classes, and significantly, three of those represented novel classes of zzso proteins in zzso The three novel zzso had high levels of identity to their counterparts in higher zzso including Homo zzso The numbers of zzso proteins in the two zzso zzso were similar to those seen in other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso acid receptors were divided into three different zzso indicating that differences among the zzso existed not only among different classes but also within zzso In conclusion, the identification and zzso of zzso and their zzso to some well-studied zzso will be an important starting point for future research in zzso zzso
