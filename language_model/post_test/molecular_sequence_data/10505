zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which has been associated with zzso such as arthritis and zzso The assignments of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso determination of the secondary structure and analysis of zzso relaxation data of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso human zzso zzso zzso are zzso It is shown that zzso is composed of a zzso consisting of five zzso in a mixed parallel and zzso arrangement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This is nearly identical to the secondary structure determined from the refined X-ray crystal structures of inhibited zzso The major difference observed between the zzso solution structure of zzso zzso and the X-ray structures of inhibited zzso is the dynamics of the active zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the lack of information in the zzso zzso zzso and the generalized order parameters zzso determined from zzso zzso zzso and zzso data suggest a slow zzso exchange for zzso zzso the active site zzso B, zinc zzso zzso and the nearby loop zzso and a high mobility for zzso zzso in the vicinity of the active site for zzso zzso In contrast to the X-ray structures, only the slow zzso exchange is lost in the presence of an zzso
