The basic zzso zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso regulate cellular differentiation and proliferation in diverse cell zzso While looking for proteins that bind to zzso and zzso by the zzso interaction zzso we isolated the rat zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been localized to the zzso layer of the zzso and to distinct zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are zzso similar and zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso expression was regulated by growth factor stimulation in cultured rat zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso bound to zzso and zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso The C zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso specifically with a zzso acid domain in zzso that is distinct from the zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso and zzso specifically increased the promoter activity of a zzso reporter construct containing an E box and did not affect the zzso activity of the reporter zzso zzso appears to be a novel zzso partner of zzso that regulates zzso protein zzso
