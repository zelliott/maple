According to data in zzso a gene zzso SARS spike protein zzso 1 zzso was zzso After zzso with an zzso sequence zzso the gene was cloned into the zzso zzso to produce zzso On confirmation of the expression of zzso protein by indirect zzso zzso zzso after the zzso of zzso into zzso cells, the DNA vaccine was repeatedly zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso T zzso were analyzed by flow zzso zzso to evaluate T zzso immune responses, the zzso responses of T cells were evaluated by zzso T zzso zzso zzso and the level of zzso in zzso from zzso mice was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the counts of zzso zzso and zzso T zzso were increased, that the T zzso immune responses showed zzso zzso and that zzso was significantly induced with DNA vaccines zzso and zzso at zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These results are promising for the protective zzso of zzso
