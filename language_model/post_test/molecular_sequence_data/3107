The zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso determines zzso zzso as a hypersensitive reaction zzso on bean zzso carrying the zzso resistance gene and also zzso zzso on other zzso The zzso protein carries an embedded consensus zzso motif and is zzso in bacteria and certain plants to yield fragments of about 6 and 28 zzso We investigated plant recognition and type III zzso zzso in zzso by constructing three zzso truncated and two zzso zzso carrying zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which lies adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso The peptides were either delivered to plant cells by zzso or were expressed zzso in zzso via the zzso zzso or zzso virus zzso The 63 zzso terminal zzso were required for type zzso zzso from zzso strains to the plant, but were partially zzso for zzso recognition following in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in differential zzso zzso in two different zzso zzso of bean and abolished zzso processing in zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso proteins zzso zzso in resistant bean hosts and in tomato but zzso no reaction in zzso zzso
