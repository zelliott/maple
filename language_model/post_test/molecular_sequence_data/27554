The involvement of the storage zzso zzso zzso in zzso has been increasingly reported in many zzso zzso analysis has shown that group 3 zzso zzso are zzso to zzso Similar zzso have not been identified in zzso zzso Our aims were to characterize group 3 zzso in zzso zzso and to investigate their significance in zzso 

zzso of zzso p 3 and zzso p 3 from zzso zzso were cloned and expressed in zzso zzso Native zzso p 3 zzso p 3) was zzso from spent growth medium with an affinity column zzso of zzso Biological activities of zzso p 3 were compared with zzso p 3 in terms of zzso activity, zzso activity and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso p 3 encodes a zzso acid zzso zzso and acquires zzso activity after removing the zzso and zzso zzso p 3 is a zzso protein with equivalent zzso zzso but weaker zzso activity than that of zzso p zzso A limited level of zzso has been found between zzso p 3, zzso p 3 and zzso Eight of 10 zzso zzso individuals showed zzso zzso release after triggering with zzso p zzso 

Our studies demonstrate that zzso p 3 is a frequent zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Since zzso p 3 displays equivalent biological activities as zzso p 3, the role of group 3 zzso can be studied using zzso p 3 to zzso the zzso effects and diagnostic applications of zzso p zzso
