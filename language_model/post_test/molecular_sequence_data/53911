Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated zzso of type III collagen by zzso A zzso in a cellular model of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that a mechanism of gene zzso zzso might be responsible for collagen zzso in zzso zzso resulting from chronic zzso zzso 

We zzso in the same cellular model: zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso promoter activity by zzso of zzso zzso with zzso containing promoter fragments of different length fused to a reporter zzso zzso expression of zzso factors by western zzso zzso zzso zzso binding by gel zzso zzso with nuclear extracts from zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoter to verify the role of a short DNA segment as zzso responsive zzso 

zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso zzso that was paralleled by a stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was comparable in zzso and zzso zzso The target region was first limited to a 178 zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso By gel zzso utilizing several zzso that covered the whole length of zzso we detected a factor able to bind the promoter DNA zzso 31) in nuclear extracts after 3 h treatment with zzso The binding was absent in zzso cells and it was not detected when a zzso zzso was introduced in zzso zzso Finally, the same substitution zzso at the site of binding of this factor abolished the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso Some zzso factors, whose potential binding sites are included in the above promoter fragment, were induced by zzso treatment either soon (3 zzso or late zzso zzso after treatment and were detected by western zzso zzso 

zzso zzso the synthesis of type III collagen by stimulating a zzso leading to zzso of zzso promoter and zzso of zzso zzso A short promoter fragment, zzso to the zzso start site, is the target of zzso zzso
