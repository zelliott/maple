In zzso analysis, the zzso domain is one of the most frequently detected zzso in the zzso zzso In fact, it is more abundant in zzso than in other zzso zzso However, zzso analysis might zzso ambiguous zzso of the closely related zzso and zzso motifs as zzso zzso by zzso Thus, we set out to define an ordered set of zzso zzso zzso by evaluating predicted zzso on the basis of recent structural zzso 

zzso of the zzso with a current zzso release predicts zzso zzso zzso We evaluated each detected domain and as a result eliminated 59 false zzso The remaining zzso zzso were grouped by cluster analysis and according to their zzso zzso We further defined novel patterns for additional zzso analyses of the zzso They were based on recent structural data that enable discrimination between the related zzso zzso and zzso zzso These patterns allow us to predict with different degrees of certainty whether a particular domain is indeed likely to form a zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso have a significant potential to form a zzso zzso zzso Many of these zzso zzso overlap with predicted zzso zzso however, the zzso domain signature mostly zzso Thus, the abundance of zzso zzso in zzso has been significantly zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso defines groups of zzso which frequently show significant similarity outside the zzso zzso These groups document a common evolutionary origin of their members and potentially represent genes of overlapping zzso
