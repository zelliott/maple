The zzso pathogens have the unique capacity to sense the host cell environment and to respond to it by zzso in gene expression and protein zzso zzso analysis of bacteria exposed directly to the host cell milieu might thus greatly contribute to the zzso of processes leading to bacterial adaptation and proliferation inside the host zzso Here we have performed a global zzso analysis of a virulent zzso zzso zzso zzso strain during its zzso cycle within the zzso zzso cell line zzso using the zzso zzso of bacterial proteins with zzso and zzso in various periods of zzso The two-dimensional gel analysis revealed zzso bacterial zzso changes in which 64 identified proteins were zzso expressed in comparison to controls grown in tissue culture zzso Nevertheless, zzso of zzso with zzso gamma before in zzso infection decreased the number of detected zzso in protein zzso Thus, these zzso data indicate the zzso zzso ability to adapt to the zzso hostile environment that is, however, diminished by prior zzso gamma treatment of host zzso
