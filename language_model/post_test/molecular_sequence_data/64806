zzso proteins destined for the zzso or zzso zzso are typically zzso the zzso serving as a targeting signal for the zzso body zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is an integral membrane protein that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso S zzso the zzso zzso and other proteins containing exposed zzso zzso within their zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso provides an alternative zzso mechanism for zzso zzso and other zzso zzso is a zzso protein with a zzso motif that binds the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso It can thus act as a specific zzso linking zzso to its zzso Like zzso the zzso system zzso polar zzso zzso also controls the zzso targeting of a zzso zzso and a zzso plasma membrane zzso and together with the zzso retrieval zzso zzso it protects cells from zzso We suggest that zzso has a wide role in the quality control of membrane zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of human zzso binding protein zzso which may therefore have similar zzso
