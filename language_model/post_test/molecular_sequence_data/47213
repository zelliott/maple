zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate the zzso zzso and viability of zzso by modulating their signaling zzso By using the differential display zzso we have cloned a putative zzso zzso which is predominantly expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This zzso termed zzso zzso is a zzso zzso form of a human zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso includes an approximately zzso acid zzso domain, the major (3 zzso zzso zzso predicts a unique zzso untranslated region and truncated (8 zzso zzso zzso domain with a zzso zzso region and single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functional approximately zzso and approximately zzso zzso which are most abundant in normal zzso zzso B cells and decreased or absent in zzso center B cells and zzso zzso diffuse large zzso zzso Because zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso zzso B cells, the zzso effects on zzso progression were zzso When multiple stable zzso sense, zzso and zzso only zzso zzso were grown in reduced serum and synchronized with zzso zzso sense clones exhibited markedly increased zzso zzso Taken together, these data zzso zzso in the growth control of specific zzso zzso
