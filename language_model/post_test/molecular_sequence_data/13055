To define DNA regions involved in the zzso expression of the zzso light zzso zzso we generated transgenic mice bearing different zzso zzso A zzso human zzso zzso including zzso base pairs of zzso sequences contained sufficient elements for nervous system expression in transgenic zzso zzso of zzso 1 and 2 from this zzso DNA zzso resulted in reduced levels of zzso expression in the cortex, while deletion of zzso 3 had little zzso Both zzso 1 and 2 could act independently as enhancers to zzso zzso expression of the zzso heat shock promoter zzso fused to zzso in transgenic zzso The zzso zzso promoter zzso base zzso was found to contain elements for directing zzso expression of either the zzso reporter gene or an zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison revealed that zzso 1, zzso 2, and the zzso human zzso promoter all contain an zzso zzso zzso present in a variety of genes expressed in the nervous zzso
