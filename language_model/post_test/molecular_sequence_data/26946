zzso utilizing zzso protein zzso typically require an zzso to enhance immune response in the zzso However, the consequences of zzso binding to zzso on both the zzso and long-term stability of the protein remain poorly zzso In our companion paper zzso et zzso in press, J zzso zzso we characterized the effects of binding to zzso on the zzso and zzso stability of three zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the current study, we evaluated the effect of binding to zzso zzso aluminum zzso on chemical stability of these zzso during long-term storage in zzso zzso We developed methods that employ zzso zzso mapping in conjunction with zzso mass zzso zzso maps were developed for the proteins for a vaccine zzso of zzso as well as a zzso zzso vaccine zzso This method provided high sequence coverage for the proteins in part due to the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso method during sample preparation, and was also successfully zzso to evaluate the chemical integrity of zzso zzso protein zzso We found that all three of the zzso proteins were susceptible to degradation via both zzso and zzso In many cases, such reactions occurred earlier with the zzso protein zzso when compared to the proteins in control samples that were not bound to zzso Additionally, some chemical modifications were found in the zzso protein zzso but were not detected in the zzso solution zzso Our studies indicate that binding to zzso zzso can impact the chemical stability and/or the chemical degradation pathways of protein during long-term storage in zzso zzso Furthermore, the methods we developed should be widely useful for assessing chemical stability of zzso zzso protein zzso
