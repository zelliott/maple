zzso protein C zzso exerts its zzso zzso role by zzso zzso of the blood zzso zzso Va and zzso To identify regions on the surface of the light chain of zzso that mediate zzso activity, 10 synthetic peptides were prepared and tested for their ability to inhibit zzso zzso zzso The synthetic zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso in normal and protein zzso plasma with 50% zzso at zzso zzso zzso In a system using zzso zzso factors, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso of factor Va in the presence or absence of zzso with 50% zzso at 50 zzso zzso However, zzso had no effect on zzso zzso activity or on the reaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited factor zzso zzso activity in normal plasma as well as in a zzso zzso in the presence of factor Va with 50% zzso at 5 zzso and 50 zzso zzso respectively, under the zzso zzso The zzso had no significant effect on factor zzso or zzso zzso activity and no effect on the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso suggesting that it does not directly inhibit these zzso active zzso zzso was shown to bind directly to immobilized factor zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
