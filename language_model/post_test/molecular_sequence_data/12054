zzso zzso T cells are present in the circulation of normal individuals without zzso zzso In zzso animal models, stimulation of these zzso T cells in the presence of zzso molecules zzso results in T zzso zzso disease, whereas zzso stimulation generates regulatory zzso T cells that abrogate disease zzso Thus, zzso in the brain of zzso T cells by zzso with zzso molecules may be a critical event in the zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso a putative zzso disease of central nervous system zzso zzso We investigated the expression of zzso and zzso molecules in a panel of 41 zzso characterized zzso specimens from 15 zzso and 10 control cases using zzso reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso In four cases, vascular zzso zzso with inflammation were compared with zzso plaques from the same zzso We observed increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in acute zzso zzso particularly from early disease cases but not in inflammatory zzso zzso zzso was localized predominantly to the zzso in zzso inflammatory cuffs but not the zzso In contrast, zzso was expressed predominantly on zzso both in zzso zzso of varied time duration and in inflammatory zzso These findings indicate that an early event in the initiation of zzso involves zzso of zzso and zzso resulting in conditions that zzso stimulate T cell zzso and induction of T helper zzso immune zzso
