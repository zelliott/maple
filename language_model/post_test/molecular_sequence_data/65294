A zzso zzso slender rod, measuring approximately 10 zzso long and approximately 1 zzso zzso isolated from the gastric zzso of a cat and designated strain zzso was subjected to a zzso zzso zzso Despite its apparent lack of zzso zzso the zzso showed a zzso motion by means of multiple zzso zzso located at both ends of the cell and by a zzso zzso coiled around the zzso zzso zzso grew preferably on zzso culture plates or on very moist zzso zzso forms predominated in cultures older than 4 days as well as in growth obtained on dry zzso zzso The strain grew at 37 degrees C, but not at 25 or 42 degrees C and exhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, the novel isolate was identified as a member of the zzso zzso and showed about 98 to 99 % sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso five highly related species previously detected in the zzso or canine gastric zzso zzso profiling of strain zzso using zzso revealed a pattern different from those of other zzso species of zzso gastric zzso Additionally, the zzso and zzso gene sequences of strain zzso were different from those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso It is thus proposed that strain zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a novel species within this zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
