The current measures to control zzso disease zzso include zzso movement control and slaughter of infected or susceptible zzso One of the difficulties in controlling zzso by vaccination arises due to the substantial diversity found among the seven zzso of zzso virus zzso and the strains within these zzso zzso vaccination using a single vaccine strain may not fully zzso against all strains within that zzso and therefore selection of appropriate vaccines requires zzso comparison of the field virus and potential vaccine viruses using relationship zzso zzso zzso zzso of this approach are that zzso relationships among field viruses are not zzso as comparisons are only with potential vaccine zzso Furthermore, inherent variation among vaccine zzso may impair zzso of one-way relationship zzso Here, we used zzso zzso to zzso and zzso the zzso relationships among zzso zzso A zzso aiming to improve the understanding of zzso zzso evolution and the scope and reliability of vaccine zzso Our results suggest that predicting zzso difference using genetic sequence alone or by geographical location is not currently zzso We found zzso lineages in one region that were genetically similar but zzso zzso Nevertheless, by comparing zzso distances measured from the zzso maps with the full zzso zzso zzso we identified a specific zzso acid substitution associated with an zzso mismatch among field viruses and a commonly used zzso vaccine strain, zzso
