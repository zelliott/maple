The guinea pig is widely used as a model to study zzso zzso such as neurodegenerative zzso zzso dual function as an zzso inhibitor and a zzso regulator is crucial not only for ordered development but its zzso seems crucial also under disease zzso However, data on the expression and function of the guinea pig zzso protein zzso are currently zzso 

Here, we here report the cloning and functional characterization of zzso The respective zzso was cloned from zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso for a protein of zzso zzso displays a high zzso to the human and zzso zzso especially in zzso critical for function, such as binding sites for zzso passenger complex zzso proteins and the nuclear export signal zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso is more related to humans than to zzso zzso expression studies of a zzso fusion confirmed its dynamic zzso zzso analogous to the human and zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso was predominantly zzso and accumulated in the nucleus following export zzso with zzso B zzso A typical zzso protein zzso during zzso was observed for zzso zzso experiments together with genetic knockout demonstrated that the zzso is essential for the zzso and regulatory role of zzso during cell zzso In zzso protein interaction zzso further demonstrated its zzso with human zzso and its interaction with human zzso zzso zzso zzso studies show that zzso can fully substitute for human zzso as an zzso inhibitor and a zzso zzso zzso zzso and western zzso were employed to detect zzso expression in guinea pig zzso Besides its expression in zzso zzso such as zzso and liver, we also found zzso in terminally differentiated cell zzso zzso zzso was zzso also in the zzso suggesting a potential role for zzso in the auditory zzso 

We provide the first experimental evidence for the expression of zzso in the guinea zzso As zzso can substitute for known functions of human zzso the guinea pig model will now also allow investigating zzso zzso role and to test zzso potential therapeutic zzso
