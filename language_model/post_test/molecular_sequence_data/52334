A zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso utilizing zzso affinity zzso and zzso The molecular weight of the zzso was estimated to be approximately 25,000 by zzso gel zzso This zzso which we propose to call zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was characterized zzso Using human zzso hormone zzso and zzso of zzso zzso acid and zzso acid, we found a marked difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso although both zzso showed higher zzso for zzso bonds than for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso the zzso The findings clearly indicate that zzso can be classified as a zzso zzso To zzso the complete primary structure and precursor of zzso its gene was cloned from the zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso sequence was zzso Taking the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso into consideration, the clones zzso a mature zzso of 222 zzso zzso which follows a zzso of 94 zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso and zzso to zzso Its key physical and chemical characteristics were the same as those of the zzso zzso zzso was confirmed to be a zzso specific for zzso acid, and the primary structure deduced from the zzso sequence was found to be identical with that of a zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso being different from zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which consist of 268 and 188 zzso zzso zzso
