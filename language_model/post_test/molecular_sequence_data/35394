We determined the complete sequence and organization of the zzso of a putative member of the zzso zzso tentatively named Pepper yellow leaf zzso virus zzso zzso has a wider host range than zzso zzso virus zzso and has a close zzso relationship with zzso zzso zzso virus zzso (both zzso The extracted viral zzso was subjected to zzso next-generation sequence analysis and used as a template for reverse zzso zzso which was followed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso includes zzso zzso zzso six open reading frames zzso which is typical of the zzso zzso Comparisons of the deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso 2-4 and zzso indicate that there are high levels of similarity between these sequences to zzso 2-4 of zzso zzso and to zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso and Pepper vein zzso virus zzso contain sequences that point to a common ancestral zzso The zzso zzso which is located at zzso zzso which encodes the viral coat protein zzso may explain the zzso sequences found in the zzso of the pepper infecting viruses zzso and zzso Two additional regions unique to zzso zzso and zzso were identified between zzso zzso and zzso zzso 5) and between positions zzso and zzso in the 3' zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed three unique regions zzso with no similarity to other members of the zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso and zzso suggest that the zzso of these viruses occurred through putative zzso zzso between zzso zzso a common zzso resulting in the emergence of zzso a novel pathogen with a wider host zzso
