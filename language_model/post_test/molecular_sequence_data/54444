In a microbial zzso cell zzso hydrolysate produced by zzso treatment of wheat straw was used for hydrogen production during selective recovery of zzso The average zzso production rate was zzso zzso zzso zzso and equivalent to a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso The microbial community in the zzso zzso was adapted by establishment of zzso bacteria of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso During the process, zzso of the chemical oxygen demand was removed as hydrogen at zzso zzso The total energy production yield was zzso considering the energy content in the consumed compounds and the cell zzso of zzso zzso The highest hydrogen production was equivalent to zzso zzso zzso zzso and was obtained at pH zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso compounds in the liquor was obtained by zzso addition of the hydrolysate during simultaneous production of hydrogen from consumption of zzso for the zzso and zzso of the fatty zzso Final calculations showed that hydrolysate produced from 1 zzso wheat straw was upgraded by means of the zzso to 22 g hydrogen zzso zzso 8 g zzso and 9 g zzso for potential zzso in zzso zzso
