The study of human zzso zzso in cell culture has been hindered because of the difficulty in zzso the three-dimensional structure of the zzso on which the virus depends to complete its life zzso Additionally, the study of genetic zzso in the zzso zzso and its effects on the viral life cycle are difficult using the current method of zzso zzso cloned zzso zzso into zzso human zzso zzso zzso because of the limited life span of these zzso Unless the zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso extends the life span of the cell, analysis of stable zzso becomes zzso In this study, we have used zzso cells, an immortalized human zzso zzso cell line, to recreate the zzso life zzso This cell line exhibits many characteristics of the zzso zzso including the ability to zzso and terminally differentiate in an zzso raft culture zzso Because of their similarity to zzso zzso these cells were tested for their ability to support the zzso life zzso The zzso cells could zzso maintain two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, when the zzso cell line was zzso zzso with zzso and cultured using the zzso raft culture system zzso it sustained the zzso life zzso Evidence for the productive stage of the zzso life cycle was provided zzso DNA in zzso zzso demonstrating zzso DNA amplification in the zzso layers of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso showing the presence of zzso protein in the zzso layers of the zzso and electron zzso indicating the presence of virus like particles zzso in zzso from cells in the differentiated layers of the zzso
