zzso activated zzso zzso play an important role in zzso immune responses and alternatively activated zzso zzso function in zzso immune zzso While the classical zzso of fish zzso has been well zzso the existence of zzso has not yet been described for zzso zzso is the characteristic zzso in zzso and two zzso have been described for zzso To study the presence of zzso in a primitive zzso species we cloned zzso 1 and 2 zzso of common zzso zzso zzso 1 is a 340 zzso protein with zzso zzso sequence identity to human zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 is a 347 zzso protein with zzso zzso sequence identity to human zzso zzso Three highly zzso zzso 2 genes were found, each showing only single zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 expression is mainly found in carp mid zzso In contrast, zzso 2 was expressed in all zzso examined with the highest zzso gene expression in zzso zzso carp head zzso zzso were used to study zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso activity which could be induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and specifically inhibited by zzso zzso At the gene level, zzso 2 gene expression was zzso by zzso zzso while zzso 1 gene expression was not zzso zzso stimulation did not alter the zzso 1 or 2 zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso expression was, however, zzso This expression of zzso was used as a measure of classical zzso of carp zzso Thus, in contrast to zzso fish zzso 2 and not zzso 1 is zzso regulated and likely involved in the alternative zzso of fish zzso Our data suggest there may be an evolutionary conservation of the presence of zzso down to zzso zzso
