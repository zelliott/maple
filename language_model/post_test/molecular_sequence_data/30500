zzso of zzso genes from four strains of zzso B of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso have been zzso These sequences permit comparisons of zzso acid sequence between zzso from different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the B zzso and assessment of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso strains 234 zzso and 183 zzso were produced by zzso zzso harboring a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and these zzso were used in sheep vaccination zzso zzso from strain 183 zzso were found to be a senior zzso to zzso from strains of other B zzso providing protection against zzso infection caused by strains of the other B zzso zzso of this strain are therefore the most suitable candidate for inclusion in a zzso zzso zzso of strain 234 from zzso zzso the reference strain of the B zzso provided poor protection against infection with other zzso
