While zzso zzso of silk zzso are well known for their exquisite sensitivity to sex zzso zzso molecular mechanisms underlying this sensitivity are poorly zzso In searching for proteins that might support zzso mechanisms, we characterized the protein profile of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the wild silk zzso zzso zzso We have zzso and cloned a prominent zzso protein which we have named zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso Northern zzso analysis suggests that zzso is uniquely expressed in zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso analyses show that zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and that the protein is localized to the zzso zzso and zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso expression increases significantly 1-2 days before the end of adult development, zzso with the functional maturation of the zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests zzso is zzso with the zzso protein family, a zzso diverse family of zzso membrane zzso zzso family proteins are characterized as having two zzso zzso and interacting with zzso zzso zzso is the first member of this family identified in nervous zzso These findings argue that zzso has an important role in zzso possible roles of zzso in zzso detection are zzso
