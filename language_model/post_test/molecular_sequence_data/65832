An unknown zzso zzso was cloned by spliced zzso zzso chain reaction from zzso zzso The full length of zzso was found to be zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso results showed that none of 70 normal and 75 zzso zzso samples reacted with zzso zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso method, it was revealed that the native zzso protein distributed extensively in inner zzso walls but not in the zzso in zzso zzso Together with predicted results, it is suggested that the zzso protein is a zzso structural zzso which is not involved in induction of the zzso immune reactions against infection at least at the zzso zzso
