We constructed a zzso and zzso zzso zzso sensor for detecting the zzso of the zzso This zzso which usually suppresses the gene expression with its zzso sequence bound to the zzso of its own zzso zzso activates the translation only when a zzso is added to release the zzso sequence from itself as a result of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso The rationally zzso one with zzso as a reporter gene enabled us to detect the zzso of the zzso visibly with high zzso zzso
