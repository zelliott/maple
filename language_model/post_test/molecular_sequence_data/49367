The aim of these studies was to characterize the zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso were killed 47 zzso 9 h after steroid withdrawal, when symptoms of zzso and/or zzso became zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies indicated the presence of both MR and zzso in zzso and zzso Competitive binding studies using zzso in brain tissue showed that the zzso MR binds zzso zzso and zzso with equal zzso zzso in zzso availability in intact and zzso zzso along with determination of the binding affinity zzso of MR and zzso suggested that MR occupancy is about zzso whereas zzso occupancy is about zzso in normal zzso There was a significant increase in protein level of MR in zzso and the appearance of a higher molecular weight band for MR in zzso following steroid withdrawal, however no significant change in zzso was detected by zzso zzso for either MR or zzso in zzso or zzso following steroid zzso These studies suggest that zzso zzso of MR in the sheep brain include zzso and zzso and that, as in other species, affinity of MR for cortisol is greater than that of zzso
