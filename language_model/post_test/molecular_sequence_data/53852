A bacterial strain zzso zzso zzso was selected from a zzso zzso on the basis of its capacity to use zzso zzso zzso as a sole carbon and energy zzso This zzso the first isolate with this capacity to be zzso was identified by zzso zzso DNA analysis, and zzso sequence identity with a reference strain of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso used an unusually wide spectrum of zzso as growth zzso including zzso and zzso zzso with chains ranging from 5 to 16 carbon atoms long, as well as zzso zzso zzso It also attacked zzso such as zzso zzso zzso During growth on gasoline, it zzso zzso of the zzso Our results indicated that strain zzso zzso was capable of degrading zzso groups, possibly by a zzso and zzso zzso Evidence that it attacked the zzso carbon atom structure by an zzso mechanism during growth on zzso and zzso was also zzso
