The zzso gene of the fungus zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso through specific interactions with different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of two incompatible genes triggers a cell death reaction that prevents zzso zzso The zzso zzso has been cloned to get information on the function of the zzso It encodes a putative zzso zzso that displays two sequence motifs that have not yet been reported to be present on a single zzso They are a zzso domain and a repeated region that shares similarity with that of the zzso zzso to other members of the zzso family, sequence conservation between the repeated units is very strong and the number of repeats is different in zzso zzso zzso
