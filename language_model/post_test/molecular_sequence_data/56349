The crystal structure of the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso with zzso and a zzso inhibitor zzso is reviewed and correlated with chemical and genetic zzso The striking convergence of the structure with the zzso and zzso provides for the first time a molecular basis for understanding how this zzso functions, as well as an explanation for the highly zzso zzso that are scattered throughout the zzso Because these zzso probably serve a common role in all zzso protein zzso this first protein zzso structure serves as a general template for the entire family of zzso
