The binding of zzso fragments of the zzso zzso zzso of the two large zzso toxin A zzso and toxin B zzso expressed by zzso zzso and a library consisting of the most abundant neutral and zzso human milk zzso zzso was examined zzso at zzso and pH 7 using the direct zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso The results of the zzso zzso indicate that both toxin fragments investigated, zzso and zzso which possess one and two zzso binding sites, respectively, bind specifically to zzso ranging in size from zzso to zzso zzso five of the zzso tested bind to both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the binding of the zzso is zzso weak, with apparent affinities zzso The results of molecular zzso simulations, taken together with the experimental binding data, suggest that a zzso zzso zzso or zzso represents the core zzso recognition element for both toxin zzso The results of a zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso do not significantly inhibit the zzso effects of zzso or zzso The absence of protection is attributed to the very weak intrinsic affinities that the toxins exhibit towards the zzso
