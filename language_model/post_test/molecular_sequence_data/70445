zzso comparisons were carried out on two zzso isolated from endemic zzso New Zealand pasture zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso belong to the same virus zzso but it is not known how related they zzso The major zzso protein zzso gene from each virus was located, zzso and compared to the zzso gene from other zzso The zzso genes of zzso and zzso were similar to each other zzso zzso acid zzso and to other zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes of both zzso and zzso were most zzso to the zzso gene from zzso zzso virus zzso with zzso acid similarities of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso were compared to other zzso zzso using solution zzso zzso Even after reducing the zzso stringency conditions zzso ratios never exceeded zzso indicating there is little sequence conservation between zzso zzso Estimates of the size of terminal redundancies were also calculated for these viruses using zzso zzso gel zzso These values ranged from 0 to zzso These studies indicate that zzso and zzso have distinct zzso and that the zzso zzso is comprised of a group of genetically diverse zzso
