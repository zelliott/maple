We present here the sequence analysis of a DNA zzso zzso zzso located on the right arm of zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence reveals 14 open reading frames zzso longer than 300 zzso and the 201 zzso zzso zzso Among the 14 large zzso two overlapping frames are likely to be zzso and one zzso to the known zzso gene zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso zzso putative zzso regulators with a zzso DNA binding domain characteristic of members of the zzso zzso Among the nine remaining zzso five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso present significant similarity to proteins of unknown function and four zzso zzso zzso and zzso lack zzso to sequences present in the databases zzso
