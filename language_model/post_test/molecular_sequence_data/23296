zzso has evolved in many groups of zzso but it is rare among both extinct and extant zzso zzso Among zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso of the zzso species are considered to be zzso and zzso is restricted to zzso Here, we show that within a group of South American zzso zzso approximately 170 zzso zzso has evolved more frequently than in all other zzso combined and at a rate estimated to be zzso times zzso Furthermore, in contrast to other zzso zzso and to existing theory, most zzso zzso are small zzso and live in cool zzso zzso is generally thought to evolve only in zzso species that are large zzso live in warm climates, and maintain high body zzso These three well known zzso of zzso are considered to form the bases of zzso constraints that explain the paucity of zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso and paradoxical evolution of zzso in zzso is explained by a combination of environmental conditions zzso independent origins of zzso in isolated zzso zzso zzso constraints zzso small body size in cool climates, yet high body temperatures for zzso and zzso zzso More generally, our study demonstrates how zzso information from zzso and zzso can help to explain zzso zzso
