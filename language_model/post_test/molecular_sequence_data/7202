zzso 57 of the zzso zzso of zzso was replaced with zzso to determine whether the resulting zzso would be capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso & Wells, zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso A zzso increase in zzso was observed on zzso or zzso zzso containing zzso leaving groups and zzso at zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso extending from zzso to zzso is improved zzso by zzso in the zzso or zzso zzso This preference creates new zzso zzso for sequences zzso zzso R decreases zzso zzso zzso and K decreases zzso The ability of zzso from either the zzso or the zzso position of zzso to participate in zzso emphasizes the considerable zzso of zzso active zzso which can be assumed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to zzso fully folded zzso zzso with complete specificity at a site containing the sequence zzso zzso zzso was compared to zzso in its ability to cleave a zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso containing an introduced zzso zzso site only zzso slower than zzso zzso zzso The selective zzso of folded proteins suggests that zzso zzso can be used for specific zzso and protein zzso The extension of zzso zzso to the zzso family of zzso zzso indicates that it may be possible to apply this strategy to a wide range of zzso zzso and thereby develop various unique zzso for zzso and protein zzso
