The zzso tree is valuable for zzso oil, which is derived from the zzso of the zzso zzso markers were developed in zzso trees zzso zzso zzso zzso for use in population genetic studies and, particularly, analyses of genetic relationships among zzso 

A total of 20 zzso markers were developed and characterized in zzso zzso tested for zzso in zzso zzso using the Fast Isolation by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso These markers showed rich zzso when assessed in 120 samples of zzso zzso six samples of zzso zzso 

The developed zzso markers will be of great use for investigating genetic diversity of zzso analyzing population structure, and zzso molecular breeding in zzso zzso
