zzso zzso which was zzso with a zzso zzso and zzso the zzso reaction between zzso dioxide and zzso with high efficiency, was successfully zzso to bind a range of structurally diverse steroids with zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso out of 36 total sequence differences suffice to switch the selectivity of zzso to that of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the double zzso which tightly binds multiple steroids with differently configured zzso ring zzso the individual zzso and zzso single zzso both exhibit significantly greater specificity than zzso zzso binding zzso zzso approximately 5 zzso over other zzso These findings illustrate how easily differently shaped binding pockets can be created through subtle changes to the same primordial germ line zzso
