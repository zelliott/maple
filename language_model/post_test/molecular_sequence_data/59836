We have isolated a carbon zzso gene from the zzso fungus zzso zzso by use of a zzso zzso This zzso called zzso is strongly induced by zzso and efficiently zzso by zzso and zzso The predicted zzso mature zzso gene product lacks similarity to known proteins but is likely to be zzso zzso required for regulated expression of a reporter gene are contained within a zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso The promoter of zzso zzso requirements for an efficient zzso gene expression system in zzso zzso
