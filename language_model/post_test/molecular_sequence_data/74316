The techniques of zzso cloning and anchored zzso were used to clone the zzso factor 2 zzso gene from black tiger shrimp zzso zzso The full length zzso of black tiger shrimp zzso zzso contained a zzso untranslated region zzso of 73 zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids with an estimated molecular mass of 95 zzso and a zzso zzso of 112 zzso The searches for protein sequence similarities with zzso analysis indicated that the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso was zzso to the zzso of other species and even the zzso The zzso signature sequence of zzso gene family, zzso zzso domain and zzso domain were found in the zzso deduced zzso acid zzso The zzso expressions of gene in the different zzso stages were measured by real time zzso The zzso expressions of the gene were zzso expressed in zzso and different during the maturation zzso The result indicated that zzso gene was zzso expressed and could play a critical role in the zzso maturation zzso
