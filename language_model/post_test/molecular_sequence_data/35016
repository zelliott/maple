In this paper we characterize the zzso community from an ancient zzso zzso gold and zzso zzso zzso diversity was examined using a zzso technique based on zzso zzso gene amplification, cloning and zzso We show that unexpectedly the microbial diversity of this community was extremely high (more than 190 zzso zzso with the most numerous members from zzso zzso Although the level of rock zzso diversity was similar to the microbial mat community we have previously characterized in the same zzso its zzso composition was completely zzso zzso analysis of functional zzso and zzso zzso chemical properties of zzso found in pore water as well as the zzso chemical composition suggest that the zzso community contributes to zzso pollution of surrounding water in a zzso cycle similar to the one observed in bacterial zzso To interpret our results concerning the biological zzso cycle, we applied the theory of ecological zzso of Charles zzso
