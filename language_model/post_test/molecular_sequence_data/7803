Imprinting of the zzso growth factor II gene zzso is zzso in human, zzso and zzso In human liver and zzso zzso transcripts from promoter zzso are always derived from both parental zzso while transcripts from promoters zzso are from one parental zzso To examine the zzso zzso pattern of mouse zzso we examined zzso expression in F1 generation mice derived from crossing zzso zzso with zzso zzso using a novel zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso There was maintenance of maternal zzso zzso in all zzso nervous system zzso zzso in the F1 generation zzso However, there was zzso expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso expression of each zzso promoter transcript was examined by full-length zzso amplification with zzso zzso In every tissue in which zzso was zzso zzso transcripts were derived from paternal promoters zzso while the maternal zzso was zzso In the zzso however, promoters zzso of the imprinted maternal zzso became zzso leading to the zzso expression of zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso from each parental zzso differed in various zzso zzso In zzso zzso drive zzso expression predominantly from the paternal zzso while in some zzso regions, the promoter transcripts were primarily from the maternal zzso The coordinate regulation of mouse zzso promoters suggests the presence of an upstream zzso complex controlling zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
