Little is known about the function of host factors involved in disease zzso The barley zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is required for full zzso of the leaf zzso to invasion by the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso of zzso reduced the ability of barley to accommodate zzso of zzso zzso in intact zzso leaf cells and to form hairs on the root zzso suggesting that zzso is a common element of root hair outgrowth and zzso of zzso in leaf zzso zzso We further identified a barley zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacting with zzso in zzso and in zzso Fluorescent zzso decorated cortical zzso and was recruited by activated zzso to the cell zzso Under zzso attack, zzso zzso built a polarized network at sites of successful zzso By contrast, zzso loosened where the fungus succeeded in zzso zzso evidence suggests a function of zzso in limiting zzso to penetration by zzso zzso Additionally, zzso influenced the polar organization of cortical zzso These results add to our understanding of how intact plant cells accommodate zzso infection structures and suggest that zzso and zzso might be zzso players in zzso organization for zzso zzso
