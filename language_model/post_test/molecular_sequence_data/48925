The zzso family is one of the largest target families in the human zzso The family's key function in signal zzso for all organisms makes it a very attractive target class for the therapeutic interventions in many diseases states such as cancer, diabetes, inflammation and zzso A first step toward accelerating zzso drug discovery process is to fast identify whether a chemical and a zzso interact or zzso zzso these interactions can be identified by in zzso binding zzso - an expensive and zzso procedure that is not zzso on a large zzso zzso there is an urgent need to develop statistically efficient approaches for identifying zzso zzso For the first time, the quantitative binding affinities of zzso pairs are differentiated as a measurement to define if an inhibitor interacts with a zzso and then a zzso framework using an unbiased set of general integrated features zzso zzso and protein zzso and random forest zzso is employed to construct a zzso model which can accurately zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso with integrated features gave prediction accuracy of zzso sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso zzso The results are superior to those by only considering two separated spaces zzso space and protein zzso demonstrating that these integrated features contribute zzso Based on the constructed model, we provided a high confidence list of zzso associations for subsequent experimental investigation guidance at a low false discovery zzso
