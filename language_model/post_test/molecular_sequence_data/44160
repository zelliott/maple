The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the capacity to sense small changes in the zzso zzso concentration zzso not only upon cells involved in maintaining systemic zzso zzso but also upon those not directly involved in this zzso Since high zzso is known to affect various zzso processes in lens zzso both in health and in disease states zzso the formation of zzso in zzso zzso we investigated the expression and function of the zzso in these zzso By zzso and zzso the zzso is expressed in human lens zzso cells in zzso In addition, the open state probability of a zzso zzso zzso channel with a zzso of 82 zzso 3 zzso is significantly increased by zzso zzso to zzso zzso or by application of 100 zzso zzso both effective zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that human zzso cells express the zzso which may be functionally linked to zzso zzso channels and, perhaps, to other zzso channels involved in zzso zzso in the zzso
