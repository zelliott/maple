The zzso coiled zzso is a valuable folding motif for protein design and zzso By means of zzso display technology, we selected a capable binding partner for one strand of a coiled zzso bearing a charged zzso acid in a central zzso core zzso This procedure resulted in a novel coiled zzso pair featuring an opposed zzso pair arranged staggered within the zzso core of a coiled zzso zzso zzso investigation of the selected coiled zzso zzso by CD zzso and MD simulations suggest that a buried salt bridge within the zzso core enables the specific zzso of two zzso
