In zzso coli, phase variation of the outer membrane protein zzso zzso by the zzso gene is zzso by DNA zzso and the global regulator zzso zzso of zzso occurs zzso zzso when three Dam target sequences in the zzso regulatory region are zzso which prevents the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso when these Dam target sequences are zzso and zzso zzso A change in expression phase requires a zzso change in the DNA zzso state of these Dam target zzso To gain insight into the process of inheritance of the expression phase and the DNA zzso state, zzso interactions at zzso were zzso zzso of zzso at zzso was sufficient to protect the three zzso sequences contained within its binding site from zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that no other factors are required to maintain the zzso state and OFF zzso To maintain the zzso state of the ON phase, however, Dam must access the zzso zzso region after DNA zzso and zzso binding must not zzso zzso bound zzso zzso DNA, but the affinity was zzso lower than for zzso zzso This presumably contributes to the maintenance of the zzso state but, at the same time, may allow for zzso zzso binding and a switch to the OFF zzso zzso zzso DNA was also a binding zzso for the zzso protein zzso Thus, zzso zzso and Dam may compete for the same zzso zzso DNA that is formed after DNA replication in an ON phase zzso In zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso phase variation rates were altered and resulted in a bias to the OFF zzso In part, this can be attributed to the observed decrease in the level of DNA zzso in the zzso zzso
