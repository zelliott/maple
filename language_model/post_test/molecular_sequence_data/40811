The objective of this study was to describe the zzso and anatomical features of five unidentified zzso types of zzso zzso and to complement their identification based on zzso sequence zzso The combined approach of zzso and sequence analysis based on ITS sequence comparison with sequences contained in zzso and the zzso database let us assign three of the five zzso zzso zzso to the zzso lineage that closely matched European and North American zzso The sequencing results within zzso point toward alder specific zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The two other zzso zzso matched zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Better focused, zzso fruit body surveys are needed for accurate identification of South American zzso zzso because of the evidence of cryptic zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso
