zzso interactions play a pivotal role in the amplification of immune responses and, as such, represent an attractive target for immune intervention in a number of disease zzso We have previously shown that binding of human zzso expressed on the zzso zzso cell line to zzso zzso on pig zzso zzso cells zzso can lead to zzso of vascular cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso class zzso This zzso can be completely inhibited by the addition of a zzso zzso zzso to human zzso In this study, we explore an alternative approach to blocking this zzso with zzso zzso zzso 

Ten zzso were generated on the basis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso that were found to reduce zzso expression on zzso were analyzed for their ability to reduce zzso zzso zzso 

Four zzso were found to significantly lower surface expression of zzso zzso on zzso 48 zzso after zzso Eight of the zzso were seen to lead to zzso zzso products by zzso protection zzso Of the four zzso tested in the zzso zzso zzso one zzso showed a dramatic zzso of zzso zzso zzso approximately 1 zzso results comparable to the use of a blocking zzso Furthermore, we compared the effect of zzso zzso on tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso in which we observed no effect, which confirmed zzso zzso 

These results indicate that a zzso zzso zzso can be inhibited with an zzso with high potency and zzso zzso could be an attractive alternative therapy to the use of zzso
