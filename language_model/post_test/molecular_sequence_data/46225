zzso proteins zzso are structural components of zzso and variation in them may affect zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso to zzso the zzso zzso family which encodes zzso and zzso zzso Five unique zzso patterns were detected in the 250 sheep zzso Between two and five patterns were observed in individual sheep and none with only one pattern was zzso This suggests the zzso were zzso and derived from more than one zzso To zzso these zzso zzso zzso a sequencing approach using zzso to separate individual amplified zzso was zzso Using this approach, five DNA sequences zzso representing five unique zzso patterns were zzso D was identical to a published zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the others were novel, but the closest zzso was with zzso sequences from human, zzso zzso and zzso The five zzso zzso sequences could be assigned into three distinct zzso B and D were identical to each other, with the exception of a zzso zzso and a single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These appear to be zzso zzso of zzso zzso A and C could form another group, as they were similar to each other (with only one synonymous zzso but different to the other zzso This group appears to be related to a sheep zzso zzso acid zzso and represent zzso variation at another zzso locus zzso zzso The remaining sequence E did not show high sequence zzso with either the zzso or zzso zzso but exhibited zzso with a bovine zzso zzso with the exception of a zzso of 30 zzso This suggests that E represents zzso zzso This sequence was detected in only zzso of the sheep investigated, suggesting either a zzso zzso zzso or failure to amplify zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is a complex gene family, that is not only comprised multiple zzso but that is also zzso
