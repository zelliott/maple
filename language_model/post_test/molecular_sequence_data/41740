The zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We have isolated partial zzso from wheat zzso zzso using the zzso chain zzso zzso of deduced zzso acid sequences of these zzso shows that they represent a small family of genes that share a high degree of sequence zzso among themselves as well as among genes from other organisms including tomato, zzso zzso human, zzso and zzso Southern zzso analysis reveals the presence of at least four zzso Our results concerning the zzso expression as well as zzso regulation of these zzso zzso highlight the important role of this zzso in the growth and development of zzso
