We screened the recently established draft zzso of the early zzso zzso zzso for genes zzso zzso intermediate filament zzso zzso The draft of the zzso zzso contains only the five genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso previously established by zzso zzso Three of these IF proteins zzso zzso zzso were shown to be zzso of zzso IF zzso I to III while two proteins zzso zzso seemed zzso zzso This is now firmly established for protein zzso since the zzso data show that it arises as a fusion protein with a zzso zzso domain, a feature not found before in the very large collection of zzso IF zzso The results also confirm the previous proposal that zzso lack zzso of zzso type IV IF zzso We discuss the striking increase of IF complexity from 5 zzso to 65 human genes during zzso zzso Thus the zzso has a single zzso pair, which is expressed in the zzso while the human zzso has at least 25 genes each for zzso I and zzso zzso Finally there are four normal zzso zzso genes in addition to the gene zzso the zzso fusion proteins zzso
