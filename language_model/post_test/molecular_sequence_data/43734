zzso zzso from growing tissue of pea zzso zzso zzso zzso were incubated with the zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso seed zzso zzso as a potential zzso zzso zzso zzso seed zzso enhanced incorporation of zzso into zzso products zzso from columns of zzso zzso in the void zzso that were zzso zzso but zzso in zzso zzso These products were zzso by zzso to fragments comparable in size to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity could be zzso along with zzso zzso by the zzso zzso When this zzso was incubated with zzso zzso zzso zzso seed zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso seed zzso that had been partially zzso with an zzso zzso the rates of Gal transfer increased and zzso transfer decreased compared with controls with native zzso The reaction products were zzso by zzso to zzso fragments that were analyzed by zzso and zzso liquid zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The major components were zzso zzso namely one of the two possible zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whether the zzso zzso in the zzso was zzso (as in zzso seed zzso or zzso (as in zzso seed zzso It is concluded that the first zzso from the reducing end of the zzso was the Gal zzso locus preferred by the zzso pea zzso These observations are incorporated into a model for the zzso of cell wall zzso
