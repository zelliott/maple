To account for the presence of zzso sequences in zzso with similarity to the zzso Response zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso of man, rat and zzso the zzso of several zzso have been screened for the presence of the sequences zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which represent perfect zzso and consensus class I zzso respectively, and for the sequence zzso zzso zzso which represents class II zzso In many of the examined zzso zzso and zzso almost perfect zzso class I zzso and perfect or almost perfect class II half zzso zzso have been detected in various zzso some of which zzso proteins involved in energy zzso in replication and in zzso zzso These findings support the hypothesis that the similar sequences found in zzso potentially involved in hormonal regulation of respiratory zzso zzso were introduced into zzso cell by the zzso zzso
