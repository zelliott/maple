zzso hormone zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in the adrenal zzso and its expression is zzso by its own zzso zzso via a zzso zzso In the present study, we characterized the zzso region of human zzso gene to zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying its zzso and zzso zzso The promoter region zzso when the zzso start site is regarded as + 1) and its serial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso into the upstream of a zzso zzso reporter zzso These zzso were zzso into zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso and zzso zzso In all the cell lines, the zzso activity gradually increased with serial zzso and the maximum activity was zzso by - zzso zzso However, the magnitude of zzso activity of each deletion construct in zzso cells was much less than that in zzso cells, suggesting that the promoter functions in an zzso zzso We identified two zzso Factor zzso sites at zzso and zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso demonstrated that both sites bind to zzso zzso of both sites significantly decreased the activity of zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso cells significantly increased the promoter activity, suggesting that zzso plays a role in the zzso expression of human zzso zzso We identified the region, zzso to zzso that was required for the zzso responsiveness of the zzso This region contains one zzso zzso zzso revealed that the binding of zzso to this site increased significantly upon treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso of the site abolished the zzso In zzso cells, the zzso was observed only when zzso zzso was zzso This is the first demonstration that both zzso and zzso are required for the zzso induction of human zzso zzso
