Two genes zzso zzso protein zzso were cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso Both genes contain an uninterrupted region of only 75 zzso coding for a protein of zzso zzso Within the coding regions the zzso sequences are virtually zzso whereas in both the zzso and zzso regions the two genes differ significantly from each zzso The deduced protein shows an zzso and zzso content of 68 percent, zzso 17 out of 25 zzso and the basic zzso are evenly distributed over the zzso When compared to the zzso protein sequences currently available no counterpart to zzso could be found in zzso and it seems likely that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso
