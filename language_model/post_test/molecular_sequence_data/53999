The zzso modification of proteins by zzso and by zzso with zzso zzso are important regulatory processes which mediate biological signal zzso For the study of such biological phenomena in molecular detail characteristic peptides which embody both types of modification may serve as efficient zzso However, their synthesis is complicated by their pronounced acid and base zzso as well as their zzso For this purpose the zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso can be removed selectively and in high yields from various zzso and zzso at pH zzso and 37 degrees zzso The conditions under which the zzso zzso proceed are so mild that no zzso side reactions are observed zzso no zzso or zzso of the zzso bonds and no zzso of the zzso or the zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso guarantees that neither the zzso bonds nor the other protecting groups present are being zzso When this zzso protecting group technique was combined with the zzso zzso zzso zzso protecting group a complex zzso could be built zzso The zzso is equipped with a zzso label by which it can be traced in biological zzso This zzso represents a characteristic partial structure of a zzso and zzso sequence from the zzso domain of serum response factor zzso a widely occurring human zzso zzso
