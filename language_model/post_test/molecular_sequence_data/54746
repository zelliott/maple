zzso zzso zzso cell differentiation is dependent on the presence of HS zzso zzso We have demonstrated that, during zzso the evolution of specific cell lineages is associated with particular patterns of zzso zzso zzso For example, different HS zzso are zzso during neural or zzso lineage zzso Cell lines zzso for various components of the HS zzso zzso are selectively impaired in their zzso with zzso effects observed for some zzso We have also observed that the addition of soluble zzso zzso to cells, with or without zzso zzso can influence the pace and outcome of zzso again highlighting specific pattern requirements for particular zzso We are combining this work with ongoing studies into the design of artificial cell environments where we have zzso three-dimensional zzso generated by zzso or by the formation of zzso for the culture of zzso zzso By zzso these scaffolds with defined zzso zzso we intend to control the mechanical environment of the cells (via the scaffold zzso as well as their biological zzso environment zzso the zzso We predict that this will allow us to control zzso cell zzso and differentiation in a three-dimensional setting, allowing the generation of differentiated cell types for use in drug zzso or in zzso
