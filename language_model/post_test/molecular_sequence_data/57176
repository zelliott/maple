The zzso for the zzso of human zzso codes for 15 zzso acids at the zzso zzso that are not found in the native protein circulating in zzso In the present studies, experiments were designed to test whether the zzso extension was required for zzso assembly or was simply the result of limited zzso and maturation of the protein during or following zzso Baby zzso kidney cells were zzso with zzso coding for the zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso into the cell culture medium was identified either with an zzso against the mature zzso or with an zzso directed toward the zzso extension of the zzso The zzso protein contained primarily two species of zzso including one with the zzso extension and one that was the same as that in plasma zzso A zzso zzso in which zzso at the putative zzso site in the zzso was converted to zzso was also readily zzso and, in this case, the protein was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Similarly, a zzso zzso that completely lacked the zzso extension of the zzso was assembled and zzso from the zzso baby zzso kidney zzso These two zzso with modified zzso were readily zzso by zzso and zzso by factor zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso extension in zzso is not required for assembly or zzso of the zzso zzso it was concluded that the zzso of the zzso removing the zzso 15 zzso acids is a normal and specific processing event occurring during the maturation of the zzso
