zzso zzso of resting adult zzso zzso T cells to B zzso has been shown to be transient and can be zzso by zzso major zzso complex zzso class II zzso zzso zzso zzso of adult zzso zzso zzso to B cells is not regulated by zzso of zzso We have investigated the regulation of zzso of zzso blood zzso zzso T zzso In contrast to adult zzso zzso T cells, zzso blood zzso zzso T cells were strongly sensitive to the zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso class II interaction, since zzso to zzso class zzso B cells was transient and inhibited by an zzso zzso In addition, human zzso virus zzso synthetic zzso peptides encompassing a zzso binding site inhibited zzso formation between zzso blood zzso zzso T cells and B zzso Following zzso of the zzso blood zzso T cells by an zzso zzso a conversion from a transient to a stable zzso pattern of zzso blood zzso T cells to B cells occurred in 2 zzso The reversal to a transient zzso occurred at day 8 following zzso zzso in correlation with a complete shift to a zzso zzso of the zzso blood zzso T zzso These data suggest that zzso T cell zzso can be zzso zzso
