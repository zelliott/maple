The zzso sequences of a short zzso of the envelope protein gene zzso zzso acids 25 to 89 of 27 dengue 3 viruses were determined by direct sequencing of zzso products, and the viruses were compared regarding their time of isolation and geographic zzso Four distinct zzso groups were discerned at zzso divergence between zzso zzso The first group contained zzso from the South Pacific zzso to zzso Singapore zzso and Indonesia zzso to zzso The second group comprised viruses from Asia zzso to zzso including the reference strain zzso The third was composed of one isolate from Thailand (1971), and the fourth included the early strains from French zzso zzso to 1969) and from Puerto Rico zzso Furthermore, the difference between early and recent strains from the South Pacific was as high as zzso This observation suggests that the recent zzso in the South Pacific were probably the consequence of the spread of a new zzso that emerged from New zzso However, zzso between zzso sequence and disease severity, or between strains from zzso with mild disease (New zzso and strains from zzso with severe disease zzso zzso could not be zzso
