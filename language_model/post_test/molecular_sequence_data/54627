Small zzso zzso zzso and zzso are two classes of zzso zzso with distinct functions in zzso modification or zzso gene zzso In this study, we introduce novel insights to zzso gene activity adjustments in human cells by identifying numerous zzso molecules with zzso function, including zzso box zzso and zzso box zzso In particular, we demonstrate that several zzso box zzso give rise to gene regulatory zzso named zzso zzso Our data are zzso the increasing number of studies in the field of small zzso with regulatory zzso In zzso deep sequencing of small zzso zzso we identified high copy numbers of zzso from zzso zzso with lengths of zzso zzso secondary structure prediction indicated for a majority of candidates a location in predicted stem zzso Experimental analysis revealed efficient gene zzso for 11 box zzso zzso indicating zzso processing and recruitment to the zzso zzso zzso zzso in four different human cell lines indicated variations in both the zzso levels and their processing to active zzso In addition we show that box D elements are predominantly zzso at least one of the zzso zzso while the box C element locates within the sequence of the zzso guide zzso
