The zzso zzso gene responsible for the zzso puff of zzso zzso encodes a family of proteins which are members of the steroid zzso zzso These proteins are believed to be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso In order to investigate the evolutionary conservation of zzso we have identified the zzso gene of zzso zzso We show here the structure of a zzso believed to zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and demonstrate that the putative DNA zzso hormone binding and zzso and zzso terminal zzso zzso are zzso However, due to a relative reduction in zzso size and number and the absence of zzso zzso acid repeats, the zzso B zzso unit and protein are considerably smaller in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso These findings have implications for the identification of critical structural features of zzso and also suggest that zzso has a zzso function and a shared zzso in zzso
