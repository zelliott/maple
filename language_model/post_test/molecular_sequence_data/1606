zzso zzso zzso is found in certain highly virulent strains of zzso zzso zzso sites, portions of the right and left zzso ends, and zzso DNA from eight zzso in seven zzso zzso strains were characterized in this zzso zzso and zzso sites zzso for the most part to the consensus sequence zzso although minor zzso were zzso zzso were integrated into similar sites in four zzso suggesting that these strains may have had a common zzso Two strains had three zzso copies each, and integration sites were zzso Two strains had two copies zzso One of these shared two of the integration sites occupied in the zzso zzso while the other shared one of these sites and zzso a second zzso in a unique zzso zzso sites in the two strains with one zzso each were zzso Four zzso copies contained extensive zzso within a region zzso a putative structural protein and the putative zzso zzso A zzso zzso was deleted from the right side of two of these zzso It is proposed that zzso within zzso zzso integration sites and within the zzso themselves may help to identify zzso relationships among virulent zzso zzso zzso
