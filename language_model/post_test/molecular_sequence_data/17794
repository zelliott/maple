The reverse zzso of zzso of a human zzso using an zzso complementary to rat zzso zzso zzso sequence as a zzso gave rise to a single strand zzso This zzso zzso permitted by zzso amplification the preparation and cloning in zzso 19 of a human zzso probe of zzso base zzso The choice of primer was dictated by the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso sequence which were zzso in different species throughout zzso The presence of zzso on the zzso was not an obstacle to a specific amplification and the probe sequence was found identical to the human zzso zzso zzso This probe, zzso by zzso translation detected on Southern zzso of zzso hybrids, bands on human DNA after zzso zzso or zzso zzso The results with zzso were explicit and drove to the conclusion that zzso is located on zzso zzso Five bands were obtained on human DNA zzso with zzso indicating that either numerous zzso could interrupt the coding sequence of zzso gene or duplicated sequences could be present in zzso zzso
