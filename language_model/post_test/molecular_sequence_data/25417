The zzso of occurrence of the zzso and 3' nearest neighbor zzso of zzso containing zzso and zzso blocks show strong zzso Specifically, the following trends are zzso Given a zzso zzso zzso (where zzso indicates a sequence of length zzso composed solely of zzso and/or zzso and zzso is a sequence of length m composed solely of As and/or zzso and zzso zzso zzso m zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso greater than zzso + 2 zzso That is the zzso zzso is zzso located 3' of the zzso enclosing the zzso zzso The trends are strongest for zzso zzso 3, m zzso 1 and gradually weaken as the size of the zzso block decreases (with a zzso increase of zzso zzso nearest neighbor flank zzso encloses the zzso block (to produce zzso zzso zzso The zzso flank trends are weaker than the zzso flank zzso The zzso flank trends also decrease in strength as the size of the zzso block zzso The statistical significance of these trends in zzso is very zzso A possible correlation with DNA structural zzso in particular groove zzso is zzso
