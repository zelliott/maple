Two structurally distinct series of potent and selective zzso of an zzso zzso zzso converting zzso zzso activity identified in the rat lung have been zzso zzso A, which zzso zzso the rat lung zzso served as the basis for the first zzso zzso selected zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso were shown to be zzso of rat lung zzso zzso modifications improved zzso of the rat lung zzso while eliminating zzso zzso Both series of zzso zzso demonstrated a range of selectivity over zzso zzso zzso zzso were appended onto selected compounds to facilitate in zzso zzso zzso reduction of the zzso response to zzso administered Big zzso was observed with selected rat lung zzso zzso
