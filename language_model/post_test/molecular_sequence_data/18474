zzso play an essential role in producing several zzso zzso In the present study, zzso and zzso effects of zzso from zzso were zzso zzso were isolated from north eastern Himalayan soil samples, zzso The zzso were investigated for their zzso property by conventional method and the active zzso were identified by zzso zzso sequence zzso Further the zzso were extracted and zzso to evaluate the zzso zzso they were subjected to zzso zzso The active fraction was evaluated for selective toxicity and zzso zzso Among isolated zzso zzso showed potent zzso activity and was identified as zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso extract of zzso showed zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso in primary cells and zzso zzso levels on zzso zzso treated with zzso revealed no toxicity to the primary zzso zzso also suppressed the paw thickness on zzso induced animals and also controlled the release of zzso zzso and zzso levels on zzso induced zzso zzso cell zzso zzso profile of zzso showed the presence of an zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the first report in zzso zzso The zzso isolate zzso can be proceed further to produce zzso
