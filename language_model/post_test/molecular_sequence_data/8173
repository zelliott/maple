Using methods for database screening with individual protein sequences and alignment blocks, a zzso domain is delineated in a group of proteins including several zzso zzso Two motifs within this domain resemble zzso zzso and may be directly involved in zzso zzso These motifs can be readily distinguished from previously described zzso sites using a method for database screening with zzso weight zzso derived from alignment zzso zzso this group of known and predicted zzso zzso includes the product of the zzso zzso which is involved in zzso development, and its zzso from man and zzso zzso
