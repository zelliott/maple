The zzso box gene zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein that binds with high affinity to sequences located near the zzso zzso of the eve and en zzso The zzso en sites are A + T rich and contain copies of the zzso zzso consensus sequence zzso In contrast, the zzso eve sites are G + C rich and contain the zzso sequence zzso Among the five different zzso box proteins that have been tested for zzso eve is unique in that it shows virtually equal preference for the A + zzso zzso en binding sites and the G + zzso zzso eve zzso Most of the other proteins bind with a relatively higher affinity to the en sites than to the eve zzso In an effort to identify the regions of the eve protein that are responsible for its efficient binding to both classes of recognition zzso we analyzed the zzso properties of various zzso eve zzso These studies suggest that the zzso domain of the eve protein is responsible for both binding zzso However, zzso in distant regions of the protein influenced the binding behavior of the eve zzso domain and caused a reduction in binding to the G + C class of recognition zzso We propose that the protein context of the zzso domain can influence its zzso zzso
