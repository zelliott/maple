zzso coordinate biological activities into daily cycles using an internal zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso are widely believed to zzso zzso zzso of gene expression in zzso However, a group of very abundant zzso zzso marine zzso species, lost the third zzso zzso zzso during zzso We demonstrate here that the remaining zzso proteins fulfill their known zzso functions, although zzso is zzso by default in this zzso These data provide zzso support for the observed evolutionary reduction of the clock locus in zzso and are consistent with a model in which a mechanism that is less robust than the zzso zzso protein clock of zzso is sufficient for biological timing in the very stable environment that zzso zzso
