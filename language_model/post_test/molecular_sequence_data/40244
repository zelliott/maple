zzso zzso is a zzso protein that is involved in a number of neurodegenerative zzso zzso disease, the protein is typically encountered in zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is abundant in the zzso terminals of the central nervous system, its zzso function is still zzso There is strong evidence for the membrane affinity of the zzso One hypothesis is that zzso binding and zzso folding may zzso the fusion of synaptic zzso with the zzso membrane and the ensuing zzso zzso Here we show that membrane recognition of the zzso is essential for the cooperative formation of zzso zzso in the zzso We used circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to investigate synthetic zzso fragments from different zzso of the full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial zzso of the full-length protein were employed to further characterize the structural motifs responsible for zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso zzso of varying net charge and zzso compositions undergoing lateral phase separation or chain melting phase transitions in the vicinity of zzso temperatures served as model zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso folding of the first 25 zzso may be driven simultaneously by zzso attraction and by a change in zzso zzso Our findings highlight the significance of the zzso zzso for folding zzso and provide a framework for zzso the role of zzso zzso transitions of the protein within its zzso zzso
