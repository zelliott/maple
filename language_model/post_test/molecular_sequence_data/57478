Human zzso zzso C plays a functionally important role in maintaining zzso shape and regulating membrane mechanical zzso We report here the characterization of the zzso C and D zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso C gene is zzso by 4 zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and normal individuals generated a zzso zzso when using zzso spanning zzso 1 and zzso However, no zzso chain reaction zzso products were detected in the zzso zzso using zzso zzso either zzso 1 and 3 or zzso 1 and 4, suggesting that the 3' end of the zzso was missing or zzso zzso 4 also appeared to be missing from zzso zzso DNA, based on both Southern zzso and zzso These results indicate that an absence of zzso C and zzso D in zzso from these zzso zzso individuals is a consequence of a deletion or marked zzso of zzso 3 and zzso 4 of their zzso C zzso Surprisingly, the zzso gene encodes an zzso stable enough to be detected in circulating zzso Although this zzso could zzso an zzso zzso of zzso C, these protein zzso would not be expressed in the membrane because they lack the zzso and zzso zzso
