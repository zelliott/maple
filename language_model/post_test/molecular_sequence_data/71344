We have applied in zzso atomic force zzso to directly observe the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso zzso zzso in contact with two model solid zzso zzso mica and zzso zzso The time course of zzso was followed by continuous imaging of surfaces remaining in contact with zzso zzso solutions of zzso in PBS zzso zzso zzso of fragile zzso zzso of zzso was made possible by the application of a tapping mode of imaging, which zzso the lateral forces between the probe tip and the zzso The size and the shape of zzso zzso as well as the zzso of their formation, exhibited pronounced dependence on the zzso nature of the zzso On zzso zzso zzso formed zzso zzso zzso which at higher zzso concentration had the tendency to form linear zzso reminiscent of zzso species described recently in the zzso In contrast, on zzso zzso zzso formed uniform, zzso zzso The dimensions of those sheets were consistent with the dimensions of zzso with extended zzso chains perpendicular to the long axis of the zzso The sheets of zzso were oriented along three directions at 120 degrees to each other, resembling the zzso symmetry of a zzso zzso Such zzso zzso may be the distinguishing feature of zzso in comparison with zzso These studies show that in zzso atomic force zzso enables direct assessment of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and suggest that zzso zzso formation may be driven by interactions at the interface of zzso solutions and zzso zzso as occurs in zzso and zzso particles in zzso
