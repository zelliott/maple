The sex zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are designated zzso for females and zzso zzso for zzso Numerous long terminal repeat zzso and zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso have accumulated as strata on the W zzso However, there are zzso sequences that do not show the characteristics of typical zzso elements on the W zzso To zzso these zzso zzso sequences on the W zzso we used zzso shotgun zzso data and assembled data that was obtained using male zzso zzso Through these zzso found that almost all of these zzso sequences were zzso zzso elements that do not fit into the conventional zzso It is notable that some of these zzso elements contained the zzso short zzso element zzso sequences in the zzso We designated them as zzso zzso elements zzso Because putative ancestral zzso zzso sequences without zzso do not occur in the zzso data, we suggest that the zzso sequences of zzso are not carried on each element merely as a package but are components of each zzso zzso we confirmed that zzso should be classified as a new group of zzso zzso
