The zzso zzso zzso binding of certain zzso zzso antibiotics from zzso zzso has been examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on an zzso restriction zzso of zzso DNA under several experimental zzso A buffer at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso at 37 degrees C was found to be optimum for the interaction of these antibiotics with zzso At zzso zzso zzso both zzso A and S exhibited zzso in the regions zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a weak footprint in the region zzso zzso The binding locations identified that are common to zzso A and S are (all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and weak interaction locations are zzso zzso and zzso zzso bases are shared by two adjacent binding zzso Both the zzso zzso A and S show preference for zzso or zzso zzso It appears that zzso A has no affinity for zzso while zzso S shows a strong footprint at this zzso Neither of the zzso recognizes alternating zzso zzso zzso S also binds to zzso which suggests that molecular recognition processes involving the parent antibiotics are also important, and not only recognition by, and zzso binding of, the common zzso species to the zzso The protection sites at zzso and zzso suggest that zzso A and S recognize zzso zzso However, between the two zzso zzso C is preferred to zzso Enhancement of zzso by both zzso is observed in the zzso region of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
