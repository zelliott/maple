Three bacterial strains were isolated from activated sludge samples of two treatment plants receiving domestic and industrial zzso containing zzso zzso One strain zzso was isolated on rich zzso and the other two zzso and zzso on mineral medium containing two industrial zzso of zzso zzso as the sole carbon zzso zzso zzso was a zzso spore zzso zzso zzso producing zzso during growth in liquid zzso On the basis of zzso analysis the strains were assigned to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso High performance liquid zzso analysis showed that only the zzso and zzso strains were involved in the degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso however, when zzso with the two degrading zzso induced the formation of cell zzso and facilitated zzso zzso Fluorescent in zzso zzso on the activated sludge sample from which zzso zzso was isolated, using zzso for zzso bacteria with low G + C content, showed that bacteria belonging to this group specifically occurred inside the examined zzso These observations suggest that the enhanced zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells involved in the zzso
