A zzso zzso protein of 18 zzso zzso was originally isolated from rabbit zzso by using as an zzso the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso 37 zzso acids of zzso zzso make up the zzso zzso zzso zzso has broad zzso activity against both zzso zzso zzso zzso 130 to 200 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 to 100 zzso zzso zzso strains include zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity is highly dependent on zzso zzso Although a zzso zzso resulting from the zzso of 5 zzso acids from the C zzso of zzso is highly active, other fragments of zzso including zzso with a truncated N zzso do not exhibit zzso zzso Unlike previously characterized zzso peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso is active in zzso zzso or a zzso zzso may have therapeutic potential for bacterial zzso
