It has been zzso that a segment zzso zzso inserted in the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in controlling zzso zzso binding for zzso zzso To investigate its functions, we expressed human zzso in a zzso system with deletion of a zzso segment from this region zzso zzso and zzso designated as zzso and characterized the zzso zzso zzso In contrast with zzso zzso zzso exhibited characteristics resembling zzso zzso zzso It contained an zzso bound zzso which was essential in folding and stabilizing this zzso zzso and retained zzso of zzso formation in 5 zzso zzso We also produced four zzso truncated zzso zzso with or without the zzso segment, and either including or excluding the zzso zzso zzso zzso c zzso activity of zzso zzso without the zzso segment was up to 20 fold greater than that of corresponding zzso zzso and higher than zzso activity of the zzso zzso A series of zzso with smaller zzso deletion in this region such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were further zzso The crude zzso of zzso zzso and zzso did not show activity in the presence of zzso while other four zzso had activity comparable to that of zzso The zzso zzso and zzso proteins had a zzso higher affinity for zzso but their zzso forming activity was still zzso dependent upon the addition of zzso Both zzso exhibited a low level of the zzso c and zzso zzso activities, which either did not respond to zzso or slightly enhanced by zzso the zzso zzso In contrast, activities of zzso and zzso like those of zzso were largely zzso Thus, our findings indicate that the zzso half of the zzso segment containing zzso zzso plays a significant role in regulating zzso zzso
