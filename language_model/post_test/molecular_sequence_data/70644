To investigate the processing and general properties of the zzso zzso domain, three protein expression zzso have been developed as zzso one without the domain, one with the domain, and one with a zzso near the putative zzso processing zzso The zzso have been expressed in two zzso model systems, zzso and zzso zzso modifications that normally occur in zzso including zzso signal zzso zzso and zzso processing, occur in the three zzso in both cell zzso zzso sequencing of zzso protein revealed leader sequence processing at two sites, a primary site between zzso and a secondary site of zzso zzso of the zzso domain could be observed by migration differences in zzso gel zzso and was evident in both zzso and insect zzso zzso identification by Western zzso confirmed the loss of the expected zzso The failure of both cell systems to process the zzso construct shows that the zzso sequence is the site of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain occurred zzso in zzso cells in an early zzso zzso compartment as demonstrated by studies with zzso blocking zzso This finding, taken with the zzso nature of the zzso site and observed calcium sensitivity of zzso suggests that the processing zzso is a zzso zzso resident zzso zzso
