zzso chemical studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso from bovine brain reveal that one zzso zzso is accessible for reaction with zzso zzso zzso of the two types of zzso zzso with zzso acid resulted in a zzso loss of zzso zzso The zzso followed zzso zzso zzso with the zzso rate constant of 83 zzso zzso and 75 zzso zzso for zzso I and zzso II, zzso The zzso was partially prevented by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso A combination of 10 zzso zzso with 2 zzso zzso gave complete protection against the zzso There were no significant differences between the two zzso zzso zzso in their sensitivities to zzso by zzso indicating that the zzso structures of the zzso zzso are very similar to each zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso had no effects on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso By a combination of zzso mapping analysis and labeling with zzso zzso acid, a zzso zzso zzso was identified as zzso in the overall zzso The zzso zzso was clearly identical to sequences of other zzso species zzso
