The complete primary structure of the lentil zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was determined by conventional methods in order to find relationships between partial sequences and the difference in action against human and bovine zzso As other zzso type zzso zzso contained 68 zzso acid zzso seven zzso bridges, and two zzso sites, zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso of sequence zzso showed that it belonged to the group III zzso zzso The zzso additional binding site of zzso for human zzso was discussed and compared with such binding sites of two other zzso zzso the zzso soybean zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso bean zzso inhibitor LBI I, for human and bovine zzso and zzso A concept to reduce the action of these zzso against human zzso by genetic engineering was zzso
