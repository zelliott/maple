Natural killer zzso cells are important early zzso of host immunity to viral zzso The zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso both zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulate zzso cell zzso toward target zzso Like other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso class I molecules to avoid detection by zzso T zzso but renders cells susceptible to zzso cell zzso We now show that the zzso immune evasion zzso zzso reduces cell surface expression of the zzso zzso zzso class zzso chain A zzso zzso and the newly defined zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso requires the zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso to target zzso zzso tail zzso zzso The common zzso zzso zzso has a zzso zzso leading to a premature stop zzso and is resistant to zzso because of the loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso signals zzso but not degradation of zzso and causes a potent reduction in zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso for both the zzso and zzso zzso pathways provides zzso with a powerful mechanism for evasion of zzso cell zzso zzso
