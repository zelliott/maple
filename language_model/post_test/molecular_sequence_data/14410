A large body of literature provides compelling evidence for the role of zzso zzso core zzso zzso in various biological zzso However, zzso zzso of individual zzso that are known to be sites of zzso modifications often does not result in clear zzso zzso In some cases, the combination of multiple zzso can give rise to stronger zzso zzso functional zzso between distinct zzso on zzso Here, we examined the zzso zzso zzso by characterizing double deletion of all zzso combinations of zzso tails zzso from the four core zzso zzso in budding zzso First, we found that multiple zzso zzso on the zzso of both zzso and zzso are zzso involved in cell zzso Second, simultaneous deletion of zzso from zzso and zzso leads to a severe growth zzso which is correlated with zzso gross zzso structure in the zzso zzso Finally, by combining point zzso on zzso with deletion of the zzso zzso we revealed a redundant role for zzso 4 on zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Altogether, these data suggest that the zzso of core zzso share previously zzso potentially redundant functions that, in some cases are different from those of the widely accepted zzso and zzso zzso zzso
