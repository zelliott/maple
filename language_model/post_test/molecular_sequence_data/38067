In higher plants, zzso organization and cell division regulation are two fundamentally important and intimately related biological zzso zzso and zzso regulatory genes in these processes is essential for understanding higher plant growth and zzso We describe the molecular isolation and analyses of an zzso zzso zzso which regulates both of these zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso displayed defects in cell division of floral zzso cells including partially formed cell walls, increased DNA content, and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Development zzso zzso Here, we characterize a second zzso of zzso in zzso zzso development and show that the enlarged zzso in zzso zzso results from repeated division of one zzso zzso into two or more zzso zzso Using a zzso approach, we isolated the zzso gene and found that zzso encodes a protein with zzso repeats bearing similarity to zzso zzso of zzso and its plant zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression pattern and the nuclear zzso of zzso are consistent with a regulatory role of zzso in floral zzso cell division and in zzso zzso zzso
