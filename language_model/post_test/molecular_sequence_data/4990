Two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso zzso from a culture broth of zzso zzso zzso which produces zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso was composed of three zzso with molecular weights of 23,000 zzso zzso zzso and 40,000 zzso zzso was composed of two zzso with molecular weight of 22,000 zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso I and zzso zzso I were very zzso zzso zzso II and zzso zzso II had an identical zzso zzso acid zzso That of zzso zzso III showed no similarity to the other zzso Both zzso had similar zzso properties zzso pH and zzso pH zzso and 55 degrees zzso but showed a significantly different zzso stability at 55 degrees zzso Both zzso and zzso used zzso as well as the zzso as the zzso donor and used various zzso acids and peptides as the zzso It was also found that the PGA produced by the strain was zzso to zzso acid by its own zzso
