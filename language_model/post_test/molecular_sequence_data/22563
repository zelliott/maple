zzso are nearly zzso distributed in all zzso of zzso They are essential for pigmentation and are important factors in wound healing and primary immune zzso Their active site is characterized by a pair of zzso coupled copper zzso zzso and zzso which are coordinated by six zzso zzso Such a zzso 3 copper zzso is the common feature of zzso zzso and zzso It is also one of several other copper types found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The copper pair of zzso binds one zzso of atmospheric oxygen to zzso two different kinds of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso The best-known function is the formation of zzso from zzso via zzso zzso The complicated zzso mechanism at the active zzso is still not completely zzso because nothing is known about their zzso zzso One main reason for this deficit is that zzso zzso from zzso sources could not be isolated in sufficient quantities and zzso for detailed structural zzso This is not the case for zzso zzso from different zzso species, having been zzso characterized genetically and zzso for zzso The zzso zzso are zzso zzso proteins with a low molecular mass of zzso zzso They are zzso to the surrounding zzso where they are involved in zzso zzso zzso In the species zzso the zzso gene is part of the zzso zzso Next to the zzso gene zzso this zzso contains an additional zzso called zzso which is essential for the correct expression of the zzso This review summarizes the present knowledge of bacterial zzso which are promising models in order to get more insights in structure, zzso reactions and functions of zzso 3 zzso proteins in zzso
