The zzso zzso technology uses multiple zzso per gene to measure its expression zzso Individual probe signals can vary widely, which zzso proper zzso This variation can be caused by zzso that do not properly match their target gene or that match multiple zzso To determine the accuracy of zzso zzso we developed an extensive zzso zzso for mouse zzso incorporating the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mouse Gene Index, and zzso mouse zzso zzso 

zzso this protocol to zzso Mouse Genome zzso (the earlier zzso and the newer 430 zzso zzso the number of zzso zzso with perfect matches was no less than zzso and zzso zzso and for zzso and zzso of the probe sets all zzso were sequence zzso The latter percentages increased to zzso and zzso after discarding one or two zzso zzso per probe set, and even further to zzso and zzso when, in addition, allowing for one or two zzso between probe and target zzso Similar results were obtained for other mouse zzso as well as for human and rat zzso Based on these data, refined chip definition files for all zzso are provided zzso Researchers can choose the version appropriate for their study to zzso expression zzso 

The accuracy of zzso probe sequences is higher than previously reported, particularly on newer zzso Yet, refined probe set definitions have clear effects on the detection of zzso expressed zzso We demonstrate that the interpretation of the results of zzso zzso is improved when the new chip definition files are zzso
