We have constructed an zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso containing the zzso zzso gene derived from zzso zzso under control of the zzso immediate early zzso zzso hybrid zzso zzso We examined the zzso zzso by this Ad zzso in zzso cells bearing a reporter gene construct zzso which directs expression of the zzso coli zzso gene upon zzso zzso of the zzso gene located between the zzso promoter and the zzso zzso Nearly zzso of these cells were shown to start to produce zzso after infection with the zzso zzso at zzso zzso On the basis of this result, we discuss the possible use of the zzso zzso to manipulate the gene expression in zzso zzso
