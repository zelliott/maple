The high levels of variation in surface zzso can be considered as an evolutionary hallmark of immune zzso New zzso tools enable analysis of this variation by identifying zzso that exhibit high rates of zzso acid changes relative to the synonymous substitution zzso In the outer membrane protein zzso of zzso zzso a vaccine candidate for zzso zzso we identified four zzso with this attribute in zzso that did not zzso to known or assumed zzso and zzso zzso of zzso These zzso flank zzso zzso and do not appear to be false zzso as judged from zzso and maximum likelihood zzso Some closely spaced positively selected zzso have been previously considered part of a zzso domain, which would render this region zzso for inclusion in a zzso Secondary structure analysis, three-dimensional structural database searches, and zzso modeling using zzso of zzso coli as a structural zzso however, revealed that all positively selected zzso are located in or near zzso looping zzso The spacing and level of diversity of these positively selected and exposed zzso in zzso suggest that vaccine targets based on these and zzso zzso zzso may provide broad coverage in zzso zzso
