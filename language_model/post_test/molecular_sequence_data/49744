zzso zzso catalyze the breakdown of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso Until now there are no reports of the identification of a plant zzso zzso at a molecular level, and it is not clear what biological role this class of zzso have in zzso A zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso and partial zzso acid sequencing allowed the corresponding full-length zzso zzso to be zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed highest zzso to the deduced zzso acid sequences of several zzso zzso genes zzso as zzso zzso including a zzso zzso acid, and salt zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the unidentified zzso gene zzso zzso A full-length expressed sequence tag clone of zzso was obtained and zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso reaction, but no zzso zzso The present study zzso for the first time, a zzso zzso from plants at a molecular level and zzso the functional assignment of the only functionally identified member of a group of zzso zzso genes zzso as zzso zzso
