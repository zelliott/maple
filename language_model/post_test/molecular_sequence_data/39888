In the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso for the next generation zzso from a zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso progeny are programmed to enter a sexually zzso period, during which cells do not zzso This programming occurs at a critical period during the fifth cell cycle after zzso Here, we show that treatment with zzso A, a zzso zzso zzso leads to a partial recovery of mating zzso in immature cells, suggesting that zzso zzso can affect the zzso zzso In addition, zzso demonstrated that zzso 4 zzso of zzso zzso was absent from or present at an zzso level in the nascent zzso during the first cell cycle after zzso The zzso level gradually increased in proportion to de zzso DNA zzso until the new zzso reached the maximum level of zzso zzso with its full zzso A link between gene expression and zzso 4 zzso is indirectly supported by the observation that a zzso active gene was enriched by zzso zzso with an zzso directed against zzso 4 zzso whereas a silent gene was zzso These results provide evidence that zzso modification plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression and the zzso programming that determine sexual zzso after zzso
