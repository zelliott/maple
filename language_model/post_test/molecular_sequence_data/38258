In an attempt to identify a specific marker for zzso 2 of the Asian rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we used zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso We identified an zzso marker that is specifically amplified in zzso 1, 2 and 5 of the rice zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso 1, 2 and 5 are zzso to hosts bearing the zzso resistance gene zzso in rice variety zzso whereas zzso 4 is virulent to zzso Based on the sequence of this zzso marker, zzso zzso characterized amplified zzso zzso were designed and used in combination with previously developed zzso zzso to distinguish effectively all five zzso in a multiplex zzso zzso The inheritance pattern of this marker in the zzso of zzso crosses between zzso 1, 2 and 4 shows that the marker can be amplified by zzso from all F1 zzso irrespective of the zzso status of their zzso However, the marker is present only in those male zzso whose mother was of a zzso zzso zzso The specific amplification of this marker in the zzso zzso and its pattern of inheritance show that zzso with respect to carriers of the zzso gene in rice zzso zzso is zzso
