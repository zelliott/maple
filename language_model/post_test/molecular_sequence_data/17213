Several zzso muscle zzso have been directly linked to zzso in zzso and associated zzso zzso T zzso is one of the three zzso that form zzso zzso which together with zzso is responsible for the regulation of zzso muscle zzso All three zzso of cardiac zzso as well as zzso have been associated with zzso zzso zzso However, zzso accounts for most of the zzso that cause zzso in these regulatory zzso To date 30 zzso have been identified in the cardiac zzso zzso gene that results in familial zzso zzso The zzso gene has also been associated with familial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is lethal due to impaired cardiac zzso A zzso nonsense zzso in the gene zzso slow skeletal zzso has been associated with an unusual, severe form of zzso zzso among the Old Order zzso How each zzso leads to the diverse clinical symptoms associated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso is zzso However, the use of animal model systems, in particular transgenic mice, has significantly increased our knowledge of normal and zzso muscle zzso In this review, we focus on the role of zzso in muscle physiology and zzso
