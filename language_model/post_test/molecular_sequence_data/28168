We have identified the domain of the human zzso protein zzso produced in zzso coli that is responsible for the ability of the protein to bind zzso zzso Using analysis of binding of DNA by proteins transferred to zzso zzso zzso and a zzso filter binding zzso we examined the binding properties of zzso peptides generated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of proteins that fuse portions of zzso to zzso protein zzso The results of these analyses indicated that zzso zzso acids 265 to zzso were responsible for DNA binding and that other regions of the protein (including a highly zzso basic region and a region containing the zzso zzso zzso were not zzso Some zzso zzso that did not bind DNA maintained rat zzso zzso activity, which indicated that the zzso property of in zzso DNA binding was not essential for this zzso These zzso however, were unable to transform established rat zzso zzso zzso that were susceptible to transformation by zzso zzso although this lack of activity may not have been due to their inability to bind zzso
