zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso cells undergo a rapid inflammatory response associated with biological and zzso effects including increased zzso oxide production and zzso in zzso zzso By 2 weeks zzso these changes were accompanied by both zzso and zzso of a number of plasma zzso In the experiments reported here, plasma from individual zzso mice was analyzed at several zzso over the zzso period to determine if there were sets of proteins whose expression varied in concert and thus might serve as early zzso for zzso zzso zzso were collected just prior to injection of the zzso cells and then after 4, 8, and 12 zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and the samples were resolved by zzso gel zzso The gels were cut into 20 zzso and the proteins were zzso zzso with zzso The zzso were treated with zzso zzso and then analyzed using zzso The resulting data were processed with two software packages, that is, zzso and zzso Mill, and then subjected to zzso cluster analysis (K zzso zzso The four clusters revealed a set of highly zzso zzso a set of progressively zzso zzso a set with no major changes, and a set that zzso The first cluster included zzso and serum zzso zzso the second included groups with several functions including zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso The zzso results for a selection of the zzso zzso including zzso zzso serum zzso P zzso and zzso were confirmed with Western zzso zzso zzso proteins included zzso zzso and zzso zzso 50% of the zzso proteins are zzso acute phase zzso while the remainder are regulated by the zzso zzso zzso
