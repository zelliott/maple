In this paper we describe a novel 19 zzso zzso protein named zzso The zzso sequence zzso an open reading frame of 167 zzso acids that does not resemble any known zzso zzso against a zzso zzso zzso were used for Western zzso analysis, confirming the presence of this 19 zzso protein in heart and skeletal muscle and revealing an zzso pattern typical of zzso zzso overlapping zzso The frequency of specific zzso clones in different libraries indicates that the zzso transcript is amongst the most abundant in skeletal zzso In human, zzso maps at zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso
