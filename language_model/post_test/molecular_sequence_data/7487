To identify the minimal structural elements necessary for biological activity, the rigid zzso nucleus of the known human zzso virus type 1 zzso reverse zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was subjected to systematic bond zzso to obtain simpler zzso A rational selection and testing of modeled zzso containing these potential zzso zzso led to the discovery of a new series of zzso zzso of zzso The lead compound of this new zzso series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso virus in cell culture at zzso zzso This zzso was also found to inhibit zzso zzso Through an integrated effort involving synthesis and molecular zzso compounds with zzso potency against zzso in cell culture were zzso In these studies, zzso was identified as a potent zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso possessing favorable zzso zzso
