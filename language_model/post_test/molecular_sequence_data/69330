zzso zzso zzso serve as the recognition components of B zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to these receptors leads to dramatic effects on B cell growth and zzso We have examined the structural elements of zzso that are involved in zzso zzso assembly and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in a B cell line led to assembly with the other two known components of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression on the cell surface, and when zzso by zzso zzso stimulation of signal zzso zzso including zzso protein zzso zzso zzso production, and increases in zzso calcium zzso Replacement of the highly zzso zzso 41 zzso acids of zzso heavy chain zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso of human zzso alpha resulted in a zzso which was expressed on the B cell surface at levels comparable to zzso zzso but which did not form a complex with zzso or zzso and did not stimulate any of the signaling reactions mentioned zzso Replacement of the basic zzso zzso domain of zzso m with a different but similarly charged sequence had no effect on zzso expression or signaling zzso On the other hand, removal of the entire zzso domain resulted in a zzso which did not bind zzso and zzso and which did not zzso zzso This effect is probably due to altered zzso processing of this zzso zzso Finally, a series of eight zzso zzso in the zzso domain was zzso Most of these resulted in the removal of zzso groups from zzso zzso zzso to be important for interactions with other zzso Each of these zzso molecules was capable of zzso signals when zzso by zzso but one was partially zzso Since zzso of any single zzso was not sufficient to disrupt signaling completely, the interactions required for signaling are likely to involve multiple zzso so that elimination of one zzso group does not prevent the zzso We propose that the zzso domain of zzso m does not play a critical role in zzso function but that the zzso domain specifies interactions with other zzso probably zzso and zzso required for proper zzso zzso signal zzso
