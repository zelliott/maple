The mechanism for the regulation of zzso protein zzso I zzso zzso I) was investigated using a series of zzso truncated zzso These zzso were expressed in bacteria as fusion proteins with zzso zzso and zzso by affinity zzso using zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso showed complete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited decreasing affinities for zzso and also exhibited decreasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were unable to bind zzso and were zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso active at a slightly higher level zzso than fully active zzso zzso zzso These results indicate the location of the zzso domain on zzso zzso I zzso zzso and predict the existence of an zzso domain near, or zzso the zzso zzso These conclusions were supported by studies which showed that a synthetic zzso zzso zzso I zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of zzso zzso I inhibited the fully active zzso in a manner that was competitive with zzso and also inhibited the zzso active zzso zzso zzso in a manner that was competitive with zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but was zzso with zzso Thus, these results suggest that zzso zzso I is regulated through an zzso mechanism common to other members of the family of zzso protein zzso
