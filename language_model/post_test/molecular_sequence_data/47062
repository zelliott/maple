We have reported previously that zzso protein zzso was zzso in a zzso manner, showing that it was zzso at early zzso at zzso zzso II target zzso To assess the possible involvement of zzso in cell cycle zzso zzso expression zzso was zzso zzso into various zzso Unexpectedly we found that zzso with zzso expression zzso resulted in an abundance of dead zzso zzso examination revealed that these cells had undergone zzso The coincidence of zzso zzso and zzso induction at the individual cell level was confirmed by a zzso zzso To confirm that zzso of zzso was the cause of zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso with the wild zzso The zzso of zzso effectively rescued zzso zzso in a zzso manner, zzso that zzso was truly a specific effect of zzso zzso and not an artifact of the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that neither the zzso zzso domain, which functions in transcription, nor the zzso domain, in which a cluster of various zzso targets exists, is zzso however, the zzso zzso domain is required for the induction of zzso A more precise study indicates that the zzso stretch zzso at the most zzso region of the zzso domain is especially important for the induction of zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso certain signals from the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso roles of zzso zzso and also an zzso of the zzso zzso level in zzso zzso are zzso
