Forward zzso using zzso is a powerful tool for studying zzso development through large-scale zzso Nonetheless, the identification of the molecular zzso is still zzso and involves time-consuming genetic zzso Here, we show that zzso sequencing of the whole zzso zzso can directly locate the zzso carrying the zzso zzso and at the same time pinpoint the molecular zzso The feasibility of this approach was validated by sequencing the zzso zzso line that displays a severe zzso of the zzso zzso We generated 13 zzso of zzso equivalent to an zzso zzso coverage, from a pool of 50 zzso zzso obtained from a zzso between the AB zzso carrier and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso region carrying the zzso zzso was localized based on its unique property to display high levels of zzso among sequence reads as it derives exclusively from the initial AB zzso zzso We developed an zzso identifying such a region by calculating a zzso score along all zzso This highlighted an zzso window on zzso 5 with a score close to 1 in the zzso zzso The sequence analysis of all genes within this zzso revealed a nonsense zzso in the zzso zzso zzso experiments confirmed the assertion that zzso is the gene whose zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, this study constitutes a zzso that zzso sequencing is a fast and effective alternative to the classical zzso cloning strategies in zzso
