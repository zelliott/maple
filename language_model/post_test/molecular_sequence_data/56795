Two zzso of bacterial zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were obtained and its properties were zzso Both zzso provided the high resistance to zzso by zzso Slow zzso of zzso by zzso reveals the presence in zzso zzso of another essential zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso were 16, 16 and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso on zzso was zzso zzso and 20 zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso or Met resulted in increasing of zzso stability at 25 degrees C and decreasing of zzso (above 45 degrees zzso Data obtained show that zzso is unique zzso for providing both zzso zzso and zzso optimal binding of zzso
