We studied whether zzso T cells being restricted by the very similar zzso and/or zzso molecules might demonstrate zzso in parts of their zzso zzso were generated from three individuals who were all zzso zzso Thirty-five zzso specific for zzso or zzso and restricted by zzso and/or zzso were selected for zzso beta gene zzso We found that 19 different V beta genes from 13 V beta families were expressed by these zzso Thus, it seems that many different zzso beta genes may be used by zzso restricted by these zzso zzso For zzso zzso a possible biased usage of V beta 8, as well as possible preferential usage of a zzso zzso were zzso
