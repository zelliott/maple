A zzso structure, formed by a pair of zzso repeats during DNA zzso is a zzso feature at the origin of DNA replication among plant and animal zzso zzso and plasmids that replicate their zzso via the zzso replication zzso zzso In this work, a zzso tandem construct of zzso zzso capable of generating zzso zzso DNA in zzso coli was employed to examine the role of the zzso structure with respect to the zzso initiation and termination zzso The advantage of using a zzso tandem construct is that the initiation and termination sites for generation of the zzso viral zzso are physically zzso which allows independent examination of the zzso zzso zzso substitution zzso analysis showed that a pair of zzso repeats capable of forming a zzso structure was essential for zzso but not for zzso The results also demonstrated that it is the zzso zzso not zzso sequence zzso that is critical for terminating zzso DNA zzso
