A portion of the zzso region of the human zzso B virus zzso zzso is the signal sequence with an zzso secondary structure, which plays a role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso To determine the genetic zzso which occur in the zzso region of zzso we have devised a typing method using a zzso zzso zzso zzso technique with automated zzso zzso zzso Using the cloning sequencing method, we analyzed serum samples from 10 patients with zzso B, and detected three types of zzso including two zzso which are crucial to the function of the zzso zzso position zzso G zzso to A zzso stop zzso position zzso G to A, and zzso We performed zzso analysis of these three types of zzso and described conditions for determination of the zzso which play roles in the zzso of the zzso zzso The two types of zzso zzso and zzso DNA were identified as separate individual zzso zzso The observed migration times of the three types of zzso agreed fairly well with estimates obtained from total zzso secondary structure zzso
