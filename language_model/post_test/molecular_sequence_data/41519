zzso syndrome zzso and zzso syndrome zzso or zzso zzso have both recently been shown to be caused by distinct zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso are de zzso dominant zzso that lead to protein zzso zzso leading to zzso occur in the zzso portion of the last zzso and lead to the expression of a protein without a zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso occur either throughout the zzso leading to zzso zzso or more zzso in the last zzso Features present only in zzso are zzso anomalies of the spine, ribs and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the corpus zzso Features present only in zzso include long thumbs and long great toes and zzso duct zzso Several features occur in both, such as intellectual zzso zzso heart zzso and zzso and zzso zzso We propose that zzso or loss of a function zzso by the zzso domain causes the common features, whereas zzso activities would explain the features unique to zzso Further molecular studies and the compilation of zzso in a database for zzso correlations zzso might help tease out answers to these questions and understand the zzso programs zzso by the different zzso
