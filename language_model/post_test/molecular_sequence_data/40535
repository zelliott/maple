The zzso factor zzso zzso zzso has been designated as a master regulator for the function of regulatory T cells zzso zzso the identification of zzso expression in T cells is indispensable for the study of zzso However, studies on zzso expression in bovine zzso are still zzso probably due to a lack of zzso zzso with reliable performance in flow zzso Our group recently demonstrated that a zzso zzso zzso developed against zzso zzso also binds to zzso zzso and performs well in flow zzso A protein sequence alignment of the binding region of the zzso zzso revealed, that within this region the sequences of zzso and bovine zzso are zzso zzso we tested this zzso for its suitability in flow zzso with bovine peripheral blood zzso cells zzso By using zzso zzso zzso and competition labeling with zzso zzso zzso as negative controls, we readily observed a specific zzso of a small zzso of zzso zzso within zzso zzso with zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that all zzso cells zzso zzso and were in their vast majority zzso However, minor populations of zzso and zzso zzso could also be zzso In zzso our data demonstrate that the zzso zzso is a valuable tool to promote the study of zzso T cells and their biological relevance in zzso
