zzso also known as zzso protein 14 zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso is a human zzso with potent zzso and contraceptive zzso In this paper we report the first characterization of zzso zzso Using strategies based upon fast atom zzso and zzso mass zzso we have established that zzso is zzso at zzso and zzso The zzso site carries high zzso hybrid and zzso structures, whereas the second site is exclusively occupied by zzso zzso The major zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are: Gal beta zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso zzso zzso Gal beta zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso alpha zzso zzso analogue of zzso It is possible that the zzso bearing zzso zzso or zzso antennae may manifest zzso effects by specifically blocking adhesive and zzso events zzso by zzso the human B cell associated zzso zzso with zzso zzso antennae have previously been shown to zzso block zzso zzso and may perform the same function in zzso The potent zzso effect of zzso on initial human zzso zzso binding is consistent with our previous suggestion that this cell zzso event requires a zzso zzso zzso This result also raises the possibility that a convergence between immune and zzso recognition processes may have occurred in the types of zzso zzso recognized in the zzso
