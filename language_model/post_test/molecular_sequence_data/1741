zzso and retinal zzso zzso zzso cells are of zzso origin with highly specialized functions in light zzso Identification and characterization of genes zzso expressed in these cells will greatly aid our understanding of their functional roles in retinal zzso As a source enriched for gene transcripts from the zzso we generated a human zzso and a bovine zzso zzso library applying the zzso technique of suppression zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso clones resulted in the identification of 321 and zzso zzso human zzso zzso Of these, only 27 genes were in common between the two zzso zzso One transcript expressed exclusively in zzso and zzso is the novel gene zzso which is comprised of four zzso on zzso zzso We report the full-length cloning of two zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso both of which contain four identical open reading frames zzso While zzso 1 to 3 show no zzso to known proteins or protein zzso zzso reveals 50% sequence identity to zzso a hypothetical protein on zzso with unknown zzso We demonstrate that both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso libraries are excellent resources for identifying known and novel genes exclusively or abundantly expressed in the zzso zzso In combination with other approaches such as zzso analysis or serial analysis of gene expression zzso the availability of highly sensitive and specific zzso zzso libraries will facilitate the comprehensive description of the zzso zzso
