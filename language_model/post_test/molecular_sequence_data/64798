We have previously found that the zzso of zzso zzso is a strong and selective inhibitor of the zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso by its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We further performed molecular dynamics calculations on the zzso structure of zzso free and bound to an inhibitor that blocks its ability to inhibit the zzso zzso We thus identified 4 putative zzso that may be involved in the interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (with 2 overlapping zzso zzso and zzso and zzso We have zzso each of these zzso and tested them for their abilities to affect the zzso system, first in a zzso zzso We find that peptides corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso strongly inhibit the binding of zzso to the zzso complex but do not inhibit zzso zzso of zzso while peptides corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso do not inhibit zzso binding but, except for the zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibit zzso zzso A control zzso zzso had no effect on either zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso appear to be selective for the zzso system since the zzso zzso has no effect on other zzso systems zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three of the domain zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been attached on their zzso ends to a zzso zzso enabling zzso transport into cells, and have been introduced into human zzso in which zzso was activated with zzso We find that the zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso has no zzso the zzso zzso has a weak effect on this zzso Thus, the effects in cells parallel those in the zzso zzso We conclude that all putative zzso identified in our prior structural studies, appear to interact with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso may be useful in selectively blocking uncontrolled zzso signaling involving the zzso zzso and may be a potential agent for blocking zzso zzso cell zzso
