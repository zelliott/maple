By screening an expression library of the zzso form of zzso zzso with a serum directed against whole zzso cells, a zzso zzso zzso zzso a stress protein of zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The cloned sequence zzso identified a single open reading frame with a length of zzso zzso coding for a protein containing 656 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was zzso similar to the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes one member of the zzso heat shock protein zzso zzso The relevant gene zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was localized on the zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso was expressed after heat zzso as demonstrated by Northern zzso zzso and reverse zzso with specific pairs of zzso sequences and gene zzso A zzso protein was obtained in zzso coli after cloning of the full coding sequence into the zzso site of the zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso affinity zzso The zzso protein zzso was efficiently recognized in zzso by a zzso zzso directed against a common zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as by zzso from normal human zzso Moreover, immune mouse zzso against the zzso zzso protein recognized native, zzso constituents with sizes of around 70 zzso in zzso protein extracts of zzso zzso Overall, our data demonstrate that zzso encodes one member of a family of proteins zzso which usually represent highly zzso zzso zzso of infectious zzso
