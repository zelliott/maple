zzso proteins zzso from the zzso cells that surround the zzso form a large zzso assembly which is important for protecting and sustaining the structure of the zzso and the developing zzso These proteins have been classified into two major families (A and zzso zzso analysis showed conservation of a central domain containing long stretches of six zzso acid zzso repeats in both families, which have been suggested to be organized in zzso zzso In this work zzso and CD zzso as well as molecular calculations, have been used to investigate the zzso properties of two synthetic peptides (A and B), zzso of parts of the central domain of zzso zzso proteins of the A and B families, zzso These peptides consist of three tandem repeats of the zzso basic zzso Analysis of CD zzso of the two peptides in zzso solutions and zzso with organic zzso revealed zzso and turn structural elements with a percentage higher than zzso zzso zzso at low temperatures zzso zzso show sequential zzso zzso zzso i + 1), indicative of a relative zzso The presence of zzso zzso and medium zzso zzso chemical shift zzso and temperature zzso data zzso for the first time, experimental evidence that local folded structures around zzso zzso occur in zzso segments of zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso calculations were used to examine the zzso space of the peptides and to probe the initial steps of zzso zzso formation in the case of zzso zzso
