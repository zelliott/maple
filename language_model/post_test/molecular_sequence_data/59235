The specificity of zzso binding to zzso molecules is defined by binding motifs composed of several relatively zzso anchor zzso The zzso binding motifs of zzso zzso class II I-A molecules are functionally important but poorly zzso Here we use zzso binding studies and isolation of naturally presented peptides to characterize the zzso binding motif of the zzso class II I-A zzso zzso a zzso that is involved in experimental zzso in the Lewis zzso We now report that, similar to other class II zzso the zzso motif consists of a zzso sequence with four major anchor positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso and zzso rather than at zzso appeared to be particularly important for zzso zzso charged zzso were favored at zzso consistent with the presence of a zzso at position 57 of the zzso beta zzso This zzso motif could be observed in the dominant zzso T cell zzso mapped previously in the Lewis zzso These results highlight a general similarity and some important differences in the organization of zzso class II zzso binding zzso The reported zzso motif should facilitate the prediction and design of T cell zzso for the induction and control of experimental zzso diseases in Lewis rat zzso
