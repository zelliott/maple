Two distinct forms of zzso zzso rat zzso zzso were cloned from an adrenal zzso tissue zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences showed that one of the zzso zzso zzso had a long extension zzso composed of 34 zzso acid zzso while the other zzso zzso had an extension zzso identical to that of rat zzso zzso zzso at the zzso position of zzso zzso was replaced with zzso in zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso was highly zzso zzso to rat zzso zzso Constructed expression zzso containing the zzso for extension zzso of zzso zzso and the mature protein of zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso The cells converted zzso into zzso zzso and zzso
