Two zzso zzso virus zzso Miller zzso zzso clones were identified and their zzso sequences zzso The clones were zzso and were located in the zzso region of the S zzso zzso The zzso clone zzso contained zzso zzso of the S zzso gene and had zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence zzso with the Purdue zzso strain of zzso and over zzso sequence zzso with zzso infectious zzso virus zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained 267 zzso of the S zzso zzso It had zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence zzso with zzso but only a zzso zzso sequence zzso and a zzso zzso acid sequence zzso with zzso Using dot zzso zzso a probe prepared from zzso could differentiate zzso from the zzso related zzso zzso zzso enteric coronavirus and canine zzso This probe could also differentiate zzso from zzso respiratory coronavirus zzso Using zzso chain reaction amplified regions of zzso zzso and zzso sequencing, a zzso zzso deletion in the zzso region of the S gene from zzso isolate zzso was zzso This deletion was located in the area of the S zzso gene identified by the zzso zzso
