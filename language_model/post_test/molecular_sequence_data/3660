zzso DNA binding proteins zzso have been identified in all three zzso of zzso Here, we report the identification of a novel zzso zzso protein that is distinctly different from its zzso zzso Rather than zzso four zzso zzso and a zzso motif within a single zzso of 645 zzso zzso as for zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso has a single zzso domain in a zzso of just 148 zzso acids with a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso to zzso and found to form zzso in solution, suggesting a zzso structure analogous to that of zzso coli zzso zzso possessing zzso zzso more similar to those of zzso zzso zzso A zzso We demonstrate zzso binding of zzso to zzso at high temperature with an apparent site size of approximately five zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the protein is functional both in zzso and in zzso stimulating zzso zzso DNA zzso and rescuing the zzso lethal zzso of zzso coli zzso We discuss possible evolutionary relationships amongst the various members of the zzso zzso
