Previous studies indicated that zzso of zzso avian zzso cannot induce zzso transformation of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we isolated and characterized novel spontaneously derived transforming zzso of avian zzso from a Syrian zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso with the avian zzso zzso zzso independently derived zzso zzso cell clones were injected into zzso nude zzso After a zzso period, tumors eventually arose and were established in zzso The zzso zzso was always accompanied by the presence of the avian zzso DNA and functional expression of zzso However, most of the zzso cell lines expressed an zzso altered form of zzso suggesting zzso in zzso zzso with this hypothesis, zzso isolated from the zzso lines, but not the parental zzso cell lines, zzso transformed zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso We characterized zzso in detail from three of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two of these lines contained zzso within the zzso zzso coding zzso Line zzso has an internal repeat of 29 zzso acids immediately following zzso which zzso the spacing between the end of the zzso domain and zzso the negative regulatory site in zzso Line zzso has a zzso deletion following zzso which results in loss of zzso However, the DNA sequence of the coding region of zzso from a third line, zzso was completely wild zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of the altered zzso from lines zzso and zzso showed that zzso the site of negative regulation of zzso is not zzso but zzso the site of in zzso zzso is zzso However, in line zzso zzso was zzso and zzso was zzso to a lesser zzso Additionally, two proteins that indicate zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in at least six of the zzso cell lines, although to a lesser extent in line zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso correlate with zzso of zzso in the zzso lines zzso and zzso zzso However, in line zzso the high levels of zzso in combination with a partial zzso of the zzso protein as indicated by zzso of zzso appear to be involved in the zzso process, rather than zzso
