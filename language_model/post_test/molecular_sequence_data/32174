zzso animals protect cellular architecture and zzso machinery in the dry state, yet the molecular repertoire supporting this profound zzso tolerance is not fully zzso For the zzso zzso zzso zzso we report differential expression of two distinct zzso zzso for proteins that share sequence similarities and structural features with zzso abundant zzso proteins originally discovered in zzso zzso analyses support assignment of the zzso proteins from zzso zzso to group zzso This zzso species is the most highly evolved animal for which zzso gene expression has been zzso It is becoming clear that an ensemble of zzso and zzso is important for establishing the physical conditions required for cellular stabilization during drying in zzso
