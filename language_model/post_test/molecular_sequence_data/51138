While conventional zzso zzso and zzso named according to their zzso are expressed in almost every zzso zzso of newly identified zzso which has a significant sequence similarity to the conventional zzso large zzso is abundantly expressed only in skeletal zzso In addition to this specific zzso zzso is distinct from conventional zzso in that it contains three unique regions showing no similarity to conventional zzso zzso When rat and human zzso are zzso overall sequence similarity is zzso which is close to those for zzso and zzso large zzso zzso and zzso between human and zzso respectively, suggesting the evolutionary importance of zzso These zzso large zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be considered to constitute a super family, whose zzso zzso and zzso represent the three major zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family members, including the recently reported zzso zzso are zzso Their evolutionary correlation and function are discussed on the basis of the results thus far zzso
