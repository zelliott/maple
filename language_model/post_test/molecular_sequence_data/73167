The zzso zzso originally identified as the transforming gene of the avian zzso zzso encodes a protein with a zzso zzso zzso structure which is a typical motif for protein zzso and DNA zzso The zzso protein forms zzso and sometimes zzso with some zzso proteins and works as a zzso zzso Recent studies of zzso expression of cellular zzso family proteins suggest that zzso proteins play important roles in early development and cell zzso In our previous studies, two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated from a rat liver zzso library which zzso the investigation of zzso roles of zzso as well as their target genes in zzso We determine here the binding DNA sequences of zzso and zzso zzso zzso recognizes a number of sequences containing a short consensus zzso zzso half of the zzso recognition element zzso which has been previously identified for zzso On the other hand, binding sequences of zzso are limited and zzso binds to the zzso zzso It is shown that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso or zzso family proteins are zzso zzso efficiently forms zzso with zzso family zzso Compared to the case of zzso though the zzso specificity of the zzso depends on the kind of counterpart binding to zzso a wide variety of target sequences are available for zzso In contrast, zzso shows restricted zzso specificity and zzso zzso so that the target genes for zzso are considered to be much more zzso
