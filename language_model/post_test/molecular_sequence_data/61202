The global zzso repair zzso zzso of zzso zzso repair zzso is capable of removing zzso throughout the zzso In zzso zzso the zzso and zzso genes are essential for zzso Here we identify zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso the previously cloned zzso zzso located very close together and are transcribed in opposite zzso Upon zzso zzso both genes are zzso reaching a maximum level after zzso zzso These observations suggest that the genes are zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso deficient cells are, in contrast to zzso zzso and zzso zzso not sensitive to zzso zzso In zzso an alternative repair zzso zzso damage repair zzso is capable of efficiently removing zzso from zzso In the absence of this zzso zzso both zzso and zzso deficient cells display an enhanced zzso zzso zzso analyses show that zzso zzso zzso zzso only involved in zzso zzso analyses at zzso resolution demonstrate that both zzso and zzso probably acting in a complex, are essential for zzso in zzso
