The best-known zzso zzso zzso is the Weizmann zzso zzso zzso which was used for zzso industrial zzso In the past two decades, cultures of zzso zzso from various culture collections have included organisms that were isolated for sugar zzso industrial zzso zzso Recent zzso and genetic studies have revealed significant differences among some of these zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso to analyze 39 cultures of zzso zzso and zzso similar organisms from major zzso The results of this study clearly identified four groups intergroup zzso values of less than zzso All of the zzso values except the value for one strain were zzso or more, which supported species status for each zzso The zzso zzso group (with zzso zzso as the type zzso consisted of 17 cultures and had average zzso values of zzso with the other three zzso All strains of zzso zzso produced zzso in milk, and the cultures were bright yellow, which is useful for zzso this species from the other three zzso The zzso zzso group (with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso consisted of 16 cultures and included strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 262 and zzso zzso constituted the third group, whereas strain zzso zzso zzso and its zzso strain zzso formed the fourth zzso At present, the last two groups are each represented by only one independent zzso definitive descriptions of these two groups as two new or revived species will require further zzso zzso as well as identification of additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used in industrial zzso production from zzso which confirms that the new organisms used for the zzso processes are distinct from zzso zzso
