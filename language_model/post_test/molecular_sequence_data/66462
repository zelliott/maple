The zzso status of populations of zzso penguins zzso zzso is still zzso Northern populations differ from southern ones in breeding zzso song characteristics and head ornaments used as mating zzso We conducted a molecular analysis using zzso DNA sequencing to test if there is a gene flow barrier between northern zzso populations and southern zzso populations in relation to the zzso zzso a major ecological boundary for marine zzso zzso of the control region and the zzso gene were zzso in zzso penguins and in the macaroni penguin zzso zzso a closely related zzso zzso distances and zzso analyses showed a clear split into three zzso two zzso zzso and the macaroni zzso Moreover, zzso and gene flow estimates also suggested genetic structuring within the northern zzso Our results add further support to the notion that the two zzso penguin zzso often considered as two subspecies, can be recognized as two species zzso zzso and zzso zzso The divergence in mating signals found between these two zzso seems to have occurred recently and relatively zzso Thus, the zzso changes may have been enough to isolate these zzso without the need for zzso zzso The findings have important zzso zzso since zzso zzso is far less abundant than zzso zzso but more populations may warrant an zzso to endangered status if full species status should be recognized for more zzso
