Recently, the binding sequence zzso zzso was found adjacent to the zzso sequence in zzso suggesting involvement in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso functions of a synthetic zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso and to examine potential applications in bone zzso The zzso zzso significantly enhanced the zzso and proliferation of several human zzso cells including bone zzso zzso stem cells, and zzso zzso was involved in cell attachment to the zzso Additionally, the zzso reduced the number of zzso zzso cells during zzso of zzso cells and normal zzso zzso and also suppressed zzso activity and expression of zzso zzso When standardized bone defects in rat zzso were filled with a collagen sponge containing the zzso or PBS zzso the number of zzso zzso in the grafted sites after 3 weeks was significantly lower in the zzso zzso By the 5th week, significantly enhanced zzso of the grafted collagen sponge and new bone formation was observed within and surrounding the sponge in the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is an effective zzso zzso for bone tissue zzso that promotes attachment and proliferation of zzso cells while also suppressing zzso
