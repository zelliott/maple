The regulation of zzso influx through the zzso of the zzso zzso channel, zzso is important for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is thought to be the target of multiple zzso that mediate the signals of both the zzso and sympathetic nervous zzso zzso zzso information regarding the protein zzso reactions involved in the regulation of zzso is zzso The protein zzso C zzso family of zzso can zzso cardiac zzso in a complex manner, such that zzso is either enhanced or depressed and relaxation is either accelerated or zzso We have previously reported that zzso in the zzso of zzso was a target for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of seven zzso zzso sites within the zzso zzso Using zzso specific zzso to zzso and zzso we demonstrate that both sites within the zzso are zzso in zzso cells in response to zzso zzso was inhibited with a zzso zzso zzso In zzso rat hearts, both zzso and zzso were zzso in response to zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso is zzso zzso specific, as only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso were able to zzso this zzso Our results identify a molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso can have different effects on channel activity by zzso different zzso
