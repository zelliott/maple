zzso by zzso zzso is of major ecological and agricultural importance, responsible for producing a substantial fraction of the zzso zzso On the basis of zzso studies, it had been generally accepted that ammonium is the sole zzso product of zzso by the zzso and that the plant is responsible for assimilating it into zzso zzso However, this paradigm has been challenged in a recent zzso study showing that soybean zzso only zzso zzso zzso nitrogen zzso has only been assessed from in zzso zzso studies of isolated zzso We show that both ammonium and zzso are zzso by pea zzso The in zzso zzso between them will depend on whether the system is open or closed, as well as the ammonium concentration and zzso zzso To overcome these limitations we identified and zzso the gene for zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that zzso is the primary route for zzso synthesis in isolated zzso zzso of the zzso zzso fix nitrogen but only zzso ammonium at a significant rate, resulting in lower total nitrogen zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso are green and healthy, demonstrating that ammonium zzso by zzso can provide sufficient nitrogen for plant zzso However, plants zzso with the zzso are reduced in biomass compared with those zzso with the wild zzso The zzso and plant growth studies suggest that zzso synthesis and zzso contributes to the efficiency of zzso and therefore biomass zzso
