A gene from the marine zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso and also the zzso zzso zzso of the model zzso zzso The zzso was unusual in its ability to employ either zzso or zzso as zzso zzso The zzso and zzso values for zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso However, zzso zzso value for the zzso zzso in the presence of 100 zzso zzso was 17 times greater for zzso than for zzso zzso zzso the quantitative conversion of 5 zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso recycling system, to give the zzso and zzso zzso products of zzso reaction in a ratio of zzso albeit with poor zzso The conversion with zzso was zzso zzso also zzso the zzso transformation of zzso aromatic zzso giving in the best case, zzso zzso for the transformation of zzso zzso zzso to its R zzso The structure of zzso reveals that the relaxation in zzso specificity appears to be accomplished by the substitution of an zzso zzso responsible for recognition of the zzso on the zzso zzso in related zzso zzso with a zzso zzso in zzso zzso is thus representative of a separate class of zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso from which possible sequences and strategies for developing zzso zzso for zzso zzso reactions might be zzso
