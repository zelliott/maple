zzso zzso is a human counterpart of the mouse zzso inflammatory protein 1 zzso stem cell zzso zzso of the zzso alpha and zzso beta genes showed similar zzso activities in two zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso but the induction mechanisms differed between the two cell zzso Further characterization of the zzso alpha promoter indicated that multiple positive and negative regulatory elements are present, some of which are zzso required for induction and repression of the promoter activity in different zzso One of the negative regulatory zzso zzso functioned in both cell lines in the absence and presence of stimulation and was shown to be a recognition site for positive and negative zzso zzso This zzso element contained a direct zzso and similar repeats were also found in the negative regulatory elements of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso gene zzso Nuclear extracts from zzso and zzso cells formed several zzso complexes with the zzso alpha zzso element, one of which was also observed with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from in zzso and in zzso analyses suggested that the protein forming this complex functions as a negative zzso The binding affinity of this zzso zzso to the zzso alpha zzso element was low and was significantly affected by the incubation temperature and the salt concentration in the binding zzso zzso another protein bound specifically by the zzso alpha zzso element, was shown to be a positive factor important for induction of the zzso These results suggested that zzso plays an important role in balanced expression of zzso zzso and zzso during zzso cell growth and zzso
