Recent studies showed that deletion of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso results in a strain that is resistant to zzso indicating that zzso is important for the toxic action of this zzso To determine if zzso resistance in house flies was due to a zzso of zzso (the zzso of zzso from house zzso zzso were cloned and characterized from an zzso and a zzso strain of the house fly, zzso zzso The zzso contain a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso untranslated region zzso and a zzso zzso of approximately 371 zzso The predicted mature protein possesses zzso zzso acid zzso has the typical features of a zzso alpha zzso and is zzso identical to zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis revealed that zzso was expressed in the head and the zzso at zzso and zzso higher levels, respectively, than in the zzso There was no difference in the expression level of zzso between zzso and susceptible zzso Ten zzso arising from alternative zzso were zzso with zzso II being most zzso zzso zzso editing was examined and found at 12 sites: editing at 11 of these sites resulted in an zzso acid zzso zzso is linked to zzso 1 zzso resistance was previously shown to be linked to zzso zzso Single zzso zzso alternative zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso editing were compared between head and zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso These comparisons indicate that zzso is not responsible for zzso resistance in house zzso
