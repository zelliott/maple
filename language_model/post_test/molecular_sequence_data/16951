We report the identification and functional analysis of a type II zzso zzso zzso zzso by the mouse zzso expressed in zzso cell zzso zzso 1 zzso and the definition of a cluster of seven zzso zzso genes within a zzso region of mouse zzso zzso This locus is zzso to a region of human zzso zzso containing the human zzso of four of the mouse zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that all seven zzso genes zzso functional zzso zzso zzso cloning showed that mouse zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso with an zzso signal anchor, a SEA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The mouse zzso zzso was present in zzso zzso and male zzso zzso and directed the translation of a zzso zzso zzso protein with type II zzso Mouse zzso was zzso in insect cells as a zzso that could be activated by exposure to zzso The zzso activated zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso showing a preference for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was abolished by generic zzso of zzso zzso but not by other classes of zzso zzso Most interestingly, zzso formed stable zzso complexes with both zzso zzso zzso and protein C inhibitor that are expressed in the same zzso with zzso suggesting that type II zzso zzso zzso may be novel targets for zzso zzso Together, these data show that mouse zzso encodes a functional cell surface zzso zzso that may have important functions in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
