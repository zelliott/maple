Multiple targeted gene replacements are often required for functional analyses of zzso zzso For this purpose, we previously devised a simple genetic method, termed zzso gene replacement, in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for construction of zzso free from drug resistance zzso Here, we improved the method by employing a zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene was zzso only when it was expressed under the strong promoter of zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso bearing a zzso zzso zzso Transformation of the zzso zzso strains with zzso template plasmids permitted the selection of zzso with gene replacement at zzso up to 50% among zzso zzso
