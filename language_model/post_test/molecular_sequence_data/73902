A 300 zzso probe generated by the zzso was derived from rabbit zzso DNA using zzso from a highly zzso region of the DNA for human factor X zzso The probe was used in northern zzso analysis of liver zzso to demonstrate an zzso species of zzso zzso for the rabbit factor X and subsequently for isolation and characterization of the zzso for rabbit factor X zzso from a zzso zzso II zzso library generated from rabbit liver zzso The zzso contains 22 bases upstream from the zzso initiation zzso zzso zzso of open reading frame, a stop zzso and a 3' zzso zzso zzso The zzso codes for a zzso zzso region, followed by a zzso mature zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows a high degree of zzso with the sequence of zzso zzso peptides derived from interactive sites of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso exerted degrees of zzso of zzso zzso which showed a dependence on extent of zzso with the corresponding regions of zzso
