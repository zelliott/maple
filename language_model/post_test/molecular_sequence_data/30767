zzso zzso zzso clones were screened using zzso against zzso zzso from a zzso library of zzso anterior zzso and their zzso sequences were determined by the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso untranslated region and part of the signal zzso region were determined by direct zzso sequencing with reverse zzso The composite sequence of zzso zzso showed a signal sequence of 30 zzso acids and a further 199 zzso acids corresponding to the mature zzso zzso The predicted sequence confirmed the zzso acid sequence determined previously by direct protein analysis, except for one zzso form at zzso 122 zzso instead of the reported zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the length of the zzso zzso zzso was about zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid sequence showed 81, 80, 64, 62, 80 and zzso zzso with human, zzso zzso zzso chick and salmon forms zzso The identical zzso acid zzso showed marked zzso in four zzso two of which are highly zzso throughout a wide range of zzso The zzso and secondary structure of zzso zzso were zzso and compared with those of zzso zzso which shares the same ancestral zzso The two highly zzso regions of both hormones showed similar zzso and the predicted secondary structures indicated that these regions in each hormone form different structures with differences in extension of the zzso zzso outside the zzso
