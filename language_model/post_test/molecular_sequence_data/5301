The zzso zzso zzso is localized on the cell membrane of mature zzso and is also expressed in the zzso zone of developing zzso To characterize and follow the zzso cells during development, we examined the mouse spinal zzso by in zzso zzso and zzso At embryonic day zzso 11 and zzso cells expressing zzso zzso were present only in the zzso zone, where zzso zzso was associated with most of the cell bodies of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was detected in zzso processes running through the mantle and marginal zzso From this characteristic zzso zzso cells at early stages were judged to be zzso zzso zzso At zzso cells expressing zzso zzso first appeared in the mantle zone, and zzso zzso or zzso zzso were formed along the zzso zzso From zzso to zzso day zzso 7, zzso zzso or its zzso gradually decreased from the zzso zone and disappeared from zzso zzso whereas cells with zzso zzso spread all over the mantle zone and zzso zzso zzso predominated in the zzso At zzso zzso cells were zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso an intermediate filament specific to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is expressed from zzso zzso through zzso during spinal zzso zzso Furthermore, the distinct changes in the cell position and zzso suggest that both the migration and transformation of zzso zzso cells begin in the spinal zzso between zzso and zzso when the active stage of zzso migration is zzso
