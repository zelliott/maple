The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso zzso zzso directly zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso complexes and/or interferes physically with zzso zzso by zzso Interestingly, the expression level of zzso zzso was zzso in resting Go zzso and rapidly declined following zzso zzso We report here the cloning of zzso gene from zzso zzso DNA and the functional analysis of the promoter of the zzso zzso The gene consists of at least three zzso and spans more than zzso zzso of zzso zzso extension and zzso zzso protection analysis revealed two major zzso initiation zzso The promoter region lacked a zzso box but contained potential binding sites for the zzso factors including two zzso zzso zzso and zzso located at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To analyze the regulatory mechanisms controlling zzso gene zzso we characterized the zzso region from zzso zzso to zzso The zzso to zzso region contained positive regulatory zzso
