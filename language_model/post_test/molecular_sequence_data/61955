zzso zzso is an zzso zzso neurological disorder caused by zzso in the zzso zzso Classical zzso zzso zzso I) delete entire zzso during zzso zzso In this report, we describe nine examples of zzso zzso zzso in 12 zzso patients and compare zzso changes to estimates of zzso junction strengths based on maximum zzso zzso These zzso fall into three zzso zzso insertions zzso zzso single zzso changes within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso changes that disrupt the zzso 3' zzso sequence and lead to partial zzso deletion zzso zzso Four patients with a previously reported type II zzso zzso all shared a common founder zzso Three patients with apparent zzso or silent zzso actually had type III zzso zzso and partial deletion of an zzso Five patients had type IV zzso that could have been zzso as classical zzso zzso Instead, their zzso disrupt a zzso site and use another AG zzso site located nearby within the zzso they lead to partial deletions at the beginning of zzso These zzso zzso zzso create zzso that result in premature termination zzso Without screening zzso or using accurate models of zzso site strength, the consequences of these zzso zzso cannot be reliably zzso This may lead to further zzso of zzso correlations and may subsequently impact upon zzso therapeutic zzso
