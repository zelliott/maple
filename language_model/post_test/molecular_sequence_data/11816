zzso growth factor zzso lacks a classical signal sequence to direct its zzso yet zzso high affinity cell surface receptors to signal its zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have previously reported that zzso is released in response to temperature stress as a zzso zzso through a zzso that is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso Gamble, zzso Friedman, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to further characterize this unconventional zzso zzso we sought to define the zzso zzso critical for zzso zzso formation and release and to determine whether zzso can associate with known zzso components of zzso or plasma zzso which may be disturbed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we were able to demonstrate that zzso zzso is critical for zzso release in response to heat zzso In addition, using solid phase zzso binding zzso we demonstrate that zzso is able to specifically associate with zzso zzso zzso zzso the association between zzso and zzso and synthetic zzso competition zzso suggest that the zzso domain of zzso lies between zzso 114 and zzso These observations indicate that zzso may be able to associate with the zzso component of zzso and/or plasma zzso and that the zzso responsible for zzso zzso formation and zzso binding are structurally zzso
