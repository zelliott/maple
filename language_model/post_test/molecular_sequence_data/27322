zzso zzso calcium channels play critical roles in the control of membrane zzso gene zzso and muscle zzso These channels show diverse functional properties generated by alternative zzso at multiple sites within the zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms controlling this zzso are not zzso We find that two zzso in the zzso channel are controlled in part by members of the Fox family of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 33 zzso distinct zzso properties on the channel and show opposite patterns of regulation during cortical development, with zzso zzso progressively decreasing its inclusion in the zzso zzso over time and zzso 33 progressively zzso Both zzso contain Fox protein binding elements within their adjacent zzso and Fox protein expression is induced in cortical zzso in parallel with the changes in zzso zzso We show that knocking down expression of Fox proteins in tissue culture cells has opposite effects on zzso zzso and zzso The loss of Fox protein increases zzso zzso zzso and decreases zzso 33, as predicted by the positions of the Fox binding elements and by the pattern of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and enhances zzso 33 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso These effects of Fox proteins on zzso zzso and 33 can be zzso in zzso zzso zzso Both the repressive and the enhancing effects of Fox proteins are dependent on the Fox binding elements within and adjacent to the target zzso indicating that the Fox proteins are directly regulating both zzso These results demonstrate that the Fox protein family is playing a key role in tuning the properties of zzso calcium channels during zzso zzso
