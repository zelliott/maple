To report the clinical, zzso zzso and genetic characteristics of zzso syndrome zzso in a Chilean family and to investigate the zzso of open angle glaucoma zzso and zzso hypertension zzso in the family zzso 

Five family members affected with zzso and two unaffected members underwent a complete zzso examination, including computerized visual field, optical zzso zzso zzso of the zzso disc and ultrasound zzso Renal function was assessed by zzso and blood zzso zzso evaluations were also performed, including zzso studies of the zzso elbow and hip zzso zzso DNA was extracted from peripheral zzso of the five affected and two unaffected family zzso zzso 2-6 of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso gene were screened for zzso by DNA sequencing of the zzso We also screened for zzso in zzso 2 by zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso of the other participants and 91 blood zzso 

Five living family members from three generations were positively diagnosed with zzso three of them with varying degrees of zzso and one with zzso zzso nerve fiber layer zzso thickness measured by spectral domain zzso was below normal values in three zzso All subjects evaluated had normal zzso zzso zzso clinical, and zzso zzso were compatible with zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso 6 of zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changing zzso to zzso within zzso 2 in zzso 65 zzso of the coding zzso This zzso was present in all zzso subjects and absent in the unaffected family members and in 91 Chilean blood zzso 

This is the first report of zzso zzso zzso in zzso in a Chilean family with zzso and the second zzso The zzso associated with this zzso is variable within the family, although we noted a close connection between the presence of the zzso zzso zzso and the presence of zzso or zzso and probably also with an early onset of zzso in patients with zzso All subjects older than 21 years had either zzso or zzso We also suggest that the zzso zzso may be related to affective zzso
