The majority of chicken repetitive sequence is zzso sequence zzso which resides in a large number of zzso zzso zzso and is absent from zzso zzso zzso and some of the intermediate zzso zzso Two repetitive families, zzso are confined to the zzso W zzso The core repeat units of the three families are 21 zzso containing zzso and zzso clusters separated by zzso zzso In this article, we describe the isolation and initial characterization of a novel repeat family that is related to zzso zzso The novel family, designated as zzso consists of multiple types of partially zzso repeat units of about zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequence is restricted to chicken zzso 8, and accounts for about zzso zzso or zzso copies of the zzso units, of the chicken zzso The evolution of zzso and related sequences is zzso
