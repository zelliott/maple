This paper zzso to our knowledge, the first zzso DNA sequencing method that zzso the product of interest during each zzso cycle, allowing it to overcome the critical obstacles that impede alternative zzso approaches to DNA zzso loss of product and the zzso of background signal due to incomplete zzso It can sequence numerous zzso zzso DNA segments in parallel without gel resolution of DNA fragments and can sequence DNA that is almost entirely zzso preventing the secondary structures that impede sequencing by zzso This method uses zzso of an zzso containing the recognition domain for a zzso restriction zzso and zzso with a zzso restriction zzso that recognizes the zzso recognition zzso This generates a set of DNA templates that are each composed of a short zzso positioned at a fixed zzso with respect to one end of the original zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso a unique sequence during each zzso cycle, so that the zzso chain reaction can be used to zzso the desired zzso before zzso restriction zzso zzso Following zzso restriction zzso zzso sequencing of a zzso in each zzso occurs by zzso zzso during zzso zzso or through a separate zzso zzso step with labeled zzso DNA sequencing occurs in strides determined by the number of zzso separating the recognition and zzso zzso for the zzso restriction zzso zzso in the zzso zzso maximizing the span of DNA zzso for a given number of zzso zzso This method allows the concurrent sequencing of numerous zzso segments in a zzso format, and in the future it can be adapted to zzso zzso
