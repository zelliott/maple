The zzso plant zzso known as zzso play important roles in agriculture, zzso and human zzso Despite an advanced zzso understanding of the zzso pathway, the source of the reduced sulfur atom in the core zzso structure remains zzso Recent evidence has pointed toward zzso which would require further involvement of a zzso zzso processing zzso In this article, we show that an zzso zzso zzso impaired in the production of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso has altered zzso levels and accumulates up to 10 related zzso zzso We also show that the double zzso is impaired in the production of zzso and accumulates high amounts of the zzso intermediate zzso upon zzso In addition, we demonstrate that the cellular and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso matches that of known zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we show that the zzso zzso zzso can metabolize at least nine of the 10 zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is the sulfur donor in the zzso of zzso and establish an in zzso function for the only known zzso plant zzso zzso zzso the processing of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso
