zzso tight junctions regulate zzso diffusion and restrict the zzso of zzso and zzso plasma membrane zzso We now identify a zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that binds to the zzso domain of zzso a zzso protein of tight zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus and at tight zzso and binds to sequences of specific promoters containing an zzso zzso zzso In reporter zzso zzso and zzso functionally interact in the regulation of the zzso promoter in a cell zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso control expression of zzso zzso and function in the regulation of zzso zzso These data indicate that tight junctions directly participate in the control of gene expression and suggest that they function in the regulation of zzso cell zzso
