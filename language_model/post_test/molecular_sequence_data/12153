zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso with derivatives of the complementary zzso zzso zzso and zzso bearing a zzso of zzso attached to the terminal zzso zzso I, II, and III, zzso was studied at 37 degrees zzso It was established that during zzso the zzso are zzso zzso their affinity to the zzso A kinetic equation describing the modification was zzso From the dependence of the zzso modification level on the zzso zzso the association zzso of the zzso with the target were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso I, II, and III, zzso and the efficiency of the modification in the complex gamma ef zzso zzso for all the zzso were zzso From the dependence of the modification level zzso on time for zzso II, the rate constant was determined for the zzso step of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is close to the rate constant for the zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
