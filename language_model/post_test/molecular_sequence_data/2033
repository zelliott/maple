zzso mouse zzso cells incubated in an zzso buffer with cloned DNA capture DNA molecules over a 15 zzso zzso zzso incubated with zzso zzso in either circular or linear form were used to zzso mouse eggs in zzso zzso complementary to zzso were identified in approximately zzso of 250 progeny by Southern zzso A zzso library was constructed from the DNA of a positive zzso Three positive clones were identified and two adjacent zzso restriction fragments of 240 and 370 zzso showed identical sequences to the corresponding fragments of the zzso zzso F1 progeny showed paternal and maternal transmission of the zzso from zzso zzso gene expression was detected on zzso of adult F1 individuals, zzso on tails and zzso We conclude that transgenic mice can be obtained using zzso cells as foreign DNA zzso
