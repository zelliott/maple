Here we report functional characterization of the essential zzso zzso zzso zzso We have created a conditional zzso of zzso zzso mimicking the zzso in the budding zzso zzso zzso Although budding zzso zzso arrests at the zzso transition, zzso cells progress through S phase and instead display two distinct zzso A fraction of the zzso cells arrest in zzso with high zzso zzso Other zzso cells as well as the zzso cells accumulate abnormal thick zzso leading to defects in cell zzso zzso identification of 16 zzso zzso zzso proteins led to identification of the product of zzso (for zzso zzso as a zzso zzso Interestingly, cells deleted for the essential zzso gene display a similar cell separation zzso noted in zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and cell zzso zzso of zzso demonstrates association of zzso whereas the zzso zzso was absent from the zzso These findings reveal an essential zzso protein function for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso in cell zzso
