zzso disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a zzso zzso expansion in zzso which provokes zzso of a zzso zzso zzso of the affected protein encompassing the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso somehow triggers cellular dysfunction and leads to a progressive zzso of zzso zzso Despite considerable efforts, the function of zzso as well as the precise molecular mechanisms by which the expanded zzso elicits cellular dysfunction remain zzso In addition, no treatment is available to zzso zzso or even slow down the progression of this devastating zzso zzso are valuable tools to understand protein function and disease zzso Here, we have identified the zzso recognized by the zzso zzso a broadly used zzso generated against the zzso region of zzso which detects both zzso and soluble zzso The zzso zzso specifically recognizes zzso acids zzso of human zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso resides within the zzso region of zzso which is critical for zzso zzso and zzso These properties suggest that the zzso zzso might be useful in zzso therapeutic zzso
