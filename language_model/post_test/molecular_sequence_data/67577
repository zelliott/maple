Marine zzso interact with various zzso ranging from pathogens to zzso zzso zzso between a single microbial species and a single host animal has served as a model for the study of zzso zzso In addition, increasing attention has recently been focused on the complex symbiotic associations, zzso associations between sponges and their zzso due to their zzso zzso however, relatively little is known about the microbial diversity associated with members of the zzso zzso Here, for the first time, we investigated microbial communities associated with a commercially important zzso species, zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso and abundant zzso mostly zzso members, were cultured zzso Using the cloning and sequencing technique, different microbial communities were found in different zzso zzso In the zzso zzso fluid, potentially metabolically active and zzso unique members of zzso and zzso were zzso This study suggests that zzso zzso of marine zzso at least those inhabiting zzso areas where physical and chemical conditions zzso provide microbes with unique and stable zzso
