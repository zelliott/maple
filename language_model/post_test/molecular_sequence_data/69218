A truncated form of zzso zzso deprived of 22 zzso zzso acids zzso zzso delta zzso was found in both the zzso and the zzso fraction of the zzso zzso zzso A reduced CO difference spectrum of this form was characterized by the absence of zzso at zzso zzso and weak zzso at zzso zzso Another zzso of zzso delta zzso expression was its reduced content in the zzso cells compared to that of zzso with the zzso levels of the corresponding zzso being the zzso We suggest that the deleted form of zzso zzso lacking 22 zzso zzso acid zzso is not inserted properly in the zzso zzso zzso it does not take up the proper zzso to enable normal zzso binding and is zzso in the zzso zzso
