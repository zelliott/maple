zzso are small, zzso zzso zzso known principally for their ability to induce migration and zzso of zzso populations under both pathological and zzso zzso On the basis of previously constructed express sequence tags zzso of the head kidney and zzso zzso library of the zzso marine fish zzso zzso zzso name zzso We used zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso and obtained a full-length zzso of a new zzso zzso gene zzso zzso The zzso putative zzso exhibits sequence similarity to the group of zzso zzso zzso The reverse zzso quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso was used in transcript expression studies of zzso We examined the zzso expression of the transcripts in 12 zzso of zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected in all zzso zzso with the highest expression in zzso and liver, following by head zzso zzso zzso skin, zzso muscle, stomach, heart, blood and zzso zzso expression of zzso was examined in zzso zzso including head zzso zzso and liver, following zzso injection of zzso saline control, zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The transcripts in these zzso were quickly zzso by the injection of zzso and bacterial vaccine at early time points, although with different expression zzso These results indicate zzso represents an important component of innate immunity in zzso
