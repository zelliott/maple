We have employed a zzso zzso library to identify zzso for a zzso zzso zzso which is directed to a zzso within a highly zzso zzso region of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have selected two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso which interact specifically with zzso zzso This interaction is specifically inhibited by zzso and by synthetic peptides corresponding to the zzso presented by the selected zzso Although zzso zzso binds to zzso in its native as well as its zzso form, the selected zzso do not exist as such in the zzso zzso However, three zzso acid sequence zzso with these zzso were shown to be present in the zzso region of zzso zzso By extending the selected zzso at one or both ends, with zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso in the zzso we obtained zzso with an up to two order of magnitude higher affinity to the zzso These extended peptides were able to efficiently block the binding of zzso zzso to both zzso zzso and to zzso
