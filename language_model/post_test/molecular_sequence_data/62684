The zzso are a family of zzso proteins from zzso They have the characteristic structural features of a circular protein backbone and a knotted arrangement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies of the zzso suggest that their unique zzso stability can be loaned to zzso zzso fragments for pharmaceutical and agricultural zzso In particular, the zzso incorporate a number of zzso zzso that are potentially suitable for zzso zzso zzso Here, we determine the structure of the largest known zzso zzso which has an zzso size and composition within one of the zzso zzso The structural data show that an increase in size of a zzso loop does not zzso the core fold, to which the zzso and chemical stability has been zzso The zzso core fold, thus, can in principle be used as a framework for the development of useful pharmaceutical and agricultural zzso
