zzso zzso is of agricultural and economic importance as a biological control agent largely because of its plant association and production of secondary zzso in particular zzso zzso This zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso has zzso effects on zzso promotes zzso acid zzso from plant roots, and zzso systemic resistance in zzso Despite its importance, zzso production is limited to a subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the evolution of the zzso cluster and understanding the selective pressures promoting its retention or loss in lineages of zzso zzso will help in the development of zzso zzso as a viable and effective zzso for application in zzso In this study, zzso and zzso approaches were integrated to reconstruct the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso It was determined that zzso production is an ancestral trait in the species zzso zzso but that most lineages have lost this capacity through zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso has relocated the zzso cluster within the zzso zzso zzso at least three times, but the integrity of the cluster has always been zzso The possible evolutionary and functional implications for retention of the zzso cluster and zzso production in some lineages of zzso zzso are zzso
