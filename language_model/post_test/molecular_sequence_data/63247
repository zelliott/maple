Three zzso genes are linked to a major zzso resistance locus in the zzso zzso zzso We have expressed zzso in zzso coli and produced a structural model in order to examine its role in zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso with kinetic parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso values of a wide range of compounds were zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced low zzso values, but were not zzso Plant zzso were the most potent zzso Several compounds were shown to be zzso suggesting that zzso has broad zzso specificity and plays an important zzso role during the zzso phase of the zzso
