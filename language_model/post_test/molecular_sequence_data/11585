We report the first evidence that differential zzso regulation of human zzso A zzso gene expression occurs during in zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso acid (5 zzso and/or zzso (1 zzso The zzso gene encodes a tissue specific protein restricted to cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system, but also widely expressed among zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso as well as other neuroendocrine markers are modulated during zzso differentiation in zzso To zzso at the molecular level, the mechanisms leading to zzso zzso cell differentiation during the treatment with biologically active compounds, we zzso and functionally zzso zzso zzso of a zzso DNA clone encompassing the zzso zzso region of the human zzso zzso zzso analysis of the sequence revealed the presence of a zzso responsive element at positions zzso to zzso and zzso binding sites at positions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso Two novel 9 zzso zzso located at position zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso of the zzso promoter were identified in the regulatory regions of two other neuroendocrine genes zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, in the first 1000 zzso of the untranslated zzso region, we found the presence of several putative DNA binding sites of zzso zzso a protein family regulating tissue specific zzso zzso zzso experiments of zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso showed the presence of an active promoter within the first 455 zzso upstream from the start zzso This region zzso tissue specific expression to a zzso reporter zzso In addition, the zzso activity of this zzso was modulated during the induction of differentiation of zzso cells treated by zzso acid and/or zzso These observations provide preliminary data regarding zzso zzso regulation in zzso cells, and indicate that zzso acid and zzso activate zzso apparently competitive, zzso pathways during zzso cell zzso The molecular zzso of the mechanisms regulating zzso expression in zzso and normal neuroendocrine tissue could lead to the identification of novel molecules potentially relevant for future gene therapy of zzso zzso
