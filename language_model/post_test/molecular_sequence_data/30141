A replication defective zzso zzso containing a human zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced by zzso + zzso packaging cells at high zzso We report long-term expression of zzso in the zzso zzso of mice transplanted with bone zzso cells infected by in zzso zzso with zzso producing zzso Western analysis using an zzso zzso allowed detection of the protein in the peripheral blood of all 37 transplanted mice for at least 9 zzso zzso percent of the animals continued to express zzso in one or more of their zzso zzso for the experimental period, and zzso was found in both zzso colonies and zzso of secondary zzso There was zzso integration and expression in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso indicating extensive zzso by the progeny of infected stem zzso The zzso did not contain a zzso marker, and the infected stem cells did not have a competitive in zzso zzso Nevertheless, we observed consistent gene transfer into zzso stem cells and long-term expression of a human gene product in their zzso
