A zzso approach was developed to identify zzso Q zzso within a zzso zzso zzso Based on tagging with a zzso fluorescent probe, six zzso zzso and low molecular weight zzso peptides were identified by zzso tandem mass zzso In functioning as an zzso zzso tissue zzso was able to form complexes with the zzso zzso zzso whereas by lowering zzso the peptides were zzso by zzso at the same Q zzso which were previously zzso The main common feature shared by the peptides was the consensus sequence zzso Our findings offer relevant information for the understanding of how dietary peptides interact with the host zzso in zzso zzso
