Human zzso zzso zzso zzso class I zzso presentation by a sequential zzso process involving a family of unique short zzso zzso zzso zzso retains class I zzso whereas zzso and zzso mediate the zzso degradation of heavy chains by the zzso In zzso cells, however, zzso transport of class I molecules is impaired because of defective zzso zzso by zzso associated with zzso processing zzso zzso transport is restored in zzso zzso lacking zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso virus protein zzso zzso interacts with TAP inside the zzso zzso zzso as shown by zzso derivatives lacking the zzso and zzso zzso and by the observation that zzso does not prevent peptides from binding to zzso Thus, zzso targets TAP for immune escape by a molecular mechanism different from that of zzso zzso zzso
