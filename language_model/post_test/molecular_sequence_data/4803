In zzso zzso both DNA zzso alpha zzso zzso and delta zzso zzso are required for DNA zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and that this zzso is also required for DNA zzso Following a shift to the restrictive temperature, zzso zzso zzso cells block at the onset of DNA zzso suggesting that zzso is required early in S phase very near to the initiation zzso In the budding zzso zzso zzso it has been reported that in addition to its proposed role in zzso zzso DNA pol zzso zzso by zzso also functions directly as an S phase checkpoint sensor zzso zzso zzso Zhou, zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell 80, zzso We have investigated whether zzso is required for the checkpoint control operating in zzso zzso and our data indicate that pol zzso does not have a role as a checkpoint sensor zzso S phase with zzso In contrast, zzso spores disrupted for the gene zzso pol alpha rapidly enter zzso in the absence of DNA zzso suggesting that in the absence of pol zzso normal coordination between S phase and zzso is zzso We propose that the checkpoint signal operating in S phase depends on assembly of the replication initiation complex, and that this signal is generated prior to the zzso stage of DNA zzso
