The zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso carbon zzso They have been classified into six evolutionary and structural families: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso present in higher plants, algae and zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a single copy of zzso zzso 

We determined the crystal structure of zzso in complex with a zzso analog at zzso A zzso It assembles as a zzso with the active site located at the interface between two zzso At the bottom of the zzso pocket, a zinc zzso is coordinated by the three highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition to a water zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a tunnel to the bottom of the active site which is occupied by a zzso of the zzso analog zzso zzso zzso of full length and two truncated versions of zzso indicated that the zzso arm is zzso 

The zzso structure of zzso resembles the typical plant type zzso of known structure, with an zzso arm indispensable for the zzso zzso Comparative structure analysis enables us to draw a possible tunnel for the zzso to access the active site which is located at the bottom of a zzso zzso zzso
