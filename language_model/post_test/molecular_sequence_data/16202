Two zzso zzso and one zzso zzso from zzso mice are shown to be coded by zzso gene zzso This gene has been found earlier to code for several zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The L chain partner of the zzso zzso gene is different in zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso two new unrelated zzso chain V regions were zzso Both of the new zzso genes involved code frequently for zzso zzso in zzso mice but then with different zzso zzso We tested five zzso zzso for zzso Four zzso were specific, one bound only to zzso one only to zzso and two only to zzso zzso The fifth zzso zzso bound also to zzso zzso and zzso though probably with a low zzso This is the first demonstration that one V gene can code for three different zzso zzso It emphasizes the role of the zzso element in zzso zzso
