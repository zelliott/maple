A zzso zzso the zzso zzso rat fatty acid zzso has been constructed and expressed as a zzso active protein in zzso zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso The zzso zzso zzso was engineered by the amplification and sequential zzso together of seven fragments contained in overlapping zzso that collectively spanned the entire rat fatty acid zzso coding zzso The full-length zzso was cloned into a zzso transfer zzso and used together with zzso zzso DNA to zzso zzso zzso zzso viral clones were zzso and identified by Western zzso The zzso fatty acid zzso was expressed zzso 2 days after infection of the zzso cells, zzso up to zzso of the soluble zzso and could be zzso separated from the insect host fatty acid zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso properties of the zzso zzso fatty acid zzso are indistinguishable from those of the best preparations of the natural protein obtained from rat zzso These results indicate that, in the insect cell host, all seven zzso components of the zzso zzso fatty acid zzso fold correctly, the zzso domain is appropriately zzso zzso and the zzso zzso forms zzso competent zzso Thus the zzso system appears to be well suited for the expression of specific fatty acid zzso zzso that can be used to explore the mechanism by which the seven zzso of this zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of fatty zzso
