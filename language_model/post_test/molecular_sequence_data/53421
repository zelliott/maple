zzso zzso zzso interactions between zzso zzso segments in proteins are investigated by incorporating selected TM sequences into synthetic peptides using the construct zzso The peptides are of suitable zzso for spontaneous membrane zzso whereas formation of an zzso zzso bond can bring pairs of TM zzso into proximity and promote their parallel zzso Using the propensity of the protein to undergo zzso induced zzso zzso zzso transitions as a zzso for zzso stability, we compared the wild type and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso coat proteins with their corresponding TM zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that the relevant zzso zzso contacts found in the intact proteins persist in the zzso zzso zzso dynamics simulations support the tight zzso zzso zzso zzso motif for zzso consistent with zzso zzso The overall results reinforce the notion of TM segments as autonomous folding zzso and suggest that the generic zzso construct provides a viable zzso system for membrane protein structural and zzso zzso
