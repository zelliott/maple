zzso zzso zzso zzso have been engineered to express potentially zzso human zzso These animals contain zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso drives the expression of the appropriate coding regions derived from human zzso zzso Animals containing zzso expressing the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso from human zzso precursor protein zzso produce zzso deposits zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso A subset of these deposits also bind the zzso dye zzso zzso indicating that these deposits have the zzso characteristics of classic zzso zzso of zzso and zzso a protein implicated in preventing the formation of zzso zzso leads to a dramatic reduction in the number of zzso zzso These results suggest that this zzso model may be useful for in zzso investigation of factors that zzso zzso zzso
