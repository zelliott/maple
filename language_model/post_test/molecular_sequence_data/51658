In some biological systems zzso radiation appears to induce large deletions and zzso while in others point zzso predominate the zzso zzso Moreover, while the point zzso are often randomly distributed, some systems exhibit zzso zzso zzso shuttle zzso are particularly useful for investigating the basis of these differences since the genetic target can be zzso analyzed in a variety of host backgrounds and zzso zzso We have studied the zzso specificity of zzso in a Chinese zzso zzso cell line zzso containing a zzso integrated zzso shuttle zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso as the genetic zzso zzso were zzso with 7 zzso using a 180 zzso X-ray zzso The zzso zzso zzso of all zzso zzso as determined by Southern analysis, was the complete deletion of the shuttle zzso zzso In addition, 23 zzso zzso carrying an apparently intact shuttle zzso were characterized at the sequence zzso 5 were zzso 9 were zzso 3 were small deletions or zzso 4 were zzso and 2 were small zzso Although the type and the location of the point zzso characterized appeared largely random, small zzso zzso and zzso were frequently associated with direct sequence zzso
