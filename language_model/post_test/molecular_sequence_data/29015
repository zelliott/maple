zzso zzso is an inflammatory zzso blistering skin disease associated with an zzso zzso response to the type zzso zzso The zzso features of zzso zzso can be reproduced in mice by the passive transfer of zzso zzso collagen zzso In this model, it is thought that zzso formation depends upon complement zzso zzso zzso and some zzso zzso In this study, we cloned zzso type zzso collagen zzso which contains a zzso zzso coding region and which is predicted to be a zzso protein with an zzso zzso domain, residing in type II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained against a segment of zzso type zzso collagen zzso with the human type zzso collagen zzso zzso The zzso zzso were passively transferred to zzso Syrian zzso The injected zzso developed a microscopic zzso zzso as seen previously in the zzso In order to test whether zzso complexes and complement initiate the zzso zzso formation, we carried out experiments in zzso on condition that inflammatory cells were completely zzso zzso zzso in zzso was inhibited either by heating (at 56 degrees C for 30 zzso or by zzso with zzso zzso zzso When the zzso skin was incubated with fresh zzso zzso separation of zzso junction was zzso The zzso zzso failed to induce zzso deposition and zzso junction zzso however, if the zzso zzso was added alone or complement zzso in zzso was zzso Under these conditions, zzso but not zzso was deposited on the basement zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso complexes and complement initiate zzso junction zzso
