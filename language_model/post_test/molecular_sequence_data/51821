The zzso gene family in zzso comprises at least 11 distinct genes but the only family member previously identified in zzso has been the segment polarity gene wingless zzso the zzso of zzso zzso In this report we describe the isolation of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which differs significantly from zzso in both the pattern of its expression during zzso and the predicted structure of its zzso zzso encodes a zzso of 112 zzso which is more than twice as large as the products of previously known zzso zzso The protein shares zzso with other zzso sequences in its zzso half only and is most closely related to the products of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is expressed in a complex pattern during zzso zzso At the extended germ band stage, however, transcripts accumulate specifically in the nascent limb zzso of the head and zzso zzso We show that this elevated expression depends on the activity of the zzso gene zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso gene may constitute a downstream target of zzso that acts in the zzso of these zzso
