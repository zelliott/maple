The formation of biologically active zzso from zzso processing zzso occurs via the action of a zzso zzso zzso The observation that zzso exists primarily as zzso precursors in the zzso but as zzso zzso in the zzso prompted these studies to examine whether the zzso zzso in the two zzso were different in their zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso in the stomach has not previously been characterized in extensive zzso zzso activity was zzso by measuring the conversion of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso by zzso The activity of the zzso zzso in both the rat and hog had a similar apparent molecular weight zzso zzso requirements zzso zzso acid, and zzso pH zzso zzso and zzso (12 zzso as the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are the same zzso thus it is unlikely that differences in zzso zzso can account for the observed differences in the tissue specific processing of zzso
