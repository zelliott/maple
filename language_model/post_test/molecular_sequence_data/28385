The activity of rat liver zzso zzso zzso is increased by limited zzso zzso the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso are activated about zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sites that correlate with this zzso were determined by zzso acid sequence analysis to be located after zzso and zzso zzso in the relative extent of zzso at these two sites did not consistently affect the degree of zzso Thus the data support the conclusion that zzso at either site results in zzso The zzso zzso was compared with the form activated with zzso which zzso zzso These two differently activated forms were found to have similar kinetic zzso which differ from those of the zzso zzso The zzso of the two types of zzso is also demonstrated by the observation that zzso zzso zzso fully activated by zzso is virtually resistant to further zzso by zzso This is the case despite the fact that the zzso zzso is much more susceptible to zzso zzso at zzso than is the zzso zzso The latter observation indicates that zzso with zzso is accompanied by a zzso change involving zzso
