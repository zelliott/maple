The zzso protein zzso was isolated from zzso zzso by affinity zzso and the zzso sequence was determined for part of the zzso The zzso sequence was obtained by using the zzso zzso reverse zzso and zzso and 3' zzso The zzso coded for a zzso of zzso which made it among the largest known zzso and it had a predicted zzso point of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was divergent from other zzso having more than zzso identity only with zzso from zzso zzso The sequence contained insertions that are also present in zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso There appeared to be only a single zzso gene and one transcript from this zzso
