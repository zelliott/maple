zzso a zzso zzso is a zzso zzso for the plant zzso fungus zzso zzso It was recently discovered that another zzso zzso zzso also produces zzso 

The major genes zzso known as zzso involved in the zzso of zzso were identified from zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins share zzso zzso acid identity, and the genes for zzso zzso are duplicated in both zzso The zzso organization of the genes in the two zzso show a similar but not identical partial zzso zzso A set of representative zzso proteins show a similar high level of zzso acid identity between zzso zzso and zzso zzso which is consistent with the close zzso of these two zzso within the family zzso zzso 

This is the first report that the plant zzso factor zzso is made by an zzso other than zzso zzso The genes may have moved by horizontal transfer between the two species, but it cannot be excluded that they were present in a common zzso and lost from other species of zzso and zzso
