Because collagen is a major component of the human zzso zzso factors controlling collagen synthesis may have a profound influence on the volume growth of these zzso zzso In human zzso we compared normal vs zzso media vs zzso for type I collagen gene expression using zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso with subsequent correlations with plaque topographical zzso We also determined the associations of such collagen gene expression with proximity to zzso and T zzso Type I collagen synthesis appears to be zzso in zzso plaques compared with their underlying zzso and normal internal zzso arteries and coronary diffuse zzso zzso At least in established and advanced coronary and carotid zzso type I collagen gene expression is focal and especially prevalent in zzso cap and zzso zzso Although zzso and type I zzso zzso zzso and protein are both found in zzso zzso no apparent spatial correlation between zzso presence and type I zzso presence was found within these zzso zzso Type I zzso presence appears to be zzso associated with the spatial presence of T zzso Thus, human zzso plaques exhibit zzso patterns of type I collagen gene zzso Although the zzso zzso of this focal gene expression have yet to be determined, it is conceivable that zzso zzso and other factors zzso zzso play important roles in determining the focal nature of collagen synthesis in zzso
