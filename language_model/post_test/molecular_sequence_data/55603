zzso zzso appear to play a major role in maintaining the structural integrity of the zzso and are likely involved in the processes of viral zzso and zzso Previous studies demonstrated that a zzso zzso extending from zzso to zzso has zzso zzso This zzso contains an zzso acid stretch from zzso to zzso which is quite similar in sequence to the zzso acids that make up the zzso zzso hand structures found in many zzso To assess the contribution of this domain to zzso structural integrity, the effects of zzso in this region were examined by zzso zzso viral DNA into susceptible zzso zzso studies indicated that although viral protein synthesis occurred zzso zzso viral progeny were not produced in cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso either a zzso zzso lacking zzso acids zzso through zzso or a zzso zzso containing a zzso of zzso to zzso zzso molecules containing the deletion zzso were unable to bind zzso in an in zzso zzso Upon expression in zzso coli and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated as zzso zzso structures which could be induced to form zzso structures upon addition of zzso consistent with previous zzso However, although zzso containing the point zzso was isolated as zzso which were indistinguishable from zzso zzso zzso addition of zzso did not result in their assembly into zzso zzso zzso labeling and electron zzso studies of zzso zzso cells provided in zzso evidence that a zzso in this region affects the process of viral zzso
