The DNA coding for the zzso protein zzso has been isolated by expression zzso The gene is localized in zzso on the X zzso and is expressed zzso during embryonic development with prominent expression during the first 12 h of zzso zzso and zzso clones have been zzso and show a single zzso frame of zzso zzso zzso coding for a Mr zzso zzso basic zzso In the zzso half of the protein we detect stretches of repeated zzso zzso centrally a region with zzso to zzso proteins containing the zzso 1 and zzso 2 consensus motif of zzso binding zzso and the zzso part is rich in charged zzso zzso The zzso protein is a product of the gene zzso transient A, a gene required for normal vision and courtship zzso in zzso
