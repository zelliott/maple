DNA zzso I, zzso on the zzso coli F zzso zzso a zzso and zzso zzso reaction within the F zzso origin of transfer zzso to initiate zzso DNA strand zzso The product of the zzso reaction contains a single zzso bond interruption as determined by zzso resolution mapping of both sides of the zzso zzso This analysis has demonstrated that the zzso is located at precisely the same site previously shown to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso Thompson, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, studies with two zzso point zzso have confirmed the specificity of the in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso DNA product has revealed a modified zzso end and a 3' OH available for extension by zzso coli DNA zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA with cold zzso in the presence of sodium zzso zzso suggests the existence of protein zzso attached to the zzso DNA zzso The zzso nature of this interaction has been directly demonstrated by transfer of zzso zzso from DNA to zzso On the basis of these results, we propose that zzso I becomes zzso bound to the zzso end of the zzso DNA strand as part of the reaction mechanism for zzso bond zzso A model is presented to suggest how zzso I could zzso the F zzso at zzso and subsequently unwind the duplex DNA to provide zzso DNA for strand transfer during bacterial zzso
