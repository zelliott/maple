The present study investigated genetic zzso within a population of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso affecting horses in an endemic area of central Italy using zzso chain reaction zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso c zzso zzso 1 gene zzso No different zzso sequences were detected in any of the zzso zzso individual, while two zzso representing zzso zzso individuals differed for one zzso The zzso distance between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso coding for five zzso acid zzso The sequence of an zzso region within the zzso gene of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso methods using available zzso sequences zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis supported the split of the tree into two sister zzso groups, zzso and zzso + zzso The zzso and evolutionary implications of zzso with zzso and zzso are zzso
