zzso zero zzso is the zzso gene zzso zzso that mediates the zzso of the zzso cell plasma membrane that yields compact zzso zzso is a poorly differentiated zzso cell line that has lost characteristic zzso features of the cervical zzso from which it zzso Normally, zzso cells are not zzso However, when zzso is artificially expressed in this line, cells rapidly aggregate, and zzso concentrates specifically at zzso contact zzso zzso of zzso are generated at these zzso the plasma membrane zzso of zzso and zzso proteins that have been shown to be associated with tight zzso is substantially increased, and zzso coalesce into a cohesive zzso zzso zzso patterns for the zzso junction proteins zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also markedly enhanced at the cell zzso Our data demonstrate that obligatory zzso zzso which in this case is initially brought about by the zzso association of zzso molecules across the zzso zzso triggers pronounced zzso of the normally sluggish or zzso cell zzso program in zzso cells, culminating in suppression of the transformed state and zzso of the zzso to an zzso zzso Furthermore, this response is apparently accompanied by an increase in zzso and protein levels for zzso and zzso which are normally associated with zzso zzso Our conclusions are supported by analyses of ten proteins we examined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and by quantitative zzso chain reactions to measure relative amounts of zzso and zzso zzso zzso has no known signaling zzso the dramatic zzso changes we observed are highly likely to have developed in direct response to zzso cell zzso More generally, the ability of this zzso membrane zzso protein to stimulate zzso and zzso junction formation by zzso well-studied zzso zzso mechanisms raises the possibility that perhaps any bona fide cell zzso zzso when functionally zzso can engage common zzso pathways and trigger zzso of a zzso to an zzso zzso
