We have examined 35 zzso tumors induced in mice of four different strains by chronic exposure to ultraviolet B radiation for the presence of aberrations in the zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso chain reaction products from zzso zzso 5 to 8 were screened by zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso Base zzso were found in seven tumors zzso All zzso occurred at zzso zzso most frequent were zzso single base and zzso tandem transitions suggesting the involvement of zzso radiation in the genesis of the zzso Three base zzso were located at zzso zzso and all zzso zzso occurred at sites where the sequence is present in the zzso DNA zzso indicating some site and strand specificity of the ultraviolet zzso zzso zzso
