zzso T4 gene 41 protein is an essential replication zzso part of the zzso required for lagging strand DNA zzso In a zzso infection, 41 zzso is first expressed as a zzso transcript attached to the upstream zzso of genes zzso zzso zzso and 40 zzso head formation zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As infection zzso less of the upstream zzso extends into gene 41 due to an zzso 3' end, approximately equal to 60 bases downstream of zzso DNA sequence analysis of this region positions this end within gene 40, immediately after a zzso zzso This end probably arises from host zzso zzso termination or zzso processing since it is observed in zzso expressed by a zzso zzso in zzso but is not seen after in zzso zzso with zzso zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso coli zzso termination zzso zzso zzso has been characterized as a zzso zzso whose terminating activity is not effectively overcome by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1983) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 80, zzso During a zzso zzso infection of zzso the levels of some zzso zzso including 41, are depressed; a T4 zzso zzso in zzso gives wild type protein patterns in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso in zzso The zzso analyses presented here demonstrate that the zzso decrease in 41 protein in zzso is accompanied by a similar decrease in 41 zzso There is both a general reduction in zzso zzso zzso and a zzso increase in the proportion of zzso zzso ending at the 3' zzso zzso of zzso by T4 zzso returns the relative amount of zzso reading into 41 versus that stopped to near a wild type zzso These results suggest that host zzso and the T4 zzso are involved in the expression of T4 41 zzso
