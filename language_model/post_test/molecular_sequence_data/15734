The zzso Twin zzso zzso zzso zzso uses three membrane proteins and the zzso zzso to transport folded proteins across sealed zzso zzso proteins bind to the zzso zzso complex, triggering zzso assembly and protein zzso zzso is required only for the zzso step and is thought to be the zzso zzso The organization of zzso zzso was examined by substituting pairs of zzso zzso into zzso and inducing zzso zzso under varying stages of protein zzso zzso formed zzso via its zzso domain in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso by precursor and the zzso zzso zzso formed larger zzso of at least 16 zzso via its zzso tail, but such zzso zzso only occurred in zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso domain directed zzso as well as zzso clusters require zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso both of which are necessary for zzso zzso A novel double zzso strategy demonstrated that both zzso domain zzso and zzso directed zzso occur in the zzso These results support a model in which zzso zzso dock with a zzso complex and undergo a zzso switch that results in zzso for protein zzso This possibly involves zzso of additional zzso into a larger zzso zzso
