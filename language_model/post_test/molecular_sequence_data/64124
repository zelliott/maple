Miniature zzso zzso elements zzso are short, zzso DNA elements that are widespread and abundant in plant zzso Most of the hundreds of thousands of zzso identified to date have been divided into two major groups on the basis of shared structural and sequence zzso zzso and zzso Since zzso have no coding capacity, they must rely on zzso zzso by other zzso Two active zzso the zzso P zzso Factor zzso and the rice zzso element, have recently been implicated as sources of zzso for zzso zzso Here we report that zzso and zzso elements are zzso diverse, and abundant in zzso with hundreds of zzso zzso found in a variety of plant, animal, and zzso zzso The availability of virtually the entire rice zzso sequence facilitated the identification of all the zzso elements in this zzso and permitted a comprehensive analysis of their relationship with zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso and zzso are founding members of a large zzso zzso zzso and that members of this zzso are responsible for the origin and amplification of zzso zzso
