zzso zzso were generated against a synthetic zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which represents the zzso zzso of the zzso from the obligatory zzso human pathogen zzso zzso of all zzso G zzso were obtained and characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso using the zzso zzso as well as chemically zzso derivatives of the zzso zzso The latter contained zzso one of the three zzso in zzso instead of zzso zzso a zzso zzso the zzso group of which had been reduced to a zzso group zzso or zzso changing the linkage of the terminal zzso from zzso to zzso Only one compound, zzso zzso exhibited binding to and zzso of zzso zzso zzso whereas all other compounds were not zzso zzso and zzso investigations using zzso zzso at high field on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso confirmed the zzso similarities between those structures 4, 5, and 10 which were able to bind to the zzso zzso
