The construction of a gene zzso zzso zzso its direct expression in zzso coli, and the simple zzso procedure are described zzso The temperature zzso zzso was employed for induction in a very short zzso The expression level could reach zzso After simple downstream processing and only one step of zzso zzso zzso 150 zzso zzso zzso zzso with a purity of up to zzso could be obtained easily from 1 L of high density zzso zzso The obtained product is in the form of zzso zzso because of the failure of the bacterial host to remove the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso could be changed into human insulin by zzso and zzso B treatment in later zzso After separation with zzso zzso human insulin with expected zzso acid composition and full native biological activity could be obtained with a yield of 50 zzso of zzso zzso
