The zzso of the zzso zzso B zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso results in enhanced survival of a diversity of zzso This resistance to zzso is partly accomplished by the zzso of genetic programs induced by a zzso of zzso zzso factors including zzso Here we describe an zzso zzso that appears to account for at least part of this zzso regulatory zzso zzso induced to zzso an active form of zzso die by zzso the zzso death zzso An analysis of genes regulated by zzso demonstrated that zzso a zzso zzso is zzso approximately zzso An examination of the zzso promoter demonstrated that zzso bound to specific target sites that could activate zzso zzso an zzso zzso contains potential zzso target sites in its zzso An analysis of zzso zzso levels in zzso cells revealed enhanced zzso of the transcript ( approximately zzso and zzso and zzso directly binds to and suppresses the zzso zzso Finally, zzso isolated from zzso mice show enhanced survival in zzso These results suggest that zzso regulates zzso in part by suppressing the levels of zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso
