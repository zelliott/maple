We report the molecular and functional characterization of a new alpha chain of zzso in zzso The new zzso chain appears to be the zzso counterpart of both zzso zzso (also called zzso and zzso zzso with a slightly higher degree of zzso to zzso suggesting that this chain is an ancestral version of both zzso and zzso zzso During zzso the protein is associated with basement zzso of the zzso system and muscle attachment sites, and during zzso stage it is found in a specific pattern in wing and eye zzso The gene is assigned to a locus called wing zzso zzso which is essential for embryonic zzso zzso zzso include twisted zzso and fewer zzso cells, resulting in gaps in the zzso heart and zzso zzso and zzso detached from their target muscle attachment zzso Most zzso are in common with those observed in zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and many are in common with those observed in zzso zzso Adult zzso show zzso in the wings in viable zzso combinations, similar to zzso observed in zzso zzso zzso analysis in the eye demonstrates a function in zzso zzso In zzso this new zzso alpha chain is essential for embryonic viability and is involved in processes requiring cell migration and cell zzso
