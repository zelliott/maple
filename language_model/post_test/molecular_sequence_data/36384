The ability to amplify routinely long zzso products zzso zzso with high specificity and zzso regardless of target template sequence or structure, would provide significant benefits to zzso mapping and sequencing zzso Although occasional reports have described the generation of long zzso products, such results have been difficult to replicate and have frequently zzso probe zzso to identify the specific product from zzso amplified zzso zzso of specific zzso products has generally been limited to target templates of less than 3 zzso To extend the effective range of standard zzso amplification, it may be necessary to zzso alternative reaction conditions and/or zzso such as novel zzso DNA zzso or accessory zzso We describe the use of a model system to evaluate systematically zzso changes that might enable efficient long-range zzso Specifically, the zzso zzso has been used to introduce randomly zzso known primer binding sites within separate zzso of zzso clones carrying identical zzso zzso zzso allows us to study amplification of DNA fragments that vary in size and sequence using only a single set of zzso In the present studies, we describe conditions that enable zzso amplification of specific DNA templates ranging in size up to 9 zzso Some of the key features of our methodology include the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso the addition of gelatin to the reaction mixture, the use of zzso zzso zzso and, zzso the use of zzso extension zzso These results also provide insights into additional approaches that might further enhance our ability to perform long-distance zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
