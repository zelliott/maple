A method for zzso zzso which can be used with any gene in any zzso has been zzso This method has been named zzso zzso Upon selection of the zzso site, the zzso bearing the gene in question is zzso with one or two restriction zzso that generate fragments with random staggered zzso The zzso are chosen to maximize the zzso while minimizing the size of the zzso to be zzso zzso of the fragments zzso the original zzso zzso are obtained by allowing zzso fragments, added in zzso zzso zzso to compete with their zzso counterparts for a place in the zzso zzso In a test system with the restriction zzso zzso which zzso an zzso zzso bearing the zzso alpha gene into four fragments, the efficiency of zzso exceeded that of zzso zzso zzso The recovery of zzso molecules was zzso With zzso which also zzso the zzso into four fragments, both the efficiency of zzso and the production of zzso were zzso To zzso the use of zzso zzso a simple technique for generating zzso fragments in tandem zzso chain reactions is zzso In the first step, a zzso zzso is zzso from the region of the zzso to one zzso in the second step, the complete zzso is made with the aid of an zzso targeted to the other zzso and one strand of the product of the first zzso The complementary strand is present, but does not interfere with the amplification zzso
