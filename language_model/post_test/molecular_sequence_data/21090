Water zzso causes a dramatic reduction in crop production zzso zzso crop varieties that are more efficient in their water use is one strategy to overcome this zzso In this study, a member of the zzso family, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso To study the biological functions of zzso transgenic zzso plants zzso that zzso expressed the zzso gene were zzso zzso of zzso resulted in early zzso establishment, longer primary roots, and larger leaf zzso zzso transgenic zzso zzso zzso resulted in enhanced long-term water use efficiency zzso as estimated by the analysis of carbon zzso zzso The zzso results were supported by the zzso and anatomical results, which included improved zzso rate, decreased zzso rate, and zzso zzso The transgenic lines have significantly more zzso as compared to the wild zzso Since the zzso of zzso can strongly enhance the water use efficiency in transgenic zzso plants, zzso could potentially be used in transgenic breeding to improve the water use zzso
