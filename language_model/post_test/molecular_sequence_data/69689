A function and identify of a zzso Da protein derived from round zzso of the rat zzso was investigated with a specific zzso zzso raised against zzso The proteins released from cultured round zzso significantly zzso the zzso of de zzso zzso protein from cultured immature rat zzso cells zzso above control zzso zzso of zzso from round zzso protein further enhanced the stimulation of zzso cell protein zzso up to zzso above control levels, indicating that zzso plays a role in the down regulation of zzso cell zzso The zzso recognized the zzso Da protein in Western blots of round zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso A 40 zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso zzso internal zzso of zzso showed zzso zzso to a zzso binding zzso These results suggest that zzso binding protein zzso in the negative regulation of zzso cell zzso function during zzso
