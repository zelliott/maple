The upstream promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso zzso gene contains five copies of zzso the zzso sequence found at the zzso initiation sites of almost all zzso late zzso In zzso zzso cells, late zzso initiation is detected from only two upstream zzso sites and not from three downstream zzso zzso To examine several models for preferential zzso site zzso we constructed a series of zzso zzso zzso that contain promoter region sequences from the zzso gene fused to a zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso were inserted in the zzso zzso To test a scanning model in which zzso sites are zzso selected according to their location in the region, we generated zzso viruses in which the highly transcribed sites were zzso by point zzso zzso from the zzso promoter zzso was compared zzso and zzso to zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the upstream zzso sites did not result in increased zzso from the downstream zzso sites, suggesting that immediate context, rather than position, determines promoter zzso To test this hypothesis, we made a series of minimal promoter zzso containing decreasing quantities of the sequences immediately zzso one of the active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso site and zzso or zzso 12 zzso of zzso sequence on both sides were transcribed at near zzso zzso zzso with less zzso sequence (9 or 6 zzso of zzso zzso were accurately zzso but at substantially lower levels, and zzso was not detected from zzso containing only 3 zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso immediately zzso the zzso site zzso zzso are necessary for zzso promoter activity while additional zzso sequences zzso or zzso 12 zzso are required for late promoter zzso and zzso To further examine late promoter selection, we constructed zzso zzso zzso that contain zzso late promoters from the zzso gene of the related virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sites that serve as functional late promoters in zzso were found to mediate zzso initiation at only zzso levels in the context of the zzso zzso suggesting that late promoter zzso may be virus specific within the family zzso
