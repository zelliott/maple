The zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso degrading zzso A zzso of membrane type zzso zzso has been described zzso We have determined the structure of the gene zzso zzso the first zzso to be zzso zzso zzso and mapped it to mouse zzso zzso The mouse zzso protein is zzso by ten zzso The novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso are zzso by a single large zzso that also encodes the zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso the zzso domain and zzso of zzso is distinct from previously described zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso the zzso zzso are similar to those of most other zzso zzso zzso and the gene for tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso show a temporally and zzso zzso expression during mouse zzso They are zzso during vascular and zzso development and during the development of zzso and zzso zzso The stringent zzso of these two genes suggests common regulatory pathways that may have important functional implications for the zzso of zzso A in health and zzso
