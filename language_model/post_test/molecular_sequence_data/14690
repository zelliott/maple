In response to DNA damage, cells initiate complex zzso zzso leading to growth arrest and DNA zzso The recruitment of zzso to damaged sites requires the zzso of the zzso cascade controlled by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso However, molecular events that regulate the accessibility of zzso zzso to allow the recruitment of zzso to DNA breaks, are zzso Here, we show that like zzso the zzso (also known as zzso tandem zzso domain binds zzso zzso zzso however, zzso is zzso by the zzso following the DNA damage in an zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is zzso by zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso abrogates zzso recruitment to DNA damage sites, indicating a role in zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso The combined zzso of zzso and zzso significantly rescued the ability of zzso and zzso cells to form zzso zzso We propose that the zzso degradation of zzso regulates DNA repair by controlling the recruitment of zzso at DNA damage zzso
