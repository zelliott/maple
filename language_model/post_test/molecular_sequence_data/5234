In this report, we establish a regulatory role of natural killer zzso cells in experimental zzso zzso zzso a zzso T helper cell type 1 zzso zzso Active zzso of zzso zzso mice with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a mild form of zzso zzso When mice were deprived of zzso cells by zzso treatment before zzso they developed a more serious form of zzso associated with zzso zzso of zzso by zzso cell deletion was also seen in beta zzso zzso zzso mice, indicating that zzso cells can play a regulatory role in a manner independent of zzso T cells or zzso T cells zzso zzso The disease enhancement was associated with zzso of T cell proliferation and production of zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso passively induced by the zzso T cell line was also enhanced by zzso cell deletion in zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso gene 2 zzso mice, indicating that the regulation by zzso cells can be independent of zzso B, or zzso zzso We further showed that zzso cells inhibit T cell proliferation triggered by zzso or zzso zzso Taken together, we conclude that zzso cells are an important regulator for zzso in both induction and zzso zzso
