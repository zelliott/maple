We have cloned a zzso for a novel zzso zzso protein designated zzso from a human zzso zzso library using rat zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso consists of 219 zzso acids and contains three zzso zinc finger motifs at its zzso The zinc finger zzso showed 59% and zzso sequence similarity to those of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of the zinc finger zzso a short sequence rich in basic zzso acids is zzso between zzso and zzso Furthermore, This basic sequence concurs with the zzso half of the consensus sequence for basic zzso of the proteins containing both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The other region of zzso is notably rich in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli showed zzso activity whose specificity was closely similar to that of zzso zzso experiments using zzso cells (a mouse zzso cell line) with a zzso expression zzso and zzso zzso reporter plasmids revealed that zzso apparently activated the expression of the zzso zzso Moreover, when zzso was fused to zzso zzso domain, the zzso protein could enhance the zzso through promoters containing zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso was expressed specifically in zzso and zzso with different sizes, zzso and zzso respectively, among various zzso zzso
