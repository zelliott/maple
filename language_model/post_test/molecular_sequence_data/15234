zzso evidence suggests that zzso against zzso proteins is important for zzso zzso We have characterized zzso and zzso responses associated with experimental zzso zzso zzso induced in Lewis rats with zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso The zzso zzso T cells recognize a single zzso region with an zzso delineated at zzso acids zzso zzso specificity is more zzso albeit directed mostly to the zzso of zzso Most interestingly, zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses spread not only to other zzso zzso but also to zzso zzso raising the possibility that zzso immune attacks could also result in zzso
