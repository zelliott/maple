We present a method for improving the quality of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso involving zzso zzso near the base of the stem of zzso hairpin zzso zzso zzso of five different zzso zzso were zzso These zzso consisted of a native zzso structure and four molecules each having different zzso or dangling, zzso at the 3' zzso zzso experiments were acquired in water for each construct and the quality of the zzso zzso spectral regions were zzso The zzso zzso near the base of the stem of the wild type zzso structure were not observed due to breathing zzso However, a significant increase in spectral quality for molecules with dangling 3' zzso or zzso zzso was observed, with zzso zzso detected in these zzso that were not observed in the wild type zzso A modest improvement in spectral quality was seen for the construct with a 3' zzso zzso whereas no significant improvement was observed for a 3' zzso zzso This improvement in zzso spectral quality mirrors the increased zzso stability observed for 3' zzso zzso which is zzso on the stacking interactions of these zzso against the base of the zzso The use of a dangling 3' zzso zzso represents an easy method to significantly improve the quality of zzso zzso of zzso zzso
