zzso activity is zzso regulated by zzso protein zzso through binding to the zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso partner zzso that allow proper cell cycle zzso In contrast to the other zzso zzso the newest member of the family, zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we report an unexpected role for zzso in regulating zzso activity during the DNA damage zzso Specifically, zzso is induced in zzso cells, upon which it binds to zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso depleting zzso in cells zzso zzso activity that zzso with increased levels of zzso zzso zzso target gene expression and associated zzso zzso analysis of zzso highlighted a zzso region, outside the zzso domain, required for the negative control of zzso zzso Our results define a new pathway, which acts independently of zzso and through a zzso distinct zzso involved in negative regulation of zzso zzso
