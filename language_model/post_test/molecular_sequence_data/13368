The human growth zzso zzso zzso zzso gene cluster contains five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, the nature of zzso products of their primary transcripts (except zzso was analyzed by zzso mapping as well as by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso experiments All the previously described zzso zzso zzso the normal zzso growth hormone, the zzso zzso as well as a transcript lacking the third zzso were found in zzso tissue and zzso tissue and in zzso zzso human zzso zzso In addition, zzso products lacking either zzso 3 and 4 zzso zzso and 4 were found in both zzso In accordance to previously reported data, the zzso the zzso and the zzso genes which are expressed in zzso tissue give rise to the zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso Furthermore, no zzso zzso arising from skipping of zzso 3 was present, whereas zzso arising from zzso of zzso 2 to zzso 5 and of zzso 1 to zzso 5 were clearly zzso The various zzso zzso were expressed in zzso and screened for zzso zzso Only the zzso and the zzso zzso were active in this zzso All of the zzso zzso processed zzso were found in cell lines of zzso zzso and of zzso type zzso which had been recently described to zzso growth zzso Interestingly, zzso analysis allowed the determination of zzso transcripts in zzso zzso This finding zzso the importance of growth hormone in influencing immune system development and further suggests possible zzso regulatory zzso in skin zzso
