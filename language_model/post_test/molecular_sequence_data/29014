zzso syndrome is a zzso zzso associated with zzso hair zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 5 gene have been identified in zzso syndrome zzso however, the actual zzso zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 5 zzso are unknown, and how the genetic defects cause characteristic skin zzso remains zzso Here, we describe the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 5 gene zzso including two novel zzso zzso and zzso correlation in three zzso syndrome patients in two unrelated Japanese zzso Furthermore, based on the zzso of the structure of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 5 zzso demonstration of the presence of zzso in normal zzso and the observation of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 5 transcripts in the uppermost zzso as well as zzso units, we propose a hypothetical model of zzso processing of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 5 zzso in the zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso by a set of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis is supported by the marked increase of zzso zzso activity demonstrated in stratum zzso samples from our zzso syndrome zzso The findings in this study suggest that the defective zzso regulation of zzso due to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 5 gene zzso may cause zzso of zzso in zzso syndrome, leading to severe skin zzso barrier zzso
