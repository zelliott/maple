We have characterized the putative zzso site in the backbone of zzso plasmids and found unique regulatory zzso The site, which mapped to a zzso region around zzso 37, zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso that was zzso up to fivefold by zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso hormone changed zzso of the zzso response by zzso into zzso Although the zzso sequence is a near-perfect consensus zzso site, the perfect consensus zzso site from the human zzso promoter did not show the same zzso zzso of the zzso binding domain of the zzso eliminated the ability of the zzso to boost zzso activity, and zzso zzso or changes in specificity of the DNA binding domain eliminated both its ability to zzso zzso activity and repress with zzso In zzso zzso complexes bound the operative zzso fragment, and the presence of zzso zzso very little with zzso binding zzso zzso interaction studies in the absence of DNA showed that zzso bound zzso protein in solution either in the presence or in the absence of zzso These observations suggest a mechanism for zzso and repression by zzso through zzso of zzso activity: positive when zzso is zzso and negative when hormone is zzso They also suggest that the presence of the zzso element can confound studies of the regulation of linked zzso
