The initiation of zzso reverse zzso occurs at an zzso sequence in the viral zzso designated as the primer binding site zzso which is complementary to the 3' terminal zzso of zzso Since the PBS is highly zzso among all infectious zzso it represents an attractive target for the development of new zzso to inhibit viral zzso In this study, we have evaluated three approaches using small interfering zzso zzso targeted to the PBS for the capacity to inhibit zzso zzso In the first, zzso of a zzso zzso complementary to the PBS into cells inhibited production of zzso following zzso Control zzso of the same length complementary to zzso gag zzso or to zzso zzso decreased the production of virus or had no effect on virus zzso zzso Analysis of the PBS of integrated zzso derived from viruses that ultimately grew in cultures zzso with zzso all contained zzso PBS zzso demonstrating that zzso did not mutate to escape zzso by zzso In the second approach, hairpin zzso targeted to the zzso PBS were expressed using an zzso virus zzso zzso zzso replication was inhibited in cells infected with zzso zzso the zzso to the zzso zzso but not in cells infected with zzso zzso an zzso of the same length targeted to an irrelevant zzso Finally, studies from this laboratory have shown that zzso of the PBS to be complementary to zzso results in the production of infectious virus that rapidly reverts to zzso zzso following in zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing a PBS complementary to zzso that encodes an zzso zzso complementary to the zzso PBS under control of a zzso promoter within the zzso gene was as infectious as the parent zzso zzso containing no insert in zzso The virus with the PBS only complementary to zzso reverted to use zzso zzso with rapid virus growth, while the virus zzso zzso grew slower than the virus without zzso and maintained the PBS complementary to zzso longer in zzso At later times of infection, viruses with the PBS complementary to zzso and the zzso exhibited a rapid increase in zzso zzso in the zzso Analysis of the PBS revealed that it was now complementary to zzso Analysis of the gene zzso the zzso revealed that the zzso of the PBS coincided with the deletion of the gene zzso zzso The results of these studies show that zzso targeted to the PBS of zzso can inhibit virus zzso supporting the concept that zzso has evolved a strong preference to select zzso for high-level replication and establishing the PBS and primer selection as a potential target for new zzso
