zzso zzso the primary protein component of Alzheimer's zzso is zzso when zzso into zzso We have devised a modular strategy for generating compounds that inhibit zzso zzso based on linking a recognition element for zzso to a zzso element designed to interfere with zzso zzso One such compound, with the zzso sequence of zzso as the recognition element and a zzso zzso as the zzso element, altered zzso zzso zzso and protected cells from zzso toxicity zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To zzso the recognition element, peptides of zzso zzso composed of overlapping sequences within the zzso domain were zzso along with hybrid compounds containing those recognition sequences coupled to a zzso zzso None of the recognition peptides altered zzso zzso zzso and only two, zzso and zzso had any protective effect against zzso zzso The hybrid zzso zzso dramatically altered zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and provided significantly improved protection against zzso toxicity compared to the recognition zzso zzso In contrast, zzso possessed only modest zzso activity and had no marked effect on zzso zzso The scrambled sequence zzso was nearly as effective a recognition domain as zzso suggesting the zzso characteristics of the recognition sequence are zzso None of the zzso peptides prevented zzso zzso rather, they increased zzso size and altered zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso recognition with zzso elements is an effective zzso strategy for the creation of zzso zzso zzso prevention of zzso zzso may not be required for prevention of zzso
