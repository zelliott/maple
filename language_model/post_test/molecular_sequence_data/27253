Spinal muscular zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso disorder, and about zzso of zzso patients are zzso for deletions in the zzso zzso zzso classical zzso chain reaction and restriction zzso length zzso zzso using zzso yielded false zzso deletions of zzso zzso 7 in a patient with zzso but multiple zzso probe amplification analysis revealed one remaining copy of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that this false deletion in the zzso resulted from a novel zzso of one zzso copy that was not deleted zzso zzso zzso zzso This novel sequence zzso introduced a mismatch that zzso with primer zzso These findings demonstrate that comprehensive analysis using zzso multiple zzso probe amplification, and sequencing can reliably and correctly diagnose zzso
