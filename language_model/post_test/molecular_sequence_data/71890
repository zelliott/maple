A zzso zzso region carrying the four genes zzso necessary for production of and immunity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso encodes the primary structure of zzso as a precursor endowed with an zzso extension of 37 zzso zzso The products of zzso and zzso are thought to be involved in zzso zzso which implies zzso of zzso and zzso linkage of the zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso which is highly similar to several ABC zzso was found to be required for zzso zzso thus explaining its ability to zzso immunity to zzso
