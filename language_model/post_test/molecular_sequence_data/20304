To isolate zzso zzso bacteria from a single field and to examine their genetic zzso 

zzso bacteria were screened from a long-term experimental field in which zzso has been continuously applied to, and a zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from in zzso As the result, five strains of zzso were newly zzso The sequences of several zzso genes separated the six zzso including zzso into two zzso Among the genes involved in zzso degradation, the sequences of zzso zzso and zzso were identical among all six zzso that of zzso was identical among five zzso and that of zzso was zzso 

We calculated that the zzso populations of the two zzso arose zzso Not just one but diverse zzso that degrade a particular zzso compound possibly tend to arise and/or accumulate in fields, where that compound has been zzso 

This study indicates the potential usefulness of a long-term continuous application of zzso compounds to an experimental field in that it would potentially generate diverse zzso able to degrade the zzso
