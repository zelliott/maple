zzso in zzso coli are anchored to the zzso side of either the inner or the outer membrane by a zzso zzso that is zzso attached to the zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity depends on a sorting signal at position 2 of the zzso zzso directed to the outer membrane are released from the inner membrane in an zzso manner through the formation of a complex with zzso a zzso zzso However, the zzso involved in this reaction has not been zzso Here we show, using zzso zzso that a new complex, zzso belonging to the zzso cassette (ABC) zzso family, zzso the release of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso complex differs mechanistically from all other ABC zzso as it is not involved in the zzso transport of zzso This new mechanism is zzso zzso in other zzso zzso
