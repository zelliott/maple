zzso mediates growth zzso of zzso in zzso cells by suppressing the release of zzso necessary for their zzso We now show that 2 zzso fragments derived from the zzso portion of zzso corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso also inhibited zzso cell growth and suppressed release of zzso whereas peptides zzso and zzso zzso in which the zzso at position 21 was replaced by a zzso zzso were zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso and a scrambled sequence of zzso failed to inhibit cell zzso Moreover, the zzso stimulation of cell proliferation and zzso release in these cells was blocked by peptides zzso and zzso and also by peptides zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not by a scrambled sequence of zzso zzso
