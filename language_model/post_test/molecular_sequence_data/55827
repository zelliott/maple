Our aim was to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso is a key mechanism culminating in lethal zzso injury of rat zzso Although zzso zzso was suppressed during zzso total zzso zzso was increased twofold compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited total zzso zzso and improved cell survival during zzso Indeed, we found a direct highly significant linear relationship between cell death and total zzso zzso as modulated by changes in the zzso pH zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso generation of zzso from zzso during zzso suppressed total zzso zzso and improved cell zzso An increase in a zzso zzso zzso activity was also identified during zzso but zzso zzso activity only accounted for zzso of total zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso only partially protected against cell killing despite complete zzso of zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso total zzso zzso contributes to lethal cell injury during zzso However, zzso zzso activity only partially contributes to total zzso zzso activity and cell zzso
