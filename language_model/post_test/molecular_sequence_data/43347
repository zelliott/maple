To determine whether there is a zzso effect of zzso expression of gag on zzso zzso we compared the zzso of zzso zzso with that of a zzso in which the translation of gag was zzso This comparison indicated that there is not such a zzso zzso To determine what is necessary and sufficient for zzso we measured the relative zzso efficiencies of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso containing zzso in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso signal or containing large deletions in the remainder of the zzso These data indicate that zzso and two additional regions are required for zzso and that the zzso end of the zzso is sufficient for zzso The zzso element is required mainly for efficient zzso transport from the nucleus to the zzso A foreign sequence was found to have a negative effect on zzso upon placement within the parental zzso Interestingly, this negative effect was compounded by multiple copies of the zzso
