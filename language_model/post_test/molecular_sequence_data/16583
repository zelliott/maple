zzso gene zzso zzso is an attractive zzso tool for studies of gene zzso However, efficient zzso has only been accomplished in a few plant zzso In order to extend the application of zzso we examined whether a zzso zzso based on zzso early zzso virus zzso would produce recognizable zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso was modified to allow zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso fragments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were inserted into the zzso zzso zzso replacing the genes required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso carrying a zzso of zzso developed characteristic zzso leaves and this zzso was associated with a significant reduction in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso is known as zzso zzso Plants zzso with zzso carrying a zzso of zzso developed distorted flowers and leaves with modified architecture, which are also observed in zzso In zzso zzso the zzso is characterized by an extreme dwarf zzso zzso zzso plants zzso with zzso carrying a zzso of zzso displayed a significant reduction in height and zzso of root zzso The zzso zzso zzso did not affect the ability of zzso zzso to zzso set seeds, and form zzso characteristic of zzso with zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso can be applied to functional zzso in a zzso species to study genes involved in a wide range of biological zzso
