zzso (an zzso representing three zzso density protein zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso and tight junction protein zzso domain containing proteins are adapter proteins that play indispensable roles in regulating cell growth, development, and zzso predominantly through their capacity to serve as central organizers of protein complexes at the plasma zzso A recently identified member of this protein family is melanoma differentiation associated zzso zzso also known as zzso which was first identified as a gene zzso during human melanoma differentiation as zzso and subsequently recognized as an interacting partner of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interest in zzso is intensifying because of its involvement in organization of protein complexes in the plasma zzso regulation of B cell development, zzso trafficking and cell surface zzso cancer zzso synaptic transmission, and zzso zzso In this review, we discuss the zzso structure and function of zzso and delineate future studies to address its role in regulating key zzso and pathological zzso
