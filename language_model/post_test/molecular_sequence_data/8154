It is known that production in a host of zzso against a protein is associated with various molecular zzso These include the stimulation of specific zzso a step that implies the processing of the protein into peptides by various zzso zzso such as zzso zzso however, we observed in zzso that zzso B and D have no degrading effect on toxin alpha from zzso zzso a zzso toxin of 61 zzso acids and four zzso In sharp contrast, the zzso exert an efficient zzso of the toxin zzso chain once the toxin zzso are zzso We also found that the fully reduced toxin and the native toxin were presented with comparable efficiency to two different zzso by zzso cells zzso Together, the data suggest that presentation of toxin fragments to zzso requires a reduction step of toxin zzso and, in agreement with previous findings, that this step may be achieved by zzso We wish to suggest that this phenomenon may commonly occur for any toxic proteins that contain zzso
