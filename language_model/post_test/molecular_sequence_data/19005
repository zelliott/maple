The linkage region constituents, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso in the zzso of all zzso zzso of the structure and zzso of the linkage region of zzso is important to understand the presentation and dynamics of the zzso chain at the zzso zzso Earlier zzso studies using zzso models and zzso of zzso linkage region have shown that the zzso zzso zzso is more influenced by the structural variation in the sugar part than that of the zzso zzso To access the influence of zzso sugar as well as zzso linkage zzso or zzso on the zzso zzso angles, zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso and structural features of seven of these zzso have been characterized by X-ray zzso Comparative analysis of the seven zzso zzso with the reported zzso zzso showed that the zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso with respect to zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso is more than zzso These zzso indicate that the zzso zzso is influenced by addition of zzso sugar as well as with respect to zzso zzso linkage zzso or zzso it is less influenced by changes occurring at the zzso The zzso value of zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso exhibit a large range of variations (from zzso to zzso This large span of zzso value suggests the greater degree of zzso freedom around zzso bond which is restricted in zzso zzso The present finding explicitly proved the importance of molecular architecture in the zzso linkage region to maintain the zzso zzso and zzso These factors are necessary for zzso to serve role in zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso
