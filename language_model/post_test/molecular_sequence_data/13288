DNA markers linked to the zzso of mating type in the zzso zzso zzso were identified and used to address the genetic basis of zzso in the normally zzso zzso Thirteen zzso linked to the A1 and zzso mating types were initially identified by zzso zzso analysis using random amplified zzso DNA markers zzso and subsequently scored in three crosses zzso zzso zzso amplified zzso zzso or zzso zzso chain reaction markers zzso All DNA markers mapped to a single region, consistent with a single locus determining both mating zzso zzso restriction mapping also demonstrated the linkage of the markers to one region and zzso the mating type locus to a zzso zzso The zzso containing the mating type locus displayed zzso segregation as only two of the four expected zzso were detected in zzso This is consistent with a system of balance lethal zzso near the mating type zzso A model for mating type determination is presented in which the balanced zzso exclude form progeny those with potentially conflicting combinations of mating type zzso such as those simultaneously expressing A1 and zzso zzso
