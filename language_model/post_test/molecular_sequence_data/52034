We have shown that the restricted repertoire of zzso genes expressed in second zzso human fetal liver is not solely determined by zzso zzso Furthermore, by following the fate of two zzso gene segments in different zzso zzso we have provided evidence that multiple factors contribute to the frequency with which individual zzso genes are zzso We found that the repertoire of adult blood zzso B cells contains a high proportion of B zzso that express extensively zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso of particular zzso and zzso genes that, in zzso zzso are frequently found in the early zzso repertoire and in natural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristic of human zzso These zzso and zzso genes harbor all the characteristics of an zzso zzso zzso and selection zzso
