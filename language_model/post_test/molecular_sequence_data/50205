The in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in human cells was determined by zzso various cell lines with plasmids that carried a single zzso at a defined zzso zzso is one of the many DNA modifications formed by oxygen zzso and was found to be highly zzso during replication with zzso DNA zzso in zzso Here we show that the frequency of zzso induced by zzso during replication in zzso is at most only zzso above zzso The most zzso zzso found was a single zzso zzso The frequency of this zzso was found to be 3 to zzso increased in zzso repair deficient zzso zzso Interestingly, also the replication of zzso containing plasmids was significantly impaired zzso zzso in the zzso cells, but not in zzso cells, normal zzso or zzso zzso zzso When zzso containing plasmids were used, the zzso zzso did not exceed background levels (less than zzso with any of the cell lines zzso The presence of zzso almost completely inhibited zzso replication (more than zzso in zzso zzso Apparently, both zzso and zzso are not or poorly repaired in these cells, causing a block of DNA zzso This suggests that both zzso are zzso for zzso repair, although to a varying zzso
