To investigate the genetic zzso and zzso distribution of human zzso virus type 1 zzso in zzso we determined zzso sequences for 63 zzso patients in various risk groups from all over the country between April and July, zzso Two distinct zzso of zzso A and B, were found to segregate by mode of zzso Of 29 sexually infected patients, 25 zzso had zzso of zzso A and 4 zzso had zzso zzso Among 29 injecting drug users, probably zzso zzso only 7 zzso had zzso A and 22 zzso had zzso zzso This segregation is unlikely to have arisen by chance zzso zzso zzso No patient was found to have dual zzso zzso divergence averaged zzso among zzso patients and zzso among zzso patients, but zzso between the zzso 37 of 40 zzso (both zzso had the zzso zzso at the tip of the zzso loop, which is common in African zzso strains but rare in North American and European zzso where the zzso motif zzso These findings suggest that the waves of zzso infection in injecting drug users and in sexually infected patients in Thailand may not be zzso zzso The zzso divergence data point to the separate introductions of the two zzso in zzso Further studies in Thailand and zzso countries will be useful in the design and selection of candidate zzso zzso
