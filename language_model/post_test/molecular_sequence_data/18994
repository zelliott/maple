A zzso zzso zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso and zzso to zzso Its optimal temperature was zzso with approximately zzso of its activity retained after incubation at zzso for zzso zzso zzso cells carrying zzso zzso zzso gene exhibited higher stress resistance to salt and zzso zzso agents than control zzso zzso In an effort to provide structural zzso zzso was zzso and its structure was determined at zzso zzso The overall architecture of zzso was found similar to other zzso with highest structural similarities obtained against a zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso In order to explain its zzso structural and sequence analysis of zzso with other zzso was carried zzso An increased number of charged zzso and an increase in the number of zzso salt bridges and the zzso ratio were identified as potential reasons for the zzso of zzso
