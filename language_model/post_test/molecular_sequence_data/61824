zzso is a zzso zzso consisting of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been shown to possess zzso biological activities, but is different in its capacity to stimulate memory T cells in zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso could influence envelope protein 2 zzso zzso immunity induced by zzso of zzso C virus zzso zzso We found that zzso induced long-lasting zzso and zzso immune responses to zzso which are much stronger than zzso immune zzso Interestingly, zzso an zzso zzso showing reduced expression of excess zzso without changing the level of zzso exhibited a higher ratio of zzso to zzso zzso T cell frequency than did zzso zzso suggesting a negative regulatory effect of zzso on zzso immune response induced by zzso These data suggest that zzso particularly zzso would be an effective zzso of DNA vaccine for the induction of durable zzso T cell zzso
