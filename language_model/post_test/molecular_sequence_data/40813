zzso species provide an ideal model to test the applications of a zzso zzso system for zzso species of other zzso of zzso zzso species are closely related and share similar gross zzso zzso designed for a zzso for zzso have been transferred and tested as zzso for zzso diagnostic against zzso zzso The zzso were combined with complementary universal zzso to identify known and suspected zzso species of zzso The primer set was zzso for 56 species, including the three varieties of zzso zzso then zzso against 10 random DNA zzso The protocols established in this study successfully identified species from the blind test as well as eight previously zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso were identified as new species of zzso with the aid of the zzso zzso identification system established in this zzso The zzso that were positive for each zzso isolate were used to determine close relatives of these species and some of their biological zzso The transfer of zzso from a zzso platform to a zzso diagnostic was successful, and the identification system is robust for both known and unknown species of zzso
