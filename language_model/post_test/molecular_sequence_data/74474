zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso bacterial pathogen that causes zzso show limited genetic zzso We generated zzso sequences for 19 zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso including the previously zzso zzso and zzso zzso were selected to represent major zzso in the zzso zzso Comparative analysis showed little evidence of zzso selection, zzso variation or zzso between zzso Rather, evolution in the zzso population seems to be characterized by ongoing loss of gene function, consistent with a small effective population zzso The lack of evidence for zzso variation driven by immune selection is in contrast to strong zzso selection for zzso zzso zzso resistance in zzso The observed patterns of genetic isolation and drift are consistent with the proposed key role of zzso carriers of zzso as the main zzso of this zzso highlighting the need for identification and treatment of zzso
