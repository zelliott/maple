An analysis of the universal target zzso sequence from the zzso gene was performed in order to evaluate its usefulness in zzso and zzso studies and as an identification marker for the zzso zzso zzso of 555 zzso corresponding to the zzso region, were obtained from a collection of 35 strains representing all of the species and subspecies of zzso From the analysis of these zzso a range of divergence of zzso was zzso with a mean of zzso Comparative analyses between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene sequences were carried out from the same zzso strain zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region showed similar zzso power to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso relationships zzso from zzso sequence distances indicated an excellent correlation with the present affiliation of zzso species with the exception of zzso zzso zzso zzso which appeared in a separate zzso line, and zzso zzso which exhibited a very loose zzso relationship to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso from 33 additional zzso strains also allowed us to establish zzso and zzso threshold zzso zzso divergence rates were zzso while zzso divergence rates fell between zzso and zzso excluding zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso sequencing was shown to be a universal, useful, simple and rapid method for the identification and zzso affiliation of zzso zzso
