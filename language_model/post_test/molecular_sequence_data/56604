The zzso organization of the gene cluster zzso the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso coli was zzso Genes zzso to zzso were determined to constitute a single zzso unit under the control of the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso and that of an upstream open reading frame zzso on the opposite zzso designated zzso were determined to share limited zzso with the zzso and zzso genes of the P zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso transcripts were mapped by primer extension and zzso protection zzso The promoters for these transcripts were associated with potential regulatory sequences including two consensus zzso regulatory protein zzso sites which contained zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso site, and an integration host factor zzso zzso zzso of the zzso locus was determined to be dependent on zzso subject to zzso repression, and dependent on zzso
