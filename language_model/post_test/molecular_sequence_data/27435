The family of zzso zzso zzso genes comprises zzso zzso and zzso This study used zzso to demonstrate the presence of zzso genes among zzso from a collection of zzso strains and clinical zzso zzso zzso and zzso appeared to be present in a limited number of zzso zzso the zzso gene was distributed zzso among all zzso zzso None of the zzso genes were detected among intermediate or zzso zzso zzso It was also shown that, similar to the previously characterized zzso zzso a short specific zzso zzso of zzso could be used to correctly identify zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso is widely present among zzso strains and may be useful for their reliable identification and zzso
