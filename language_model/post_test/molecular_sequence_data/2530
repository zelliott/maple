The zzso zzso region, zzso situated between the gag and pol zzso underwent gene zzso in the lineage now represented by zzso zzso type 1; the sequence of the duplicated segment has zzso considerably from the present zzso sequence zzso zzso Marx, zzso Bryant, zzso Gardner, zzso Barr, zzso & zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso The zzso duplicated gene segment was at some point zzso to a new site within the pol gene of a zzso zzso to the divergence of human zzso virus type 1), where it has been zzso We have identified in the zzso virus zzso a sequence that is zzso to the zzso duplicated gene segment of both types of zzso in an open reading frame whose product is predicted to be a zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene is located in the zzso F fragment, and its product displays zzso zzso acid identity to the two types of zzso duplicated zzso sequences over a region encompassing 125 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene showed no significant zzso at either the DNA or zzso acid level to the zzso zzso zzso and primer extension analyses determined that the zzso gene is transcribed early in zzso
