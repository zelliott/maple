The structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso S peptides have been investigated to develop the structural rationale for their zzso and zzso zzso The basis for these studies is zzso zzso designed as an extension of the naturally occurring zzso zzso The structure of zzso has been determined using zzso methods and was found to exist in a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the framework of the zzso zzso were found to decrease the zzso of this zzso These results indicated that there was a direct correlation between the high zzso character and potent zzso activity in the zzso whereas an inverse correlation existed between zzso and zzso zzso To define the structural consequences of changing the zzso nature of zzso zzso to maximize zzso activity and to minimize zzso zzso structures were determined in water and the zzso zzso zzso The structures show that these attributes are the result of induction of the zzso character in a membrane environment and the positioning of charged side chains on the zzso face of the zzso zzso thus decreasing the zzso and directed zzso of these zzso zzso for the design of more effective zzso are zzso
