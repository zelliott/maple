zzso are small zzso proteins expressed in all zzso They are involved in the regulation of zzso filament dynamics and various zzso zzso The identification of a variety of zzso zzso led to the assumption that there may be zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed and engaged in the regulation of various zzso processes in all cell zzso By contrast, zzso zzso is mainly restricted to zzso cells and there is evidence that it is involved in zzso plasticity and membrane zzso However, the zzso sequence is much better zzso than zzso throughout different zzso indicating that its restricted expression and specialized function in zzso might be zzso Using zzso zzso we show that the situation is different in zzso zzso is zzso expressed in embryonic and adult chicken zzso at equal and frequently higher amounts than in zzso Together with zzso it is present in cultivated chicken zzso but zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso reveal that zzso is involved in cell zzso spreading and zzso and zzso this zzso has pronounced consequences on these zzso Our results indicate zzso zzso expression is zzso regulated among zzso
