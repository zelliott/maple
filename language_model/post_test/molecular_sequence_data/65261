Alternative zzso is an important mechanism to generate a large number of zzso thus increasing zzso diversity and tissue zzso Three transcript zzso of zzso a zzso protein mainly involved in zzso have been described so zzso Whereas zzso 140 is the whole and main transcript, zzso 112 and 126 are short proteins that result from zzso deletions of zzso 3 and 5, zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso show differential expression changes in zzso body diseases zzso in the present work, we searched for a fourth zzso zzso and studied its expression levels in zzso zzso By using zzso zzso zzso zzso and direct sequencing, we identified zzso 98, which lacks zzso 3 and zzso zzso expression analyses in zzso tissue revealed that zzso 98 is a zzso zzso zzso with varying expression levels in different areas of fetal and adult zzso Additionally, we studied zzso 98 expression levels by real-time zzso zzso in the frontal zzso of zzso patients and compared them with those of zzso disease zzso patients and control zzso zzso of zzso 98 in zzso and zzso brains would indicate its specific involvement in the zzso of these neurodegenerative zzso
