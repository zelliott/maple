Two zzso binding growth factors with different molecular weight, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso from bovine zzso The two factors have almost the same affinity to zzso they were zzso with zzso M zzso from the affinity zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso growth factor by zzso acid sequence zzso The zzso zzso zzso was an zzso blocked zzso and was suggested to be zzso cell growth zzso These molecular species may play significant roles in maintaining zzso structure in zzso and be related to the zzso activity of the zzso
