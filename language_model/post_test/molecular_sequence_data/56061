Prior to zzso zzso light zzso chain zzso zzso cells can express zzso heavy zzso chains at the cell surface in association with zzso zzso L zzso This complex may be essential for B cell zzso We have investigated the composition of the zzso L chain complex of a human zzso cell line, in view of its potential role in zzso signal zzso The zzso zzso of a mature B cell line was analyzed in zzso The zzso L chain complex is associated with zzso molecules that are zzso or identical to the zzso and zzso zzso known to be integral components of membrane zzso receptors on mature B zzso Both receptors contain zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso could clearly be zzso The zzso and zzso proteins in both zzso and zzso L chain receptors are zzso for in zzso zzso on zzso but also on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The undefined zzso zzso zzso also zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso protein that is present in both zzso The zzso protein may be an integral part of both zzso types, or a zzso associated zzso instrumental in the signaling zzso We conclude that the zzso L zzso on human zzso cells fulfills the presently known criteria to function as a signal zzso zzso
