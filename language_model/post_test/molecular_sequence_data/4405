Two zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso and an open reading frame zzso were found in the zzso region which was previously identified as a zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes zzso predicted zzso of 629 and zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, zzso and zzso had 81 and zzso zzso acid identities with zzso zzso A zzso zzso strain zzso which contained a deletion in the entire zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not show zzso towards all 20 commonly occurring zzso zzso This zzso strain also failed to respond to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are strong zzso for the zzso strain zzso To study the role of each gene product in zzso acid zzso plasmids zzso the zzso zzso zzso or zzso genes were constructed and introduced into strain zzso by zzso The zzso gene did not complement the zzso in zzso of strain zzso The zzso gene restored the ability of strain zzso to respond to 18 zzso zzso suggesting that zzso plays a major role in detecting zzso acids in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes zzso the zzso in zzso to only seven zzso zzso zzso zzso Met, zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
