Previous results indicated that translation of four zzso genes and one zzso gene zzso is zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso lacking zzso and zzso zzso translation was studied here using a zzso targeted green zzso protein zzso fused to the zzso promoter and its zzso and 3' untranslated regions zzso Lack of zzso expression independent of carbon source and strain background was established to be at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was not due to zzso of zzso respiratory function but was rather caused directly by the lack of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of a functional zzso gene under control of the zzso promoter restored zzso synthesis and expression of zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed the presence of a zzso zzso with two zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a protein zzso specifically to this sequence was observed with zzso from zzso but not zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso as reporters, zzso spontaneous zzso zzso that allowed expression of zzso and zzso were isolated, which appeared to be zzso zzso suggesting that the genes zzso may zzso the trans factors that bind to the zzso element in zzso zzso
