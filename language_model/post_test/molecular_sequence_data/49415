zzso of the smooth muscle zzso zzso targeting zzso 1 zzso are generated by zzso alternative zzso of zzso zzso expression of these zzso is thought to determine smooth zzso properties and unique responses to signaling zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso regulators of zzso of the chicken zzso central alternative zzso Comparisons of alternative zzso zzso were made between smooth muscle cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the central alternative zzso is zzso and slow zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the alternative zzso is zzso We demonstrate that zzso of the alternative zzso requires a zzso complex in the vicinity of the alternative zzso zzso zzso This complex consists of two zzso motifs in an zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso tract zzso or T cell inhibitor of zzso binding zzso an zzso zzso zzso that has similarities with the cardiac zzso T zzso zzso and a potentially novel zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains the zzso sequence zzso present in many other transcripts where alternative zzso of zzso occurs, suggesting that it may be more broadly zzso The zzso zzso is adjacent to a potentially novel zzso zzso element that contains a zzso imperfect zzso zzso This zzso in conjunction with a zzso zzso zzso is proposed to mediate the zzso of zzso of the zzso central alternative zzso in the fast zzso smooth muscle zzso
