The molecular basis of the zzso tumor rejection zzso of chemically induced zzso of zzso mice remains a mystery, despite the discovery of these zzso over 40 years ago and their critical importance to the foundation of tumor zzso In an analysis of a panel of zzso zzso tumors, we identified one zzso zzso that zzso a strong zzso T cell response with exquisite specificity for zzso A stable cloned line of T cells with this specificity zzso was used to screen a zzso zzso expression zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso was identified as a zzso form of a mouse zzso protein zzso zzso and a zzso incorporating the resulting zzso acid substitution zzso to zzso was efficiently recognized by zzso zzso with this zzso zzso specific resistance to zzso zzso zzso efforts to isolate zzso zzso of zzso were zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso protein zzso is essential for maintenance of the zzso zzso
