zzso use specialized zzso zzso systems to transport proteins across their cell zzso in order to manipulate their zzso In zzso zzso tuberculosis there are five zzso zzso zzso systems, named zzso through zzso Each system includes a zzso zzso zzso or zzso as a core component essential for zzso Here we report crystal structures of zzso and zzso the zzso expressed by the zzso and zzso systems, zzso In both zzso the putative zzso wraps around the zzso domain and does not zzso the active zzso The extensive contacts between the putative zzso and zzso domain, which include a zzso bond, suggest that the zzso extension is an integral part of the active zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are located in a deep active site groove in contrast with an exposed active site in majority of zzso We show that zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso protein B zzso in zzso at zzso zzso and zzso We also systematically characterize the specificity of zzso using zzso libraries, and show that it has evolved a narrow specificity relative to other zzso Finally, comparison of the zzso and zzso structures suggest that both zzso have stringent and different specificity profiles that result from the structurally distinct active site pockets, which could explain the system specific functioning of these zzso
