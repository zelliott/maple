A computer program is designed to facilitate the identification of coding zzso fragments using a set of zzso The program is written on Basic programming language for personal computer zzso zzso To accelerate some operations, computer code commands are zzso Treatment of 50 DNA fragments by means of 10 peptides takes zzso 1 h of computer zzso The program zzso list coding zzso fragments and corresponding zzso The suggested zzso is based on our finding that the number of false identifications of a coding gene fragments may be predicted by zzso distribution and minimized using correct zzso The suggested method enables one to evaluate the reliability of the true identification of DNA fragments in case of mistakes in primary structure of the gene fragments or zzso
