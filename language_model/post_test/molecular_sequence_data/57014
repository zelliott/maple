We cloned a mouse zzso zzso to identify the zzso in zzso mice zzso and to determine the relationship of the zzso locus zzso both to zzso 10 markers and to zzso the zzso activity zzso zzso The his zzso a G to A transition at zzso zzso changes zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso reduced amounts of zzso protein and activity compared to the zzso zzso Hal maps approximately 4 zzso zzso to the zzso growth zzso locus and approximately 10 zzso zzso to zzso zzso was found to be tightly linked to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was associated with reduced zzso zzso These studies indicate that the zzso zzso reduces the stability of zzso position Hal on the zzso 10 linkage map, and provide further evidence that zzso is zzso to zzso
