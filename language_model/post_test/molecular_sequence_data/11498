The current zzso of aquatic zzso is based on zzso zzso with zzso zzso In this study a comparison of several procedures used for zzso aquatic zzso was made with 10 virus strains (4 reference strains from zzso and 6 zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso The relationships among the zzso strains were studied by zzso zzso with zzso zzso and by zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso The results were compared with a zzso zzso obtained from analysis of restriction zzso patterns of zzso products obtained by zzso zzso No correlation was found among the results obtained by the different zzso The zzso and the zzso zzso with zzso zzso were not useful in zzso these zzso zzso however, patterns of reaction with zzso zzso emphasized the individuality of the zzso particularly in the case of two strains zzso and zzso whose patterns did not zzso to established zzso The application of zzso and restriction zzso analysis is a promising system for approaching the zzso of this viral group on the basis of zzso differences and zzso The variable results obtained in this comparison lead us to think that the current zzso of aquatic zzso may not be the most accurate and there is a need for modification incorporating recent zzso not only from zzso species but also from marine zzso
