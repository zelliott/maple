The nuclear pore complex zzso embedded in the nuclear zzso is a large, dynamic molecular assembly that zzso exchange of zzso between the nucleus and the zzso The zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso structure composed of zzso zzso chains contributed by zzso distinct proteins termed zzso zzso identified only in zzso plays a central role in both protein import and zzso export through the zzso zzso is a modular protein with zzso zzso repeats containing a zzso sequence motif and a zzso targeting domain at its zzso We report the crystal structure of the zzso targeting domain of zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso The X-ray structure of zzso is consistent with the molecular envelope determined in solution by zzso X-ray zzso zzso similarities of zzso with zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso are zzso
