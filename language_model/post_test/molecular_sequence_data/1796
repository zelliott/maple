We found in previous work a significant association between schizophrenia and zzso on zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed 10 zzso markers and found an association of schizophrenia with zzso and zzso that flank zzso The zzso B gene zzso is 30 zzso from zzso The zzso B zzso I) belongs to a series of zzso zzso proteins that are widely expressed in zzso and zzso cells, and its zzso fluid levels have been reported to decrease in patients with chronic zzso 

We screened for zzso in zzso with zzso chain reaction direct sequencing methods in 24 Japanese schizophrenic patients and identified a total of 22 zzso zzso and zzso zzso of detected zzso were compared between unrelated Japanese schizophrenic patients zzso zzso zzso and healthy control subjects zzso zzso zzso 

zzso significant differences in the zzso zzso were found between schizophrenic patients and control subjects for zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were in almost complete linkage zzso and were in linkage zzso with zzso 

zzso suggest that the zzso variations are involved in the zzso to schizophrenia in our study zzso
