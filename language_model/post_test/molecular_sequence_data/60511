The structural features of binding sites for volatile zzso are examined by performing a molecular dynamics simulation study of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso which are formed by association of two zzso zzso zzso The zzso bundle zzso was designed by zzso et zzso zzso 37 zzso zzso and was shown zzso to have a high affinity for the binding of the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Since zzso can exhibit either the anti or zzso zzso the two distinct zzso are simulated both in the presence and in the absence of zzso zzso length molecular dynamics zzso were generated for each system at room temperature zzso zzso zzso zzso The structural and dynamic effects of the inclusion of zzso are zzso illustrating that the structures are stable over the course of the zzso that the zzso zzso have suitable pockets that can accommodate zzso that the zzso remains in the designed zzso cavity in close proximity to the zzso zzso with a preferred zzso and that the dimensions of the zzso are zzso by the inclusion of an zzso zzso
