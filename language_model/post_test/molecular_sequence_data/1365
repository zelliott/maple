In common with other zzso plants zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso to mediate responses to a wide variety of zzso In contrast to other zzso plants have an unusually large number of zzso zzso such as more than 20 zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso and 60 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Group (2002) Trends Plant zzso 7, zzso zzso it is mostly unknown how zzso signaling specificity is generated in zzso Here we have isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), a novel zzso from alfalfa zzso zzso In plant zzso zzso showed zzso zzso activity and was found to induce cell zzso Among a panel of hormones and stresses tested, only zzso was found to activate zzso Out of four zzso zzso specifically activated zzso resulting in an increased cell death zzso zzso analysis between zzso proteins indicated that zzso directly interacts with zzso and that zzso and zzso are part of a protein complex in zzso These results indicate that zzso plays a zzso scaffolding role and functions in zzso of zzso zzso cell death in zzso
