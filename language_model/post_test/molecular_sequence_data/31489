Three strictly zzso zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from rumen of the Korean native cattle zzso zzso zzso zzso in South zzso The colonies were zzso zzso and slightly zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso M zzso sequences confirmed the affiliation of the novel strains with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the most closely related zzso The zzso zzso gene and zzso sequence similarities between strains zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso with strains zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso gene and zzso sequences were zzso zzso stained zzso and were zzso zzso zzso zzso long and zzso zzso zzso The strains were able to use zzso and zzso The optimum temperature and pH ranges for growth were zzso zzso and pH zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was 28 zzso Based on data from this study using a zzso approach, the three strains represent a novel species of zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
