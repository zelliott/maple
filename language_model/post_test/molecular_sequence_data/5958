We have cloned zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso B and zzso While zzso A1 and B are most closely related to either A- or zzso zzso of other species, zzso B3 is less related to these zzso However, this zzso is most similar to the recently identified chicken zzso zzso Our identification of a zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso B3 has been zzso in zzso zzso A1 is a member of an zzso zzso family; however the zzso A1 zzso only recognizes a single band on northern zzso A zzso zzso is also observed for the zzso B3 zzso In contrast, three different transcripts are observed for the zzso B zzso Based on our analyses using zzso from zzso zzso and from populations enriched for zzso one zzso B transcript is specific to the paternal zzso The two other zzso B zzso as well as the zzso A1 and zzso B3 zzso are most abundant in the maternal zzso and are only present at low levels in other zzso Moreover, the 3' untranslated regions of each zzso zzso zzso possess several copies of potential zzso control elements shown in zzso and zzso maternal zzso zzso to function during zzso and early zzso
