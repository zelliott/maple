The zzso chain zzso zzso is an essential component of high affinity zzso playing critical role for the immune specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso Up to now, no duck zzso zzso has been zzso Here, the zzso segment of a duck zzso zzso zzso zzso a 226 zzso precursor protein with a 20 zzso signal zzso was zzso Then a novel mouse zzso zzso zzso was generated using the zzso expressed zzso protein as zzso Using this zzso the zzso zzso zzso was localized on the surface of duck zzso and the duck zzso zzso proliferation was further zzso Furthermore, flow zzso analysis showed that zzso positive cells were zzso in ducks infected with avian influenza virus zzso Our findings confirm that zzso is a zzso of duck zzso and zzso positive cells play a potential role in zzso virus zzso
