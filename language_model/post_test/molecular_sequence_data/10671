The application of flow zzso zzso for determination of zzso respiratory burst zzso activity, to the investigation of chronic zzso disease zzso may lead to improved laboratory detection of patients and carriers and indicate the nature of the molecular zzso To evaluate the diagnostic capability of flow zzso an investigation of 5 zzso families was zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined using zzso 123 zzso and flow zzso analysis in 26 members of 5 zzso families zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso from zzso patients displayed absence of zzso Female carriers demonstrated dual zzso zzso of high and low intensity indicative of normal and abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was observed in a boy whose zzso was successfully treated by bone zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was observed in 3 patients with zzso zzso compared with their parents and zzso The patterns of flow zzso zzso correlated with the different molecular defects zzso zzso of the zzso membrane component of the zzso zzso complex resulted in a significantly reduced level of respiratory burst activity which was comparable to that observed in zzso whereas reduced but zzso levels of respiratory burst activity were observed in a patient with diminished levels of zzso and in a patient with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso flow zzso zzso offers a sensitive diagnostic screening test for zzso and zzso may provide an indication of the likely underlying molecular zzso
