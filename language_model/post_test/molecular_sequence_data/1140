zzso is an essential component of numerous zzso with functions including oxygen zzso energy zzso and drug zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Upon exposure to drugs that induce zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso increasing the rate of zzso zzso to provide zzso for zzso zzso zzso We used a combined in zzso zzso approach to identify sequences in the zzso gene that mediate direct zzso response to zzso zzso We have characterized two zzso zzso located 20 and 16 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso Both elements respond to zzso zzso drugs and interact with the human zzso X zzso zzso and the human zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the fundamental mechanism of drug induction is the same for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is the first step in the coordinated zzso of zzso and zzso synthesis in response to zzso and zzso signals controlling zzso zzso zzso the direct effects of drugs on zzso synthesis is of clinical interest, particularly in patients with zzso zzso
