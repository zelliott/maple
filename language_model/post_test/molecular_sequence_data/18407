A synthetic zzso zzso derived from the sequence of the sea zzso zzso adhesive zzso zzso has been shown to bind zzso zzso in high zzso strength zzso zzso The binding is enhanced by approximately zzso in the presence of zinc zzso and no other transition metal tested demonstrates any zzso zzso isolated from zzso contains zinc zzso at roughly zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the synthetic zzso binds to eggs and zzso zzso with a zzso effective concentration of 300 zzso The zzso binding selectivity of the zzso complex is similar to zzso but less zzso Although the order of effectiveness of the zzso zzso is the same for zzso and the synthetic zzso zzso that are only weak zzso of zzso binding to zzso show greater effectiveness against the zzso The effect of chemical zzso zzso and zzso acid substitution on the binding properties of the zzso suggest that zzso zzso zzso interact with the zzso zzso while zzso groups zzso zinc zzso Although the mechanism of zzso stimulation of zzso binding is not yet clear, one potential explanation is that zinc may stabilize a zzso secondary structure that has a high affinity for zzso
