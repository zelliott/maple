We report the molecular zzso with zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso regions, of seven new human zzso zzso strains from Russian patients with classical zzso zzso zzso studies, based on the complete zzso zzso analysis, indicate that six of these strains belong to the A zzso with one belonging to the A4 group and exhibiting a unique deletion of 19 zzso acids in the zzso region at position zzso zzso studies of the zzso zzso region indicate that four of the new strains were of the M zzso while three belonged to the P zzso Our study indicates an important genetic diversity of the zzso strains currently present in Russia, including a new peculiar strain possessing a unique deletion in the zzso segment, and confirms the absence of correlation between the zzso and zzso molecular zzso as M and P zzso can be observed in the A zzso zzso
