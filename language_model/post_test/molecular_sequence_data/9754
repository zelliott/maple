We have characterized the zzso sequence of zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso in zzso of the sea urchin, zzso zzso The primer extension experiments showed that the sea zzso zzso gene generated multiple lengths of zzso To obtain the zzso of the zzso we isolated zzso clones by the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso These clones were classified into 2 types on the basis of their zzso leader zzso The sequences of the clones were identical except their zzso zzso By Northern zzso analysis, 1 of the 2 types of transcripts was always zzso in sea zzso zzso during early development, and another was not detected before the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the two zzso leaders were coded by different zzso separated by an zzso in a single zzso These results show that the transcripts coding 2 zzso were expressed from a single zzso
