The zzso and zzso potential was examined of human zzso type 5 zzso zzso carrying and expressing from one to four tandem repeats of a linear zzso zzso from the zzso protein of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso as a fusion with the zzso zzso The fusion proteins produced by these Ad zzso in infected cell culture reacted with a zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso to a degree dependent on the number of zzso repeats in the zzso Mice zzso by zzso injection of the Ad zzso developed an zzso immune response as measured by zzso and by zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso induced by a single injection of the Ad zzso increased with the number of zzso repeats expressed by the zzso Any animal that had developed a zzso zzso of at least zzso survived challenge with a normally lethal dose of zzso administered by the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing four repeats of the zzso zzso were as effective in zzso induction and protection as an zzso zzso carrying and expressing the entire zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the expression of tandem repeats of appropriate zzso sequences by zzso zzso may provide a safe and effective method of zzso against zzso zzso
