A panel of zzso which differ in their L chain structures and which bind to structurally defined zzso would be useful in investigating L chain structure and zzso In a previous study, chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced by zzso zzso Although both parental zzso bound zzso with high zzso zzso lacked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was subsequently fused with H zzso zzso in order to produce a panel of zzso composed of zzso H chains and zzso zzso L zzso Two zzso produced were zzso which demonstrated zzso activity and zzso which did zzso zzso and zzso expressed only one zzso acid difference zzso to zzso at zzso This difference resulted in the zzso binding zzso In this report, two new zzso zzso are zzso One, zzso contained the Pro to zzso zzso zzso but still bound zzso zzso affinities and binding specificity patterns, as well as complete zzso DNA sequence and corresponding protein sequence of the new zzso binding zzso L chains zzso and zzso are zzso Both zzso L chains are highly zzso to the zzso zzso L chain as well as the zzso zzso gene zzso These results suggest that zzso which are initially defective in binding activity can be cured by changing specific zzso acids involved in determining the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of the zzso region were completed to address L chain structural changes induced by specific zzso acid zzso
