The zzso zzso is a dynamic environment that constantly zzso zzso and degradation during vital zzso processes such as zzso wound healing, and zzso zzso zzso zzso breakdown is associated with many diseases such as arthritis, cancer and zzso zzso collagen is zzso by zzso zzso with zzso activity by zzso zzso and zzso collectively known as the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso plays a pivotal role in degradation of zzso collagen types I, II, and zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of the active form of human zzso at zzso A zzso This is the first zzso structure that is free of inhibitor and a water zzso essential for zzso zzso is observed coordinated with the active site zzso Comparing this structure with the human zzso shows significant structural differences, mainly in the relative orientation of the zzso domain, between the pro form and active form of the human zzso
