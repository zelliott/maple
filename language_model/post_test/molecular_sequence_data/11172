The induction and repair of DNA zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso DNA of human cells in culture were zzso after cell exposure to zzso zzso The level of induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and nuclear DNA was comparable, while a higher frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso than in nuclear zzso Besides the known zzso in zzso zzso zzso were shown to be deficient also in the zzso of 6-4 zzso The effects of zzso conditions for the two major zzso zzso on zzso was assessed by zzso the frequency and spectrum of spontaneous and zzso zzso by restriction site zzso zzso method in a restriction zzso site, zzso zzso located within the coding sequence of the zzso gene for zzso The spontaneous zzso frequency and spectrum at the zzso site of zzso DNA was very similar to the zzso background zzso frequency zzso zzso and type zzso zzso transitions at zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an approximately tenfold increase over background zzso frequency was recorded after cell exposure to 20 zzso In this case, the majority of zzso were zzso transitions zzso located on the zzso DNA strand at C1 and C2 of the zzso zzso This zzso spectrum is expected by zzso zzso This is the first evidence of induction of zzso in zzso DNA by treatment of human cells with a zzso
