To test the ability of the zzso chain reaction zzso to detect zzso zzso in blood, we generated two sets of zzso zzso The first defined zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso and the second defined zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso These zzso segments were detected in zzso from zzso of all 20 zzso zzso tested, but they were not detected when used to test zzso from 41 zzso of zzso bacteria and zzso The sensitivity was evaluated by using zzso zzso zzso We were able to detect 10 zzso of zzso zzso DNA, or zzso zzso zzso Blood samples were obtained from 16 patients with zzso zzso zzso and were subjected to zzso zzso Of eight zzso coat zzso tested, six showed zzso in the zzso with the zzso zzso and five of the eight produced the expected products when tested with the zzso zzso zzso 75 and zzso zzso Of the eight zzso specimens tested, only three produced the expected products with either set of zzso Additionally, we tested 14 samples from patients with zzso that were culture positive for zzso bacterial species, and 13 were negative zzso zzso This combination of sensitivity and specificity may make detection of zzso zzso in blood by zzso in comparison with that by blood culture a very promising alternative for a means of definitive zzso
