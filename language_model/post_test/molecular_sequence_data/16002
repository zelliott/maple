The structural and functional organization of the zzso zzso virus type I zzso DNA zzso zzso of strain zzso was studied by a combination of sequence and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso DNA zzso sequence with those of zzso and zzso DNA zzso resulted in the allocation of zzso zzso regions within the zzso DNA zzso From the analysis of all currently identified zzso of zzso and drug-resistant zzso DNA zzso zzso as well as from the degree of zzso observed, it could be deduced that the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequence regions zzso constitute the major structural components of the zzso domain of the zzso which should accommodate the sites for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further insight into the structural organization was gained by the use of zzso zzso responding specifically to the zzso central and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Each of the zzso was able to zzso as well as to zzso a viral zzso of 132 zzso 5 zzso that corresponded well to the molecular mass of 136 zzso predicted from the coding zzso zzso and zzso studies confirmed that both functions, zzso and zzso zzso are intimately related to each other, and revealed that, in addition to the sequences of the proposed zzso domain, the very zzso zzso except for zzso zzso zzso are important for the zzso functions of the zzso most likely zzso the binding to zzso
