Many group I zzso zzso zzso that promote zzso zzso by initiating a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this work we describe zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso the DNA zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which belong to the zzso zzso family and possess zzso activity in zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso indicate that zzso and zzso are required for zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso process is a gene conversion event that does not require the major zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the necessary functions are provided by zzso zzso Our results provide the first examples of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the first demonstration of zzso zzso initiated by a zzso zzso
