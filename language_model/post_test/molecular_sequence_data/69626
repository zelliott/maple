A complementary DNA zzso a salicylic acid zzso protein has been zzso Its properties suggest involvement in zzso induction of systemic acquired resistance zzso in zzso The sequence of the protein is similar to that of zzso and the protein exhibits zzso zzso zzso acid specifically inhibited the zzso activity in zzso and induced an increase in zzso zzso in zzso zzso or compounds, such as zzso that inhibit zzso or enhance the generation of zzso induced expression of zzso genes associated with zzso Thus, the action of zzso in zzso is likely zzso by elevated amounts of zzso
