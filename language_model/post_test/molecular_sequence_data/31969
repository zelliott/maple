zzso have evolved a unique carbon fixation zzso known as the zzso that zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This effectively increases the local CO2 concentration at the active site of zzso and decreases its relatively zzso side reaction with zzso zzso consist of a protein shell composed of zzso and zzso proteins arranged in zzso zzso Facets composed of zzso proteins are connected at the zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also found in zzso bacteria where they form zzso related zzso such as the zzso and zzso zzso for the metabolism of zzso and zzso zzso Here we describe two new high-resolution structures of the zzso shell protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and provide detailed analysis of their characteristics and comparison with related shell zzso
