zzso necrosis factor zzso is a zzso zzso produced by many types of zzso It has been shown that two distinct zzso receptors zzso zzso type I zzso I) and zzso type II zzso zzso have different functions in signal zzso which is possibly associated with the development of a variety of zzso In this study, we isolated a zzso zzso I zzso clone and zzso the expression of zzso I and zzso II zzso in zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso and zzso similarity with those of its human, zzso zzso and pig counterparts, zzso The zzso zzso I zzso was shown to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fundamentally zzso in the zzso of other zzso zzso of zzso I and zzso II zzso was shown to be zzso in zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso by stimulation with zzso zzso Five of six zzso zzso cell lines were shown to express both zzso I and zzso II zzso The expression of zzso I in zzso was zzso in cats infected with zzso zzso virus zzso whereas the expression of zzso II in zzso was not different between zzso cats and zzso zzso The present study indicate that expression of zzso I and zzso II may be associated with disease zzso especially in zzso infections in zzso
