zzso of the ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso zzso is initiated in zzso by DNA zzso such as zzso zzso that do not share significant sequence identity with their zzso counterparts, typified by zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The unexpected presence of a functional zzso zzso in the model plant zzso zzso has brought into question the existence of functional zzso zzso in zzso We report here the zzso zzso expression and functional characterization of zzso an zzso zzso gene widely expressed in different plant zzso which encodes a zzso zzso protein with significant sequence identity to zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso duplex DNA containing an zzso zzso and the repair reaction proceeds through an zzso intermediate
