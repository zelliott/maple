zzso zzso injury in the kidney is a major cause of acute kidney injury zzso in humans and is associated with significantly high zzso To identify genes that zzso kidney injury and repair, we conducted zzso expression analysis in the rat zzso after zzso and found that the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso chains significantly increase in the kidney and remain elevated throughout the zzso zzso Cellular characterization of zzso and zzso chain zzso proteins shows a zzso expression in zzso zzso cells and the zzso of zzso zzso chain protein is primarily in the zzso zzso in healthy and zzso zzso We also show that urinary zzso of zzso is zzso increased after kidney damage and is capable of distinguishing human patients with acute or chronic kidney injury zzso zzso 25) from healthy volunteers zzso zzso 25) with high sensitivity and specificity zzso under the receiver operating characteristic of zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso administration protects mice from zzso kidney injury by aiding in zzso cell proliferation and tissue zzso Given that kidney zzso is a major zzso of outcome for patients with kidney damage, these results provide new opportunities for the use of zzso in diagnosis, zzso and therapeutic interventions in kidney zzso
