The stability of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso was analyzed by molecular dynamics zzso The calculated free energy differences of zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso These values are in good agreement with the experimental zzso The free energy differences divided into zzso and van der zzso components were zzso These two zzso are mainly zzso due to van der zzso zzso There is little difference between the zzso contribution to the free energy change in the native state and that in the zzso zzso In each zzso structure, a small cavity appears in the vicinity of the zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso van der zzso interactions of the zzso are weaker than those of the zzso Furthermore, analyses of the contributions of each zzso near the zzso zzso and of water to the free energy difference of zzso suggest that the interaction between water and the zzso zzso plays a very important role in the stability of zzso zzso and that a small zzso core consisting of the three aromatic rings zzso zzso zzso and the side chain of zzso is also important for the zzso
