The strategy of zzso by functional zzso was used to isolate a zzso designated zzso from a zzso library constructed from dehydrated zzso zzso Baker zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence indicated a highly zzso protein with six zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed that there are at least two copies of zzso in zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed zzso identity to zzso a zzso protein from zzso The protein also showed between zzso to zzso identity to zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso stress tolerance when the cells were grown in 1 M zzso Analysis of gene expression using zzso zzso indicated that zzso is induced by dehydration, salt stress zzso zzso both low (4 degrees zzso and high temperature zzso degrees zzso and high light treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may have a significant role to play in the response of zzso zzso to zzso zzso
