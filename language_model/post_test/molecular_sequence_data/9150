Tree shrew zzso zzso is currently placed in Order zzso and has a wide distribution in Southeast Asia and Southwest zzso Due to its unique zzso such as small body size, high zzso mass ratio, short zzso cycle and life span, and low-cost of zzso tree shrew has been proposed to be an alternative experimental animal to primates in biomedical zzso However, there are some debates regarding the exact zzso affinity of tree shrew to zzso In this study, we determined the zzso entire zzso of three Chinese tree zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso flying zzso zzso zzso Combined with the published data for species in zzso we intended to discern the zzso relationship among representative species of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of Chinese tree zzso and zzso flying zzso shared similar gene organization and structure with those of other zzso zzso analysis based on 12 zzso zzso zzso genes revealed a closer relationship between species of zzso and zzso whereas species of zzso were clustered with zzso This pattern was consistent with previously reported zzso based on zzso data, but differed from the one reconstructed on the basis of nuclear zzso Our result suggested that the zzso affinity of tree shrew to primates may not be as close as we had zzso The ongoing project for sequencing the entire zzso of Chinese tree shrew will provide more information to clarify this important zzso
