To identify the genetic zzso in a large Chinese family with zzso dominant zzso zzso 

zzso DNA and clinical data were collected from the zzso zzso gene sequencing and zzso linkage analysis were used to disclose the molecular basis responsible for zzso cataract in the zzso 

Initially, sequencing analysis of the three genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso avian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso known to cause zzso cataract failed to find any zzso Then, zzso linkage analysis mapped the disease to zzso zzso between zzso and zzso with a maximum zzso score of zzso at zzso zzso analysis of the major intrinsic protein of lens fiber gene zzso a gene known to cause other types of cataract in the linkage zzso detected a novel zzso initiation zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was present in all patients with zzso cataract but was not present in any of the 13 unaffected family members nor in 96 control zzso 

zzso cataract was found in a large family and is caused by a novel initiation zzso zzso in zzso This study adds a new member in the existing list of genes causing zzso cataract and expands the zzso spectrum and zzso association of zzso zzso
