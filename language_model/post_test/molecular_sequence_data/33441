The zzso is the community of zzso present in surface zzso the thin surface film that forms the interface between aquatic environments and the zzso In this study we compared bacterial cell zzso and bacterial community structures of the zzso and the zzso (from the subsurface water zzso during a zzso bloom zzso zzso zzso cell zzso determined by flow zzso followed a typical zzso response to a zzso zzso with zzso and zzso acid content zzso bacterial cell numbers initially falling, probably due to selective zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid content bacterial cells increased in zzso but zzso cells did zzso There was no significant difference between zzso and zzso cell zzso during the zzso zzso distinct and consistent differences between the zzso and the zzso community structures were zzso This was monitored simultaneously by zzso zzso zzso gene terminal restriction zzso length zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso The zzso patterns of community structure observed in all of the zzso indicate that the zzso is distinctive and zzso
