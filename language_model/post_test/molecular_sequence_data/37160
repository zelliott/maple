zzso virus is closely related to the zzso zzso virus 5 zzso but is defective in zzso zzso The zzso virus F protein has a long zzso tail zzso domain that has been shown to inhibit membrane fusion, and this zzso effect could be eliminated by zzso of the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso Li, zzso Vincent, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To study the sequence requirements for regulation of fusion, zzso for zzso virus F protein zzso spanning zzso acids zzso to zzso and zzso were zzso zzso to zzso and the two zzso zzso at positions zzso and zzso were zzso doubly to zzso We found that zzso and zzso in the CT domain played a critical role in the zzso of fusion, as zzso of the two zzso zzso to zzso partially rescued fusion, and the double zzso zzso zzso completely rescued zzso zzso zzso of charged zzso to zzso had little effect on the suppression of fusion activity, whereas the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso enhanced fusion activity zzso The zzso zzso zzso also showed extensive zzso formation when expressed without the zzso virus zzso zzso By constructing a zzso zzso virus F CT zzso we also found that the zzso effect of the long CT of the zzso virus F protein could be partially transferred to the zzso F zzso These results demonstrate that an zzso CT of a zzso F protein interferes with membrane fusion in a zzso zzso
