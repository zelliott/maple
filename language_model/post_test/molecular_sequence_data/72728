A library of eight zzso zzso zzso that react with distinct zzso on native human type III collagen has been examined for the ability of these zzso to inhibit zzso zzso induced by this zzso Six of these zzso had no zzso one, zzso delayed the onset and slowed the rate of zzso zzso while another, zzso completely inhibited zzso In order to identify the zzso recognized by this zzso zzso a series of peptides that could fold to form zzso fragments was zzso Each zzso included six zzso triplets from the human type III collagen zzso where zzso and zzso represent the particular zzso acids in the zzso and a zzso zzso sequence to enhance zzso zzso Using these peptides we have identified the zzso as a zzso zzso zzso (where O is the zzso code for zzso starting at position 520 in the human type III collagen zzso zzso This sequence is zzso to the site proposed for the interaction of type III collagen with zzso of zzso
