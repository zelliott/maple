The incorporation of rice zzso into zzso fields strongly enhances methane production and zzso Although the decomposition processes of plant zzso in rice field soil has been zzso the structure and dynamics of the microbial communities involved are poorly zzso The purpose of the present study was to determine the dynamics of zzso fatty acids and the structure of bacterial communities during zzso decomposition in a rice field zzso The soil was zzso incubated with the incorporation of rice root or straw zzso for 90 days at three temperatures zzso 30, and 45 degrees zzso The dynamics of fatty acid zzso showed an initial cumulative phase followed by a rapid consumption phase and a zzso zzso zzso zzso the bacterial populations displayed distinct zzso during zzso zzso zzso showed a strong effect on the dynamics of bacterial zzso Members of zzso zzso I and zzso were most dominant in the zzso particularly in the early zzso zzso and zzso were abundant in the later zzso at 15 and 30 degrees C, while zzso were selected at 45 degrees zzso We suggest that the early zzso groups are responsible for the decomposition of the easily zzso fraction of zzso while the late zzso groups become more important in zzso the zzso or resistant fraction of plant zzso The bacterial succession probably is related to resource availability during zzso zzso The fast-growing organisms are favored at the beginning, while the zzso bacteria are better adapted in the later zzso when zzso availability is zzso
