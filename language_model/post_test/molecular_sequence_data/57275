We describe a novel type of mercury resistance zzso zzso which was found in the zzso of a zzso zzso strain isolated from a mercury zzso An zzso zzso zzso is bracketed by 25 zzso zzso repeats that have no sequence zzso with zzso repeats of classical mercury resistance zzso zzso and zzso Instead they show high zzso with zzso repeats zzso the zzso resistance segment of zzso zzso zzso A 38 zzso element, which is highly zzso to the zzso repeats of classical mercury resistance zzso has been found within zzso near one of its zzso This internal zzso repeat is fused to the zzso zzso of zzso in exactly the same way as in the zzso mercury resistance zzso This finding suggests that the zzso zzso was integrated into the zzso zzso module not through zzso zzso but rather via zzso of a classical mercury resistance zzso
