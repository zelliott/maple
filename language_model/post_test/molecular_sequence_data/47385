We investigated the regulation of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso among members of the gamma subdivision of the zzso which includes zzso zzso In zzso coli, this zzso zzso is zzso controlled by zzso zzso This regulation requires specific zzso within the untranslated leader of the zzso Secondary structure analysis of the zzso leaders of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and two zzso members of the gamma subdivision zzso zzso and zzso zzso shows that these foreign leaders share significant structural zzso with the zzso coli leader, particularly in the region which is critical for zzso zzso control in zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso leaders produce a regulatory response to zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our results suggest that an zzso zzso zzso regulatory mechanism may operate in all of these zzso However, the mechanism is not universally zzso among the gamma subdivision members, since at least one, zzso zzso does not contain the required zzso leader features, and its leader cannot provide the signals for regulation by zzso in zzso zzso We speculate that zzso zzso control developed during the evolution of the gamma branch of zzso
