The zzso induction of the zzso zzso zzso with the first appearance of the definitive zzso stem cell in the zzso zzso zzso promoter activity was dependent on a previously identified 23 zzso DNA segment containing zzso and zzso binding sites and on a newly identified, highly zzso 12 zzso DNA segment zzso zzso The sequence of Box B was identical in the human, mouse and rat zzso zzso of the zzso core sequence led to diminished zzso promoter zzso A protein complex which bound to Box B was found in zzso cells but not in cells which did not express zzso A zzso zzso containing a zzso of the zzso core was less effective in zzso shift zzso competitions than the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies identified a 37 zzso DNA binding protein which zzso with Box B in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified this protein as lung zzso factor zzso zzso expressed as a zzso zzso fusion zzso was capable of binding to Box zzso A zzso zzso was able to inhibit the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein by the zzso promoter and zzso zzso detected zzso bound to the zzso promoter in zzso but not zzso zzso These in zzso results suggest future in zzso experiments to examine the role of zzso a gene required for zzso in the induction of zzso during the genesis of the definitive zzso stem cell from the vascular zzso
