A zzso which functions as an electron zzso for the CO zzso complex from zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso It was isolated as a zzso having a native molecular weight of approximately zzso and zzso molecular weight of zzso calculated from the zzso acid zzso The zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso atoms and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were 395 and 295 zzso with zzso extinction zzso of zzso 395 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 295 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio ranged from zzso to zzso There were 5 zzso per zzso but no zzso zzso zzso or aromatic zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence showed a zzso cluster with potential to coordinate a zzso zzso The protein was stable for 30 zzso at 70 degrees C, but zzso during incubation at 85 degrees zzso
