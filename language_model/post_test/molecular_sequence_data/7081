Fundamental chemical transformations for zzso cycling of sulfur and nitrogen are zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the concerted zzso reductions of zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso was solved with zzso anomalous zzso zzso of the native zzso and zzso cluster zzso multiple zzso replacement, and zzso sequence zzso zzso symmetry within the zzso zzso generates a distinctive zzso zzso fold that controls zzso assembly and zzso zzso regions zzso between the zzso halves of zzso and among other zzso and zzso zzso revealed key zzso for stability and function, and identified a zzso or zzso zzso repeat zzso common to a zzso zzso The zzso zzso shares a zzso zzso zzso with the zzso cluster and zzso an unexpected zzso zzso In the zzso complex, zzso zzso zzso and binds to zzso iron through zzso An extensive zzso network of positive side zzso water zzso and zzso zzso activates zzso bonds for reductive zzso
