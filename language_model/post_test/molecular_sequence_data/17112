We present a method for the zzso of zzso from rat plasma by protein zzso and zzso No internal standard was used, as a labeled standard was not available and similar peptides did not show comparable extraction characteristics to zzso The zzso system included a zzso zzso 300 A pore size zzso a linear zzso was used with a mobile phase consisting of water and zzso each with zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected with the mass zzso in positive zzso mode monitoring the zzso charge state at zzso zzso The method had an zzso limit of detection of 1 zzso The lower limit of zzso zzso was 25 zzso zzso zzso which could be reduced with an appropriate internal zzso External zzso was used and zzso zzso were found to be linear over the range from 25 to 1000 zzso zzso to 290 zzso The method showed a high degree of precision and accuracy both within and between runs at four validation points, including the zzso
