zzso of zzso zzso into zzso body is a controlled zzso process, however the underlying molecular mechanism remains zzso In previous work, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso in our zzso zzso was shown to promote zzso differentiation in zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso might function as a zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso In the current work, we investigate the role of zzso in zzso differentiation and zzso body zzso First, the expression and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso body were assessed by Western zzso and zzso zzso was found to be zzso expressed in the zzso and zzso body but not in the zzso zzso facilitated zzso congregation and promoted zzso body production when zzso was applied on zzso At the same time, when zzso was spread on potato zzso zzso zzso medium prior to zzso zzso zzso exhibited slowed growth rates, resulting in zzso cords formation and zzso of zzso body zzso The zzso regulatory sequence of zzso was cloned by zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso lack zzso in the coding region and the upstream zzso zzso sequence was characterized by the existence of core promoter zzso which zzso two zzso boxes zzso a zzso box zzso a zzso box zzso and a zzso leader zzso within the zzso zzso The identification of regulatory expression elements may provide an explanation to the zzso and high-level expression of zzso during zzso zzso
