zzso is a vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso essential for the regulation of vascular network formation and zzso Previously, we have shown that the zzso zzso zzso region of the zzso promoter is capable of directing zzso reporter gene expression specifically into a subset of zzso cells zzso of transgenic mouse zzso However, zzso activity was restricted to early embryonic stages and not zzso in adult zzso zzso we describe the identification and characterization of an autonomous zzso zzso in the first zzso of the mouse zzso zzso Furthermore, combination of the zzso promoter with an zzso zzso containing this zzso allows it to target reporter gene expression specifically and zzso to virtually all vascular zzso throughout zzso and zzso To our knowledge, this is the first time that an in zzso expression system has been assembled by which zzso genes can be targeted exclusively to the zzso of the entire zzso This should be a valuable tool to address the function of genes during zzso and pathological processes of vascular zzso in zzso Furthermore, we were able to identify a short region critical for zzso function in zzso that contains putative binding sites for zzso zzso zzso This should, therefore, allow us to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso expression of the zzso zzso
