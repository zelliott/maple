We tested the possibility that we may express unique zzso zzso on cell surfaces, and detect zzso zzso on these peptides using flow zzso Such development can enhance the application of flow zzso to detect and zzso zzso modifications in zzso To this end, the zzso section of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was modified to contain a zzso tag followed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso acids preceding the zzso site have a single zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein called zzso zzso was expressed on the surface of two zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso using a zzso delivery zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso portion of zzso zzso can be released from these cells by zzso and the resulting zzso can be readily captured and detected using zzso zzso Using this strategy, the zzso was zzso onto beads bearing zzso against either the zzso sequence or the human zzso The zzso zzso associated with the released zzso was detected using zzso and zzso zzso zzso that recognize the zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso released from cells could be separated and enriched using zzso zzso zzso Overall, such an approach that combines zzso protein expression with flow zzso may be useful to zzso changes in zzso zzso for basic science and clinical zzso
