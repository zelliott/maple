In this work, we provide a rationale for the finding that the zzso zzso zzso binds to its DNA response element as a zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso DNA binding domain zzso zzso to a zzso consensus zzso response element zzso is increased zzso when the zzso zzso is zzso either by a zzso zzso that recognizes an attached zzso tag or by expressing the zzso zzso as a single zzso in which the two zzso are joined by a zzso zzso Most of the increase in binding is due to stabilization of the zzso zzso zzso We observed only an approximately zzso reduction in binding when a consensus zzso was replaced with widely spaced zzso zzso suggesting that the interaction between zzso zzso on the zzso is relatively weak, and that in full-length zzso the zzso can move independently of each zzso To test binding to an imperfect zzso typical of the imperfect zzso found in almost all natural zzso zzso responsive zzso we used the zzso zzso Even at high zzso of zzso zzso specific binding of the zzso zzso to the imperfect zzso zzso was zzso Both of the zzso zzso zzso exhibited efficient binding to the imperfect zzso zzso with an affinity at least zzso greater than zzso zzso zzso These data support the view that steroid zzso zzso provides an important mechanism zzso the recognition of naturally zzso imperfect hormone response zzso
