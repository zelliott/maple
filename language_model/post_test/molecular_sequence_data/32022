The plant hormone zzso plays a key role in the coordination of many aspects of growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso primary zzso responsive regulators of plant development that display a protein structure with four characteristic zzso In the present study, a comprehensive analysis of the 34 members of the zzso zzso gene family was zzso zzso reconstructions revealed two classes of zzso proteins that can be distinguished by zzso in their domain zzso Seven pairs of zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso Comprehensive zzso and zzso expression profiling revealed unique expression patterns of the diverse members of the gene zzso zzso five of seven pairs of zzso genes displayed highly correlated expression patterns in zzso All but one zzso tested zzso zzso genes were zzso zzso displaying two types of zzso induction within three hours of zzso Moreover, 51 of 55 zzso differential zzso expression patterns between different zzso followed the expression zzso crown roots zzso seminal roots zzso primary roots zzso lateral zzso This pattern might imply zzso regulation of zzso transcript zzso In zzso the detailed analysis of the zzso zzso gene family provides novel insights in the evolution and zzso regulation and thus the function of these genes in different zzso and zzso
