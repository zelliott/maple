zzso A zzso is an zzso compound commonly used in manufacture of various consumer zzso Earlier studies from our group have demonstrated that zzso exposure of male rats to zzso causes decrease in zzso count and zzso increase in post zzso loss, ultimately leading to zzso during zzso One of the factors contributing for post zzso loss is altered zzso pattern of imprinted zzso The present study was undertaken to investigate the molecular effects of zzso exposure of male rats to zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso control region zzso in zzso zzso zzso and compared with zzso of their respective zzso zzso We observed a significant down regulation in the transcript expression of zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared to control viable zzso A significant zzso was observed at the zzso zzso in the zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso by rats exposed zzso to zzso These results indicated that the zzso zzso at zzso in zzso was inherited by zzso which causes zzso in the expression of zzso and zzso ultimately leading to post zzso zzso This could be one of the possible mechanisms of zzso induced adverse zzso effects on male zzso
