The zzso minimal promoter has been shown to lie between zzso zzso and zzso + 1 in the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene in rat liver, on the basis of the drug responsiveness of the sequence linked to human growth hormone gene as reporter and targeted to liver as an zzso complex in zzso Competition analyses of the nuclear zzso complexes formed in gel shift zzso with the positive zzso zzso to zzso and negative zzso zzso to zzso zzso elements zzso and NE, zzso identified within this region earlier indicate that the same protein may be binding to both the zzso The protein species zzso on zzso and zzso affinity columns appear to be identical based on zzso analysis, where it zzso as a protein of zzso zzso zzso of a high molecular weight protein zzso zzso are also seen in the preparation obtained after one round of affinity zzso The zzso protein stimulates zzso of a zzso construct containing the 179 zzso on the zzso side of the zzso gene linked to the I zzso in a zzso system from liver zzso The zzso protein can give rise to all the three complexes zzso II, and zzso with the zzso just as the crude nuclear zzso under appropriate zzso zzso in zzso indicate that the zzso has a significantly higher affinity for the zzso form than for the zzso form of the zzso The zzso binds both zzso zzso treatment of the animal leads to a significant increase in the zzso of the zzso to zzso and zzso proteins in nuclear labeling experiments followed by isolation on a zzso affinity zzso We propose that the protein binding predominantly to the zzso in the zzso state characterizes the zzso level of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso treatment leads to zzso of the zzso shifting the equilibrium toward binding to the zzso This can promote interaction with an upstream zzso through other proteins such as the zzso protein and leads to a significant zzso of zzso
