The chicken zzso comprises six pairs of large zzso and 33 pairs of smaller zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso may be more zzso than zzso In this paper, we compare the gene zzso on zzso and zzso based on sequence sampling of cloned zzso DNA, and from the distribution of genes mapped by genetic linkage and physical zzso From these different approaches we estimate that zzso are twice as zzso as zzso and show that sequence sampling is an effective means of gene discovery in the zzso Using this method we have also detected a zzso linkage between the genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso factor zzso protein gene zzso on chicken zzso 5 and human zzso zzso Taken together with its advantages as an experimental animal, and public access to genetic and physical mapping resources, the chicken is a useful model zzso for studies on the structure, function and evolution of the zzso zzso
