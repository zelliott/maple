A zzso library has been constructed with DNA isolated from a zzso hybrid cell line designated zzso which was previously characterized and shown to retain zzso 15 as the only human zzso The library was generated and stored as 34 independent pools of primary colonies at zzso colonies per zzso zzso colonies representing pools of this library by zzso with a zzso repetitive probe has facilitated the identification of random clones bearing human zzso To data, 43 unique clones have been isolated and the zzso mapped by zzso in zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso An zzso was generated for each of these clones by end sequencing of the zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso were mapped by FISH to zzso and zzso data revealed zzso to different regions of the zzso zzso zzso generated from the other end of the zzso insert was found to match the previously identified and zzso coding sequence zzso In addition to the identification of such random zzso establishment of the library as pools was expected to facilitate the zzso identification of unique clones representing specific regions of zzso zzso zzso of the library pools with zzso specific to the zzso region led to the recovery of five independent clones zzso the development of a zzso zzso encompassing the zzso zzso One of the zzso isolated by zzso analysis was derived from the same pool as zzso and was subsequently shown to be identical to zzso The data offer the first report of a zzso 15 zzso library and demonstrate the value of utilizing pools to evaluate libraries generated from complex sources like zzso cell zzso
