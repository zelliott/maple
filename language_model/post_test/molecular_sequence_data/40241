The zzso Long 26 zzso and zzso proteins of zzso zzso virus are known to function during the assembly of the zzso However, for duck zzso virus zzso which is an zzso member of the family zzso little information is available about the function of the two zzso In this study, the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which contains the whole of zzso was zzso and the zzso zzso protein was used to zzso zzso mice to generate zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was generated against zzso zzso and zzso proteins and used subsequently to map the zzso in this zzso Both the zzso and its defined zzso will provide potential tools for further study of zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso was generated against the zzso zzso zzso and a series of 17 partially overlapping fragments that spanned the zzso zzso were expressed with zzso zzso These peptides were subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso and western zzso analysis using zzso zzso to identify the zzso A linear zzso zzso which was located at the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso was identified by zzso zzso The result of the zzso showed that this zzso could be recognized by zzso serum from zzso The zzso motif was the minimal requirement for zzso as demonstrated by analysis of the zzso of zzso with several truncated peptides derived from the zzso zzso and comparison of the zzso zzso sequence with those of other zzso indicated that the motif zzso in the zzso sequence was zzso among the zzso 

A zzso zzso was generated against zzso zzso and the zzso minimal sequence obtained using zzso zzso was zzso The zzso and the identified zzso may be useful for further study of the design of diagnostic zzso for zzso
