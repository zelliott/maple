In the moderately to extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso gas zzso are not observed before the stationary phase of growth, and only when the cells are grown in media containing more than zzso total zzso Under the electron zzso isolated gas zzso appear as zzso structures with zzso ends that reach a zzso length of zzso zzso this zzso is different from the zzso gas zzso found in the zzso zzso wild type which expresses the zzso zzso zzso but resembles that of gas zzso isolated from zzso zzso strains expressing the zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and the zzso genes zzso very similar structural proteins accounting for the major part of the zzso of the respective gas zzso The zzso zzso gene was isolated from zzso zzso using the zzso gene as zzso The zzso coding region indicates numerous zzso differences compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein is, however, almost identical to the zzso gene zzso The start point of the 310 zzso zzso transcript determined by primer extension analysis and zzso mapping was located 20 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso which is at the same relative position as found for the other two zzso zzso During the growth cycle, zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso cells grown in zzso as well as zzso total salt, with a zzso level in the early stationary phase of zzso The relative abundance of zzso zzso in cells grown at zzso salt was zzso higher than in cells grown in zzso total zzso
