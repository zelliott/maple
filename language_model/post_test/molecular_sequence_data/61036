To study zzso zzso causing zzso disease, we have screened 30 apparently unrelated patients for the presence of 7 previous described zzso zzso zzso was the most common zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso To identify the other unknown zzso we screened regions of the zzso gene zzso by zzso and zzso These analyses allowed identification of one novel zzso zzso and two rare zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in a type I patient, while zzso zzso was encountered in two patients zzso I, and zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso zzso previously zzso in Spain, was found to be high zzso making it a good candidate for routine genetic screening in patients from Spanish zzso Two zzso zzso have been identified as well zzso and zzso The zzso is a novel zzso zzso in which the gene sequence between zzso zzso zzso zzso according to zzso et zzso has been replaced by the zzso region of the zzso and consequently it carries the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The functional zzso of this zzso to a zzso zzso previously zzso suggest the zzso existence of a group of four distinct 55 zzso deletion harboring zzso with identical clinical zzso
