The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an auxiliary zzso for the zzso of zzso fatty zzso zzso of this zzso into the zzso requires a zzso signal sequence at the zzso zzso of the zzso chain which is zzso once inside the zzso The zzso of the full-length zzso zzso was previously cloned as zzso zzso zzso were used to zzso the gene zzso the functional zzso zzso from zzso The zzso product was inserted into a zzso expression zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The soluble expressed protein can be separated into zzso and zzso zzso The zzso fraction can be converted to the high specific activity form by zzso zzso suggesting it is a zzso zzso form of the zzso Using zzso and affinity zzso the zzso has been zzso to zzso and exhibits a single band on zzso zzso zzso The molecular mass of zzso Da determined by zzso zzso zzso indicates that the zzso zzso had been zzso The zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were determined to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso a turnover number of zzso zzso was zzso
