Identification of zzso zzso zzso that induce zzso T zzso zzso specific to cancer cells is critical for the development of zzso zzso In this study, we aimed at identifying a novel zzso of pancreatic cancer for zzso 

On the basis of the zzso zzso zzso analysis, we focused on zzso (also known as zzso as a candidate zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were identified using zzso transgenic mice zzso and the peptides were examined to check whether they could generate human zzso exhibiting zzso responses against zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso 

zzso was zzso in pancreatic cancer and in some other zzso but not in their zzso counterparts and many normal adult zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso peptides could induce zzso zzso in zzso zzso without causing zzso zzso human zzso were generated from peripheral blood zzso cells of zzso healthy donors by in zzso stimulation with the three zzso and those zzso successfully exhibited zzso responses to cancer cells expressing both zzso and zzso 

zzso is a novel promising candidate for zzso zzso target for pancreatic zzso
