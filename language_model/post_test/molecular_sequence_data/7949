The zzso and zzso genes are part of the zzso response to DNA zzso damage in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso genes is triggered by binding of the zzso Ada protein zzso to a specific sequence located zzso base pairs upstream of the zzso start, which is internal to an zzso zzso In this report we demonstrate that the Ada binding site is also a binding site for zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to bind the zzso to zzso region of the zzso and the zzso promoters in the absence of zzso and its binding is zzso by the alpha zzso This region resembles the UP element of the zzso zzso promoter in location, sequence and mechanism of interaction with zzso zzso We discuss the function of zzso elements in positively controlled promoters and provide evidence that Ada does not act by enhancing zzso zzso binding affinity to the promoter zzso Instead, Ada stimulates zzso by zzso the nature of the zzso zzso interaction, allowing zzso zzso to recognize the core promoter zzso and zzso elements in addition to the zzso zzso
