We have previously reported the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso with a synthetic modified zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present report, we describe the crystal structure refined at zzso A zzso During the refinement process, we found that the zzso zzso was zzso at the zzso bond between the zzso zzso and the subsequent zzso At the end of the refinement (R zzso zzso it was supposed that the resulting zzso zzso zzso and zzso were separately bound to the zzso In the complex structure, the zzso of the zzso was occupied by the zzso base of zzso via a similar interaction to that of the zzso zzso with zzso while the zzso group of zzso was not bound to the active zzso The zzso adopted the anti orientation on the zzso zzso angle with a zzso sugar zzso This zzso resulted in the zzso group protruding from the active zzso The zzso group of zzso was bound to the active site of the zzso and oriented itself toward the zzso zzso This orientation was different from that of zzso bound to the zzso zzso
