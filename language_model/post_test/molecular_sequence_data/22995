The zzso zzso domain zzso factor is elevated in a significant proportion of breast zzso and in zzso zzso where it is associated with increased zzso zzso growth, faster and larger zzso growth in zzso models, resistance to growth zzso stimuli and increased migratory zzso These effects are associated with the ability of zzso to regulate specific genes associated with these zzso zzso zzso can reverse many of these effects, suggesting that it may be possible to alter the growth and zzso of zzso cells by zzso zzso in these zzso This review discusses the effect of altering zzso in these cancer cells and possible approaches to targeting zzso as a strategy for therapy in treatment of breast zzso
