zzso genes code for a widely distributed class of proteins involved in a variety of zzso ranging from the control of zzso to bacterial infection in zzso cells and taste zzso in zzso to zzso zzso in zzso Some of the zzso proteins in zzso and in zzso are capable of transporting metal zzso including zzso In plants, iron transport was shown to require a zzso transport zzso In zzso zzso this process involves the zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the sequence of five zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso comparison suggests that there are two classes of zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 zzso rice zzso represent one class, and zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and zzso are able to complement the zzso zzso zzso defective both in low- and zzso iron zzso whereas zzso and zzso fail to do zzso In addition, zzso transcript, but not zzso transcript, accumulates in response to iron zzso in roots but not in zzso Finally, zzso of zzso in transgenic zzso zzso plants leads to an increase in plant resistance to toxic iron zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso zzso in the control of iron zzso in zzso
