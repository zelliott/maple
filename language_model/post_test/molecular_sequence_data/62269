zzso is the leading cause of death worldwide from a single infectious zzso Search of new therapeutic tools requires the discovery and zzso characterization of new potential targets among the bacterial proteins essential for the survival and zzso Among them are the zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso In this work, we determined the solution structure of zzso zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis zzso a protein of 181 zzso that was found to be essential for bacterial zzso The structure was calculated by a simulated zzso protocol and energy zzso using experimental zzso collected by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The final, zzso 20 zzso structures show an average zzso zzso of zzso A for the backbone atoms in regular secondary structure zzso The protein has a central zzso domain, composed of a zzso parallel zzso surrounded by seven zzso and two peripheral zzso zzso and zzso As compared to other zzso structures of free form zzso zzso is more zzso with the zzso domain closer to the zzso of the zzso Analysis of the zzso relaxation data enabled us to obtain the global zzso correlation time zzso zzso and the generalized order parameters zzso of zzso zzso along the zzso zzso The protein exhibits restricted movements on a zzso to zzso time scale in the secondary structural regions with zzso characterized by an average zzso value of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibit rapid fluctuations with enhanced zzso These structural and dynamic features of zzso may be related to its low zzso activity that is zzso lower than in their zzso zzso
