A new zzso has been developed for generating conservation profiles that reflect the evolutionary history of the zzso associated with a query zzso It is based on zzso patterns zzso which are sets of zzso zzso and m zzso in windows of size zzso The generation of conservation profiles is treated as a zzso problem where the signal is the count of zzso patterns in target sequences that are similar to the query sequence and the noise is the count over all target zzso The signal is differentiated from the noise by applying singular value decomposition to sets of target sequences rank ordered by similarity with respect to the zzso 

The new zzso was used to construct zzso profiles from 120 randomly selected zzso zzso These were compared to profiles generated from multiple alignments using the consensus zzso The two profiles were similar whenever the zzso associated with the query sequence was well represented in the multiple zzso It was possible to construct zzso specific conservation profiles using the new zzso for zzso with as few as five zzso The speed of the new zzso was comparable to the multiple alignment zzso 

zzso specific conservation profiles can be generated by the new zzso without zzso knowledge of family relationships or domain zzso This is useful when the zzso contains multiple zzso with different levels of representation in protein zzso It may also be zzso when the zzso sample size is too small for the multiple alignment zzso
