The type D zzso zzso cause zzso in zzso and have been reported as a zzso opportunistic infection in a patient with zzso Previous evidence based on viral interference has strongly suggested that the type D zzso viruses share a common but unknown cell surface zzso with three type C zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso virus, and avian zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso gene for these viruses has been mapped to human zzso zzso We now report the isolation and characterization of a cell surface zzso for this group of zzso by using a human zzso zzso library in a zzso zzso Swiss mouse zzso zzso zzso which are naturally resistant to zzso were zzso with the zzso library and then challenged with an zzso virus containing a dominant zzso gene for zzso zzso zzso selection yielded 12 cellular clones that were highly susceptible to a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso we amplified a common zzso product from 10 positive zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso virus, and the type D zzso zzso The zzso zzso predicted a protein of zzso zzso acids that had zzso identity with the previously cloned human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in enhanced cellular zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that the zzso zzso is widely expressed in human zzso and cell lines, including zzso zzso The human Bo zzso gene has been previously mapped to zzso which is closely linked to the gene locus of the zzso zzso
