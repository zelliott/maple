zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are closely related zzso However, zzso zzso a zzso zzso has zzso of genes as zzso far more than zzso zzso which only has zzso One of these zzso zzso to zzso which in zzso zzso encodes an zzso protein involved in zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cell lines, which is needed for full zzso of the zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso zzso with the functional zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso ) would reduce the invasion of human zzso cell zzso Our results showed that the presence of zzso in zzso zzso significantly modified the bacterial ability to alter cellular zzso and decrease the zzso recovered after cell invasion of human zzso cell zzso These results add to mounting evidence that zzso contribute to zzso zzso adaptation to zzso
