zzso to identify novel zzso sites in response to DNA zzso breaks zzso zzso we have isolated a zzso site on zzso zzso a rabbit zzso raised against this site zzso with a 120 zzso protein in cells treated by DNA zzso zzso We identified this protein as zzso zzso an abundant and essential nuclear protein containing regions binding DNA or zzso The zzso site was mapped at zzso position in a sequence context favoring a zzso consensus model for zzso zzso site in zzso This site was exclusively zzso by zzso in response to DNA zzso zzso In addition, the extent and duration of this zzso was in inverse correlation with the capacity of the cells to repair zzso by zzso End zzso These results bring a new link between the zzso family and the DNA damage zzso zzso the mapped zzso on zzso might serve as a potential zzso for zzso activity in academic studies and clinical analyses of zzso zzso or zzso
