The zzso gene region of zzso zzso was cloned as a zzso zzso zzso zzso and an overlapping zzso zzso zzso zzso by using an internal zzso zzso specific zzso gene probe generated by zzso chain reaction zzso Complete DNA sequencing of the two fragments revealed three complete open reading frames zzso These zzso exhibited a high degree of identity to the zzso zzso and zzso heat shock genes from other zzso zzso The order of the genes was found to be zzso Additionally, the zzso and zzso contained zzso acid sequences that were zzso to the zzso sequence of the zzso gene and the zzso sequence of zzso zzso respectively, from zzso zzso The entire zzso gene from zzso zzso was then isolated by zzso zzso and completely zzso A zzso stop site is located between the zzso and zzso genes but not after the zzso zzso zzso with this zzso the zzso gene is immediately followed by an zzso that shows a high degree of identity to zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The presence of zzso is not indicated in other zzso representing the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso exhibited nearly zzso identity with the zzso for large zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso and the related protein from zzso other zzso bacteria, and zzso suggesting the presence of the gene for this protein in the common zzso of zzso and zzso The absence of the zzso gene in zzso tuberculosis and other zzso bacteria indicates that the loss of this gene must have occurred in an zzso of other zzso bacteria following their divergence from the zzso of zzso zzso
