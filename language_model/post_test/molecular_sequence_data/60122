One characteristic elements in the promoter of the zzso zzso 9 zzso gene is the zzso zzso To investigate whether this element regulates the zzso of the zzso gene and its zzso activities, we zzso the promoter region isolated from zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cells with low zzso zzso activity had the number of zzso repeats shortened from 21 to 14 or zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells with high zzso activities had 21 or 23 zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso promoter containing 18, 14 or 0 zzso repeats showed zzso activities which were 50, 50 or zzso respectively, of the level achieved with promoter containing 21 zzso zzso zzso analysis of the promoter of 223 Japanese subjects revealed that most had two zzso with 20, 21 or 22 zzso repeats, whereas six had one or two zzso with 14, 18 or 19 zzso zzso We zzso that length zzso of the zzso repeat causes zzso differences among zzso cells and that zzso instability may contribute to the zzso of zzso repeat zzso
