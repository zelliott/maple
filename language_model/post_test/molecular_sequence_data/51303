Using the zzso zzso cloning system, we have constructed a two to three times coverage, zzso zzso zzso library from mouse zzso zzso zzso The library consists of about zzso clones with an average insert size of about 70 zzso that are organized into 300 primary pools containing approximately 425 clones per zzso For screening purposes the primary pools are combined into secondary pools zzso zzso clones each) and zzso pools zzso zzso clones zzso zzso is performed by the zzso chain reaction zzso with DNA isolated from the secondary and zzso zzso We have screened the library for 13 different mouse sequences and have detected zzso zzso generated from two of the zzso positive screens were isolated from the library zzso containing the zzso and G alpha zzso zzso and were further zzso zzso zzso sequencing of DNA from zzso clones with zzso bordering the insert provided sequence information from each end of the cloned zzso
