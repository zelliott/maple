We identified two zzso in the zzso gene responsible for zzso zzso in an 18-year-old zzso female with ambiguous external zzso at birth, primary zzso and sexual zzso and zzso zzso The coding zzso namely zzso zzso of the zzso gene were amplified by zzso from zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the amplified DNA from the patient revealed two zzso changes, at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso X, which were newly found zzso zzso and resulted in zzso changes of zzso and zzso zzso zzso followed by sequencing confirmed that the patient is a compound zzso The results of restriction zzso length zzso analysis and direct sequencing of the amplified zzso X DNA from the patient's mother indicate maternal inheritance of the zzso zzso zzso expression experiments showed that the zzso zzso protein had approximately zzso of the activity of the wild type, whereas zzso was totally zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in the zzso region believed to serve as the fifth zzso zzso of the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this patient is the first adult to have described the zzso features of a syndrome of zzso zzso zzso that such defects exist will lead to a better understanding of the role of this zzso in human development and zzso
