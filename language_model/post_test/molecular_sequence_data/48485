Genome of the model zzso flowering plant, zzso zzso a popular tool for understanding molecular biology of plant zzso encodes all three classes of plant zzso that differ in their zzso zzso binding and spectral zzso As such these zzso are of considerable zzso Crystal structures of few members of plant class I zzso zzso have been described zzso Here we report the crystal structure of zzso class I zzso zzso to zzso and compare its key features with the structures of similar zzso zzso from other zzso Crystal structure of zzso is zzso to the related members with similar zzso fold and zzso pocket zzso The structure is zzso in the zzso unit with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso iron zzso zzso lining the zzso interface are also zzso in zzso with the exception of additional zzso interaction between zzso and zzso of each zzso and that involving zzso through two water zzso In addition, differences in zzso pocket zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso at zzso position, zzso binding site zzso internal cavity zzso differences, CD loop zzso and stability and other such properties might explain kinetic zzso in zzso zzso cavity analysis of zzso showed the presence of a novel long tunnel connecting the zzso pockets of both the zzso zzso of such tunnel, along with zzso zzso observed in the two zzso might suggest cooperative zzso binding and support its role in NO zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
