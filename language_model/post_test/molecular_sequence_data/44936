The zzso family of zzso proteins is directly involved in the zzso of specific zzso channels at zzso We report that channel zzso depends on a zzso zzso domain of zzso that mediates zzso and zzso linkage of zzso zzso This zzso zzso domain zzso channel zzso activity on a single zzso zzso Thus, channel zzso depends on zzso of zzso zzso achieved by head-to-head zzso of zzso rather than by zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso This mechanism predicts that zzso can organize zzso membrane protein clusters via differential binding zzso of its three zzso zzso zzso and its relative zzso exist as zzso complexes in rat brain, consistent with head-to-head zzso of these proteins in zzso
