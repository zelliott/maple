The activity of zzso class II promoters depends upon zzso regulatory signals one of which, the extended zzso contains in its zzso zzso a sequence related to the zzso response element, zzso and to the zzso response element, zzso zzso zzso is recognized by the zzso factor and by other zzso or zzso containing zzso We report that the zzso dependent promoter activity of the zzso gene is zzso by an array of DNA elements each of which represented twice either in an zzso or directly repeated zzso In this frame, we describe a nuclear binding factor, namely zzso zzso interacting with two of these additional signals, delta and zzso and with a portion of the zzso namely the zzso devoid of zzso The presence of a single factor recognizing divergent DNA sequences was indicated by the finding that these activities were zzso from a zzso column and from DNA affinity columns carrying different DNA binding sites as zzso Competition experiments made with zzso representing wild type and zzso DNA elements showed that each DNA element specifically inhibited the binding of the others, supporting the contention that zzso is involved in recognition of different zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso also exhibits zzso binding activity and that this activity can be zzso out by addition of an excess of zzso delta and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso blocked not only the binding activity of zzso but also its zzso and zzso zzso this blockade was removed by the addition of the zzso or zzso peptides against which the zzso had been zzso In zzso zzso zzso was able to bind to all these boxes, albeit with seemingly different zzso The zzso of zzso interactions may explain the zzso of the zzso dependent promoter activity zzso by the accessory DNA elements described zzso
