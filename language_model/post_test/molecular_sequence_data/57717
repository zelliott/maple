Random zzso of the gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to identify functionally essential zzso acid zzso of the zzso A zzso system was developed that permits the straightforward isolation of zzso zzso zzso zzso that had lost almost all zzso zzso It was shown that zzso of zzso and Ala for Pro at the position zzso zzso for zzso Pro for zzso zzso for zzso and of zzso for zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso It is noteworthy that all these zzso are limited to two short regions that are highly conservative in sequences of zzso zzso zzso
