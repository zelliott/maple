zzso muscular zzso zzso is a common form of muscular zzso in adults that is zzso characterized by progressive wasting of muscles in the upper zzso zzso is associated with contraction of zzso zzso repeats on zzso zzso but this contraction is zzso only in certain zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso patients carry specific zzso zzso in the zzso region zzso to the last zzso zzso This zzso zzso creates a zzso zzso signal for transcripts derived from zzso a double zzso gene of unknown function that zzso the last repeat unit and the adjacent zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso transcripts are efficiently zzso and are more stable when expressed from zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso arises through a toxic gain of function attributable to the stabilized zzso zzso zzso
