zzso is an enigmatic member of the heat shock factor family, identified in the zzso classes of birds and zzso We report the characterization of zzso from an evolutionary ancient zzso the fish rainbow trout zzso zzso appears closely related to its zzso counterparts at structural and functional zzso The conservation of the distinctive features of zzso from fish to human suggests that it should ensure important biological functions, not redundant with those of zzso zzso zzso reported as a potent zzso of zzso leads to the stabilization and to a striking nuclear trafficking of zzso fusion zzso Upon treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso accumulates into zzso nuclear bodies zzso independently of its zzso and, if expressed at moderate level, moves to zzso The zzso of zzso from zzso to zzso is greatly favored by zzso of the heat shock protein zzso The zzso counterpart mouse zzso zzso also exhibited changes in zzso distribution upon zzso zzso zzso zzso between a zzso area that we characterized as an zzso and the zzso These zzso are likely to reflect common structural changes of mouse and trout zzso upon zzso
