zzso diseases are neurodegenerative disorders, affecting humans and zzso The human diseases include zzso zzso disease zzso zzso syndrome zzso and fatal familial zzso zzso To generate zzso zzso against human prion proteins we have zzso mice with DNA coding for different human prion zzso We constructed zzso zzso expressing individual zzso of either the cellular prion gene zzso or zzso forms under appropriate zzso This approach avoids the preparation of infectious material for zzso To circumvent zzso tolerance prion zzso zzso mice were used for the zzso zzso Thereby zzso zzso were raised capable of specifically zzso in zzso zzso human prion zzso With prion zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso are predominantly directed against the zzso repeat region and to a lesser extent to regions zzso the signal zzso the zzso domain or the zzso zzso In contrast, prion zzso zzso zzso mice zzso under the same experimental conditions as the zzso mice did not respond with zzso formation against the human prion zzso This is the first report clearly showing that immune competent prion zzso mice react with a vigorous zzso immune response after zzso zzso with human prion gene zzso
