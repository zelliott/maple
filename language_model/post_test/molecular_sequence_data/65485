The significance of zzso zzso as an agent of zzso has been well zzso An understanding of both the zzso and the host response is required to zzso approaches to more rapidly detect and effectively prevent or treat zzso Current vaccine strategies are focused primarily on production of zzso against the protective zzso components of the anthrax zzso which are zzso by the zzso A better understanding of the dynamic zzso of the dormant and zzso spore and its interaction with the host immune system could be important in developing an zzso zzso anthrax zzso A zzso protein was identified that was specific to the zzso zzso group of bacteria and referred to as spore zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso localized this protein to the area of the zzso beneath the coat of the dormant zzso Although our data suggested that zzso was found below the coat layers of the zzso zzso zzso was involved in the interaction of spores with zzso shortly after zzso To investigate further the specific properties of the zzso zzso the zzso gene was zzso in the zzso zzso Ames zzso The zzso protein in the Ames strain of zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso of the spores in the presence of zzso zzso Unlike the zzso strain, the zzso zzso : : Kan strain was not readily zzso by zzso zzso While the zzso spores retained characteristic resistance properties in zzso and zzso in zzso the zzso : : Kan zzso strain was significantly less suited for survival in zzso when zzso against the zzso Ames zzso
