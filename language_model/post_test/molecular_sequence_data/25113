Many studies have shown that zzso in zzso zzso is accompanied by enhanced zzso activity in the zzso zzso but it remains unclear whether the response is due to regulation of pre-existing zzso or to increased gene zzso and zzso zzso To address this question, the complete open reading frame and 3' and zzso untranslated regions of the zzso coding for the zzso of zzso from the blue crab zzso zzso were amplified by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso The resulting zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso acid sequence indicated eight zzso regions, in agreement with previously suggested zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence is highly zzso among species, with the blue crab sequence showing zzso % identity to those of other zzso and zzso % identity to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed high levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso compared with anterior zzso zzso Western blots of zzso plasma zzso revealed a single zzso zzso protein band of the expected zzso The zzso zzso contained a much higher level of zzso protein than the anterior zzso in agreement with previous zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso protein detected by zzso zzso is localized to the zzso membrane region of zzso zzso zzso Transfer of blue zzso from 35 to 5 per thousand zzso was not accompanied by notable differences in the relative proportions of zzso zzso and protein in the zzso zzso suggesting that the enhanced zzso zzso activity that accompanies the zzso response may result from zzso regulatory zzso
