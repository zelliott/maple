zzso zzso zzso zzso is applied commercially for the production of zzso from renewable resources such as vegetable oils or waste zzso Although much research has been performed on zzso of zzso conditions and on the influence of feed source and process parameters on zzso structures and yields, the zzso zzso of these important zzso remains zzso Here, we identify a zzso gene zzso and show that the gene product is responsible for the first zzso step in the zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, we provide evidence that the second zzso step is zzso by a different zzso that acts independently from the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso involves two zzso that act in a zzso zzso The zzso gene described here is the first identified gene with a clear function in zzso production by this economically important zzso
