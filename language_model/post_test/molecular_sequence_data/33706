Healthy dental zzso is the hardest and most highly zzso human zzso Though zzso zzso and without capacity for turnover or repair, it can nevertheless last a zzso zzso imperfecta zzso is a collective term for failure of normal zzso development, covering diverse clinical zzso that typically show zzso inheritance zzso One zzso known as zzso zzso is zzso by zzso volumes of organic zzso zzso but with weak, zzso opaque zzso that fails prematurely after tooth zzso zzso in genes critical to zzso zzso formation have been zzso but current understanding of other key events in zzso zzso is zzso We investigated zzso zzso zzso in a zzso Pakistani zzso A zzso zzso zzso screen identified a locus on zzso zzso zzso candidate genes revealed a point zzso in the poorly characterized zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a panel of nine additional zzso zzso families revealed the same zzso in a second, apparently zzso Pakistani family and two further nonsense zzso in zzso zzso zzso confirmed zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso function is unknown, but as a putative beta zzso is expected to be a scaffold for zzso zzso The nearest zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso trafficking is important in zzso zzso with respect to zzso into immature zzso and removal of zzso zzso zzso proteins via zzso This raises the intriguing possibility that zzso is critical to zzso zzso turnover during zzso zzso
