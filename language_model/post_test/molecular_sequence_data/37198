zzso of some zzso in nerve terminals has been shown to be regulated by zzso in an zzso zzso The transcripts whose translation is controlled by regulated zzso contain the zzso zzso element zzso which binds to the highly zzso zzso protein zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso which has a zzso in its 3' zzso is located both in cell bodies and at nerve endings zzso We found that zzso zzso from zzso zzso sensory zzso becomes zzso during long-term zzso produced by treatment with zzso or zzso zzso We cloned two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso nervous zzso The larger form, which is zzso in nervous zzso is similar to zzso the clam binding zzso as well as to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso are zzso following the treatment with zzso Since both zzso and zzso zzso zzso are present in zzso and zzso zzso protein increases during long-term zzso we suggest that the translation of zzso message in nerve endings is zzso by zzso to grow new zzso
