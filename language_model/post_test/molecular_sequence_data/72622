A zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was unable to fix zzso in air although it reduced zzso in the absence of zzso zzso strain zzso 307 formed cells zzso similar to zzso but it failed to zzso the characteristic zzso zzso zzso analysis around the site of zzso revealed an zzso of zzso base pairs, termed zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein containing two zzso with zzso zzso acid sequences identified with zzso zzso and the chain length factor variation of zzso zzso active zzso These active sites are characteristic of zzso and fatty acid zzso The zzso zzso strain zzso zzso gene is transcribed only under zzso growth zzso The zzso zzso or similar zzso was found in all other zzso zzso surveyed and was absent in zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso Based on these results, we propose that the synthesis of zzso zzso follows a zzso characteristic of zzso synthesis and involves similar large, zzso zzso
