zzso repression often depends on the action of recruited zzso complexes with intrinsic zzso zzso The composition of these complexes depends on the nicotine zzso zzso zzso and is thus directly reflective of the zzso state of the zzso This study provides evidence that an zzso zzso with zzso zzso and reduced forms of zzso zzso zzso activity may function in the nucleus as a zzso zzso By using the promoter of the zzso late differentiation marker zzso as a model, we show that both in zzso and in zzso the protein is recruited over the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter activity by altering the function of other zzso such as zzso The repressive function is associated with the ability of nuclear zzso to zzso the zzso activity in the vicinity of zzso initiation zzso These findings add zzso to the small group of zzso zzso which, by being recruited over promoter regions, could directly link the zzso and nuclear functions within the zzso
