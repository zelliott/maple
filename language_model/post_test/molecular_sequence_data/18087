zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso zzso with zzso as the sole carbon zzso Eight zzso that were unable to take up zzso were transformed with plasmids from pooled gene banks of zzso zzso DNA prepared in an zzso coli zzso that does not replicate in zzso One zzso zzso could be zzso with all gene banks to restore ability for zzso zzso One of the gene banks was zzso into single clones and zzso DNA from each clone used to complement zzso This yielded a zzso zzso DNA zzso that was zzso It contained one complete open reading frame zzso whose putative gene product displayed high sequence conservation with the zzso zzso of zzso coli and the zzso zzso zzso Further, the isolated zzso gene interrupted in zzso by a zzso resistance cassette could be used to construct zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that lacked a functional zzso zzso thus confirming the identity of the zzso gene with the zzso zzso zzso This is the first zzso zzso zzso known to share a sequence relationship with zzso zzso zzso and the first sugar zzso from a zzso characterized at the sequence zzso
