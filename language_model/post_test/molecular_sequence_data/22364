zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso have an zzso structure with zzso formed by the major zzso zzso zzso linked in groups of three by distinctive structures called zzso zzso are zzso formed by two proteins in a zzso zzso The zzso protein is called zzso and the zzso protein is zzso We have carried out zzso and zzso zzso on zzso and have examined the effects of the zzso on virus growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso approximately 100 zzso acids of the zzso which zzso to a region that is poorly zzso among zzso are insensitive to disruption and that insertions into the rest of the protein had various effects on virus zzso zzso but not all, severely disabled zzso were compromised in the ability to bind zzso or zzso Analysis of deletion zzso revealed the presence of a nuclear zzso signal zzso near the N zzso of zzso and this was mapped to a zzso region by fusion of specific sequences to a green fluorescent protein zzso By replacing the zzso zzso with that from the zzso virus 40 large T zzso we were able to show that the first 45 zzso acids of zzso were not essential for assembly of functional zzso and infectious virus zzso However, removing the first 63 zzso acids resulted in formation of zzso zzso and prevented virus growth, suggesting that the poorly zzso zzso sequences have some zzso zzso
