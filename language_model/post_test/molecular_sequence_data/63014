zzso zzso are very complex zzso of zzso most of which are peptides displaying different kinds of biological zzso Indeed, these peptides specifically bind to a variety of pharmacological targets, in particular zzso channels located in prey zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso modulating zzso zzso zzso and zzso currents have been described in scorpion zzso In this work, we have used several specific zzso raised against the most lethal scorpion toxins already described to screen the Moroccan scorpion zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to characterize new zzso This zzso screening was also implemented by toxicity tests in mice and with mass zzso study, providing new zzso on the molecular composition of this zzso In fine, we were able to determine the molecular masses of zzso different zzso According to the zzso data zzso many toxins zzso with three zzso raised against the most lethal zzso found in North African scorpion zzso but not at all with those raised against the main zzso from South and North American zzso Some of the previously described toxins from zzso zzso zzso zzso could thus be detected by combining zzso tests, toxicity in mice and molecular zzso Among these zzso one of them, which showed a mild zzso with the serum raised against zzso I (a highly potent toxin from the zzso of zzso zzso was identified as zzso III and fully zzso
