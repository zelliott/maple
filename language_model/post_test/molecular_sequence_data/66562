The zzso gene of zzso zzso was expressed in zzso form without the putative zzso sequence in a zzso zzso coli zzso The zzso protein was zzso by affinity zzso and was shown to catalyze the formation of zzso zzso from zzso zzso at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso for zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are 132 and 30 zzso zzso The zzso has an absolute requirement for zzso metal zzso preferably zzso and zzso and is inhibited by zzso with a Ki of 85 zzso The pH optimum is zzso zzso can substitute for zzso albeit at a low rate zzso as compared to zzso The zzso zzso the reverse reaction at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
