zzso is one of the zzso factors which plays an important role in zzso We have cloned and functionally mapped the promoter of the zzso zzso gene using transient zzso zzso in mouse L zzso zzso The zzso zzso promoter consists of three positively regulated zzso The zzso region, located at zzso to zzso contains an assortment of putative zzso factor binding zzso The zzso upstream region, located at zzso to zzso contains a tandem repeat sequence zzso A downstream region is positioned at zzso to zzso We have also identified an alternatively spliced form of the zzso zzso gene in L zzso zzso
