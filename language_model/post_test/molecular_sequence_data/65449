zzso bodies zzso are zzso zzso that are found exclusively in zzso zzso and that seal the zzso pore in response to zzso These zzso consist of a zzso protein zzso comprised of the zzso protein and, although they form from zzso their zzso is poorly zzso In zzso zzso we identify zzso sorting complex zzso a zzso membrane protein with dual functions in zzso zzso zzso zzso to large zzso zzso where it zzso into zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso producing zzso nascent zzso In a reaction requiring zzso these structures are delivered to the cell cortex, which permits zzso of the nascent zzso and zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso and zzso collaborate and control distinct aspects of zzso zzso and that cortical association depends on zzso which in turn depends on zzso This dependency helps order events across the zzso zzso permitting the zzso to produce a second zzso with a distinct composition and zzso zzso
