It has been shown that zzso zzso zzso containing zinc fingers can be selected from libraries displayed on zzso zzso The affinity and specificity of these peptides are well zzso in zzso but few data are available to demonstrate specific DNA binding and discrimination between closely related DNA sequences in zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed in zzso cells, using expression plasmids which produce different amounts of a model zzso factor containing a zzso zinc finger zzso domain, and reporter plasmids which carry systematic variations of the promoter zzso When the zzso concentration of the zzso factor was appropriate, zzso of gene expression was absolutely dependent on a promoter having the same DNA sequence as that originally used to select the zinc finger domain by zzso zzso However, excessive zzso zzso of the zzso factor resulted in some zzso DNA zzso leading to gene zzso from similar promoters containing a maximum of two base zzso Thus, provided delivery is carefully controlled, highly specific control of gene expression in zzso can be achieved using artificial zzso factors containing zzso zinc finger zzso zzso
