zzso zzso zzso studies are presented of zzso an analogue of human insulin lacking the zzso five zzso of the B zzso zzso of these zzso which are not required for function, is shown to reduce zzso broadening previously described in the spectrum of intact insulin zzso et zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso This difference presumably reflects more rapid internal motions in the fragment, which lead to more complete averaging of chemical shifts on the zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso assignment and preliminary structural analysis demonstrate retention in solution of the three zzso observed in the crystal state and the relative orientation of the zzso zzso These studies provide a foundation for determining the solution structure of zzso
