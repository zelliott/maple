zzso zzso identified a new competence gene in zzso zzso zzso designated zzso A zzso zzso was completely deficient in transformation and exhibited decreased levels of DNA binding and zzso The deduced zzso zzso protein exhibited 57% similarity and zzso identity to the zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso and contained the Walker zzso motif zzso in zzso proteins as well as zzso acid boxes zzso and zzso present in some components of the general zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso appeared to be part of a putative zzso encompassing a zzso zzso designated zzso together with sequences that could zzso zzso and zzso peptides designated zzso and zzso respectively, as well as other zzso The putative zzso and zzso peptides had leader sequences similar to the type IV zzso zzso of zzso bacteria, but unlike other examples in this class, including zzso zzso they contained an zzso at position zzso of the leader instead of the usual zzso zzso Northern analysis identified a single zzso zzso transcript strictly dependent on zzso competence factor for expression in zzso zzso An identical pattern of expression was seen in zzso zzso cells grown under conditions of zzso competence but not in cells that were zzso
