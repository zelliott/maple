A series of truncated zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso C zzso molecules was examined for use as zzso zzso for zzso and zzso Small regions of zzso zzso C, an zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli as zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins using the bacterial expression zzso zzso zzso obtained from horses, including zzso from zzso zzso zzso following exposure to either zzso zzso or both viruses were zzso Several of the fusion proteins were shown to zzso zzso specific zzso while others zzso strong, zzso zzso One zzso termed zzso produced a soluble and stable fusion protein which zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso Strong zzso zzso on zzso were zzso to a region zzso by zzso acids 137 to approximately 152 while zzso specific zzso were identified downstream of this region, zzso approximately zzso acids 152 to zzso zzso coli expressed zzso zzso zzso showed clear potential for use as diagnostic zzso for the detection of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso present in zzso zzso zzso
