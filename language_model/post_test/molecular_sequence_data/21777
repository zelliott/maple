The zzso zzso zzso plays multiple roles in many important zzso zzso especially zzso where it functions as both a zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity through binding at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is often used as a surrogate for zzso but it is not known whether it is an effective zzso mimic in its interaction with zzso We have characterized the interaction of zzso with zzso in solution and determined a crystal structure of their zzso zzso binds zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso comparable to that of the much larger zzso zzso measured under the same zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions make a larger contribution to zzso binding of zzso than to zzso zzso binding to zzso II zzso zzso zzso activity with high potency but with low zzso zzso zzso shows that bovine and human zzso are zzso in solution in the presence of zzso in contrast to their complexes with zzso which are zzso In the X-ray crystal structure, two molecules of zzso are bound zzso to zzso II portions of a zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso of the zzso complex, which has a different zzso association mode in the zzso zzso and zzso binding to zzso II of zzso differ on both chemical and structural levels and, perhaps most significantly, in zzso zzso These differences may offer paths to the design of more potent zzso II zzso zzso small molecules as zzso of zzso zzso
