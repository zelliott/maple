zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso are potent zzso regulators of gene zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso reduced zzso expression by zzso with the zzso 3' untranslated region zzso next to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso levels relieved the zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso through an zzso zzso as zzso required zzso to reduce zzso expression and zzso required zzso to inhibit zzso zzso Our findings suggest a regulatory paradigm wherein zzso zzso zzso expression by recruiting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso
