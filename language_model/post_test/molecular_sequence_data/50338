The zzso substitution zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to have enhanced zzso specificity and enhanced activity in the presence of zzso compared with the zzso form of the zzso The structural requirements for these zzso in zzso activity were investigated by constructing several zzso acid substitution zzso at each of the positions from 296 to 299 and evaluating their activities under a variety of zzso zzso on zzso zzso activity were common among the point zzso at positions zzso nearly all had a zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The greatest effects on zzso function were found with multiple substitution zzso but some single charge zzso and zzso zzso had substantial zzso The enhanced zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso results in less zzso than seen with zzso zzso zzso four times greater concentration of zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso was required to consume 50% of the zzso in human zzso
