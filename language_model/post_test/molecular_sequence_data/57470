The W locus of mice encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice and zzso zzso mice were similar in appearance; all of them have large zzso areas lacking any zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were characterized and their molecular nature was correlated with the mast cell differentiation in the skin and the zzso features of cultured mast cell zzso All zzso zzso and zzso were point zzso at the zzso zzso domain, and zzso zzso was normally transcribed from all of zzso The mature zzso form of the zzso protein was produced from the zzso and zzso zzso but not from the zzso zzso zzso proteins produced by the zzso or zzso zzso were expressed on the surface of zzso but those of the zzso zzso were zzso When double zzso mice were produced between W and zzso and between W and zzso both zzso and zzso mice lacked skin mast zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not survive in the zzso with zzso zzso zzso normally attached to zzso but zzso zzso did zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in the attachment was attributed to the deficient zzso expression of the zzso zzso The number of skin mast cells was compared among zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells decreased in zzso and zzso mice, but not in zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso was a point zzso at the zzso domain, the zzso effect of the zzso was comparable with that of the W zzso zzso which produces truncated zzso protein without the zzso zzso The weak zzso of zzso mice may be explained by the deficient zzso expression of zzso proteins produced by the zzso zzso When zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was observed only in zzso zzso This result was consistent with the weak zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso
