A selection for zzso of zzso coli that survive zzso of zzso zzso gene 10 and zzso F zzso has allowed the identification of a newly defined genetic zzso zzso zzso is located at zzso zzso on the zzso coli zzso the gene is zzso and zzso for zzso zzso of zzso is necessary for resistance to the toxicity of zzso gene 10 in the presence of zzso the original zzso strain contains a zzso zzso changing a G zzso to the zzso T in the zzso zzso of a zzso This zzso zzso causes a zzso increase in the level of zzso zzso The initiation zzso of zzso is shown to be zzso and the zzso protein is then deduced to consist of 158 zzso acid zzso A similar zzso selection that demanded cell survival to a challenge of zzso gene zzso and zzso also resulted in the isolation of the identical zzso zzso that affects expression of zzso The increased levels of zzso resulting from the zzso zzso allow zzso zzso to avoid exclusion by the F zzso presumably by protecting the cell from premature death due to gene 10 or to gene zzso expression in the presence of the zzso zzso
