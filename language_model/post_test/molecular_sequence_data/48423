Human blue and mouse zzso are prone to zzso in the absence of zzso which zzso the rapid cone zzso in human patients and animal models of zzso zzso zzso zzso By in zzso analysis and domain swapping experiments, we show that a zzso region in zzso sensitive zzso zzso but not in zzso sensitive zzso is responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso zzso in this region are critical in zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso region of zzso zzso to zzso causes the latter to zzso Our findings suggest that new zzso can be designed to disrupt the zzso region in preventing cone zzso due to zzso zzso in zzso
