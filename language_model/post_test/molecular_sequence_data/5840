zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso locating behind zzso was identified to be the gene zzso coding for minor coat protein zzso (95 zzso zzso zzso zzso It was shown to be zzso associated by Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso Computer analysis predicted two zzso regions for this zzso Since no signal zzso was suggested and the size estimated by zzso gel zzso matches that deduced from zzso zzso it appears to be incorporated into the zzso particle as its primary zzso zzso After completion of this study, eight genes organizing into an order of zzso have been identified for zzso zzso
