The important zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to be absent from zzso muscle zzso of the family of zzso Antarctic zzso zzso Within this family of fishes, which is endemic to the Southern Ocean surrounding zzso there exist 15 known species and 11 zzso To date, we have examined eight species of zzso (representing seven zzso using zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso is present in heart zzso from five of these species of zzso zzso is absent from heart zzso and zzso skeletal muscle of all zzso We have identified a zzso zzso in zzso species that zzso with a zzso zzso probe from the closely related red-blooded Antarctic zzso fish, zzso zzso In confirmation that the zzso zzso encodes zzso we report the full-length zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the eight zzso species zzso three lack zzso zzso in heart zzso although one of these expresses the zzso zzso All species of zzso retain the zzso gene in their zzso zzso Based on zzso of the zzso loss of zzso expression has occurred independently at least three times and by at least two distinct molecular mechanisms during zzso of the zzso
