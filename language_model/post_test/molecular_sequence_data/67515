zzso zzso strains express zzso zzso and the zzso reference strain zzso has three zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso However, there is no information on the contribution ratios of individual zzso genes to total zzso In this study, we generated single, zzso and triple zzso of zzso genes by employing a strain zzso with high zzso efficiency and zzso marker recycling in zzso zzso All the zzso showed reduced activities of zzso and the triple zzso completely lost zzso Comparative analyses of the activities and zzso amounts of the zzso suggest that the contribution of zzso to the zzso expression is smaller than those of zzso and zzso The present study suggests that the ability to express a large amount of zzso in zzso zzso is attributed to gene zzso of genes such as zzso and zzso
