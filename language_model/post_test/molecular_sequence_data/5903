We have previously reported the initial characterization of a zzso operator site zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Here, we present the characterization by gel zzso and zzso I zzso of both zzso and a second zzso operator site, zzso Both operator sites zzso a single recognition site, an zzso box, located immediately upstream of the zzso start points, a unique positioning for a zzso zzso zzso Although there is considerable sequence zzso between the two zzso operator sites, they vary significantly, around zzso in their apparent affinities for the protein zzso approximately 90 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso This difference may result from the lower match to the zzso box consensus of the zzso zzso Both zzso operators show evidence for zzso binding with respect to protein zzso zzso of the sequences of two zzso zzso operator sites, in combination with the three such zzso sites, has allowed the derivation of an improved zzso zzso zzso box consensus zzso zzso This is not identical to the zzso coli consensus operator for the zzso zzso zzso which may explain the only partial zzso of these proteins in zzso The zzso site is adjacent to a sharp, stable bend located zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis has been used to determine the relative angle of bend zzso 50 zzso its location and the effect of adding zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso binding increases the relative bend angle to approximately 85 zzso zzso is shown to be associated with a number of zzso in the upstream zzso However, altering the phasing of the zzso has little effect on the affinity for zzso zzso and competition experiments have been used to investigate the possible role of sequences zzso the operator on zzso Very surprisingly, the affinity of the zzso site appears to increase in the presence of zzso specific competitor fragment, zzso the system shows zzso zzso Competition is restored at high zzso excesses of specific zzso over the zzso We propose a novel model for the assembly of a higher affinity form of zzso at operator sites that is consistent with both the apparent zzso of binding and the zzso zzso These data suggest that the molecular interactions occurring between the zzso zzso proteins and their operators may be more complex than is generally zzso
