A zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso was screened using a zzso zzso This probe was derived from a zzso zzso zzso representing part of a zzso zzso Several zzso clones were isolated, one of which zzso consists of a zzso sequence of zzso zzso and encodes the complete zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso with a zzso signal zzso which is followed by a zzso zzso and 219 zzso zzso of the mature zzso Two potential zzso sites and a putative zzso signal were also zzso The occurrence of the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not found in zzso zzso zzso suggests the zzso of the zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso worked out in this study will enable production of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso necessary for study of the zzso specificity as well as other zzso parameters of this zzso
