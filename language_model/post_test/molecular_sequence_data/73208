zzso zzso is rearranged in various types of zzso zzso The zzso precursor acute zzso leukemia zzso cell line zzso has a zzso involving zzso at zzso and a zzso deletion of the other zzso zzso The zzso zzso results in the fusion of zzso to a previously unknown gene at zzso which we named zzso zzso leukemia zzso Both zzso fusion transcripts can be zzso On the zzso zzso the zzso zzso shows an apparently out of frame fusion of zzso at zzso zzso to zzso which would result in the addition of 14 zzso acids to the first 54 zzso acids of zzso On the zzso zzso three different zzso of the zzso fusion zzso could be zzso variable size segments were inserted at the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso One of these zzso could give rise to a protein in which the first 54 zzso acids of zzso are replaced by 12 zzso acids from one of the zzso short open reading zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso clone from a skeletal muscle library revealed no long open reading zzso This cell line will be very useful in studying the different mechanisms by which zzso of zzso contribute to zzso and in testing the hypothesis that zzso might act as a tumor zzso zzso
