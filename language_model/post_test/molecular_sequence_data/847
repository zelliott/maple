Class I fusion zzso of viruses are involved in the fusion between viral envelope and cell zzso A region located in the zzso domain of these zzso called the fusion zzso is essential for zzso Fusion peptides are able to induce by themselves in zzso membrane zzso In this paper, we review the properties of those peptides related to their zzso in particular the correlation existing between their ability to insert obliquely in zzso and zzso This relation notably allows predicting successfully the minimal region of some fusion peptides sufficient to induce significant in zzso zzso The notion of zzso and zzso is discussed in terms of the existing proposed mechanisms for viral zzso
