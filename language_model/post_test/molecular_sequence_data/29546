The crystal structure of the zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was determined by zzso X-ray zzso In the crystal with the space group zzso two zzso molecules form a head-to-head zzso with the secondary zzso sides facing each zzso The zzso unit is stacked along the zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso cavity of the zzso zzso The zzso structure exhibits zzso twofold zzso and the guest zzso is zzso on the local symmetry zzso The zzso zzso is located at the center of the zzso zzso and the nitrate groups penetrate into the zzso zzso The guest zzso zzso the zzso structure to attain the most stable accommodation into the zzso The zzso molecules are zzso shifted away from each other to create the cavity fitted to the shape of the guest zzso As the result, the zzso hydrogen bonds between secondary zzso are not fully formed, but the zzso structure is stabilized by the interaction with the guest zzso
