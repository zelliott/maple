We have zzso a new zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene includes a signal zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso tandem zzso and a zzso zzso zzso An identical modular arrangement exists in two putative zzso genes from the draft sequence of the zzso zzso zzso The three zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso but, surprisingly, none bound cellulosic zzso The results raise fundamental questions concerning the possible zzso of the newly described zzso zzso analysis and preliminary zzso zzso studies suggest that the zzso module and the zzso zzso are distinctive in their sequences and are proposed to constitute a new zzso architectural zzso
