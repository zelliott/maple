A 42 zzso acid synthetic zzso corresponding to a newly defined zzso protein motif called zzso from the zzso protein zzso has been zzso The zzso zzso and zzso constant for zinc were determined by competition with the zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that one zinc atom binds per zzso of zzso despite the presence of seven putative metal zzso and represents the first application of this method to measuring zinc zzso of proteins and/or zzso zzso binding studies indicate that the motif binds zinc more tightly than zzso that zzso are used as zzso and that the zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies both indicate that the zzso zzso is structured only in the presence of zzso copper and to a lesser extent zzso
