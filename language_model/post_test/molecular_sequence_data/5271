zzso cells are rare zzso cells that reside in a number of zzso and zzso By zzso processing and presenting zzso to T cells, zzso cells are essential for immune surveillance and the regulation of specific zzso Several members of the zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso are integral to the regulation of the immune zzso These structurally related proteins zzso cellular functions ranging from proliferation and differentiation to inflammation and cell survival or zzso The functional activity of zzso cells is greatly increased by zzso through the zzso family member zzso Here we report the characterization of zzso (for zzso zzso of zzso a new member of the zzso family derived from zzso cells, and the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso by direct expression zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso cells to stimulate zzso zzso proliferation in a mixed zzso reaction, and increases the survival of zzso T cells generated with zzso and transforming growth factor zzso Thus zzso and zzso seem to be important regulators of interactions between T cells and zzso zzso
