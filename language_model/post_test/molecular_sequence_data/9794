zzso zzso coli zzso has been implicated as an agent of pediatric zzso in the developing zzso We have shown previously that zzso zzso to zzso cells by virtue of a zzso zzso zzso designated zzso adherence zzso I zzso the genes for which have been cloned and zzso However, not all zzso strains express zzso Using zzso zzso we have characterized a novel zzso zzso zzso which mediates zzso adherence of the zzso strain zzso zzso is 5 zzso in diameter and does not bind zzso zzso as determined by zzso transmission electron zzso zzso identified a gene zzso zzso which bears significant zzso to zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso identity and zzso similarity at the zzso acid zzso When zzso and zzso by zzso zzso the zzso protein assembled into zzso filaments which bound zzso zzso The cloned zzso gene zzso a zzso in the zzso gene to zzso zzso expression from the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso characteristic of zzso but not zzso The zzso zzso did not adhere to human zzso tissue in culture, suggesting a role for zzso in zzso zzso By using DNA zzso for zzso and zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso and zzso are each found in only a minority of zzso zzso suggesting that still more zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso represent a new family of zzso zzso which mediate zzso adherence in zzso
