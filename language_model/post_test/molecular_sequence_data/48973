Recently, we described a technique that allows us to prepare zzso for expression profiling from zzso zzso zzso without template or signal zzso However, we were unable to use this method to study cells harvested by needle zzso cell zzso or laser capture zzso Here we give a new protocol for amplifying zzso with multiple reaction cycles and preparing fluorescent zzso from approximately 10 zzso We use random zzso with a zzso zzso zzso recognition sequence on the zzso end for every round of zzso synthesis except the zzso The latter is primed with zzso with a zzso zzso zzso recognition sequence on the zzso zzso zzso were highly zzso and reliable, and the products generated using our method seemed comparable to those produced using the zzso zzso kit when both were used to do two cycles of zzso To test our zzso utility, we zzso cells directly into reverse zzso buffer containing zzso inhibitor and performed three rounds of zzso zzso The expression profiles of mouse C2 and zzso zzso cells obtained with zzso zzso using amplified zzso were similar to those seen when zzso were prepared from unamplified zzso
