zzso zzso Factor zzso is the zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso is structurally and functionally highly zzso to complement component zzso zzso like zzso the activated form of zzso forms a zzso complex with Factor B in serum, called zzso zzso an zzso which activates complement components zzso and zzso Despite the high degree of zzso the two zzso zzso exhibit significant functional zzso The most important difference is that the zzso formed with zzso zzso is zzso far more stable than the zzso formed with zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso and zzso are completely resistant to zzso by the complement regulatory proteins Factor H and Factor zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso shows efficient zzso activity in fluid zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso is essentially devoid of zzso zzso zzso By taking advantage of the high degree of sequence identity at both the zzso acid zzso and DNA levels zzso between zzso and zzso zzso we created hybrid proteins of zzso and zzso zzso where zzso or only a few zzso zzso of the zzso sequence were replaced with the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso In a first set of experiments, we created five hybrid zzso termed zzso through zzso where the zzso zzso zzso collectively spanned the entire length of the zzso zzso We also created three additional hybrid proteins where only four or five zzso acid zzso in zzso were exchanged with the corresponding zzso acid zzso from zzso zzso zzso these hybrid zzso representing zzso zzso of zzso allowed the identification of regions and individual zzso acid zzso important for the zzso zzso The results include the observation that the zzso zzso is zzso important for forming a stable zzso whereas the zzso zzso appears to harbor no zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso is additionally important for the zzso zzso activity of zzso Interestingly, the structural changes in the individual hybrid proteins zzso affected the molecular functions of the zzso zzso such as zzso formation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
