We have recently characterized an instance of alternative zzso that differs from the zzso gene transcript by deletion of a length of sequence not zzso by three, but where translation can be rescued by an alternative start zzso This results in a predicted protein in which the zzso zzso differs markedly in sequence from the known protein zzso as it is translated from an alternative reading zzso zzso pipelines have zzso thousands of zzso zzso but have overlooked these protein zzso leading to them being underrepresented in current zzso 

Here we describe 1849 human and zzso mouse transcripts that can be transcribed from an alternate zzso Of these, zzso have not been zzso zzso Those zzso between human and mouse zzso (and hence under likely evolutionary zzso are zzso We provide mass zzso evidence for translation of selected zzso Of the described zzso zzso only one has previously been studied in detail and converted the zzso protein from an zzso of zzso to a zzso demonstrating that these zzso zzso can result in profound functional zzso We investigate the potential functional effects of this zzso using a variety of zzso zzso The zzso zzso we describe are involved in a wide variety of biological zzso and therefore open many new avenues of zzso
