The evolution of zzso zzso zzso resistance provides a useful zzso for the study of fitness zzso associated with stress zzso In a previous study, we used zzso zzso length zzso zzso analysis to identify zzso expressed genes zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among these zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso In the current study, the full-length zzso zzso zzso was cloned using rapid amplification of zzso ends according to an expressed sequence tag derived from the previous zzso zzso zzso expression patterns indicated that this gene was zzso expressed in zzso and stages and was highest in the zzso and zzso of the 5th zzso zzso It is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Fitness zzso such as zzso and zzso weight, zzso zzso and survival rate, which are the most sensitive zzso were evaluated after zzso zzso or feeding of the zzso protein in zzso Our findings suggested that zzso of zzso might be related to zzso resistance and an zzso to zzso zzso
