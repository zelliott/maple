zzso zzso contain type III zzso intermediate filament zzso proteins that typically zzso and zzso in in zzso experiments with certain high molecular weight zzso Here, we report zzso of one of these and demonstrate that it is in fact the type VI IF protein zzso zzso is expressed in several zzso but not zzso cell zzso We show that zzso forms zzso and zzso but does not form IF by itself in zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso or the type IV IF protein zzso to form zzso zzso zzso These molecules may zzso into 10 zzso IF provided that the total amount of zzso does not exceed about zzso However, zzso does not zzso with types zzso zzso IF zzso The bulk of the zzso protein consists of a long zzso tail composed of various highly charged zzso zzso By zzso with the larger zzso zzso we zzso that these sequences serve as zzso or zzso between IF and/or other zzso zzso In this way, we propose that direct incorporation of modest amounts of zzso into the backbone of zzso types III and IV zzso zzso a simple yet flexible method for the regulation of their dynamic zzso organization and function in zzso
