An array of zzso link the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso to zzso functions including zzso and zzso of signaling molecules associated with inflammation and zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences is driven by zzso between exposed zzso motifs and the zzso signature of an zzso active site zzso However, conventional zzso screening methods have generated conflicting zzso profiles for zzso This study zzso a recently developed screening technique, the sparse zzso library, to identify five novel zzso sequences for zzso The optimal zzso zzso was zzso with higher efficiency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than favored zzso from zzso scanning and zzso display by zzso and zzso zzso zzso site zzso was prominent among preferred zzso which enabled optimal interaction at all zzso as indicated by zzso modeling of zzso zzso These simulations constitute the first molecular dynamics analysis of zzso and offer a structural rationale for the divergent zzso preferences evident between zzso and closely related zzso zzso and zzso zzso these findings highlight the importance of binding site zzso in zzso zzso recognition, which has implications for discovery of optimal zzso and engineering highly effective zzso zzso
