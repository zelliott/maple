The human zzso type 11 zzso when linked to the minimal zzso virus 40 early promoter, has been dissected into two zzso in monkey kidney zzso cells, one being zzso zzso zzso and the other zzso by zzso zzso proteins zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Chow, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Chow, Genes zzso zzso zzso We have demonstrated that the natural promoter regulated by this zzso is located immediately upstream of the E6 open reading frame (the E6 zzso We have mapped the cap site to zzso 99 by zzso zzso We further demonstrate a second zzso zzso element, zzso which is required for zzso from the E6 promoter in the human cervical zzso cell lines zzso and zzso but not in zzso zzso By deletion zzso we have localized this cell zzso domain to 71 base pairs by using zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso dramatically decreased the zzso activity of the zzso and the E6 promoter, whereas zzso of either domain in the absence of the other could independently restore zzso Furthermore, when either of these elements was deleted, the full-length zzso protein of human zzso type 11 abolished the remaining zzso E6 promoter activity, demonstrating for the first time that the zzso zzso protein of human zzso can also function as a zzso zzso for the zzso E6 viral zzso The presence of multiple copies of each element in tandem overcomes the repression by the zzso zzso The effects of zzso are at the level of transcription, without changing the cap zzso By gel shift zzso we have shown that a protein present in nuclear extracts of zzso and zzso cervical zzso cells binds to the newly identified zzso element zzso This protein did not bind the zzso virus 40 zzso nor did it bind to the zzso region of many other zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed major zzso and minor zzso proteins that bound specifically to zzso These two proteins are either related or bind to zzso with high zzso We conclude that zzso activities directed by the zzso and E6 promoter reflect an intricate balance among viral and cellular zzso We present a model on the regulation of the E6 promoter by host and viral zzso zzso
