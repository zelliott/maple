We report here the molecular analysis of a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in a new patient, born to first cousin zzso She has initially presented with a zzso and unspecific zzso followed by an acute neurological deterioration at 14 years of zzso zzso zzso was zzso on Western zzso The sequence of zzso zzso and zzso 11 of the zzso gene were normal, but zzso 10 was impossible to amplify with standard zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The patient's sample displayed a unique zzso product of zzso zzso whereas the parents' samples displayed two bands zzso and zzso zzso The deletion zzso were determined by restriction analysis followed by direct zzso The zzso deletion covered the end of zzso 9, zzso 10 and the beginning of zzso 10 and was found to be zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequencing confirmed the deletion of zzso zzso The most probable mechanism for this gross deletion appears to be a slipped zzso zzso by an exact direct repeat zzso It is the first time that a zzso zzso is reported in the zzso gene causing zzso zzso complex zzso zzso
