Most field zzso of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso form tenacious zzso on zzso surfaces in zzso We zzso zzso zzso from zzso produced by zzso zzso field zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 and 5, respectively), and determined their chemical structures by using zzso zzso Both strains produced zzso zzso consisting of linear chains of zzso zzso zzso in zzso linkage zzso or zzso A small percentage of the zzso zzso in each zzso were zzso These structures were nearly identical to those of zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that a gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was present on the zzso of 15 out of 15 zzso zzso reference strains zzso zzso and 76 out of 77 zzso zzso field zzso zzso 1, 5 and zzso A zzso zzso of strain zzso failed to form zzso in zzso as did zzso strains zzso and zzso when grown in broth supplemented with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso B rendered them more sensitive to killing by zzso Our findings suggest that PGA functions as a major zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso formation may have relevance to the colonization and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso
