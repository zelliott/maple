Our previous study has shown that the human zzso virus type 1 zzso envelope zzso region minor zzso of infected mothers were transmitted to their infants and predominated initially as a homogeneous virus population in the infants zzso zzso zzso zzso Baker zzso et zzso J zzso zzso Here we have characterized the biological properties, including cellular zzso replication efficiency, zzso effects, and zzso zzso of these zzso region zzso from mothers and zzso zzso zzso region sequences from three zzso pairs, including the minor zzso of mothers and the major zzso of infants as characterized in our previous study, were zzso inserted into an zzso infectious molecular zzso zzso and zzso viruses were generated by DNA zzso into zzso zzso Equal amounts of zzso viruses were then used to zzso T zzso cell lines zzso and zzso primary blood zzso zzso primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso We found that the zzso region zzso failed to replicate in T zzso cell lines but zzso in zzso and zzso albeit at reduced levels compared with zzso laboratory zzso zzso In addition, the zzso region zzso were able to zzso the zzso cell line, suggesting zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso region zzso were unable to induce zzso in zzso cells, indicative of zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso minor zzso of infected mothers with zzso and zzso or zzso zzso are transmitted to their infants and are initially maintained with the same zzso
