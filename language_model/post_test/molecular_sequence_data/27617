We have previously shown that the zzso protein zzso zzso recognizes two major sites in zzso preparations of bovine brain zzso that arise from spontaneous degradation zzso These sites are derived from zzso zzso at positions 2 and 78, which are located in apparently flexible regions of zzso We zzso that this flexibility was an important factor in the zzso formation and zzso recognition of zzso and/or zzso zzso Because removal of zzso zzso from this protein may also lead to increased flexibility in the four zzso binding regions, we have now characterized the sites of zzso that occur when zzso is incubated in buffers with or without the calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso was treated at pH zzso for 13 days at 37 degrees C under these conditions and was then zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso I and zzso The zzso zzso product was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso with various zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the resulting peptides were separated by zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso as well as calcium binding sites II, III, and IV, were found to be associated with zzso under these zzso When zzso was incubated under the same conditions in the presence of zzso zzso at zzso in the zzso binding regions was not zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
