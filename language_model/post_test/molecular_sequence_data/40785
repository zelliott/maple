The zzso gene with an upstream zzso zzso zzso was originally found on the zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso However, a zzso zzso gene has recently been identified in zzso zzso species zzso and several zzso zzso zzso in Taiwan, and all of the zzso are zzso zzso This study aimed to characterize the plasmids bearing the zzso gene and their significance in zzso zzso Among the 117 zzso zzso collected from 10 hospitals in Taiwan, 58 zzso zzso from 24 clones had the genes located on plasmids that likely originated from a common zzso Among the 58 zzso four had additional copy of the zzso gene on their zzso Based on the analysis of these four zzso the zzso zzso gene appeared to be acquired via zzso zzso zzso The zzso with a zzso bearing the zzso gene had higher rates of resistance to zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso than those with the genes zzso zzso which is most likely due to increased gene dosage provided by the higher copy number of associated zzso Transformation with a zzso zzso harboring only the zzso gene was enough to zzso a high level of zzso resistance to zzso zzso eliminating the possible contribution of other factors on the original zzso This study demonstrated that the zzso zzso plasmids carrying the zzso gene are widespread in zzso zzso strains in zzso
