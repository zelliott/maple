zzso lupus zzso is an zzso disease caused primarily by zzso (including zzso zzso and immune complexes that cause tissue zzso After zzso with an artificial zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso sequences containing zzso class I and class II T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso female zzso mice develop regulatory zzso T cells and zzso zzso T cells, both of which suppress zzso zzso production and immune zzso In the present work, we show that zzso from zzso mice treated with zzso had significant expansion of primarily zzso T zzso zzso T cells and B cells were each directly suppressed by zzso T cells from zzso mice in a zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso T cells suppressed production of zzso in zzso zzso with small interfering zzso of zzso zzso the suppression zzso by both zzso T cell zzso Additionally, zzso T cells from zzso mice were zzso zzso against zzso B cells from old zzso mice, but not from young zzso zzso zzso treatment had dual effects on zzso zzso T cells from zzso mice, increasing the zzso expression of zzso while decreasing the surface expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions in the zzso T cells from zzso mice reduced their expression of zzso and their ability to suppress zzso zzso In contrast, blocking zzso in zzso T cells increased zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso with zzso activates different zzso of zzso zzso T cells whose targets are both zzso zzso T cells and B zzso
