zzso anonymous protein zzso is a type 1 zzso protein that plays an essential role in gliding zzso and cell invasion by zzso zzso It is stored in zzso zzso located primarily in the zzso end of the zzso and is also found on the zzso zzso The mechanisms that target zzso and other zzso proteins to zzso and subsequently to the zzso surface are not zzso Here we report that the zzso and surface zzso of zzso requires a zzso motif located in its zzso zzso This motif is analogous to the zzso motif zzso zzso zzso any zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that targets zzso proteins to certain zzso compartments and to the plasma zzso zzso the Y motif substantially reduces zzso and cell surface zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is substantially zzso However, there is no significant difference in the amounts of zzso zzso into the culture medium by wild type and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso destined for zzso zzso zzso zzso
