DNA repeats, revealed initially by zzso of horse DNA with restriction zzso were cloned and characterized by zzso studies and zzso zzso The zzso family of tandem repeats contained two classes of repetitive elements with unit repeats of about 80 zzso that shared no sequence zzso Both unit repeats were present, frequently in tandem, in cloned segments of horse DNA of less than 600 zzso Evidence is zzso based on their zzso patterns of zzso to horse DNA and their high level of similarity to published sequences of satellites from zzso DNA, suggesting that they are zzso located in the horse zzso The zzso tandem repeat families were specific to zzso Another class of repeats, zzso zzso which did not appear to have a zzso distribution, was also cloned and zzso
