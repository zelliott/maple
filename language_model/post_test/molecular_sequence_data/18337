zzso human zzso has been zzso in zzso coli with the aid of a human zzso gene zzso cloned by zzso et al zzso from a human complementary DNA zzso zzso The gene has been expressed by use of a new type of expression zzso called a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et al zzso The highest level of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the total cell zzso was observed in zzso coli strain zzso carrying a zzso version of the zzso The zzso zzso carries an additional zzso zzso at its N zzso in comparison with natural zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein is removed with high efficiency by zzso coli terminal zzso zzso procedures for zzso of the zzso zzso from the zzso fraction of cell zzso and for zzso the protein allowed the isolation of almost 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso wet bacterial zzso The zzso zzso zzso displayed the same biological properties zzso zzso activity and the ability to induce blood vessel growth on the zzso of experimental zzso as its natural counterpart isolated from human zzso
