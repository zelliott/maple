A recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously reported to be present in 70 zzso of 208 strains examined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Van zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Blaser, Cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of nine such strains indicated that in each strain zzso replaced zzso which encodes a restriction zzso and which, together with the gene for its zzso zzso constitutes the zzso zzso As a consequence of either the zzso zzso or independent zzso zzso function was lost in 11 zzso of the 208 strains zzso rendering zzso DNA sensitive to zzso zzso The evolutionary history of the locus containing either zzso or zzso was zzso By zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso and zzso can replace one another in the zzso zzso and there is simultaneous replacement of several zzso zzso These findings, combined with the zzso locus discovered zzso suggest that the two most strongly zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are both preceded by alternative genes that compete for presence at their zzso
