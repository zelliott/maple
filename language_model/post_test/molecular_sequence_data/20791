This article provides a review of approaches to identification of the pathways of the molecular evolution of zzso zzso zzso evidence has now accumulated on the zzso of zzso proteins with the ability to function as zzso zzso However, knowledge of the zzso acid sequences of the zzso forming these channels is a necessary but insufficient condition for identifying their origin and changes during zzso Natural selection of protein molecules appears to have identified and fixed their functional zzso zzso and functional approaches should therefore complement each other in studies of protein zzso Studies of zzso zzso channels in zzso and zzso provide an example showing how knowledge of the spatial organization and the details of the mechanisms of operation allows relationships to be identified and possible pathways of the molecular evolution of receptors to be zzso
