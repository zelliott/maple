We have cloned a novel zzso element from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The size of the element, designated as zzso is zzso zzso including on both sides long terminal direct repeats zzso of zzso zzso zzso The element is flanked by a zzso target site duplication, zzso The putative primer binding site (PBS) for zzso zzso is complementary to 18 zzso of the zzso of zzso Data base screens for DNA sequence identities were negative, apart from the sequence motif of the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence from the large zzso does not reveal identities described for other zzso In zzso zzso with zzso zzso show a biased distribution in the zzso with a massive zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso while the former zzso the zzso zzso is devoid of zzso zzso The enriched occurrence of the zzso element at the evolving zzso zzso of zzso adds compelling evidence in favor of the view that Y zzso zzso is driven by the zzso of zzso zzso
