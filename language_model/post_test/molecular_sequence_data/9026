To gain insights into a possible role of zzso in zzso zzso we performed short zzso massive sequencing and extensive zzso analysis in the zzso zzso cell zzso Overall, zzso known mature zzso were zzso of which 21 were highly zzso thus being responsible of most of zzso gene zzso zzso putative targets were enriched in specific signaling zzso providing information about cell activities under massive zzso zzso The majority of zzso were zzso of sequence zzso called zzso mainly because of alternative, zzso processing of hairpin zzso We also identified 78 novel zzso zzso derived from known hairpin zzso Both major and minor (*) forms of zzso were expressed zzso from half of expressed zzso highlighting the relevance of zzso and the complexity of strand selection bias zzso Finally, we discovered that zzso cells express a number of zzso zzso zzso short zzso derived from zzso regions zzso mature zzso We provide novel data about the possible origin of zzso although their functional role remains to be zzso Overall, this study shed light on the complexity of zzso gene regulation in zzso cells and represents the basis for future studies in zzso cellular zzso
