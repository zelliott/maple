We isolated two new zzso zzso by screening a zzso library constructed from zzso zzso of the zzso and abdominal skin of zzso mice with a probe of human zzso Due to its high sequence zzso to human zzso 17 zzso one full-length zzso is most likely to be mouse zzso 17 zzso zzso The other is the putative full-length zzso of a novel type I zzso zzso designated zzso These two zzso genes were mapped to the zzso portion of zzso 11, where the mouse zzso gene zzso zzso is zzso To zzso the zzso organization of zzso in mice, we carried out genetic and physical analyses of zzso A large-scale linkage analysis using zzso zzso suggested that there are two major clusters in zzso one containing zzso zzso and zzso and the other containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments with two zzso artificial zzso clones containing the two clusters above have revealed that the gene order of zzso is zzso zzso zzso Finally, we analyzed sequence divergence between the genes belonging to the zzso zzso The results clearly indicated that genes are classified into two major groups with respect to zzso zzso Each group consists of the respective gene cluster demonstrated by genetic and physical analyses in this study, suggesting that the physical organization of the zzso complex reflects the evolutionary process of gene zzso of this zzso
