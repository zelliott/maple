We investigated the use of zzso chain reaction zzso for diagnosis of zzso in zzso zzso zzso using seven cases in which the diagnosis was certain based on zzso examination and eight cases in which zzso findings only suggested zzso zzso zzso After amplification the zzso products were subjected to zzso gel zzso followed by Southern zzso with a zzso zzso zzso In six of seven proven cases of zzso organisms were detected using DNA extracted from zzso to zzso of a zzso tissue zzso In addition, organisms were detected in one of eight cases in which infection was suspected, but not proven by identification of zzso We conclude on the basis of this study that zzso may be useful for detection of zzso zzso in a few cases in which routine zzso examination or zzso zzso is not zzso Since zzso has zzso higher sensitivity when applied to fresh, rather than zzso zzso we expect zzso to be more sensitive in fresh zzso
