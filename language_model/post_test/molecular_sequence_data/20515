zzso based on the second zzso repeat zzso of viral class I fusion proteins are effective zzso of virus zzso One such fusion inhibitor has been approved for treatment of human zzso zzso zzso zzso Resistance to zzso usually maps to the zzso binding site in zzso To better understand fusion inhibitor potency and resistance, we combined zzso zzso and zzso experiments with comprehensive zzso analyses and tested resistance to zzso and second and third generation zzso zzso and zzso We found that most zzso acid zzso caused resistance to the first generation zzso zzso Only charged zzso acids caused resistance to zzso and none caused resistance to zzso Depending on the drug, we can distinguish four mechanisms of drug zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the design of novel zzso zzso zzso are zzso
