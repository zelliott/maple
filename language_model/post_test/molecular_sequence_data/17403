zzso zzso disease viruses zzso belonging to the zzso family, cause severe zzso in young chickens by destroying the precursors of zzso B cells in the zzso of zzso zzso Different zzso of zzso including cell zzso zzso differ markedly in zzso which is characterized by mortality and zzso zzso To study the molecular zzso of zzso in zzso the zzso segments A and B of zzso zzso zzso and tissue zzso zzso viruses were cloned and zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences of segments A and B revealed only two zzso acid zzso at positions 87 zzso zzso zzso and 261 zzso zzso zzso in segment B, and at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (A zzso zzso in segment zzso the latter of which has been shown to be involved in tissue culture adaptation and zzso of the zzso To study the function of zzso protein zzso by segment B, zzso viruses between tissue zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were recovered using the reverse zzso zzso The zzso virus zzso containing segment B of zzso was able to replicate in zzso and chicken zzso zzso zzso cells but exhibited delayed replication zzso To evaluate the characteristics of these viruses in zzso zzso chickens were given equal doses of parental viruses or zzso viruses by zzso zzso The pathological zzso and viral zzso distribution in zzso were analyzed at 1, 2, or 3 days zzso zzso zzso and the recovered zzso viruses zzso most efficiently in the zzso and cause severe zzso zzso whereas the tissue zzso zzso virus replicates less efficiently and zzso mild zzso zzso at 3 days zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that the zzso protein of zzso is involved in the efficiency of viral replication and zzso the zzso in zzso
