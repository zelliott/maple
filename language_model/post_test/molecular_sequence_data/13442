Based on evidence in zzso which shows that the small form of zzso delta virus zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso whereas the long form zzso zzso by the edited zzso zzso zzso we first put forward the hypothesis that zzso zzso editing efficiency, zzso the zzso zzso ratio, could be a determining factor on the course of the zzso In order to zzso the precise sequence of events after infection, zzso carriers of zzso zzso virus zzso were zzso with zzso and sequential changes in zzso zzso editing efficiency were zzso in relation to the duration of zzso Our findings show that: zzso in both zzso and persistently zzso zzso the percentage of zzso is higher at the early stage of onset of the disease than at the late zzso zzso at the early stage of onset the percentage of zzso is higher in cases with transient zzso than in those with persistent zzso zzso a relatively greater decrease in zzso is seen later in zzso zzso animals than in those that remain persistently zzso In view of the above findings in zzso and other supporting evidence in zzso we propose a hypothesis for the zzso of zzso This hypothesis predicts the outcome of acute infection and we suggest a gene therapeutic approach for this disease based on the zzso zzso (or zzso of the zzso
