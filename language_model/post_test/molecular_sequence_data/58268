zzso is a zzso zzso rolling circle replicating zzso whose copy number is controlled by regulating the synthesis and activity of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is modified during zzso replication by the addition of an zzso giving rise to a new form, zzso To purify zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso as a fusion protein with a zzso zzso The zzso zzso retains its initiation and zzso activities in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analysis and protein sequencing of zzso zzso and zzso were carried out, and both proteins appeared zzso except that the zzso containing the zzso active site zzso used in zzso activity was absent when the zzso zzso sample was zzso The absence of the active site in zzso suggests that this site was modified during zzso The results provide the first direct zzso evidence that zzso is a modified form of zzso and support a model in which zzso replication of zzso leaves zzso with an zzso blocking the active site of one of its zzso
