A simple, sensitive, and specific one step zzso chain reaction zzso method for the detection of zzso C virus zzso zzso in infected patients' serum or plasma samples is zzso We performed the one step zzso amplification in combination with the initial step of reverse zzso by using zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso region zzso of the zzso zzso By utilizing this strategy, there was no need for zzso or second stage zzso zzso The zzso products zzso were easily zzso by zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso products were characterized by Southern zzso zzso and DNA zzso We then used the one step zzso amplification method to detect the presence of zzso zzso in several infected patients' samples with acute and chronic zzso There was a zzso zzso between the results of zzso and second generation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, this method was found to be useful in determining zzso in zzso infected patients with indeterminate zzso II zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso being the most zzso region among different viral zzso could be amplified by zzso for the detection of zzso zzso as shown here, as well as serving as a potential target for zzso zzso
