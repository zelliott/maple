We have isolated a zzso that encodes the human regulatory zzso light chain zzso zzso in adult zzso zzso The zzso contains an open reading frame of 175 zzso acids and encodes a zzso protein of a largely zzso structure with two potential zzso zzso The protein is different from any other regulatory zzso light chain so far described and is the product of a previously zzso single copy zzso An zzso probe was used to analyze the expression of this zzso in adult muscle and in cardiac and skeletal muscle development in zzso and in zzso Parallel analysis of the corresponding human zzso zzso light chain zzso in adult zzso showed that both zzso are expressed in early heart development, in both atrium and zzso Although the zzso zzso light chain is expressed throughout embryonic zzso muscle development, the regulatory zzso light chain was not detected in skeletal zzso in zzso or in zzso Thus the zzso zzso are not universally or exclusively zzso and can be independently zzso We propose that the manner in which these particular zzso fulfill the functional requirements of the muscle at different zzso times may have direct impact on their zzso
