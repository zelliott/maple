The zzso zzso 2 zzso gene in the mouse has a zzso promoter, and its expression is regulated during the development and zzso modulated zzso of the zzso zzso Previous studies showed that the zzso of the mouse zzso zzso gene is zzso by the zzso hormones, insulin, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors which bind to the zzso gene promoter region can influence the expression level of the zzso zzso It is supposed that the zzso gene promoter region zzso pairs zzso to zzso maybe contain 10 putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso binding sites: zzso zzso zzso In order to identify the zzso factors involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso and zzso mouse nuclear extracts were zzso zzso zzso Shift zzso zzso show that the region zzso pairs zzso to zzso where there is a zzso binding site, zzso binds to zzso not to zzso zzso zzso or other zzso zzso The involvement of zzso in regulating the expression of the mouse zzso gene was further investigated by transient zzso of various zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso 7 zzso The results showed that zzso of zzso or zzso zzso can enhance zzso promoter activities in the promoter construct zzso (from base pairs zzso to zzso but not in the promoter construct zzso (from base pairs zzso to zzso This paper first reports that zzso is involved in the binding between zzso and zzso base pairs of the zzso gene promoter and stimulates the expression of the zzso gene zzso in the mouse zzso zzso zzso
