zzso protein C zzso is a zzso that contains two zzso zzso groups and is considered to be important for formation of the zzso surface active zzso zzso Here, a zzso or zzso zzso analogue zzso in which all zzso Val zzso were replaced with zzso and zzso and zzso were replaced with zzso was tested for surface activity in a captive bubble system zzso zzso either zzso at zzso and zzso or zzso was added to zzso of 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso (by zzso at a concentration of 2 and zzso With zzso zzso surface film formation was zzso reaching a surface tension below 25 zzso within 5 zzso but the samples with zzso zzso required more than 20 s to reach values below 25 zzso Minimum surface tension for the samples with zzso zzso was below zzso zzso and very stable, as the surface tension increased by less than zzso zzso within 10 zzso at constant bubble zzso Minimum surface tension for the zzso zzso was approximately 2 and 5 zzso for 2 and zzso zzso respectively, but the films were less stable as seen by frequent bubble clicking at low surface zzso Films with zzso zzso that were zzso zzso at zzso zzso were substantially less zzso at a surface tension of 20 zzso zzso zzso than those that contained the zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso the incorporation of lipids into the surface active film during initial bubble expansion occurred at a relatively low surface tension (about 35 zzso for the samples with zzso zzso compared to approximately 45 zzso for those containing the zzso zzso Furthermore, for samples that contained zzso zzso the ability to reach near zero stable surface tension was lost after a few zzso steps, whereas with the zzso zzso the film quality did not deteriorate even after more than 10 expansion steps and the incorporation of zzso material equivalent to more than two zzso It appears that the zzso linked zzso groups of the zzso analogue studied are important for the mechanical stability of the zzso film, for the capacity to incorporate material from the zzso into the surface active film upon area expansion, and for the low film zzso of zzso zzso zzso
