In zzso the functional gene zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso has been zzso to the nucleus where it became integrated between both zzso of a gene zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Two transcripts are generated from this locus by alternative zzso One transcript encodes a precursor for a functional zzso zzso while the second transcript encodes a zzso zzso precursor zzso In this paper we show that the same zzso targeting zzso is able to direct the import of both precursors into isolated zzso and is removed during zzso This processing event generates a 28 zzso protein from the zzso zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso of respiratory complex II present in zzso zzso In addition to zzso of the zzso the zzso precursor zzso zzso processing between zzso and zzso This processing generates zzso which is found assembled into zzso zzso and a truncated zzso protein which is zzso zzso our results support a role of the zzso domain in the zzso precursor only in providing a zzso targeting function for zzso
