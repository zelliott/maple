A zzso zzso called zzso isolated from liver zzso of an adult male zzso dog treated with zzso zzso is structurally and functionally similar to members of the zzso gene zzso in rat and human liver zzso The sequence of the first 28 zzso zzso of zzso is identical in 15 and 20 positions, respectively, to the zzso forms zzso from rat and zzso (and zzso from zzso Upon zzso analysis, zzso zzso recognizes zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso from human, and two proteins in liver zzso from both zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso with zzso and with at least one protein in zzso from zzso dogs and two proteins in zzso from zzso zzso zzso marker steroid 6 zzso activities increase zzso upon zzso of dogs and are selectively inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex formation and zzso zzso also marker activities for zzso forms from rats and humans, increase zzso and zzso in dog liver zzso upon zzso treatment, whereas zzso zzso zzso is induced zzso In zzso from zzso dogs, 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso greater than 75 and 50% of zzso complex formation and zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso complex formation is not inhibited by zzso a selective inhibitor of the major zzso dog liver zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso or another zzso related form is responsible for a major portion of zzso zzso metabolism by zzso from zzso dogs and for steroid 6 zzso by zzso from both zzso and zzso zzso Major species differences were noted, however, in the apparent zzso for 6 zzso of zzso by liver zzso from zzso rats (24 zzso humans zzso zzso and zzso dogs zzso zzso
