To zzso the function of the zzso zzso we applied zzso in zzso zzso to zzso of mice from different zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found transcribed in a ubiquitous manner with an expression pattern similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso which was used as a control zzso A significant difference in the zzso expression pattern, however, was markedly enhanced expression specifically confined to the zzso and the fetal zzso In the immature and mature zzso an elevated level of zzso expression is found in type A1 zzso zzso in the zzso is observed in fetal life, reaches the highest level in the immature zzso and declines early in adult zzso In the mature zzso no specific zzso expression signal was found but enhanced levels were seen in the fetal zzso At this zzso stage proliferation of zzso takes zzso It is suggested that zzso serves a special function during germ cell proliferation in males and zzso These findings are discussed in the light of the current observation that fragile X patients produce only zzso with a zzso sized zzso Two hypotheses are put zzso zzso In males lack of zzso function results in a zzso zzso preventing zzso with a full zzso to reach zzso A fragile X zzso can be passed on to zzso only as a zzso zzso zzso zzso Transition of a zzso zzso to full zzso occurs in a zzso stage after separation of the germ line and is restricted to zzso cells zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso germ cells is in line with both zzso
