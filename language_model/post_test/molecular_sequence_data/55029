A major zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance 1), a member of the MFS zzso zzso zzso invariably contributes to an increased zzso of commonly used zzso and thus corroborates their direct involvement in zzso in zzso zzso The zzso protein has two zzso zzso each zzso six zzso zzso interconnected with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The introduction of deletions and insertions through zzso was used to address the role of the largest zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Most of the progressive zzso when zzso eliminated the drug zzso zzso restoration of the length of the zzso by zzso zzso did not restore the functionality of the zzso Interestingly, most of the zzso and deletion zzso of zzso became amenable to zzso yielding zzso zzso The zzso model of the zzso protein showed that the molecular zzso distribution was zzso in most of the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso MFS zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family is critical for the function of zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso has no apparent role in zzso zzso specificity or in the recruitment of the zzso zzso
