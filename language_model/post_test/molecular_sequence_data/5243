The zzso chain reaction zzso is a rapid and very sensitive method to detect viral zzso In the present study, the efficacy of zzso against zzso B virus zzso of high-risk infants was evaluated by zzso zzso infants born to 24 zzso carrier mothers were given zzso B immune zzso zzso at birth and thereafter received repeated zzso of zzso vaccine or zzso or both, within 1 zzso zzso samples at 1 year following zzso were stored at zzso degrees C for later analysis using zzso to detect zzso When zzso zzso were detected in zzso the DNA sequences in the S gene of zzso were zzso Of 29 zzso 2 were positive for zzso at the 1 year following zzso one had the zzso containing only the zzso sequence in the S gene and became negative for zzso during the follow-up zzso In contrast, another had the zzso which contained zzso zzso that altered the expression of the common zzso zzso zzso of the S gene and resulted in clinical zzso with viral zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso against zzso prevents effectively high-risk infants from zzso zzso Even then, however, it is possible that zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso of the S gene are associated with failure of conventional zzso against zzso
