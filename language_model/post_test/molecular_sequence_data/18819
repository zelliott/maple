In response to a range of environmental zzso zzso of the alpha zzso of the translation initiation factor 2 zzso zzso general protein synthesis zzso with increased translation of specific zzso such as those zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso acid zzso by a mechanism involving zzso binding to an zzso protein zzso along with association with zzso zzso that accumulates during zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso bind to zzso thereby preventing zzso association with zzso and stimulation of this zzso zzso during zzso acid zzso zzso activity is also enhanced by other zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and lack of zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso affects directly and specifically the zzso of zzso under these stress conditions in zzso zzso We show that zzso of zzso zzso requires its interaction with zzso and that zzso promotes the dissolution of the zzso zzso To a similar extent as the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells inhibited growth under all stress conditions that require zzso and zzso for cell survival, including exposure to zzso acid, high levels of zzso zzso or zzso This study extends our understanding of the roles played by zzso in zzso zzso induced by a variety of stress arrangements and suggests that zzso and zzso use similar mechanisms for regulating this zzso zzso
