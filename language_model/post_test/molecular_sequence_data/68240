A zzso clone of the previously zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated after a differential screen of a zzso library prepared from zzso (6 degrees C zzso degrees C night) grown barley shoot zzso Southern zzso analysis of barley zzso addition lines was used to assign this zzso gene to the long arm of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso levels of zzso zzso showed the induction of this transcript in shoot zzso upon transfer of barley zzso zzso plants from control (20 degrees zzso degrees zzso to low (6 degrees zzso degrees zzso temperature zzso Further, the high level of this transcript is maintained at low temperatures but is reduced on transfer from low to control zzso The gene is not induced by drought or by zzso application of zzso Analysis of segregating doubled zzso lines shows that there is no specific association of this gene with either zzso growth habit or frost zzso zzso of the spatial expression pattern revealed ubiquitous expression of zzso in zzso (6 degrees zzso degrees zzso grown barley shoot zzso mature leaves and zzso
