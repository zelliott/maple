zzso is a ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso with a variety of important biological functions that are zzso by its interactions with zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell surface zzso zzso is the zzso of the family of small zzso repeat zzso and proteins zzso characterized by a protein core composed of zzso repeats zzso flanked by two zzso zzso We report here the crystal structure of the zzso protein core of zzso the best characterized member of the zzso zzso Each zzso adopts the curved zzso fold characteristic of zzso zzso with a parallel zzso on the inside interwoven with zzso containing short segments of zzso zzso zzso and zzso II zzso on the zzso Two main features are unique to this zzso First, zzso zzso through the zzso surfaces of the zzso zzso which have been implicated previously in zzso zzso The amount of surface buried in this zzso rivals the buried surfaces of some of the zzso zzso complexes reported to zzso Second, the zzso region adopts an unusual capping motif that involves a zzso extended zzso and a zzso zzso This motif seems to be unique to zzso and has not been observed in any other zzso protein structure to zzso zzso implications of these features for zzso zzso binding and zzso function are zzso
