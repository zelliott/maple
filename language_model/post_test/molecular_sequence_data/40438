zzso in the zzso gene zzso are suggested to be the most common cause of zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso However, the exact spectrum and frequency of zzso zzso in different forms of zzso has not been well zzso especially in Chinese zzso In this study, direct cycle sequencing was used to analyze all five coding zzso and adjacent zzso regions of zzso in 248 Chinese zzso with different forms of non zzso zzso Eight zzso zzso changes were zzso including two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and six known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in 14 zzso zzso isolated cases, three from zzso dominant families, and three from zzso zzso zzso Of the eight zzso seven were zzso changes and one was a small zzso Six may be zzso zzso and two others zzso zzso may not be zzso on their zzso The zzso change was present in six of the 248 zzso with zzso but only in one of zzso normal controls, while the zzso was present in two zzso but none of the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate an overview of the spectrum and frequency of zzso zzso zzso in a Chinese population and emphasize that zzso zzso in isolated zzso are not zzso
