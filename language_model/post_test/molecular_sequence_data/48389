Pulmonary zzso hypertension is a devastating disease with high zzso zzso cases of pulmonary zzso hypertension are usually characterized by zzso dominant transmission with reduced zzso and some familial cases have unknown genetic zzso 

We studied a family in which multiple members had pulmonary zzso hypertension without identifiable zzso in any of the genes known to be associated with the disease, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three family members were studied with zzso zzso Additional patients with familial or idiopathic pulmonary zzso hypertension were screened for the zzso in the gene that was identified on zzso zzso All zzso were expressed in zzso cells, and channel function was studied by means of zzso zzso 

We identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso (the gene zzso zzso channel zzso K, member 3) as a zzso candidate gene in the zzso Five additional zzso zzso zzso in zzso were independently identified in 92 unrelated patients with familial pulmonary zzso hypertension and 230 patients with idiopathic pulmonary zzso zzso We used in zzso zzso tools to predict that all six novel zzso would be zzso zzso studies of the channel indicated that all these zzso zzso resulted in loss of function, and the reduction in the zzso current was zzso by the application of the zzso inhibitor zzso 

Our study identified the association of a novel zzso zzso with familial and idiopathic pulmonary zzso zzso zzso in this gene produced reduced zzso zzso which was successfully zzso by zzso zzso zzso by the National Institutes of zzso
