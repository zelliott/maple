A new zzso species, for which the name zzso zzso is proposed, was isolated from cultured zzso zzso zzso with bacterial zzso zzso The zzso agent was similar to zzso zzso zzso A in its zzso characteristics and on the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, but it reduced nitrate to zzso Furthermore, it was distinguished zzso from zzso zzso zzso A by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The levels of zzso zzso between the isolate strain zzso zzso and other reference strains of zzso species, including zzso zzso were less than zzso The zzso content of the DNA of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is designated the type strain of the new zzso
