zzso of the zzso of exposure of zzso zzso on the envelope of human zzso virus type 1 zzso during the course of infection may provide key information about how zzso escapes the immune system or why its envelope is such a poor zzso to induce broadly efficient zzso zzso We analyzed the zzso of exposure of the zzso corresponding to the broadly zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso level during zzso We studied the zzso and sequences of 94 full-length envelope clones present during primary infection and at least 4 years later in four zzso zzso zzso zzso No or only minor exposure differences were observed for the zzso and zzso zzso between the early and late zzso zzso the envelope zzso of the zzso zzso present during primary infection did not expose the zzso zzso zzso unlike those present after several years in three of the four zzso zzso analysis revealed major differences at potential zzso zzso sites between early and late zzso particularly at positions known to be important for zzso zzso Our study, in natural zzso confirms that the zzso sites zzso zzso and zzso are essential for zzso zzso This study demonstrates the relationship between the evolving zzso shield zzso of zzso and the zzso of exposure of the zzso zzso during the course of natural zzso
