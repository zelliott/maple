zzso of many zzso zzso and zzso is regulated by targeting their zzso zzso for rapid zzso Essential signals for this control are zzso elements zzso in the 3' untranslated region zzso of these zzso The ARE is loosely defined as the zzso sequence zzso embedded in a zzso zzso A zzso factor, presumably a zzso binds the ARE and zzso recognition by the zzso zzso Numerous candidate zzso proteins have been zzso We show that a 32 zzso protein in zzso nuclear extracts characterized previously has zzso specificity that zzso with the activity of an ARE in directing zzso zzso zzso and subsequent analyses demonstrate that this 32 zzso protein is identical to a recently identified member of the zzso gene family zzso called zzso The in zzso binding selectivity of zzso is indicative of an ARE zzso ability to destabilize a zzso in zzso suggesting a critical role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso
