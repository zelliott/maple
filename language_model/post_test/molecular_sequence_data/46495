zzso storage disease type IV zzso zzso zzso disease) is caused by a zzso of zzso branching zzso zzso leading to excessive deposition of structurally zzso zzso zzso in affected zzso The accumulated zzso lacks multiple branch points and thus has longer outer branches and poor zzso causing irreversible tissue and organ zzso Although classic zzso IV presents with early onset of zzso with progressive liver zzso zzso IV exhibits extensive clinical zzso with respect to age at onset and zzso in pattern and extent of organ and tissue zzso With the advent of cloning and determination of the zzso structure of the human zzso gene zzso molecular analysis and characterization of underlying zzso zzso is now zzso A variety of zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso gene in zzso IV patients, many of whom presented with diverse clinical zzso zzso zzso and genetic analyses of three unrelated patients suspected to have zzso IV are presented zzso Two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a novel zzso deletion zzso zzso were zzso A variety of zzso in zzso have been previously reported, including zzso and nonsense zzso zzso deletions and zzso and donor and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis is useful in confirming the diagnosis of zzso zzso when higher residual zzso zzso activity levels are seen and zzso analysis is not zzso allows for further determination of potential zzso correlations in this zzso
