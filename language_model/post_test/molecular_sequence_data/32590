zzso are involved in zzso in both zzso cells and the zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso syndrome of zzso both have a zzso domain and a zzso domain that acts on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso growth on liquid medium and on zzso zzso cells are impaired in zzso of zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso is formed and converted to zzso just before closure of the zzso zzso In zzso cells, a zzso cup is formed upon contact with the zzso cell, and zzso is still produced, but the zzso cup does not zzso We suggest that zzso regulates the conversion of zzso to zzso and that this conversion is essential for closure of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso with zzso zzso reveal that zzso zzso zzso is a surprisingly close zzso of human zzso the protein responsible for zzso zzso We expressed human zzso in zzso zzso Growth on bacteria and zzso medium is largely zzso whereas the rate of zzso of zzso cells is partly zzso indicating that human zzso can functionally replace zzso zzso
