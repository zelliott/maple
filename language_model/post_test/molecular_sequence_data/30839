zzso zzso has a single zzso gene that is highly zzso to the zzso family of heat shock zzso Analysis of the cloned and zzso zzso gene has shown that the deduced zzso acid sequence could zzso a protein of zzso zzso that is zzso identical to the zzso protein of zzso coli and zzso identical to the zzso and human zzso protein zzso A partial open reading frame 165 base pairs 3' to the end of zzso encodes a zzso of 190 zzso acids that is 59% identical to zzso of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed a single zzso zzso zzso to the cloned zzso Since the zzso coding region is zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be transcribed as a zzso zzso zzso mapping and primer extension experiments showed that zzso initiated at two sites zzso to the zzso coding zzso A single start site of zzso was identified during heat shock at 42 degrees C, and the predicted promoter sequence zzso to the consensus heat shock promoters of zzso zzso At normal growth temperature (30 degrees zzso a different start site was identified 3' to the heat shock start site that zzso to the zzso coli zzso 70 promoter consensus zzso zzso protection zzso and analysis of expression of the zzso gene fused to the zzso zzso reporter gene showed that expression of zzso is temporally controlled under normal zzso conditions and that zzso occurs just before the initiation of DNA zzso Thus, in both human cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso and in a simple zzso the zzso of a zzso gene is temporally controlled as a function of the cell cycle under normal growth zzso
