zzso is a zzso zzso one of its activities being the growth stimulation of certain zzso T zzso In zzso zzso zzso depending on the genetic background of the host mouse strain, vigorous proliferation of either mainly zzso in resistant zzso mice or zzso zzso T cells in susceptible zzso mice occurs after infection with zzso major zzso zzso Since little is known about the involvement of zzso the possible role of this zzso with regard to its zzso function was evaluated by comparing its presence in the serum and its expression zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in resistant and susceptible zzso To this zzso of zzso zzso mice were tested functionally for zzso In addition the zzso detection of zzso zzso in zzso of mice and measurement of the zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell cultures were zzso We show here that although no functionally active zzso was detected in zzso of both zzso and zzso mice, zzso is produced after in zzso zzso zzso and its zzso was found to be expressed in zzso zzso and zzso during an immune response against zzso zzso Shortly after infection no principal differences in the zzso of zzso expression could be observed, which had its maximum between day 5 and 7 after zzso The rate of production however was higher in the susceptible zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso mice and in mice depleted of zzso T cells no zzso production was zzso in zzso at the level of zzso and no zzso was produced after stimulation with zzso major zzso in zzso Treatment of infected mice with zzso A zzso zzso zzso production when tested in zzso without affecting its production after zzso T cell zzso zzso selected, zzso zzso T cells were fully capable of producing zzso From 4 weeks after infection, zzso synthesis was observed only in zzso mice, zzso with the expansion of zzso zzso type T helper cells in these zzso Treatment of zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso a regimen known to lead to subsequent cure of infected zzso mice, suppressed late zzso zzso
