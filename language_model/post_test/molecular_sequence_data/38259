The wheat gene zzso encodes a zzso protein zzso that belongs to group 3 of the zzso protein zzso family zzso and is zzso by light and zzso and zzso by zzso In order to determine whether or not this particular regulation pattern is general among plant species, we isolated and characterized zzso genes from rice and zzso Two rice zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso 508 and 520 zzso zzso and show, respectively, zzso and zzso sequence similarity to zzso zzso and zzso proteins produced in zzso coli were able to zzso themselves and zzso basic zzso the reaction requiring zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso of zzso were detected in all zzso tested, and amounts were increased upon zzso zzso deprivation and treatment with zzso In contrast, transcripts of zzso were not found in any zzso except in mature leaves at low levels, and did not accumulate under any of the stress conditions zzso A zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein with 518 zzso acids that shows zzso similarity to zzso Its transcripts were zzso expressed in all zzso regardless of light, zzso and zzso status, but were increased upon exposure to low zzso These results indicate that, despite the sequence similarity between their products, genes for zzso proteins are zzso regulated in response to environmental zzso
