zzso liver zzso fatty acid zzso zzso complex consists of 4 zzso of the zzso and 4 zzso of the zzso and has three zzso activities of long chain zzso zzso long chain zzso zzso and long chain zzso zzso The following zzso clones for the rat zzso complex were isolated, zzso and zzso 1) the zzso pair zzso zzso clone had a zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso precursor and a zzso mature zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this zzso revealed that this zzso encodes the zzso and had regions similar to the structure of rat zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso on the zzso side, and a part similar to that of pig zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso in zzso cells yielded a protein with long chain zzso zzso and long chain zzso zzso zzso 2) The zzso zzso clone had a zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso precursor and a zzso mature zzso A high similarity of the structure to zzso zzso and zzso zzso from various sources suggests that this clone encodes the zzso zzso of this zzso in zzso cells yielded a protein with long chain zzso zzso zzso By zzso analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso and zzso with those of other zzso zzso it was suggested that the zzso is a descendant of short chain zzso zzso and short chain zzso zzso while the zzso first zzso from a common zzso gene of the zzso zzso
