The zzso boundary is defined by an zzso repeat element on the Y zzso The zzso element is found on all Y zzso and on no X zzso establishing it as part of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso element, sequences from the X and Y are strictly zzso suggesting that the boundary is formed by an abrupt break in sequence zzso Further investigation of the function of the boundary has been undertaken by examining the population structure of an zzso zzso zzso zzso which is located zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso and zzso chain reaction analysis demonstrate fixation of the high zzso zzso or AT base zzso of zzso on the Y zzso in most zzso while a full range of high zzso zzso is found on the X zzso of different zzso Two exceptions to fixation on the Y zzso were found in African zzso The level of linkage zzso suggests that the first few hundred base pairs of the zzso region on the Y zzso share a single common origin more recent than the origin of the zzso
