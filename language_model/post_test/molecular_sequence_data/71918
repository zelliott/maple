zzso A1 is a recently cloned zzso with high level expression in zzso cells in the zzso However, it is also frequently expressed at high levels in acute zzso zzso To zzso the regulation of zzso A1 gene zzso we cloned and analyzed the zzso structure of zzso zzso It consists of 9 zzso within 13 zzso zzso The zzso promoter zzso zzso from several start sites with the majority of transcripts beginning within a zzso pair zzso A construct containing a zzso from zzso to zzso showed the highest zzso zzso zzso of zzso A1 promoter zzso into zzso zzso cells demonstrated that zzso is essential for the activity of the zzso zzso as well as zzso bound to four zzso boxes between zzso zzso and zzso as observed by gel shift zzso zzso in two or more of the four zzso boxes decreased promoter activity by zzso The promoter was found to be cell zzso with highest activities found in late S and zzso zzso Further analyses suggested that cell cycle regulation was accomplished by periodic repression of the zzso boxes in zzso zzso Taken together, our data show that zzso A1 promoter activity critically depends on four zzso boxes, and members of the zzso family appear to be involved in directing expression of zzso A1 in both a zzso and cell zzso zzso
