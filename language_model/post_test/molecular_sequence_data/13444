zzso zzso zzso the zzso disease virus zzso structural protein precursor zzso together with the zzso zzso which cleave this zzso to zzso zzso and zzso were zzso These zzso were introduced into zzso virus zzso transfer zzso Attempts to isolate zzso zzso zzso expressing these zzso were zzso However, when the zzso cassette was placed under the control of the zzso zzso promoter, stable zzso zzso were zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso (which expresses zzso zzso zzso led to the production of correctly processed zzso zzso zzso Analysis by zzso zzso zzso showed that material which zzso with natural empty zzso particles zzso was zzso zzso zzso revealed empty zzso particles with diameters of about 30 zzso Studies using zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso indicated that the zzso of the synthetic particles was similar to whole zzso and natural empty zzso zzso Surprisingly, merely the modification of a single zzso acid zzso within the zzso consensus sequence at the N zzso of zzso allowed the isolation of a zzso zzso which zzso expressed the correctly processed zzso However, the zzso proteins expressed from this zzso cassette failed to assemble into zzso empty zzso
