The zzso zzso zzso product zzso is a zzso regulator and its expression and function are tightly linked to the cellular entry into S phase and DNA zzso It has been shown zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA, 87, zzso that zzso of zzso proliferation by a zzso zzso zzso is accompanied by zzso of DNA zzso alpha zzso To examine whether the zzso of the DNA zzso alpha gene is directly regulated by zzso we have identified and characterized the zzso regulatory region of the human DNA zzso alpha zzso Two major and several minor zzso start sites were identified by zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis showed that the promoter region contains no zzso box, one zzso box and putative zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso In zzso I zzso the zzso expressed zzso protected six sites in the zzso zzso region of the human DNA zzso alpha zzso However, zzso did not activate the DNA zzso alpha gene promoter in a zzso zzso Our results suggest that an unknown zzso is required for the zzso zzso of the DNA zzso alpha gene promoter, or zzso does not directly activate this zzso
