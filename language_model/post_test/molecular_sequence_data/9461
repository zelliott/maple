In a search for specific molecular markers for population analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 region zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso It was found to exhibit multiple bands and length zzso Surprisingly, single zzso were found to possess between three to five different zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso and two highly variable regions zzso and zzso were found between zzso regions, with repeat units zzso in both types of zzso There were 14 different repeat units, and these were sometimes grouped further into four combinations of repeat units, with a few individual zzso (A or zzso inserted between the zzso Among three geographically dispersed zzso the variable region zzso was divided into eight types, and the variable region zzso was divided into two types based on repeat zzso Most of the 14 repeat units were shared by the variable and the zzso zzso Among the three zzso there were a total of 12 zzso zzso but some of these were shared between zzso such that there were only eight unique zzso The occurrence of multiple zzso within single zzso may be useful for analyzing the population structure, tracking the origin of annual zzso and providing insights into evolutionary biology of this zzso
