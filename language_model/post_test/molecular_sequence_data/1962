zzso is a basic zzso zzso zzso factor expressed in specific regions within the developing brain and spinal cord, sensory zzso and zzso zzso We have identified sequences both zzso and 3' of the mouse zzso gene that function in regulating zzso zzso and each of these sequences contains distinct regulatory zzso for different zzso of the expression zzso zzso for expression in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tube appear redundant and are spread both zzso and 3' of the zzso coding zzso In contrast, a single discrete zzso tube zzso was located in the zzso sequence that is zzso among zzso human, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso is both necessary and sufficient for driving expression of a zzso reporter in transgenic mice specifically to the zzso domain of zzso expression in the spinal neural zzso Thus, sequences are identified that can be used to direct temporally and zzso restricted expression of zzso genes to the developing neural zzso
