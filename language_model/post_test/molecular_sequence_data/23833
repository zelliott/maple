zzso zzso catalyze the exchange of zzso groups between zzso and zzso A zzso These zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are crucial for the zzso of zzso fatty acids in the zzso by enabling their transport across the zzso zzso The activity of zzso is inhibited by zzso a crucial regulatory mechanism for fatty acid zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso has been linked to many serious, even fatal human diseases, and these zzso are promising targets for the development of therapeutic agents against type 2 diabetes and zzso We have determined the crystal structures of zzso zzso alone and in complex with its zzso zzso or zzso The structure contains two zzso Surprisingly, these two zzso share the same backbone fold, which is also similar to that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The active site is located at the interface between the two zzso in a tunnel that extends through the center of the zzso zzso and zzso are bound in this tunnel, on opposite sides of the zzso zzso zzso The structural information provides a molecular basis for understanding the zzso by zzso zzso and for designing their zzso In addition, our structural information suggests that the zzso zzso may assist the zzso by stabilizing the zzso in the reaction zzso
