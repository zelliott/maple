A zzso zzso zzso for a new zzso protein has been cloned and zzso from zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals an open reading frame coding for a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso with a molecular weight of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence exhibited zzso identity to the human cellular zzso zzso The zzso at position 277 in the active site and the putative zzso pocket at zzso zzso of cellular zzso are zzso Such evidence predicts that the zzso protein product is likely to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the in zzso translation products from a synthetic zzso zzso and from total protein of cultured zzso zzso cells revealed a protein with a molecular weight of zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso cells and normal human zzso cells zzso using a cellular zzso probe detected the zzso and zzso zzso species at a relative abundance of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the human cellular zzso zzso was also cloned and zzso to allow comparison to the zzso of zzso reported zzso This new piece gives a full length of zzso zzso zzso zzso for human cellular zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso sequences revealed a very high degree of zzso Beginning with base zzso the sequences diverge showing no zzso The divergence point zzso with known zzso consensus boundaries indicative of alternative zzso
