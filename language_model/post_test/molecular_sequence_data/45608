Alzheimer's disease is characterized by two protein zzso zzso zzso plaques and zzso zzso zzso zzso The primary constituent of zzso is a zzso form of the zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso on over 30 zzso primarily within zzso zzso is associated with zzso changes whose nature is poorly zzso zzso derived from the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso were zzso and the zzso were analyzed for the zzso and zzso zzso CD and zzso data indicate that zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso sequences zzso a zzso change to a type II zzso zzso The largest zzso zzso changes observed by CD were for zzso peptides incorporating zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited ordered values of zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso resulted in the disruption of a nascent zzso These results suggest that global reorganization of zzso may occur upon zzso of zzso sequences in zzso
