zzso between the zzso form of protein zzso 2A zzso and zzso middle T zzso zzso is required for the subsequent assembly of a zzso zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso zzso activity in zzso complex formation, we undertook a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso C zzso Several zzso likely to be involved in the zzso mechanism were identified and zzso The zzso zzso inactive C zzso zzso were then analyzed for their ability to associate with a cellular (B zzso or a viral zzso zzso zzso zzso while all of the inactive zzso were severely impaired in their interaction with B zzso most of these zzso formed complexes with zzso zzso These findings indicate a potential role for these zzso important zzso in complex formation with cellular B zzso but not in complex formation with zzso zzso zzso is known to associate with, and zzso the activity of, several cellular zzso including zzso family zzso To determine whether association of zzso with an active zzso zzso zzso is necessary for subsequent association with zzso zzso inactive C zzso were examined for their ability to form complexes containing zzso in zzso zzso Two zzso inactive C zzso zzso that efficiently formed complexes with zzso also formed complexes that included an active zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso activity is not essential in zzso in zzso complexes for subsequent zzso zzso
