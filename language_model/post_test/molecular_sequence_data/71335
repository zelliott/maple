We have developed a zzso approach, using incremental zzso libraries of overlapping zzso and zzso gene fragments, that examines all possible zzso points within a given region of an zzso that will allow the conversion of a zzso zzso into its functional zzso This general method for zzso zzso will have broad applications in the engineering of new zzso functions through domain swapping and chemical synthesis of modified zzso fragments and in the study of zzso evolution and protein zzso We have tested this methodology on zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and, by genetic selection, identified zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso Two were chosen for physical characterization and were found to be comparable to the zzso zzso zzso in terms of stability to zzso activity, and binding of zzso and zzso zzso analysis of 18 randomly zzso active zzso zzso revealed that the zzso primarily clustered in zzso near the surface of the zzso that the breaks could result in the deletion of highly zzso zzso and, most surprisingly, that the active site could be zzso
