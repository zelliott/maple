The Coral zzso zzso bounded by the Philippines, the Malay Peninsula, and New zzso is the epicenter of marine zzso zzso that explain the source of this rich zzso include 1) the center of origin, 2) the center of zzso and 3) the region of zzso Here we contribute to the debate with a zzso survey of a widely distributed reef fish, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 21 locations (N zzso zzso using DNA sequence data from zzso zzso b and two nuclear zzso zzso hormone and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso structure was significant zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for the three zzso zzso among five zzso French zzso the zzso Pacific zzso Islands to northeastern zzso zzso boundary zzso and zzso zzso eastern Indian Ocean zzso and Christmas zzso and western Indian Ocean zzso Garcia, zzso and zzso A strong signal of isolation by distance was detected in both zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the combined nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso We detected evidence of population expansion with migration toward the zzso Two clusters of zzso were detected in the zzso data zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the Pacific and Indian Oceans, with a low level of zzso observed outside a mixing zone at the zzso zzso 

We conclude that the zzso zzso operating during low sea level associated with zzso defines the primary zzso pattern in this zzso These data support a scenario of isolation on the scale of 105 year glacial cycles, followed by population expansion toward the CT, and overlap of divergent lineages at the zzso zzso This pattern of isolation, zzso and subsequent overlap likely contributes to species richness at the adjacent CT and is consistent with the region of overlap zzso
