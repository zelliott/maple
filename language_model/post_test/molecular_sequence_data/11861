The alternative forms of the zzso protein found in zzso coli DNA zzso III zzso zzso and zzso were zzso from extracts of strains carrying zzso plasmids zzso in their zzso sequences such that they produced only one zzso or the zzso The zzso zzso were used to zzso the zzso and gamma complexes which were characterized by functional zzso The gamma zzso zzso required a zzso excess of DNA zzso III core, beyond zzso levels, for zzso The zzso zzso zzso the gamma complex zzso but could not be used to zzso a zzso with gamma complex and zzso quantities of zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso the DNA zzso III zzso behaves as an zzso zzso it can form only initiation complexes with primed DNA in one-half of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and McHenry, zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso distribution of two products of the zzso zzso gamma and zzso has been zzso to zzso the asymmetry of zzso To provide a direct test for this hypothesis, we zzso zzso containing only the gamma or zzso zzso zzso We observed that, although gamma could function in the presence of zzso and high zzso of DNA zzso III core, it was nearly zzso in the presence of zzso gamma zzso In contrast, zzso zzso behaved exactly like native zzso in the presence of zzso gamma zzso These results zzso zzso as a key component required to zzso zzso with native behavior and show that zzso plays a key role in initiation complex zzso These results also show that gamma is not a necessary zzso since all of the known properties of native zzso can be reproduced with a zzso zzso
