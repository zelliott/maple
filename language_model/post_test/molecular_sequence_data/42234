We report the cloning of a zzso zzso zzso a putative human very low density zzso zzso E zzso zzso The gene zzso this protein was mapped to zzso zzso Northern analysis of human zzso identified zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with most abundant expression in heart and skeletal muscle, followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The pattern of expression generally paralleled that of zzso zzso zzso but differed from that of the low density zzso zzso zzso and the low density zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are members of the same gene zzso zzso zzso message was not detected in liver, whereas zzso for both LDL zzso and zzso were found in zzso zzso In mouse zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso was induced during the transformation of the cells into zzso zzso was also detected in human zzso cells, suggesting that at least part of the expression observed in zzso may be in zzso cells which would be exposed to maternal zzso zzso in brain may be related to high levels of zzso expression in that organ, an observation of potential relevance to the recently hypothesized role for zzso in late onset zzso zzso Our results suggest that the putative zzso zzso could play a role in the zzso of zzso zzso particles by specific zzso including zzso and cardiac muscle and zzso tissue and in the transport of maternal lipids across the zzso The findings presented here, together with recent observations from other laboratories, bring up the possibility that a single zzso the zzso zzso may play a role in the zzso of certain forms of zzso zzso disease, and zzso
