Recently, the zzso zzso zzso which is generated by the gene responsible for spinal muscular zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Surprisingly, the zzso transcript includes the entire sequence of zzso zzso zzso We had expected a high frequency of zzso zzso at a zzso tract in this zzso since simple repetitive sequence motifs are prone to zzso Such zzso could change the zzso structure of the zzso zzso However, our study showed that almost all individuals, including healthy individuals, zzso patients and zzso patients, carried only zzso with a normal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tract in zzso zzso 3 suggests the existence of zzso mechanisms preventing zzso to the open reading frame of zzso zzso and not allowing zzso in the protein structure of zzso
