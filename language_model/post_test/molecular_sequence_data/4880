The energetic contribution of seven zzso acids in the d position of a zzso zzso zzso coiled zzso structure was measured by determining the zzso zzso The d position contains the zzso zzso found in the zzso zzso We used a natural zzso protein as our zzso system that remains zzso when a single d position is zzso We have determined the zzso stability, monitored by circular zzso of 14 proteins which indicate that zzso is zzso zzso zzso per zzso less stabilizing than zzso The similarly sized zzso acid zzso is zzso zzso zzso per zzso less stabilizing than zzso suggesting that zzso is zzso Model building indicates that the zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso in the d position produced zzso clashes between the zzso zzso groups when placed in the favored zzso zzso The stabilization by zzso in different d positions is zzso it varies by over 2 zzso zzso in the two positions zzso The order of stabilization is zzso M, I, zzso C, A, and zzso zzso in the d position can form a zzso bond which zzso the coiled zzso
