Gene fusion has been used to produce the zzso domain of an zzso zzso DNA sequences coding for the 52 zzso zzso acids of the zzso zzso from human zzso including the zzso acid zzso tail, were fused to the zzso specifying the zzso domain zzso of rat zzso zzso The fusion protein was expressed in zzso coli and zzso in one step on zzso making use of the zzso activity of the zzso The tail zzso was released from the fusion protein using zzso zzso This method provides an alternative to chemical synthesis for the production of zzso zzso
