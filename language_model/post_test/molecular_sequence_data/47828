The three-dimensional solution zzso of an zzso zzso analogue of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso has been determined using two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso The zzso loop region zzso and the zzso tail zzso are connected by a flexible hinge formed near zzso and the zzso backbone zzso for the former and the latter are zzso and zzso A, zzso zzso zzso with the structure of zzso zzso shows that the two share an essentially identical fold in the common first zzso loop region zzso However, the absence of the second zzso loop in zzso results in zzso motion of the zzso half, causing the key zzso zzso selectivity zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso to lose its native spatial zzso The combined features of structural zzso in the zzso loop and a mobile zzso tail appear to be responsible for the activity of zzso as a competitive zzso against native zzso zzso surface potential comparisons of the first zzso region of zzso with other zzso or zzso states of zzso and zzso show a common protruding surface that may serve as the minimal binding zzso for the zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso On the basis of the original zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Scott, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Cruz, zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we propose a revised binding model which incorporates these zzso
