zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso factors involved in the development of the zzso zzso have been identified in a minority of patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In a zzso cohort of 170 Czech zzso and adolescent patients with zzso zzso including zzso zzso or zzso zzso hypothyroidism, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were directly zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso screening was performed in all 170 patients by zzso zzso zzso followed by direct sequencing of samples with abnormal zzso The zzso zzso zzso was functionally characterized by DNA binding zzso 

We identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso inherited in a zzso pedigree and leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with gradual zzso zzso of the zzso size and zzso The zzso zzso zzso results in the substitution of a highly zzso zzso of the zzso domain with a zzso zzso 

The very low frequency of genetic defects in a zzso cohort of children affected by zzso zzso and zzso hypothyroidism, even in a zzso screening study, suggests the zzso role of either zzso genetic mechanisms or the involvement of genes unknown so zzso Identification of a novel zzso zzso in a particular zzso of zzso zzso zzso indicates a key function of zzso in the zzso growth and functional maintenance of the zzso zzso
