zzso processes are governed by diverse regulatory mechanisms including a suite of signaling pathways employing zzso zzso With the advent of large-scale zzso it is now possible to identify thousands of zzso sites from zzso at distinct zzso zzso We describe here the identification of over zzso zzso zzso sites from zzso zzso zzso When compared to nearly three times the number of zzso sites identified from zzso zzso brain, remarkably one-third of the zzso sites were zzso This fraction only dropped to one-quarter when allowing the site to stray plus or minus 15 zzso This provides evidence for considerable change in the profiles of zzso regulated zzso Using quantitative zzso we characterized a novel zzso site zzso identified uniquely in the zzso brain on zzso zzso a protein essential for proper zzso brain zzso While the relative levels of zzso and zzso zzso between embryonic and zzso brain were similar, their levels fell zzso by zzso day 21, as did zzso a site required for proper zzso zzso Both sites lie near the zzso domain and may provide functionally similar regulation via different zzso
