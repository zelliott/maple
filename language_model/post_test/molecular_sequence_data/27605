Type VI zzso prepared from zzso extracts of human zzso contains very little zzso material, the major forms being zzso and zzso In order to study the orientation of the molecules in these zzso they were zzso with zzso followed by bacterial zzso Two fragments were isolated, one containing part of the inner zzso domain still attached to part of the triple zzso and the other containing large fragments of the outer zzso zzso Each fraction was further zzso peptides were isolated and their zzso zzso acid sequences zzso By comparing the determined sequences with published data, it was found that the outer zzso domain contained sequences derived from the zzso domain of all three chains of type VI collagen whereas the inner zzso domain contained sequences from the zzso zzso This provided direct chemical evidence that zzso and zzso of type VI collagen are formed by overlapping zzso regions of the zzso
