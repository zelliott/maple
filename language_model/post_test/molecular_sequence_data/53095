We have studied the relationship between zzso acid sequence and zzso specificity in a DNA zzso family by characterizing zzso the specificity of four new members of the zzso We show that principal component analysis zzso of the sequence family correctly predicts the zzso specificity of one of the novel zzso even though conventional sequence analysis methods fail to group this zzso with other sequences of the same zzso zzso also suggested, correctly, that another zzso characterized previously differs in its specificity from those sequences with which it clusters by conventional zzso These results suggest that principal component analysis of sequence families can be a useful tool in zzso zzso sequences when there is ambiguity concerning which zzso a new zzso belongs zzso Published 2000 zzso zzso
