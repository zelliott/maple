zzso resistance to various drugs was investigated in zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso Drug zzso were transferred via plasmids of 100, 50, and 40 zzso Resistance to zzso zzso was transferred on plasmids of all 3 zzso The zzso gene zzso was cloned from the 50 zzso plasmids zzso and zzso transferred from zzso zzso zzso zzso strains isolated in different years and places in zzso zzso localized the cat to within zzso zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso sequences of the coding and zzso region of the cat were determined as zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso which corresponded with the sequence from zzso 40 to zzso in zzso The zzso sequences identified an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of about zzso zzso a size consistent with the molecular mass of known cat gene products, and the zzso had maximum zzso zzso with a Type II zzso zzso from zzso zzso
