zzso C has two apparently zzso cellular zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso While a role of the zzso and zzso C in the assembly of the zzso and zzso zzso has been established for zzso cells, the existence of a comparable function for zzso C in zzso remains zzso zzso possesses two zzso c zzso zzso and zzso We show that only zzso is required for zzso zzso in an zzso process during zzso zzso whereas zzso is required for zzso in the zzso However, both zzso C proteins can function zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and the difference in their genetic requirements can be attributed to differential expression in the zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso zzso Ark zzso and zzso zzso are also required for the proper removal of bulk zzso during zzso Finally, several zzso that block zzso zzso during zzso were isolated in a genetic screen, including zzso with defects in zzso zzso zzso These observations establish a role for the zzso in zzso zzso during zzso
