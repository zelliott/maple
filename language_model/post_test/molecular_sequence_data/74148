The zzso zzso peptides zzso from the egg jelly bind to their zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso on the tail to activate zzso in sea zzso zzso are produced as single peptides and then zzso into shorter zzso zzso zzso is followed by the zzso reaction, which is zzso zzso In order to investigate the molecular details of the zzso interaction, corresponding zzso have been zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso identity were found from the deduced zzso acid sequences in zzso and its zzso zzso zzso respectively, across all species zzso The zzso tree zzso for zzso and its zzso was similar to that of the zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso In spite of a certain zzso the zzso acid sequences exhibited zzso Conservation was found in the zzso zzso involved in zzso bonding and zzso zzso zzso similarities were detected between potential zzso sites and the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso and its zzso share certain common zzso they may serve as barriers that ensure zzso in the sea star zzso zzso and closely related zzso
