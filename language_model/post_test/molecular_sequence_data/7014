The 26 S zzso is a zzso zzso required for zzso zzso Recently, we identified a zzso zzso zzso of this zzso that binds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now isolated, zzso and expressed a zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso of the 26 S zzso The zzso protein does not bind zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that two zzso of the 26 S zzso have apparent molecular masses of 50 zzso zzso specific for the zzso protein recognize the more basic of the two zzso zzso whereas the more zzso zzso zzso binds zzso zzso Thus, the 26 S zzso contains at least two distinct zzso with apparent molecular masses of 50 zzso
