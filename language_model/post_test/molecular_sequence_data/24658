We report a previously zzso complexity to the ecology of rabies in zzso zzso zzso zzso in spotted zzso the most numerous large zzso in the zzso zzso zzso East zzso revealed a high frequency of exposure of zzso to rabies virus, and reverse zzso zzso zzso demonstrated rabies zzso in zzso of zzso Despite this high frequency, exposure neither caused symptomatic rabies nor decreased survival among members of zzso social groups monitored for 9 to 13 zzso zzso intermittent presence of virus in saliva of zzso of zzso zzso indicated a zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso differed significantly zzso sequence zzso from those isolated from other zzso zzso suggesting that at least two separate strains circulate within the zzso zzso zzso This finding is consistent with the fact that exposure in zzso increased with age and social status, following a pattern predicted by zzso age and zzso oral and bite contact zzso High zzso of zzso low basic zzso rate of the virus zzso of zzso a carrier state, and the absence of symptomatic rabies in a zzso in an zzso with zzso and zzso maintenance has not been previously demonstrated for zzso Because of the substantial differences between the zzso viral zzso and those from zzso and zzso in the zzso it is unlikely that spotted zzso were the source of rabies virus that killed several African wild dog packs in the zzso zzso in the zzso
