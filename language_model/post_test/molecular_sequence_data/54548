The zzso factor zzso plays an important role in cellular zzso transformation and zzso In this study, we report a novel human zzso zzso zzso name: zzso zzso which encodes a zzso protein that can inhibit zzso zzso activity via zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes a protein of 251 zzso zzso which is a classical zzso zzso zzso investigation reveals that zzso of zzso significantly inhibit zzso activity and zzso zzso Further investigation indicated that zzso of zzso significantly inhibit zzso activity of zzso and zzso but not zzso As for the upstream of signaling zzso of zzso our study demonstrated that zzso of zzso significantly zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso These results clearly indicate that zzso is a novel member of the zzso family and zzso zzso zzso activity via zzso zzso
