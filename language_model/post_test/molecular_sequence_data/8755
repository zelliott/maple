The zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we zzso a combination of random zzso zzso genetic screening in a zzso zzso zzso strain, and zzso analysis in zzso zzso to identify strong modifications in zzso selectivity of the inward zzso zzso channel zzso zzso at position 256 was replaced by 11 other zzso acid zzso Six of these zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso strain at low zzso of zzso Among these, two zzso zzso and zzso showed a sensitivity of zzso growth toward high ammonium zzso and a dramatic increase in current zzso of zzso and ammonium zzso relative to zzso by zzso These single site zzso gave rise to zzso and zzso channels with zzso and zzso currents that were approximately zzso greater in zzso than zzso zzso whereas the zzso to zzso current zzso ratio of wild type zzso was zzso This strong conversion in zzso specificity without loss of general selectivity exceeds those reported for other zzso in the pore domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso growth was greatly impaired by sodium in two other zzso at this site zzso and zzso which were blocked by zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso although the wild type channel was not blocked by 110 zzso zzso Interestingly, the ability of zzso to grow in the presence of toxic zzso correlated to zzso properties of zzso zzso illustrating the potential for qualitative zzso channel zzso selection in zzso These data suggest that the size of the side chain of the zzso acid at position 256 in zzso is important for enabling zzso zzso and that this site plays a crucial role in determining the zzso selectivity of zzso zzso zzso
