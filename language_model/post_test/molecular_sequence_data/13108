We have obtained a series of fragments growing from the N zzso of the protein zzso zzso zzso in order to study the development of structure on zzso of the zzso in zzso We present an extensive zzso characterization of ten fragments using different zzso zzso Small fragments up to zzso 40 of the zzso protein are zzso zzso zzso has non-native local zzso zzso but nevertheless does not bind zzso zzso zzso regions in longer fragments become gradually more capable of binding zzso as the chain grows to zzso with a tendency to form native zzso Major changes in secondary structure and accessibility to zzso sites occur in zzso between zzso and zzso together with changes in zzso volume and zzso zzso studies of zzso the first zzso displaying zzso zzso show that a zzso is fully formed and the zzso zzso 12 to 24) is of fluctuating zzso zzso zzso and zzso share many properties with molten zzso structures, with varying degrees or zzso Fluorescence properties of the native fold are gradually recovered from fragments zzso to full-length zzso together with a decrease in zzso zzso A small degree of zzso of formation of structure appears when zzso 60 is added, gradually increasing as zzso 62 is added, but a full two-state zzso transition appears only on addition of zzso and zzso We believe this is the result of correct zzso packing of the zzso core, capping the major elements of secondary structure in zzso at this late stage, which is zzso by the complete recovery of the zzso of the unique zzso The structures that develop as the zzso chain increases in length parallel the structural features present in the nucleus for the folding of intact zzso which develops in the transition zzso The folding nucleus consists of much of the zzso and the interactions made by zzso in the zzso with zzso in the core, especially with zzso and zzso with the rest of the structure being formed only very zzso in the transition zzso
