The zzso immune system has zzso mechanisms, both cellular and zzso that destroy the membrane integrity of target zzso The main zzso molecules of these zzso zzso used by killer zzso and the membrane attack complex zzso components of the complement zzso a unique module called the zzso zzso Until now, both zzso zzso and the zzso module have been reported only in zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of a protein containing the zzso module from the zzso zzso zzso ( zzso zzso using expressed sequence tag zzso analysis of the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this zzso is most similar to the primary structure of human complement component zzso and is designated zzso zzso shares a unique modular structure, including the zzso zzso with human zzso and other MAC zzso Another zzso clone predicts the presence of a zzso protein with the closest structural similarity to zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso retains most of the functionally important zzso of zzso zzso and is shown by zzso analysis to be derived directly from the common zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Only zzso activity has been assigned to the zzso complement system until zzso zzso this is the first molecular evidence for zzso zzso zzso in zzso
