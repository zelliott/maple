zzso of the zzso family have been implicated in zzso guidance in both zzso zzso and zzso Here, we report the cloning and expression analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the floor plate and the anterior zzso neural zzso Its expression is zzso induced by zzso of sonic zzso zzso and a dominant negative zzso of the regulatory zzso of protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso however, is restricted to distinct regions in the zzso Upon zzso of zzso or zzso in zzso zzso which have strongly impaired zzso expression in the zzso neural tube, rescue of zzso expression was observed in the brain but not in the spinal zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso protein can be detected at high levels throughout injected zzso from zzso stages zzso suggesting that the competence of the neural plate to respond to zzso zzso activity differs zzso Similar to zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is also expressed along the zzso neural tube, is zzso induced in the brain of zzso injected with zzso zzso zzso differentiate normally within zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso differentiation appears to be unaffected despite zzso of a gene program specific for the zzso neural zzso This also suggests that these zzso expressing regions have not differentiated into floor zzso
