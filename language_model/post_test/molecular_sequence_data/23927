The replication checkpoint is activated when replication zzso are zzso by DNA zzso or protein complexes bound to DNA or when DNA synthesis is restrained by the limited availability of zzso This checkpoint preserves zzso integrity by stabilizing stalled zzso and delaying the onset of zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a replication checkpoint zzso protein that allows the sensor zzso zzso to activate the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso associates with replication zzso and zzso with the DNA replication protein zzso Whether or not zzso interacts directly with DNA is zzso Here we define a approximately 150 zzso acid DNA binding domain zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso The zzso interacts zzso with zzso DNA structures in zzso zzso of the zzso or point zzso that diminish its DNA binding activity render cells sensitive to the replication inhibitor zzso These zzso also impair the replication checkpoint zzso The zzso has a zzso motif that is predicted to bind zzso This motif is zzso in the recently identified zzso zzso of human zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
