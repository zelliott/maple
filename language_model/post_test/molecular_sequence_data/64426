zzso occur in the whole animal kingdom, from the least evolved zzso with a very simple nervous system zzso to the highest zzso and are involved in most, if not all, zzso processes in zzso Knowing the zzso acid sequence of zzso hormones or zzso is important since this allows for synthesis of large quantities of peptides to perform further functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso can then provide information on the zzso and spatial distribution and zzso of the zzso Ever since the 1970s, a wealth of peptides has been discovered and investigated and this flow seems to be far from zzso This is partially due to the use of new approaches mainly based on zzso zzso as well as molecular biological zzso Surprisingly, peptides have so far been neglected in most zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso projects has opened new opportunities for rapid identification and functional analysis of zzso as zzso In zzso with the zzso technology, where all proteins expressed in a cell or tissue are zzso the zzso approach aims at the simultaneous zzso and identification of the whole zzso of a cell or zzso zzso all expressed peptides with their zzso modifications zzso This technology provides us with a fast and efficient tool to analyze the peptides from any zzso This paper reviews the approaches that have been used so far to achieve zzso
