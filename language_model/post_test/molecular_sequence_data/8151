The sequence of zzso toxin 1 zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The central part, zzso zzso is rich in zzso zzso zzso which is a characteristic of zzso zzso zzso started to inhibit zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso of zzso brain zzso all five zzso zzso at about 1 zzso and to zzso from pig heart muscle zzso zzso zzso at about 1 zzso zzso of zzso zzso to heart was inhibited with an zzso of 14 zzso and to brain in two zzso In the first step zzso zzso 32 zzso binding decreased by zzso indicating that the toxin acted on zzso or zzso zzso each accounting for about zzso of total zzso zzso The second step was similar to the effect on zzso zzso inhibited binding of zzso to brain receptors with an zzso of zzso zzso corresponding to a Ki of about 6 zzso Literature values of Ki for zzso are zzso zzso for zzso and zzso or zzso 120 zzso for other zzso This indicates binding to zzso zzso zzso for other zzso This indicates binding to zzso zzso zzso bound to brain with a zzso of 20 zzso and a Hill zzso of zzso zzso one toxin zzso per zzso In guinea-pig zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a rapid contraction, zzso by zzso The toxin may be an zzso but might also cause contraction by inducing zzso release by a different zzso
