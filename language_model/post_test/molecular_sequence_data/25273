In women who are zzso for a genetic disease, genetic analysis of the first polar body allows the identification of zzso that contain the maternal unaffected zzso These zzso can be zzso and transferred to the mother without risk of establishing a pregnancy with a genetically abnormal zzso We have demonstrated that removal of the first polar body has no effect on subsequent zzso rates or embryonic growth to the zzso zzso We have developed a zzso technique to successfully analyze the zzso type Z and zzso type M zzso of zzso zzso and applied this technique for a couple at risk for zzso type zzso zzso zzso After standard zzso treatment to stimulate multiple zzso development, eight zzso were zzso zzso Polar bodies were removed by zzso from seven zzso and zzso occurred in six zzso zzso analysis was successful in five zzso One was zzso type M, two were zzso type Z and two were zzso zzso due to crossing zzso zzso from the two zzso containing the unaffected gene zzso body zzso type zzso were transferred in the same cycle 48 h after zzso No pregnancy was zzso The accuracy of the polar body diagnosis was confirmed by zzso chain reaction zzso analysis of an zzso that failed to zzso
