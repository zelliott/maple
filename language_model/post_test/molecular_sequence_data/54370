zzso zzso protein zzso 2 zzso plays a key role in the plant stress zzso zzso zzso via zzso Here, a zzso member of common zzso zzso was cloned and zzso Southern zzso analysis suggested that the common wheat zzso contains three copies of zzso zzso zzso showed the presence of zzso in the cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso patterns revealed that zzso is expressed strongly in roots, and responds to zzso zzso zzso and cold stress, but not to zzso acid zzso application, suggesting that zzso might participate in zzso signal zzso zzso zzso was transferred to zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is involved in zzso zzso decreasing zzso potential, enhancing zzso II activity, and promoting root zzso Its zzso results in enhanced tolerance to zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso regulatory factor in plants, and has the potential to be zzso in transgenic breeding to improve zzso stress tolerance in crop zzso
