The genetic relationships among 1,300 zzso of zzso coli representing 16 zzso associated with enteric disease, including zzso strains recovered from patients with zzso colitis and zzso zzso syndrome and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso many of which were isolated originally from infants with zzso were estimated from zzso variation among 20 zzso genes detected by zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso types were observed among zzso of each zzso with zzso of the same O zzso differing on average at zzso of the zzso zzso Comparisons of the zzso zzso profiles revealed that zzso of the zzso belong to 15 major zzso types, each of which zzso to a bacterial clone with a wide geographic zzso zzso the zzso clone is most closely related to a clone of zzso strains that has long been associated with worldwide outbreaks of infantile zzso We propose that the new pathogen emerged when an zzso zzso already possessing a mechanism for adherence to zzso cells, acquired secondary zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso via horizontal transfer and zzso
