zzso zzso a zzso produced by several zzso species, is a worldwide contaminant of food and zzso The zzso zzso variable zzso zzso zzso was produced in zzso zzso zzso The variable regions of the heavy chain zzso and light chain zzso cloned from the zzso zzso were connected with a flexible zzso using an overlap extension zzso chain zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the zzso zzso was a member of the zzso III gene family zzso zzso and the zzso gene belonged to the zzso gene family II zzso zzso efforts to express the functional zzso zzso in zzso coli have been made by using gene fusion and zzso zzso zzso of the molecular zzso zzso allowed soluble expression of the zzso The zzso zzso fused with zzso zzso at the zzso was zzso by immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced in this manner was characterized for its zzso zzso Its biological affinity as zzso was measured by surface zzso resonance zzso analysis and proved to be significant but weaker than that of the whole zzso zzso
