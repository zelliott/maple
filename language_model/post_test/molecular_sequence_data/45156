A significant body of evidence has been accumulated that demonstrates decisive roles of members of the zzso network in the control of various aspects of cell behavior, including zzso zzso and zzso The components of this network serve as zzso zzso Mad family members, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso function in part as zzso of zzso zzso At the molecular level this antagonism is reflected by the different zzso zzso complexes that are recruited by zzso and Mad family zzso One important function of the latter is their ability to repress gene zzso In this review we zzso the current view of how this repression is achieved and what the consequences of Mad action are for cell zzso In addition, we point out some of the many aspects that have not been clarified and thus leave us with a rather incomplete picture of the functions, both molecular and at the cellular level, of Mad family zzso
