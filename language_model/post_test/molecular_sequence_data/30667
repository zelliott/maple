The protein components that direct and activate accurate zzso by rat zzso zzso I were studied in extracts of zzso zzso zzso zzso A minimum of at least two zzso besides zzso zzso I, that are necessary for efficient zzso of templates were zzso The first factor, rat zzso is required for zzso recognition of the rat zzso zzso I promoter and may be sufficient to direct zzso by pure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed the zzso of templates deleted to zzso the zzso boundary of the core promoter element zzso being the zzso initiation zzso The second factor, zzso increased the efficiency of template zzso zzso of deletion zzso indicated that the zzso boundary of the domain required for zzso lay between zzso and zzso zzso using block substitution zzso confirmed and extended these zzso zzso experiments using those zzso demonstrated that two regions within the upstream promoter element were required for optimal levels of zzso in zzso The first region was centered on zzso zzso and zzso The zzso boundary of the second domain mapped to between zzso zzso and zzso zzso footprint experiments using highly zzso zzso indicated that zzso bound between zzso and zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso did not affect the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso levels of zzso by zzso zzso I may require only zzso and the core promoter zzso However, higher zzso levels are zzso by additional interactions of zzso and possibly zzso bound to zzso promoter zzso
