zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the hot springs within the zzso geothermal area of zzso The strains of zzso zzso produce zzso zzso have an optimum growth temperature of about 55 degrees C, and have higher levels of zzso fatty acids than the strains of the other species of the zzso zzso These zzso unlike all other strains of the species of the zzso zzso examined zzso required zzso zzso or zzso for growth in liquid zzso zzso but not in the corresponding medium solidified with zzso Several strains belonging to zzso zzso isolated from zzso also required reduced sulfur compounds for growth in liquid zzso leading to the hypothesis that this requirement is not a zzso characteristic of the new zzso The new species represented by strains zzso and zzso can be distinguished from the other species of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso values, and zzso zzso DNA zzso The type strain for zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
