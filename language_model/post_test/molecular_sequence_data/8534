A panel of zzso clones was generated that was specific for zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso stress zzso All the clones were found to express a member of the V beta 5 family, as defined by zzso However, the clones could be differentiated on the basis of different zzso characteristics with the zzso zzso This zzso is known to recognize both V beta zzso and V beta zzso as was the zzso primer pair used in the zzso zzso of the zzso revealed that those clones which were not stained by zzso expressed a previously unidentified member of the V beta 5 zzso By comparing the sequences of the V beta 5 family members that are recognized by zzso with those that are not, we were able to identify a probable zzso for the zzso It is also clear from our data that the zzso of T cells recognizing identical zzso combinations, although very similar, may be differentiated by zzso thereby posing potential problems in any proposed disease therapy involving treatment with zzso
