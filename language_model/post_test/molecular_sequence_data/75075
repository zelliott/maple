The ability of the ultraviolet zzso zzso technique to detect zzso has been investigated in zzso Two basic types of zzso a phased zzso and a phased zzso containing a phased zzso zzso have been zzso onto a cloned zzso zzso zzso gene from sea zzso The zzso interactions in each complex have been zzso with zzso III, zzso I, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Whereas zzso I and zzso III readily detect interactions between zzso and DNA, zzso light and zzso zzso do zzso In contrast to zzso zzso we demonstrate that intimate zzso contacts between the same sea zzso zzso DNA and the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso are readily detected with zzso zzso Since the sensitivity of zzso light for zzso contacts is similar to its sensitivity for other regulatory zzso zzso these studies demonstrate the feasibility of using zzso light to selectively zzso regulatory zzso interactions in zzso with little or no interference from zzso zzso
