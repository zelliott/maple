Three Type VI zzso System zzso zzso called zzso to zzso coexist in zzso zzso zzso targets zzso cells whereas zzso mediates interactions with both zzso and zzso host zzso Little is known about the third system, except that it may be connected to zzso during the host zzso Here we show that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We demonstrate that the two putative zzso zzso called zzso and zzso are zzso with zzso by the Las and zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso factor has divergent effects on the three zzso As for many zzso zzso activates the expression of zzso zzso However, zzso unexpectedly zzso the expression of zzso right and also zzso zzso and zzso are putative zzso binding proteins zzso on zzso and zzso zzso In other zzso zzso can act as zzso zzso to promote zzso zzso zzso we found that the zzso effects of zzso are zzso while the zzso zzso repression of zzso is zzso This is the first example of zzso repression of a zzso being zzso by a zzso zzso
