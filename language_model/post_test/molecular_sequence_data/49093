zzso zzso sequencing projects for several important zzso within the zzso zzso were undertaken for the purpose of gene zzso Included were several zzso of medical importance zzso zzso zzso zzso and others of veterinary importance zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso deposited into zzso were included in the zzso The resulting sequences have been clustered into zzso gene zzso and deposited into a zzso database that supports a variety of sequence and text zzso This database has been used to compare the gene zzso using zzso similarity comparisons to the public protein databases to identify putative zzso Of these new entries, approximately zzso represent putative zzso with a conservative zzso of p zzso zzso thus identifying many zzso genes that are likely to share common functions with other well-studied zzso Gene zzso were also used to identify strain zzso examine zzso zzso and identify gene zzso An interesting class of genes that are confined to members of this zzso and not shared by plants, animals, or zzso was zzso These genes likely mediate the novel biological features of members of the zzso and hence offer great potential for biological investigation and as possible therapeutic zzso
