zzso are a diverse group of proteins carrying one or more zzso side chains linked to the protein as zzso Our appreciation of these structures has matured from a curiosity about unusual structural zzso to zzso upon them a central role in cell zzso The major classes of zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The latter is unique in that it does not contain zzso zzso and appears to be zzso at least sometimes, free of a carrier zzso There is now a wealth of information on the ability of these structures to influence the growth and development of cells and zzso Many direct and specific effects of zzso will undoubtedly be found, and there are likely to be indirect effects of the zzso relating to their zzso zzso zzso arguments that biological activity resides in certain zzso core proteins are also zzso The following discussion concerns the role of zzso in the regulation and action of zzso and zzso growth factors, direct zzso and zzso actions of zzso the role of these structures in regulating gene zzso and the biological activities of zzso core zzso The probable role of zzso in normal zzso cell function, and in progressive zzso disease, will be presented as a harbinger of the significant role we can expect them to play in diagnosis and therapy in the near zzso
