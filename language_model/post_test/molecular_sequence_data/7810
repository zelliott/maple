zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso attachment of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of a number of zzso proteins involved in cellular growth and signal zzso The zzso gene is essential for zzso growth of zzso zzso Studies were carried out to determine if zzso is also essential for zzso growth of the zzso fungus zzso zzso A strain of zzso zzso was constructed in which one copy of zzso was partially deleted and zzso A zzso zzso was introduced into the second zzso zzso This zzso produced marked reductions in zzso efficiency at 24 and 37 degrees C, as judged by in zzso kinetic studies of the zzso and zzso zzso which had been expressed in, and zzso from, zzso zzso The growth characteristics of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were assessed under a variety of zzso Only the zzso zzso strain required zzso for zzso This was true at both 24 and 37 degrees zzso zzso could not substitute for zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells at 37 degrees C in the absence of zzso resulted in cell death as observed by the inability to form colonies on media supplemented with 500 zzso zzso Studies in an zzso model of zzso zzso infection revealed that the zzso zzso strain produced zzso zzso within 7 d after intravenous administration while the zzso zzso zzso strain produced no deaths even after 21 zzso These observations establish that zzso is essential for zzso growth of zzso zzso and suggest that zzso of this zzso may be zzso useful zzso zzso
