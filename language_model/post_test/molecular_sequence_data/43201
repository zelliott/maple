The zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to contain at least six DNA replication zzso in the zzso region of the zzso By using a zzso DNA probe for the consensus zzso sequence and zzso zzso conditions, several additional minor zzso bands were zzso DNA corresponding to the most intense of these bands was cloned and zzso Although localized in the zzso region, it could not bind zzso and possibly represents a zzso zzso A search of the zzso database identified an additional zzso sequence in the zzso region, near zzso It was shown to bind zzso and to function in blocking replication fork movement in a polar zzso Its orientation zzso to the replication fork trap arrangement of the other zzso The zzso zzso experiments failed to identify any zzso zzso zzso in the region of the zzso where zzso control sequences zzso zzso are known to zzso The two most likely zzso in zzso site regions, in terms of sequence similarity to zzso region zzso were identified through sequence zzso They were zzso and were found not to bind zzso under conditions that allowed binding to zzso region zzso Neither did they elicit fork arrest, when present in a zzso under stringent zzso It is concluded that the zzso site zzso at least the first two to the left of zzso do not have the typical consensus zzso site makeup of zzso region zzso
