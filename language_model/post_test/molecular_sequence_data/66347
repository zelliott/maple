The zzso zzso zzso is known to have two different zzso zzso gene zzso This study confirms the presence of two zzso zzso and describes their zzso One zzso zzso was found to be located downstream from zzso and the other zzso was found downstream from zzso The promoter regions were zzso and also the zzso transcribed zzso zzso and zzso regions separating the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene coding zzso Analysis of the zzso fraction revealed that zzso is regulated by two zzso and zzso promoters and zzso is regulated by one zzso These data show that the two zzso zzso of zzso zzso are organized in the same way as the two zzso zzso of classical fast-growing zzso This information was incorporated into a zzso analysis of the zzso based on both zzso zzso gene sequences and (where zzso the number of zzso zzso per zzso The results suggest that the ancestral zzso possessed two zzso and zzso zzso per zzso and that zzso on two separate occasions, an zzso zzso was lost, leading to two clusters of species having a single zzso zzso one cluster includes the classical pathogens and the other includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso
