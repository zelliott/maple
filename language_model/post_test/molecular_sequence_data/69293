A human zzso zzso zzso zzso has been created from a rat zzso clone by a single zzso zzso reaction and expressed in good yield in zzso zzso The zzso has been zzso to zzso and kinetic identity to the naturally occurring zzso has been zzso zzso has also been zzso and the crystal structure was solved using zzso A data that was refined to an R value of zzso The structure described in this report represents the first complete structural characterization of this important human zzso
