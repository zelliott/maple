Major zzso complex zzso class I molecules are zzso zzso that bind peptides and present them to T zzso The formation of a zzso complex is the initial step in specific, T zzso immune zzso But, unlike other zzso systems, peptides are essential for a stable zzso of the zzso zzso To investigate the contribution of every zzso acid of zzso to the stability and zzso integrity of zzso zzso complex zzso libraries with one defined zzso acid and zzso of 19 zzso acids in the remaining seven positions were zzso and tested for their capacity to stabilize the zzso of the mouse zzso class I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were employed in this zzso zzso acid preferences found for the eight sequence positions reveal constitutional, zzso and zzso constraints that govern zzso selection by zzso zzso The pattern of zzso acid preferences indicates that the peptides behave as integral parts of the zzso proteins and follow rules established for the zzso of primary sequence and the zzso and stability of proteins in zzso
