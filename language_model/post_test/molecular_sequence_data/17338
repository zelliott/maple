Martha's Vineyard, zzso has been the site of two outbreaks of zzso zzso and zzso Although most patients from both outbreaks presented with zzso disease and although zzso transmission has been suggested, the bite of a dog tick and exposure to rabbits remain the only proven modes of zzso The factors that zzso the zzso outbreaks or the zzso zzso of human risk remain zzso We sought to test the hypothesis that the ongoing outbreak is due to a recent introduction event as opposed to amplification of a cryptic zzso zzso From zzso we collected zzso dog ticks and tested them in pools for evidence of zzso by zzso We then measured the genetic diversity of zzso zzso by using zzso zzso tandem repeat zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso in dog ticks averaged zzso From 29 positive pools, we identified 10 unique zzso which was an unexpectedly large degree of diversity zzso index zzso zzso This degree of genetic diversity is inconsistent with a recent introduction zzso We conclude that there has been long-standing zzso transmission of zzso on the zzso
