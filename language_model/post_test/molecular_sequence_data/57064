The structure and expression of the zzso serum zzso P component zzso and zzso protein zzso have been investigated in the guinea zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso from animals in which acute inflammation had been induced by zzso injection of zzso established that neither zzso or zzso is a major acute phase zzso in the guinea zzso zzso clones of zzso and zzso were isolated and zzso and the gene and the derived protein sequences were compared with other zzso zzso Both genes have organizations typical of the zzso genes of other species, but some differences were defined in the regions that potentially determine the capacity of the zzso gene to be induced during acute zzso zzso zzso in coding regions have occurred at similar rates in the two zzso zzso zzso substitution rates indicate that zzso and zzso are subject to similar, relatively low levels of zzso at the zzso acid sequence level the rate of evolution is approximately two replacements per site per zzso zzso An estimate of the zzso relationship among the zzso genes suggests that zzso and zzso arose as the result of a gene zzso event that occurred very early in zzso evolution, but subsequent to the divergence of the zzso ancestors of the zzso and avian zzso This raises doubts about the identity of proteins from fish, which have been previously characterized as zzso and zzso
