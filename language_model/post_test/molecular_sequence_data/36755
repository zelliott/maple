The molecular biological approach has provided important information toward understanding the complexities of the zzso zzso This article focuses on our recent results on the zzso zzso site contained in the beta zzso and the role of the gamma zzso in regulation of zzso zzso We used a combination of affinity labeling and zzso to locate several zzso of the alpha and beta zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso labeled beta zzso beta zzso and alpha zzso suggesting that they are near the zzso zzso of zzso Turning to a zzso approach we demonstrated that the two zzso zzso beta zzso and beta zzso in the zzso zzso are essential for zzso Finally, using zzso analysis, we positioned zzso beta zzso (also in the zzso zzso in proximity to beta zzso beta zzso zzso site for zzso and beta zzso zzso three zzso away from the zzso binding site, beta zzso zzso studies suggested that the gamma zzso plays a role in regulation of zzso and its zzso with zzso zzso We found that four zzso in the zzso region zzso zzso gamma zzso gamma zzso or zzso had similar membrane zzso activities but different zzso zzso pumping and growth by zzso zzso These results suggested a zzso in the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso We were able to clearly define the zzso by introducing zzso in the zzso region of the gamma zzso We were led to gamma zzso and zzso which resulted in an zzso still regulated by delta zzso but with profoundly inefficient zzso between zzso zzso sites and zzso zzso in both zzso zzso pumping and delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of the gamma zzso reversed this zzso
