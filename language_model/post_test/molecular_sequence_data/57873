The zzso relationships of members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were studied by direct sequencing of their amplified zzso zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the sequence data confirmed that the zzso zzso and zzso belong to distinct zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were found to be zzso heterogeneous, and several zzso in which zzso and zzso species were zzso were zzso The present findings show that the zzso and species definitions of these organisms are in need of zzso Different possibilities for this are discussed in the light of sequencing zzso
