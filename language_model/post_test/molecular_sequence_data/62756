zzso is an zzso that regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso 3 zzso via zzso zzso zzso C zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso zzso sites on zzso does not affected regulation of zzso by zzso but zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso are essential for zzso control of zzso zzso One binding partner of the zzso family is zzso zzso protein zzso We tested the role of zzso interaction in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso kidney zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both native and zzso zzso and zzso are present in the same zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso interaction by 30 - zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction is evident by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the minimal interacting region is localized to the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso The zzso data were confirmed in zzso cells where truncated zzso zzso still shows zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso from the zzso binding region zzso interferes with the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso activity and to increase zzso zzso Reduction of native zzso expression by small interference zzso zzso the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso We conclude that zzso interaction is regulated by zzso zzso and this interaction is a necessary and integral part of the signaling zzso between zzso and zzso
