zzso zzso vary in their zzso to zzso zzso zzso To understand the molecular basis of this zzso the structure and function of receptors for zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso screening of an zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA library yielded two identical clones expressing a zzso protein that zzso with a 220 zzso zzso in zzso extracts from this zzso This protein inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes although single base zzso alter several zzso zzso zzso is also similar to the zzso zzso zzso cloned from zzso zzso zzso All three zzso zzso zzso and zzso share at least one zzso since zzso and zzso zzso zzso react with both zzso and zzso However, other zzso zzso are specific for zzso and appear to react with a zzso domain exhibiting little zzso to zzso or zzso Sugar zzso studies showed that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was most zzso inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso acid, a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that while the zzso and zzso proteins are genetically and zzso zzso their specificity for binding sites on zzso zzso
