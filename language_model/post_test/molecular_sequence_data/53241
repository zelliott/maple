zzso is a zzso acid protein with extensive zzso to the zzso class of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene results in temperature sensitivity for zzso Genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso when present on zzso zzso will suppress this zzso growth zzso zzso can also suppress the mating zzso seen in zzso zzso zzso is specific for disruption of zzso since zzso does not restore zzso growth to strains lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso regulator zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are not required for zzso rather the essential sequences include about 170 highly zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Previously we found that zzso plays a role in gene zzso Since zzso of zzso does not suppress the reduced expression of the zzso promoter found in zzso deletion zzso zzso probably has one or more functions beyond its involvement in gene zzso
