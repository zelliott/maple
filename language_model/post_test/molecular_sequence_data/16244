zzso is a 22 zzso acid zzso first isolated and zzso from zzso zzso The use of zzso directed to the synthetic zzso gut zzso sequence has produced conflicting results as to regional distribution and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso brain and zzso zzso zzso has been detected (by zzso in brain regions where no zzso is zzso Variations in the patterns of zzso are also observed with different zzso These discrepancies have been explained by zzso zzso zzso and zzso variations in zzso zzso and variable cross zzso of the independent zzso with these zzso The use of cloned zzso zzso zzso gut zzso in Northern zzso analysis of brain regions expressing zzso zzso has also failed to reveal a zzso message, questioning the true nature of the zzso material in the zzso zzso studies, however, have suggested central roles for zzso in a variety of zzso zzso behavior, zzso control, cerebral and brain stem zzso zzso growth hormone zzso and gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso material detected in brain may be zzso by a distinct zzso zzso and still share zzso acid zzso with the zzso zzso zzso biological characterization of the cell systems which contain zzso and zzso zzso should allow a better definition of their roles in these zzso
