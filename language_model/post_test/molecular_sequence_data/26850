The functions of the members of the zzso family of zzso proteins are modulated by calcium and, in a number of cases, by zinc or zzso One such protein is zzso which is implicated in inflammation and zzso zzso Previously, we reported the structures of human zzso in both low zzso and high zzso calcium forms and, in addition, that of a complex with copper and zzso Here we report the crystal structures of the zzso zzso form of human zzso at zzso A resolution and of the zinc complex in two crystal forms zzso and zzso to zzso A and zzso A resolution, zzso These are the first structures of a zzso complex of an zzso protein to be zzso The zinc complex structure shows significant differences from those of both zzso and zzso structures, and comparisons suggest an explanation for the zzso zzso increase in calcium zzso In addition, the new structures provide insight into the role of zzso interplay in the transition of zzso from a zzso through a zzso to a zzso The role of both zinc and calcium in target binding by zzso during zzso responses is confirmed by experiments with zzso from the tropical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
