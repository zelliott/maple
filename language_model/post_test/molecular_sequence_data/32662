zzso is a zzso hypothetical protein of unknown function from zzso zzso It was originally zzso as a shorter zzso zzso but a more detailed sequence analysis conducted in our laboratory revealed that the full-length protein has an additional 43 zzso on the C zzso corresponding with a region initially ascribed to zzso As part of a larger effort to understand the functions of hypothetical proteins from zzso bacteria, and zzso zzso in particular, we report here the three-dimensional solution zzso structure for the corrected full-length zzso zzso The structure consists of two zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso separated by an zzso zzso zzso Both zzso have positively charged surface patches and weak structural zzso with folds that are associated with zzso zzso suggesting a possible functional role in binding zzso zzso acid zzso
