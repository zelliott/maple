zzso transport zzso is a zzso based system that supports the assembly and maintenance of zzso zzso and zzso studies have identified two distinct complexes containing multiple proteins that are part of the zzso zzso In this study we prepared mouse zzso cells that expressed an zzso zzso protein and zzso the zzso B complex from these zzso Mass zzso analysis of the isolated complex led to identification of a number of well known components of the zzso B zzso In addition, peptides corresponding to mouse zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The mouse zzso zzso zzso genes are zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is required for assembly of the zzso segment of the zzso We used zzso studies to provide evidence that, zzso zzso or zzso can be incorporated into a complex with a known zzso B zzso zzso We also found that zzso can interact with mouse zzso a zzso which zzso in zzso In zzso expression in a zzso system followed by zzso also provided evidence that zzso can directly interact with several different zzso B complex zzso The findings support the view that mouse zzso zzso and zzso can contribute to the zzso B complex, likely through interactions with multiple zzso proteins and also suggest a possible link to the molecular zzso zzso to support transport of cargo during zzso
