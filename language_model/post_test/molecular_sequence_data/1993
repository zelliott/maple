The human zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 2) is modular in structure with two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso domain rich in zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential zzso factor that also functions as an important regulator of alternative zzso In zzso zzso zzso region zzso alternative zzso zzso zzso functions as a strong zzso of zzso zzso selection, both in zzso and in zzso In the present study, we tested the functional role of individual zzso of zzso in alternative zzso in zzso We show that zzso is the critical domain controlling zzso alternative zzso In fact, zzso alone is sufficient to mimic the activity of the full-length zzso protein as an zzso of zzso zzso selection in zzso The zzso domain zzso a switch to zzso zzso usage by zzso zzso 12 S zzso and simultaneously stimulates zzso 13 S zzso In contrast, the zzso domain has a more general zzso zzso zzso and appears to stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso which is zzso in all zzso proteins zzso zzso containing two zzso and the zzso zzso recognition motif were both found to be necessary for the alternative zzso activity of zzso The zzso motif was necessary for efficient zzso zzso whereas the zzso motif most probably contributes by functioning as a zzso critical zzso contact during zzso zzso
