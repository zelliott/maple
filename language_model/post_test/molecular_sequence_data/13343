zzso acute zzso of G zzso receptors has been presented as a zzso process in which modification of the zzso by zzso leads to reduction in or the loss of zzso to all zzso Investigation of multiple signaling pathways has modified this view: for example, when expressed in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso couples to both stimulation of zzso calcium zzso (via zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Acute zzso for 2 zzso with 100 zzso zzso zzso an zzso of protein zzso C zzso abolished the zzso calcium response induced by 100 zzso zzso but did not reduce zzso zzso zzso of zzso In the present report, zzso zzso receptors lacking one, two, or three putative zzso zzso sites located in the zzso third zzso loop were constructed and zzso separately into zzso zzso The zzso zzso displayed zzso affinities similar to that of the zzso zzso The relative zzso of zzso changes in zzso calcium or zzso zzso levels were also similar to those of the zzso zzso for all except one of the zzso In addition, zzso treatment did not change the magnitude or potency of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso with zzso there was a progressive recovery to zzso of the control zzso increase in calcium zzso as zzso sites were eliminated from the zzso indicating that multiple zzso sites are required for zzso zzso zzso Also, these results indicate that zzso zzso selectively zzso the zzso zzso from enhancement of calcium zzso without reducing zzso zzso of zzso Thus, zzso by zzso can zzso zzso signaling via zzso zzso
