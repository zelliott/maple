zzso distemper virus zzso is a highly contagious viral pathogen causing lethal disease in dogs and other zzso A high degree of genetic variation is found between recent zzso strains and the old zzso zzso used in the vaccines and such genetic variation is regarded as a possible cause of the increasing number of zzso diseases in zzso The H gene shows the greatest extent of genetic variation that allows for distinction of various zzso according to a geographical pattern of distribution and irrespective of the species of zzso In the present study, zzso zzso genes obtained from field strains detected from clinical specimens of Italian dogs were analyzed zzso zzso analysis revealed that a homogeneous group of zzso strains is widespread in Italian dogs, all which are included into the European zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso clustered along with zzso of the Arctic zzso the highest identity being to strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso The full-length sequence of a red fox zzso strain, zzso was also determined and zzso The H protein of the fox zzso strain was unrelated to strains within the major European zzso These results suggest that at least three different zzso lineages are present in zzso
