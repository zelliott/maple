The zzso protein is widely distributed, from human to bacteria, but so far no three-dimensional structure and functional analysis of this family of proteins has been zzso We determined the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso at a resolution of zzso The overall structure of the zzso consists of zzso fold forming a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso coordinate to zzso as a possible active zzso zzso shows structural similarity to the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The active site groove of zzso includes the zzso coordinated to zzso zzso and zzso Despite the low sequence identity, zzso zzso of zzso were zzso among the two zzso There were definitive differences, however, in that one of the zzso of the zzso site was zzso for the other zzso located on the other zzso Moreover, these important zzso zzso and the zzso of the presumed active site are fully zzso in zzso zzso
