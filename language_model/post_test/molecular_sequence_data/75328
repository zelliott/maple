zzso DNA zzso clones zzso a zzso factor zzso were isolated and zzso The primary structure of zzso was determined by zzso sequence analysis of these zzso The predicted primary structure was consistent with the model that we proposed previously from the results of zzso analyses of zzso Using these clones as zzso we analyzed the zzso for zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the presence of four species of zzso that zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso tumor zzso This is the first evidence of zzso of zzso zzso a zzso factor of zzso zzso zzso The results of analysis of the zzso structure suggested that the zzso of zzso may be due to alternative zzso or differences in initiation or termination of zzso
