We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso a recently isolated zzso zzso is an zzso zzso in zzso zzso smooth muscle cells zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso decreases both the zzso zzso concentration zzso and tension induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso in zzso was assessed by the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso using the total zzso from the zzso and the specific zzso for the zzso zzso zzso A band with an expected size could be detected only when the reverse zzso was added, thus indicating that the zzso zzso express zzso zzso These results therefore suggested that zzso plays an important role in the regulation of the zzso vascular tone, not only as a circulating hormone, but also as an zzso zzso
