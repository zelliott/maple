zzso zzso are zzso interaction zzso that normally recognize short zzso zzso The apparent requirement for a zzso with a free terminal zzso group has led to the proposal that zzso interactions with the zzso play a significant role in zzso However, this model has been called into question by the more recent finding that zzso zzso can recognize some internal zzso motifs that occur within a specific secondary structure zzso Although these motifs bind at the same zzso they lack a terminal zzso Here we have investigated the role of zzso in zzso recognition in the mouse zzso zzso domain by examining the salt dependence of binding to both terminal and internal zzso and the effects of mutating a zzso basic zzso previously proposed to play a role in zzso zzso These studies indicate that direct zzso interactions with the zzso zzso do not play a significant energetic role in zzso Additional chemical modification studies of the zzso zzso support a model in which zzso and hydrogen bonding zzso play a primary role in recognition zzso zzso with a free zzso zzso or presented within a specific structural context, can satisfy these zzso
