zzso arranged zzso genes zzso and zzso are members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We analyzed population samples of zzso zzso from Africa, Europe, North and South America, and single strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso within two linked regions encompassing partial sequences of zzso and zzso The evolution of zzso and zzso is highly constrained due to their important regulatory zzso Despite this, a variety of forces have shaped the patterns of variation in zzso zzso zzso zzso gene conversion and natural selection strongly influence background variation created by linkage zzso and zzso zzso zzso The two genes exhibited similar levels of zzso diversity and positive selection was detected in the zzso regions of both zzso However, synonymous zzso was significantly higher for zzso no zzso changes were observed in this zzso We argue that balancing selection impacts some synonymous sites of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso secondary structure was significantly different between the zzso (but not zzso zzso groups and may represent a driving force of balancing selection in zzso interacting synonymous zzso Balancing selection on synonymous sites may be the first, or one of a few such zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso positive selection on zzso at the protein level influenced evolution at three zzso zzso zzso factor zzso profiles were different for zzso and zzso suggesting that their zzso functions are not zzso Combined with our previous results on zzso variation in zzso and other zzso zzso these results suggest that interplay of balancing and directional selection may be a general feature of molecular evolution in zzso and other zzso zzso
