zzso zzso in plant tissue culture involves de zzso formation of zzso zzso and should therefore provide important information about the fundamentals of zzso gene zzso We identified novel factors required for zzso of the shoot zzso zzso zzso through an analysis of shoot zzso in root initiation zzso zzso and root growth zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso After induction of callus to zzso zzso cell division soon ceased and was then zzso locally in the surface region, resulting in formation of mounds of dense cells in which zzso zzso were eventually zzso The zzso zzso inhibited zzso of cell division and suppressed expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso caused excess zzso cell division on the callus zzso This was intimately related to enhanced and broadened expression of zzso zzso cloning revealed that the zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso (a kind of zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso In the early stages of shoot zzso zzso was expressed (as was zzso in the developing cell zzso whereas zzso was expressed outside the cell zzso When zzso was zzso zzso the expression levels of zzso and zzso were significantly zzso Taken together, these findings show that both negative regulation by zzso and positive regulation by zzso of the zzso zzso participate in proper control of cell division as a prerequisite for SAM zzso
