zzso experiments indicate that the general zzso factor zzso zzso can interact directly with zzso zzso zzso and that zzso can stimulate zzso by increasing recruitment of zzso to zzso For promoters at which recruitment of zzso to promoters is limiting in zzso one would predict that zzso activity should be particularly sensitive to zzso zzso that decrease the association of zzso with promoter DNA and/or with zzso zzso zzso such zzso zzso should exacerbate a limiting step that occurs in zzso zzso Here, we describe zzso on the zzso surface of zzso that severely affect both zzso protein zzso complex formation and interaction with the zzso zzso domain in zzso These zzso zzso affect the stability of the zzso complex in zzso because they are zzso lethal in combination with zzso zzso impaired for zzso zzso Interestingly, these zzso derivatives support zzso and they efficiently respond to zzso and natural zzso zzso in different promoter zzso These results suggest that in zzso recruitment of zzso is not generally a limiting step for zzso zzso However, one zzso zzso shows reduced zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso may be limiting at a subset of promoters in zzso
