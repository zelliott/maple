The zzso protein regulates the transfer potential of zzso zzso plasmids through its interaction with zzso zzso zzso and its target, zzso zzso zzso binds to and protects zzso from degradation and promotes duplex formation between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso The zzso secondary structure consists of two zzso zzso separated by a zzso zzso and terminated by a zzso zzso Previous studies suggested zzso bound to the smooth zzso pair zzso of zzso zzso In this investigation, zzso mobility shift analysis was used to study the interaction between a zzso zzso zzso fusion protein and a series of synthetic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in 16 of the 28 bases in stem II of zzso that are predicted to disrupt base pairing did not significantly alter the zzso binding zzso zzso of the zzso regions on either side of zzso II led to a dramatic decrease in zzso binding to zzso and to the complementary region of the zzso zzso zzso While no evidence for zzso contacts was found, the results suggest that zzso recognizes the overall shape of the zzso and is influenced by the length of the zzso regions zzso the zzso
