Investigation of soil zzso in 11 cooling towers allowed us to isolate a major unknown zzso zzso population zzso However, zzso did not appear to be specific to cooling tower zzso since they are also a major zzso population found in zzso isolated from different points of a water treatment zzso The zzso sequences from zzso strains did not match any known database zzso suggesting that zzso constitutes a new zzso zzso We isolated and further described one of the zzso that we named zzso zzso The zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso belongs to the zzso and zzso together with zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses within the zzso group distinguished different zzso of zzso strains according to their origin, zzso cooling tower or zzso Although zzso are able to feed on viable zzso coli cells, they do not zzso virulent zzso zzso zzso thus enabling them to avoid infection by zzso zzso zzso is not directly involved in zzso zzso zzso However, an indirect role of zzso in zzso risk is zzso
