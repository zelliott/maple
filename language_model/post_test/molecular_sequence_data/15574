zzso have a zzso zzso which is an important zzso in contributing to their successful survival for more than 400 million zzso Their zzso contain a diversity of zzso which represent a tremendous zzso partially unexplored resource not only for understanding zzso channels but also for use in drug design and zzso In this investigation, zzso a new toxin gene was identified from the zzso of the scorpion zzso zzso by constructing zzso library method, and its product was expressed and characterized zzso The mature zzso has 38 zzso including six zzso zzso The zzso experiments further indicated that the zzso zzso zzso has an interesting pharmacological profile: it blocks zzso channel with zzso which is moderate zzso channel blocking activity compared to the other zzso zzso and exhibits good selectivity on zzso over zzso and zzso about 60 folds and 450 zzso zzso These data not only enrich the family of zzso channel toxins from scorpion zzso but also present a potential drug template for selectively targeting the zzso zzso
