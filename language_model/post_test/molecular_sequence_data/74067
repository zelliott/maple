zzso vaccination against tumor zzso without induction of zzso remains a major challenge in cancer zzso Here, we show for the first time effective therapeutic vaccination followed by suppression of established spontaneous zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso We identified three novel mouse zzso zzso derived peptides with high predicted binding affinity to zzso class I zzso zzso according to the prediction program zzso and computer modeling of zzso into the zzso class I zzso binding zzso zzso a DNA zzso vaccine was generated based on the expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso and therapeutic zzso of this vaccine were established following oral delivery with attenuated zzso zzso zzso Only mice zzso with zzso were free of spontaneous liver zzso This effect was clearly dependent on zzso and high affinity of the zzso zzso to zzso class I zzso Specifically, we showed a crucial role for zzso expression as a stable zzso fusion zzso for vaccine zzso The immune response following the zzso DNA zzso vaccination was zzso by zzso T cells as indicated by zzso of primary tumors and zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso no cell zzso was zzso in zzso adrenal zzso indicating the absence of zzso In zzso we show effective therapeutic vaccination against zzso with a novel rationally designed zzso zzso vaccine without induction of zzso providing an important baseline for future clinical application of this zzso
