We have determined and compared the promoter, coding, and zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso gene of various zzso zzso Although we confirm the previous observation that the zzso of the gene in the zzso of the human and the great apes results from a single zzso to zzso nonsense zzso in zzso 2, we find that the zzso in the zzso lineage results from an independent nonsense zzso at a different zzso zzso in zzso 2 or from either zzso deletion in zzso 3 or zzso zzso in zzso 5, contrary to the previous claim that the cause is a zzso deletion in zzso zzso We also find that compared with other organisms, the zzso functional zzso gene is exceptional in terms of usage of zzso zzso which are prone to zzso nonsense zzso Nevertheless, we demonstrate rather strong selective constraint against zzso sites of the functional zzso gene and argue that this observation is consistent with the fact that the zzso gene is unique in the zzso and zzso zzso not only among animals but also among zzso Another finding that there are a few zzso in the zzso element or zzso (or zzso of zzso functional zzso genes may explain the lowered zzso zzso We suggest that although the zzso of the zzso zzso gene was caused by independent nonsense or zzso zzso the gene has taken a zzso deterioration process, first in the promoter and second in the coding region during zzso zzso It is also argued that the high concentration of zzso acid in the blood of humans and nonhuman primates has developed molecular zzso with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, it remains to be answered whether loss of zzso activity in zzso is related to protection from zzso damage and the prolonged life zzso
