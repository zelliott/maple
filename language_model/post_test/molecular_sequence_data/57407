zzso zzso chains from bovine zzso cartilage were fully zzso with zzso from zzso zzso and the products were reduced with alkaline zzso The zzso fragments were zzso on a zzso zzso column and the earliest zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the two zzso species to have the following zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso and zzso beta zzso beta zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso zzso Both zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso it can be deduced from these structures that the presence of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso zzso protects both of the adjacent zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso This result has implications for the interpretation of zzso zzso because in zzso cartilage zzso zzso the zzso blocks are not solely those with fully zzso zzso zzso but also include the zzso zzso which have zzso zzso It is, therefore, not possible to estimate their zzso zzso or the size of the fully zzso zzso sequences from zzso zzso that contain zzso
