zzso cancer cells, like zzso of the developing zzso are invasive and must escape immune surveillance to zzso zzso has long been thought to play a significant role in the tumor surveillance zzso Bone zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are expressed by zzso and are strongly zzso by many zzso Indeed, zzso has been shown to be a positive indicator of the invasive potential of some zzso In this report, we show that zzso and zzso form rapid and tight complexes with complement Factor zzso Besides its key role in regulating zzso cell zzso Factor H also appears to play a role when zzso by invading organisms in enabling cellular evasion of zzso We have investigated whether zzso and zzso may play a similar role in tumor cell complement evasion by testing to see whether these zzso could promote tumor cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso can protect zzso zzso cells from attack by human complement as well as human zzso breast cancer cells and zzso myeloma cells from attack by guinea pig zzso The mechanism of this gain of function by tumor cell expression of zzso or zzso has been defined using specific peptides and zzso to block zzso and zzso protective zzso The expression of zzso and zzso in tumor cells provides a selective advantage for survival via initial binding to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso on the cell surface, followed by zzso of Factor H to the cell surface and zzso of zzso cell zzso
