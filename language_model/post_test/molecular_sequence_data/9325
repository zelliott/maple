The production of zzso zzso has been studied previously in zzso zzso , a species that produces zzso acid as well as 4 other zzso compounds, but the late steps of the zzso leading to the specific end products are zzso The present study compared the zzso zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso , chosen because it produces only 2 zzso zzso and no zzso acid, with that of zzso A zzso library of zzso zzso DNA was screened with a zzso zzso probe based on the corresponding genes from zzso zzso and 1 of the zzso zzso was zzso in zzso A zzso gene cluster was identified that shows similarities to that of zzso but also contains a number of novel zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene abolished zzso production in zzso confirming the identity of the gene zzso zzso zzso of a novel gene zzso an apparent zzso also abolished zzso zzso A potential zzso zzso zzso consistent with the genes in the cluster and the zzso produced by zzso zzso and zzso different from that of zzso is zzso
