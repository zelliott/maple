We report the presence of long stretches of tandem repeats in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A 30 zzso sequence with zzso symmetry (including 5 zzso zzso zzso was repeated in tandem, zzso with zzso zzso unique zzso This structure extends for long zzso zzso at one location in zzso zzso zzso and about 3 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The tandem repeats zzso zzso show a similar distribution in both organisms, appearing once or twice in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and once in the largest, probably essential zzso of each zzso but not in the smaller zzso zzso of the structures in both zzso zzso zzso revealed an extremely high sequence conservation in both zzso within the species, as well as in the different zzso zzso sequences have also been found in other more zzso related zzso members of the zzso Transformation of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso produced significant zzso in the host cells, particularly in terms of cell zzso The introduction of extra copies of zzso within the zzso significantly alters the distribution of the zzso among the daughter cells, as observed by zzso zzso Although the precise biological role cannot be completely zzso all the data conform with the tandem repeats being involved in zzso zzso in zzso
