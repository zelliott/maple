zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grows on zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso as sole nitrogen zzso A gene cluster involved in zzso acid degradation was recently zzso The functional assignment of three of its zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the tentative functional assignment of a fourth one, zzso is zzso The genes were expressed in zzso coli as zzso fusion proteins that were zzso by zzso zzso The zzso activity of each protein was determined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso a hydride zzso zzso a hydride transfer from reduced zzso to the aromatic ring of zzso acid, generating the hydride zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso Similarly, zzso also transformed zzso to the hydride zzso of zzso A second hydride zzso zzso zzso a subsequent hydride transfer to zzso to produce a zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso All three reactions required the activity of zzso an zzso zzso zzso for shuttling the hydride zzso from zzso to zzso zzso converted zzso to a zzso unknown product, zzso The results show that zzso zzso and zzso play a key role in the initial steps of zzso acid degradation, and that zzso may prove to be important in the later zzso
