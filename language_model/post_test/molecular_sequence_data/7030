One of the major problems in structural work on zzso proteins is the identification of an expression system which will allow the production of enough pure protein for structural zzso an inadequate expression system can lead, for example, to the formation of unwanted protein inclusion zzso In the present work we report the expression of genes zzso the zzso 2 zzso zzso proteins from a number of species of purple bacteria in zzso of zzso zzso that lack the native zzso zzso The zzso structural genes zzso from the zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso were amplified and zzso by zzso chain reaction, and cloned into an zzso expression zzso which was then introduced into three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the resulting zzso strains zzso zzso complexes that were examined using zzso and zzso zzso and Western zzso Thus, we have created a zzso expression system which supports the assembly of a functional zzso zzso zzso This work opens up the possibility of creating zzso zzso zzso from bacteria for which no genetic system is zzso this is particularly significant in the case of zzso zzso since this zzso has been the source of the zzso complex that has recently been structurally resolved to atomic zzso
