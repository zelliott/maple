The zzso of zzso surfaces increases in response to zzso We have shown that vascular leakage in experimental models of tissue injury can be inhibited by zzso and by a novel class of peptides that we call zzso zzso sites for zzso have been revealed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso materials have been found in inflamed zzso Perhaps the breakdown of zzso intermediate filaments after insult generates or exposes zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso if activated or released locally in injured zzso may function as zzso to counteract the immediate inflammatory zzso If this is so, the peripheral actions of these peptides add a new dimension to the idea that zzso and related substances organize and regulate an zzso response to zzso
