We describe a method to detect zzso expression using in zzso zzso in suspension and flow zzso Our model was zzso zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso cell line zzso A zzso zzso probe was labeled with zzso and detected using an zzso zzso zzso We obtained good resolution in specific signals against background zzso zzso zzso signal ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The technique was zzso taking into account several zzso zzso like zzso zzso time, effect of blocking agents, and stringency wash zzso This method also allowed us to zzso the zzso zzso copy zzso using a zzso zzso we obtained a figure of about 1200 zzso which is in good agreement with the dot zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of in zzso zzso represents an original method to study gene zzso This technique has the potential to develop into a zzso tool for cell biology studies, examining specific zzso production together with DNA content or membrane molecules zzso and offering the possibility to purify by sorting a cell population expressing a specific zzso
