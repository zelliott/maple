The construction of a three-dimensional molecular model of the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso based on zzso with the zzso domain of zzso from zzso zzso (a unique bacterial zzso of known crystal zzso is zzso It is found that the zzso zzso zzso can readily occupy the putative active site of the zzso model such that the known zzso reaction, leading to zzso of zzso is the preferred route of metabolism for this particular zzso Key zzso acid contacts within the zzso active site appear to zzso zzso for zzso attack at the zzso group, and the position of the zzso relative to the zzso zzso is consistent with the zzso zzso studies reported by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Typical zzso zzso such as zzso are able to fit the putative active site of zzso by a combination of zzso zzso hydrogen zzso zzso stacking and zzso interactions within the zzso zzso zzso The mode of action of zzso zzso as described by the zzso studies, is supported by quantitative zzso relationship zzso analyses on two groups of structurally related zzso zzso Moreover, the results of molecular zzso zzso zzso energy calculations are compatible with the proposed mode of binding between zzso zzso agents and the putative active site of zzso although membrane interactions may also have a role in the zzso activity of zzso zzso
