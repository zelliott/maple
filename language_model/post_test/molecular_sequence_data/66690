zzso are zzso of zzso innate zzso and knowledge of their zzso relationships is essential for understanding their mechanisms of zzso We report here the zzso solution structures of the mouse zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso in which a zzso zzso zzso was replaced by zzso zzso analysis of the two peptides confirms the involvement of this zzso in a zzso salt bridge that is removed in the zzso because of the shortened side zzso Despite disruption of this structural feature, the zzso zzso retains a well defined native fold because of a zzso of side zzso which result in zzso favorable zzso Furthermore, salt zzso zzso zzso were tested for zzso effects and resistance to zzso degradation, and all of the zzso had similar zzso activities and stability to zzso These findings support the conclusion that the function of the zzso salt bridge in zzso is not linked to zzso activity or zzso stability of the mature zzso
