The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso neutral zzso A, was cloned by the use of zzso zzso The size of neutral zzso A deduced from the zzso sequence was zzso zzso acids zzso zzso The cloned zzso gene was partially deleted in zzso and the deleted zzso designated zzso was used to construct an zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Growth and zzso of the zzso strain were similar to those of an zzso zzso strain, although the zzso zzso activity of the zzso strain was significantly less than that of the zzso zzso The zzso strain produced zzso crystal proteins that were more stable than those of the zzso zzso strain after zzso in zzso and zzso cultures of the zzso strain contained higher zzso of full-length zzso crystal proteins than did those of its zzso zzso The absence of neutral zzso A did not affect the zzso activity of a zzso crystal protein of zzso zzso These results indicate that crystal protein stability and yield may be improved by deletion of specific zzso from zzso zzso
