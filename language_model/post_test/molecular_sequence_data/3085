Ion zzso is essential for plant growth and zzso The zzso open reading frames for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, and 3) were previously identified as zzso that may zzso zzso zzso across the zzso zzso To understand the diversity and role of zzso zzso in controlling plant zzso levels, another zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was cloned from an zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso identical to zzso at the zzso acid level, zzso identical to zzso and zzso identical to zzso zzso transcripts appeared to be expressed at low levels in all zzso and levels of zzso zzso increased after zzso zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso fusion appeared to zzso to both zzso and plant zzso zzso When expressed in zzso zzso like zzso failed to suppress the zzso sensitivity of zzso strains deficient in zzso zzso zzso Several modifications to zzso allowed the protein to transport zzso zzso of zzso acids to the N zzso of zzso and zzso caused both zzso to suppress the sensitivity of zzso strains deficient in zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso may zzso their zzso transport properties through zzso at the N zzso
