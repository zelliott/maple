zzso zzso zzso are believed to play a role in the zzso of zzso resistance to insect viruses and zzso zzso zzso zzso of hormones and protection against zzso zzso In this study, we used quantitative real time zzso to examine expression profiles of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes in the zzso zzso of the zzso after exposure to zzso zzso and juvenile hormone analog zzso In zzso study, zzso at higher zzso zzso and zzso caused significant zzso of zzso and all zzso zzso of zzso caused significant zzso of zzso However, zzso in all zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso When exposed to either zzso zzso or zzso zzso on the third day of the fifth zzso the zzso had higher zzso at later time zzso 15, 18, and zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso expression was zzso within zzso after exposure to zzso and showed a zzso response after exposure to zzso We also did a zzso study, in which zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso expression significantly at both day 1 and day 3 of the fifth zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso at the two zzso These findings imply that hormones have an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso However, further validation and field trials should be carried out on the regulatory elements relevant to zzso and zzso gene zzso
