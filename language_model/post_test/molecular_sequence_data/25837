A synthetic analog of a zzso zzso associated with mature human zzso zzso has been investigated for zzso effects on various cell types in culture as compared to zzso action on mouse and human zzso colonies zzso which occurs from 1 X zzso to 1 X zzso M in zzso This includes colony formation by zzso T and B cells in zzso cultures, as well as zzso zzso of zzso B and zzso zzso At higher zzso zzso above 1 X zzso M, an zzso effect was found on colony zzso Neither the production of zzso zzso 3 by zzso T cells, nor the proliferation of the zzso zzso cell line were affected by the zzso up to 1 X zzso zzso A slight zzso effect was found above 1 X zzso M on mouse zzso zzso A series of zzso cell lines was also zzso No effect was seen between 1 X zzso and 1 X zzso M on human zzso zzso cells in zzso On zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso cells a zzso zzso was seen at zzso zzso On a human zzso cell line zzso no effect was seen, and on a rat zzso cell line zzso an zzso effect was seen at 1 X zzso M and zzso No significant zzso of cell growth was seen on zzso mouse zzso cells from 1 X zzso to 1 X zzso M during 7 days of zzso The investigated normal and zzso cell types in culture were thus not inhibited in very low zzso which act on zzso However, a variable zzso effect was found at higher zzso where the zzso of zzso was zzso and at zzso where the zzso is zzso The zzso zzso thus seems to be a zzso selective inhibitor of zzso The finding that various zzso cells do not respond at lower zzso supports the possibility of using the zzso as a protector of normal cells during cancer zzso
