zzso zzso is able to grow zzso using alternative electron zzso including nitrate or zzso We characterized an zzso zzso the zzso nitrate zzso zzso zzso to the zzso coli zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso a protein with zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso with it a gene zzso zzso a protein zzso to zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso abolished both nitrate and zzso zzso as electron zzso and zzso induction of zzso Four putative zzso binding sites were found in zzso zzso The consensus zzso zzso at position zzso is identical to the consensus for the DNA site for zzso zzso zzso contained a four zzso zzso cluster at its zzso zzso This is in contrast to zzso where a similar cluster is present at the zzso zzso It is possible that oxygen zzso the activity of both zzso by a similar mechanism involving zzso Unlike in zzso where zzso expression is zzso zzso by zzso zzso gene expression in zzso is strongly activated by zzso We have identified in the zzso zzso region a zzso activated by zzso independently of zzso Thus induction of genes involved in zzso zzso requires in zzso at least two levels of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso to induce zzso of zzso zzso
