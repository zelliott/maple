zzso zzso are zzso that catalyze the release of fatty acids from the zzso position of zzso zzso acids have been suggested to play a key role in the barrier function of the zzso The aim of this study was to identify and characterize the type of zzso zzso zzso expressed in human zzso We report the molecular cloning of two zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso The first zzso is identical to human pancreatic type zzso zzso zzso Western blots revealed a 14 zzso protein localized in the soluble zzso The second zzso zzso is identical to human zzso type zzso zzso and is localized in the membrane zzso By zzso reverse zzso chain reaction performed on horizontal sections of the zzso we found that the zzso of both zzso zzso were expressed mainly in the zzso layers of the zzso Our data thus provide evidence for the expression of two zzso zzso zzso in human zzso The different zzso of these two zzso proteins strongly suggests that each zzso might have a specific role in skin physiology and probably in the barrier zzso Taken together, these data validate the reverse zzso chain reaction technique performed on thin sections as a first approach to detect gene expression in different layers of the zzso
