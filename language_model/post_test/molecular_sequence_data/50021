The zzso sodium channel zzso is of fundamental importance in the control of sodium zzso in zzso zzso zzso of sodium zzso through the zzso zzso zzso is an important component in the overall control of sodium balance, blood volume and thereby of blood zzso This is clearly demonstrated by rare genetic disorders of zzso activity zzso syndrome and zzso type 1), associated with contrasting effects on blood zzso The zzso zzso is a well-established zzso of zzso zzso zzso insight has now been gained into the zzso zzso pathways linking zzso changes in gene zzso with changes in zzso zzso zzso pathways include zzso proteins and especially the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the small zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso for zzso and degradation is now emerging as a major mechanism for the zzso of channel zzso Several proteins acting in concert are an intrinsic part of this process but zzso zzso precursor cell expressed zzso zzso 4) is of central zzso Other mechanisms known to interact with zzso and affect sodium transport include zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The implications of research on accessory factors controlling zzso activity are zzso zzso cellular mechanisms controlling zzso activity may provide a more detailed insight not only of zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso but also of the link between abnormal zzso sodium transport and essential zzso
