zzso zzso zzso are formed following metabolism of zzso and during normal zzso zzso These zzso species are zzso in nature and are capable of forming stable zzso with target zzso These zzso protein modifications can initiate processes that lead to acute tissue injury or chronic zzso Recent zzso in mass zzso techniques and data analysis has permitted a more detailed investigation of zzso protein modifications by zzso zzso zzso from such analyses will assist in providing a better understanding of how specific classes of zzso produce toxicity and disease progression via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a known environmental zzso and its zzso zzso formed via the intermediate generation of zzso zzso elicit their toxic response via the zzso modification of target proteins and the generation of zzso oxygen zzso We have zzso a model zzso zzso zzso to guide us in identifying zzso and zzso derived zzso protein zzso zzso analyses reveals that these modifications occur selectively on zzso and zzso acid zzso of the target zzso and that these modifications occur within identifiable zzso binding zzso within the zzso These motifs are found within zzso regions of the protein and appear to be target sites of zzso zzso These zzso also appear to dictate the nature of zzso chemistry and the final structure of the zzso This model system will provide critical insight for in zzso zzso hunting following exposure to zzso but the general approaches can also be extended to the identification of protein zzso derived from other classes of zzso zzso
