zzso zzso B virus zzso is the single species in the zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso B viruses exist in three zzso and are associated with respiratory disease in zzso Members of the species vary in stability at acid zzso To date there has been zzso in zzso zzso and acid stability zzso zzso To identify zzso regions associated with acid stability, two viruses were serially treated at pH zzso to isolate zzso zzso An zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 1 virus contained a single zzso acid change in the zzso of zzso Similar treatment with a separate isolate identified a multiple zzso zzso infection with zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso infections were subsequently identified in original zzso taken from the infected horse and from two further cell culture zzso viruses originally isolated in zzso zzso specific rat zzso were produced and used to examine a collection of zzso from a range of zzso acid stability zzso and zzso In contrast to previous reports, we showed viruses previously classified as zzso zzso 1 are in fact zzso 3 and that there is a clear association of zzso with zzso and acid stability zzso in zzso Additionally, we have shown that zzso zzso zzso into zzso in zzso conditions below their threshold of stability, similarly to closely related viruses in the same zzso
