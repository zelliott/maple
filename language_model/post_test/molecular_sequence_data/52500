We cloned and characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso open reading frame of 1230 zzso was interrupted by nine zzso and zzso a zzso of 409 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence was similar to that of zzso zzso zzso which suggests that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso also belongs to the zzso zzso fold zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and resting cells showed a specific activity of 200 zzso zzso zzso towards zzso
