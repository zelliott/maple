A zzso zzso zzso zzso leukemia virus, zzso zzso is capable of inducing the formation of large zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso This zzso resembles that of zzso zzso a novel zzso recently isolated from the zzso of a zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that also has the unusual ability to zzso zzso cells, which are normally resistant to mouse zzso zzso zzso induction by both zzso zzso and zzso is accompanied by the zzso of large amounts of zzso viral DNA, a hallmark of zzso zzso but not previously reported for mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso determined that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso can be attributed to a single zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso region of the viral zzso zzso This site zzso to that of the single substitution previously shown to be responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso substitution in zzso zzso also contributes to the ability of this virus to zzso zzso cells, but zzso zzso is unable to zzso zzso zzso Because this zzso zzso is one of the critical zzso acids that form the zzso zzso binding site, and because zzso zzso and zzso cells have zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso formation as well as altered host range may be a consequence of altered interaction between virus and zzso
