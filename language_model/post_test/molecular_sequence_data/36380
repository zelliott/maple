A general method is described for zzso amplification of single restriction fragments from large DNA zzso The method involves zzso zzso of synthetic zzso to ambiguous zzso zzso zzso produced by type zzso restriction zzso Such zzso provide one target for primer zzso in subsequent zzso zzso The second target for primer zzso is provided by a universal zzso zzso to blunt ends produced with another zzso The key advantage of this approach is that specific fragments can be isolated without any prior knowledge of the zzso sequence of the zzso Using zzso zzso DNA as a test system, unique zzso products could be generated zzso zzso of temperature, zzso strength, and zzso concentration in the zzso zzso affect sequence zzso found to have a major influence on the purity of zzso zzso In principle, the method permits the amplification of virtually any sequence from zzso zzso or zzso DNA using a library of only 240 zzso
