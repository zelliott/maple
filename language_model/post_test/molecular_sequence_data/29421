The zzso is the only family within the zzso to zzso zzso such as the Australian zzso zzso zzso and freshwater zzso zzso and zzso We present a zzso based on partial zzso zzso sequences of 26 species of zzso and three zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso position of the zzso from zzso within the zzso suggests that the family arose during the evolutionary transition between zzso and zzso zzso 425 million years zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso lineages from zzso and zzso zzso in addition to estimates of the divergence times, indicate that zzso from zzso radiated zzso 191 zzso ago, following a switch from an aquatic zzso presumed to be extinct to zzso which diversified in the Upper zzso Within zzso from zzso we observe a zzso of four zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which occurred zzso 246 zzso ago according to molecular zzso zzso This suggests that the first zzso of zzso originated during the evolution and diversification of zzso orders and zzso zzso 250 zzso zzso Finally, we report a zzso event between two major groups of zzso zzso which is probably linked to the separation of South America from Africa zzso 100 zzso zzso
