The effectiveness of a passive flow zzso zzso processing acid mine drainage zzso generated from an abandoned coal mine in Southern Illinois was evaluated using zzso and microbial community analysis zzso post zzso zzso The results indicated that the treatment system was successful in both raising the pH of the zzso from zzso to zzso and in lowering the total iron level by zzso While zzso levels did decrease by zzso the level post treatment zzso remained above recommended drinking water zzso zzso of biological zzso reduction was indicated by a zzso increase in zzso content of the remaining zzso in the water zzso zzso community analysis targeting zzso zzso and zzso genes indicated that the zzso samples were dominated by bacteria related to zzso zzso while the zzso water directly from the reactor zzso was dominated by sequences related to zzso zzso and complex carbon degrading zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso water, prior to environmental release, revealed that the community shifted back to predominantly zzso zzso zzso analysis implied limited diversity in the zzso population present in both the zzso zzso and zzso pond zzso These results support the use of passive flow zzso to lower the zzso metal, and zzso levels present in the zzso at the zzso mine, but suggest modifications of the system are necessary to both stimulate zzso bacteria and inhibit zzso zzso
