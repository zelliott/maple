The gene zzso zzso the zzso DNA zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso system zzso of zzso species zzso has been cloned and expressed in zzso coli, and its zzso zzso sequence has been zzso The coding region was zzso zzso in length and capable of specifying a zzso protein of 416 zzso acids zzso The predicted sequence of the zzso protein displays ten sequence motifs characteristic of all zzso zzso and shows the highest similarity to other zzso that zzso the zzso zzso namely M zzso zzso and M zzso zzso All three zzso zzso the internal zzso within their recognition zzso zzso similarities between M zzso zzso and its zzso M zzso zzso and M zzso zzso as well as with four other zzso that zzso the related zzso zzso namely M zzso zzso M zzso zzso M zzso zzso M zzso zzso have been also found within the variable region of these zzso On the basis of structural information from M zzso zzso and M zzso zzso several M zzso zzso zzso that are expected to interact with DNA can be zzso Furthermore, an organization of the variable region of zzso into two segments exhibiting a pattern of zzso zzso and a considerable degree of structural zzso is zzso
