zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso isolated from zzso skin, is endowed with outstanding structural and biological zzso It has no common structure with zzso zzso peptides and is a unique example of a zzso zzso by an animal cell, which contains a zzso acid in its native zzso We have undertaken a complete evaluation of the zzso selectivity of zzso together with the binding characteristics and zzso distribution of zzso in the rat zzso zzso zzso was tested for its relative affinity to zzso zzso and zzso receptors by determining its potency in zzso the selective zzso zzso zzso (where zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso (where zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso from rat brain and/or guinea pig zzso membrane zzso zzso constant zzso values of zzso were zzso zzso 62 zzso and greater than zzso zzso respectively for zzso delta and zzso sites, indicating a selectivity ratio zzso zzso zzso Under similar conditions, zzso which is regarded as one of the most selective zzso zzso available, exhibited a selectivity ratio of zzso zzso zzso binding properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized in the rat zzso zzso zzso performed over a large range of zzso revealed a single homogeneous population of zzso binding sites zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 92 zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso differences were observed in the zzso displayed by various selective zzso and zzso zzso in zzso the specific binding of zzso The rank order of potency was in good agreement with that obtained with other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso was used to zzso the distribution of zzso binding sites in rat zzso The labeling pattern paralleled that observed using other zzso zzso zzso parameters and selectivity profile of zzso on zzso sections were similar to those obtained with membrane zzso zzso Finally, zzso administration of synthetic zzso into mice showed that this zzso is the most potent zzso known to date, being up to 5 and 670 times more active than zzso and zzso zzso Higher doses induced zzso The overall data collected demonstrate that zzso is the first among the naturally occurring peptides to be highly potent and nearly specific zzso towards the zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
