zzso are zzso zzso acid secondary structures based on zzso association that are readily adopted by zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso occurring zzso zzso sequences have functional roles in biology that are zzso through zzso To appreciate how this is zzso an understanding of the likelihood of zzso formation and the structural features of the folded species under a defined set of conditions is zzso We previously systematically investigated the zzso stability and folding zzso of DNA zzso and found a strong dependence of these properties on loop length and loop arrangement zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 47, zzso Here we report on a complementary analysis of zzso zzso using zzso melting and circular zzso zzso that also serves as a comparison to the equivalent DNA zzso zzso We found that the zzso stability of zzso zzso can be modulated by loop length while the overall structure is largely zzso The systematic design of our study also revealed subtle loop length zzso in zzso zzso zzso
