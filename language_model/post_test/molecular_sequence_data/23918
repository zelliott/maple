Tax, a protein zzso by the zzso gene of human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso interacts with various host cell zzso zzso Tax activates zzso from the long terminal repeat zzso of zzso through association with zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Here, we present evidence that zzso of regulated zzso zzso zzso protein 3 zzso a zzso of zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso By using a zzso zzso system, we show that zzso alone can enhance zzso from the zzso zzso as well as from a cellular zzso zzso element zzso Interestingly, we find that zzso of zzso and Tax dramatically increased zzso zzso at the zzso zzso We also show by zzso zzso pull-down and zzso experiments that zzso interacts with zzso Using deletion zzso analysis, we identify the Tax interaction domain of zzso as a region spanning from zzso acid 1 to zzso which contains a zzso zzso These results provide important clues toward understanding the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
