This paper discusses zzso sequencing by consecutive zzso zzso of carbohydrates using an zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso separation of the zzso Because of the high resolving power and good zzso of zzso zzso zzso sequencing of a complex zzso pool can be performed in most instances requiring no prior isolation of the individual zzso High sensitivity zzso zzso detection enables acquisition of complete sequence information from several zzso of zzso zzso of the migration times of the zzso digest fragments to the zzso zzso enables calculation of migration shifts, due to zzso based on the actual zzso zzso The particular sequence of each zzso in a zzso pool can be proposed with high confidence based on the migration time shifts of the various zzso zzso However, possible combinations of various sequence fragments may have very similar charge to zzso volume ratios, resulting in zzso zzso when a mixture of different zzso is zzso zzso Then, zzso zzso zzso of the resulting fragments should be evaluated after each zzso zzso In the instances of complex separation profiles when multiple zzso are present, the evaluation of peak shifts can get very complicated and solved only with the aid of a software zzso Data about the zzso composition of the zzso pool provides useful information in designing the zzso zzso zzso
