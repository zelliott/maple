The zzso and their receptors play a key role in immune and inflammatory responses by promoting recruitment and zzso of different zzso of zzso The membrane zzso zzso binds three zzso zzso zzso and zzso and its involvement is recognized in many inflammatory diseases and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso through interactions with three zzso was indicated as putative therapeutic target for the treatment of these diseases, and some zzso compounds have already been described in the zzso Recently, we studied the interaction between zzso and its three natural zzso and showed that three zzso zzso bound the zzso mainly by their zzso regions using aromatic and zzso zzso and, in particular, zzso had the highest affinity for zzso In light of these results, we focused our attention on what structural zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and what were the structural zzso zzso we have zzso three zzso corresponding to the zzso region of zzso but with different aromatic zzso zzso analyzed their zzso by circular zzso zzso and molecular dynamics simulations, simulated their complexes with zzso by zzso methods, and validated these data by in zzso zzso The results showed that two peptides were able to bind zzso and to mimic the molecular recognition of zzso and demonstrated that zzso region of zzso can be used as template and starting point to obtain new molecules by de zzso design zzso
