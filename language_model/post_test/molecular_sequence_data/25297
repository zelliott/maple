A rapid small-scale method of extraction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was developed for the purpose of identification of zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Cell surface zzso were prepared within less than 2 zzso from zzso zzso of broth or suspension of colonies cultured zzso The preparations were analyzed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso for zzso and by double diffusion gel zzso zzso test and zzso to zzso membrane for zzso zzso The analyses with the preparations obtained by the method could provide adequate results capable of identifying zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
