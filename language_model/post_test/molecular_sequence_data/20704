zzso analysis has revealed abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso biological functions, in several zzso zzso In this study, we identified for the first time that the zzso zzso but not the other five zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso in zzso zzso Although all of the zzso zzso genes were actively zzso only disruption or knockout of zzso abolished zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso with the zzso gene restored both zzso synthesis capability and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso genes zzso together with zzso but not its five zzso reconstructed the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso in zzso zzso and possibly its counterpart in zzso zzso has evolved the distinct function of zzso precursors for zzso zzso like zzso in zzso zzso we suggest the zzso of zzso in both zzso as zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
