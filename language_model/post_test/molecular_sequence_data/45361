zzso strains zzso and zzso were isolated from a marine sponge in the zzso Both strains were zzso zzso strictly zzso and zzso zzso of strain zzso were short, curved rods with zzso zzso whereas those of strain zzso were straight rods with a less rapid gliding zzso The two strains had zzso as the major respiratory zzso and did not produce zzso zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the two strains belonged to the family zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between strains zzso and zzso was zzso zzso their closest relative was zzso zzso with zzso % and zzso % sequence zzso zzso zzso tree zzso indicated that the two strains belonged to the same zzso but were on separate zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso were found on one branch, strain zzso was in another branch that had no species with zzso published zzso Based on the zzso zzso data obtained in the present study, we propose that strain zzso represents a novel zzso and that strain zzso represents a novel species in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type strain of the type species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed as the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso In an earlier study, it was suggested that the zzso zzso is a later zzso synonym of the zzso zzso However, a formal proposal to zzso zzso zzso the only member of the zzso zzso has not yet been zzso The results of zzso analyses in this study support the zzso of zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso
