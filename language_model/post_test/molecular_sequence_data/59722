The assembly of zzso zzso receptors in specific zzso populations is a complex process which is poorly zzso To begin to examine zzso zzso alpha 1, beta zzso and gamma 2 zzso zzso expression and association, as well as zzso zzso were examined in cultured rat zzso zzso zzso Western blots revealed two alpha zzso zzso A 39 zzso species was zzso at 2 days in culture and subsequently zzso In contrast, a 51 zzso zzso the anticipated size of the mature alpha 1 zzso was first detected at 4 days and increased throughout the culture zzso Additional studies demonstrated that the beta 2/3 and gamma 2 zzso were zzso at 2 days and attained zzso levels by 6 zzso The level of zzso zzso a measure of assembled zzso rose in parallel with the increases in the 51 zzso alpha 1, beta 2/3 and gamma 2 zzso Moreover, the 51 zzso alpha 1, beta zzso and gamma 2 zzso were associated in zzso zzso However, zzso studies demonstrated the presence of substantial zzso zzso zzso This finding suggest that only some of the zzso expressed in zzso zzso contribute to functional zzso receptors on the cell zzso
