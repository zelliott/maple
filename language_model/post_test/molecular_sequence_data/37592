Development of a transformation system in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso requires an zzso resistance gene in order to establish a zzso zzso The resistance gene for zzso B has often been used as a zzso marker in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso harboring the zzso resistance gene zzso was as sensitive to zzso B as the zzso zzso Nine zzso zzso were found in the zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso has been reported to be translated as zzso rather than zzso in zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso gene in zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is complementary to the zzso zzso showed that the sequence was highly similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso is read as zzso and not zzso These results suggested that the zzso gene was not functional due to the zzso usage of the zzso zzso Each of the nine zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso gene was changed to a zzso zzso which is read as zzso by zzso zzso When a zzso containing the zzso zzso gene zzso was constructed and introduced into zzso zzso zzso zzso were successfully zzso This zzso zzso resistance gene may be useful for direct selection of zzso zzso zzso
