zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso diffusion zzso family and is localized on the zzso zzso We investigated the zzso zzso of zzso by a zzso expression system in the zzso zzso zzso which lacked genes for zzso membrane zinc zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso was tolerant to 10 zzso zzso Active transport of zinc into zzso of living zzso cells expressing zzso was confirmed by the fluorescent zinc indicator zzso zzso transport was zzso analyzed by using zzso membrane zzso prepared from zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso Active zinc zzso depended on a pH zzso generated by zzso zzso zzso The activity was inhibited by zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso The zzso for zzso and zzso of zzso were determined to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We prepared a zzso zzso that lacked the major part (32 zzso from 185 to zzso of a long zzso zzso loop in the central part of zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso became zzso to high zzso of zzso and resistant to zzso The zzso and zzso values were increased zzso These results indicate that zzso functions as a zzso zzso in zzso and that a zzso region is not essential for zinc zzso We propose that a zzso loop functions as a zzso pocket of zzso and a sensor of the zinc level at the zzso zzso This loop may be involved in the maintenance of the level of zzso zzso
