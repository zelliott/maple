zzso proteins of zzso were analyzed by the comparison of two-dimensional zzso protein patterns of symbiotic and zzso strains of the zzso zzso zzso One protein was shown to be exclusively expressed in the zzso strain and three zzso including a zzso were characterized in the symbiotic strain zzso The zzso zzso zzso the two zzso zzso and zzso proteins of the zzso was zzso It was found to be very similar to the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso In zzso and ex zzso experiments of protein zzso demonstrated that almost zzso of the zzso protein synthesis ex zzso is focused on the zzso zzso Finally, we showed by northern zzso that heat shock at 38 degrees C results in zzso zzso zzso inside the zzso This work supports the hypothesis that zzso could have an essential zzso function in the maintenance of the symbiotic zzso
