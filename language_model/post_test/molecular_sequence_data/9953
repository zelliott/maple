To examine the role of the zzso acid zzso (between positions 258 and 275 and positions 297 and zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso promoter, we have carried out in zzso zzso experiments using a set of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggested the presence of a possible UP element associated with the zzso zzso zzso studies have revealed that an zzso sequence centered at zzso of the zzso promoter zzso functions like an UP zzso In zzso and in zzso analyses using a zzso zzso promoter carrying a disrupted putative UP element showed that this zzso sequence is responsible for interactions with the zzso which influence zzso in the absence of zzso zzso However, the putative UP element is not needed for zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso and zzso The results from in zzso studies indicated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are critical for interaction with the putative UP element of the zzso promoter and play major roles in zzso zzso zzso The zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also play important roles in zzso zzso Other zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to play less significant roles or no role in zzso of zzso zzso
