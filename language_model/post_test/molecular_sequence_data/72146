Resistance to zzso and zzso in the clinical isolate zzso zzso zzso is due to a zzso zzso zzso by an zzso gene and the zzso zzso of these zzso We have cloned and determined the zzso sequence of the gene responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso This gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso (the zzso of the zzso group in position 3 of the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was observed in both zzso coli and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso did not display any significant zzso with zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were found in 14 other clinical zzso of zzso zzso indicating the spread of the resistance trait in this zzso
