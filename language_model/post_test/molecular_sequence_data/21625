zzso function can be modified in various zzso For example, numerous studies have shown that currents through zzso zzso channels are affected by pore block or modification of zzso dependence of zzso Recent experiments performed on various zzso channels show that zzso zzso is an important mechanism for affecting channel zzso For instance, in zzso (formerly zzso channels, the zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso by an zzso zzso while zzso channels are prevented from closing by a zzso zzso zzso through an interaction with zzso located away from the selectivity zzso The recent evidence, therefore, suggests that in several zzso channels, the region around the outer mouth of the pore is rich in binding sites and could be exploited zzso These discoveries also suggest that the pharmacological vocabulary should be adapted to define these various zzso
