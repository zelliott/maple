zzso zzso zzso strains frequently carry resistance genes on zzso Recent studies focus heavily on large zzso zzso and the role that small plasmids play in resistance gene transfer is largely zzso To expand our previous studies in assessing the prevalence of the zzso harboring zzso plasmids carrying the zzso gene responsible for zzso resistance zzso zzso 102 zzso zzso zzso collected through the National zzso Resistance Monitoring System zzso in 2005 were screened by zzso using zzso primer zzso Thirty zzso were found to be positive for zzso zzso zzso from 23 zzso were able to zzso in zzso coli and were subjected to further zzso zzso mapping revealed three major zzso groups found in three or more zzso with each group consisting of two to three zzso The zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso were amplified by zzso zzso and showed four different zzso zzso The distribution of the zzso zzso groups in association with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and isolate source demonstrated a strong linkage of the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Due to their high copy number and mobility, the zzso plasmids may play a critical role in transmission of zzso resistance genes among enteric zzso and these findings warrant a close monitoring of this zzso zzso zzso
