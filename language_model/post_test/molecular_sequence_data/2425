We have identified sequences in the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso initiation sites which form specific complexes with nuclear factors of zzso and human origin and are also required for normal zzso and zzso zzso Four nuclear factor binding sites were identified within 400 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two others within 100 zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso factor bound to zzso and zzso with high affinity and with low affinity to zzso zzso and zzso which also bound with high affinity to other factors in crude nuclear zzso zzso zzso of sequences zzso of the zzso initiation site revealed that 109 zzso encompassing zzso and a zzso sequence were sufficient for zzso zzso The zzso binding site zzso of zzso was necessary for zzso zzso activity and the loss of this sequence resulted in enhanced zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso and zzso initiation sites are independently regulated and that the zzso binding site plays a central role in the normal usage of the zzso zzso
