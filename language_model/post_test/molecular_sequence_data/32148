The primary structure of a zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso was determined by combined zzso acid and DNA zzso zzso analysis of a zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed five putative zzso The first zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso containing an zzso signal zzso of 30 zzso zzso followed by the zzso acid sequence of the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso of 44 zzso zzso The second zzso zzso encodes the putative immunity protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso domain zzso and a hypothetical protein zzso The production and functional expression of zzso by zzso hosts suggest that zzso is the minimum requirement for production of biologically active zzso that zzso is most likely zzso by the general zzso zzso or zzso pathway, and that zzso is the immunity protein for zzso
