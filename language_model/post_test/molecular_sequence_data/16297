A novel zzso zzso has been isolated by differential screening of a zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is almost full zzso encodes a zzso of 124 zzso acids with an zzso zzso leader zzso No significant zzso with any known gene or protein has been zzso Northern zzso analysis has shown that the gene is expressed abundantly in the zzso and is not detected in any other zzso In zzso zzso revealed that the gene is expressed first in a zzso of zzso cone cells at zzso days of development and its later expression is confined to the zzso cells of the mature zzso The role of the gene is not currently known, but the presence of a signal zzso suggests that it may be a zzso zzso
