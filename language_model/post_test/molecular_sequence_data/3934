zzso is an zzso zzso factor essential for expression of the adult zzso zzso zzso is a zzso acid nuclear protein with an zzso zzso domain and a zzso DNA binding zzso The nuclear zzso signal zzso of zzso has not been zzso zzso We generated a series of zzso deletion and point zzso and assessed their zzso zzso Our results zzso the zzso to the zzso acid zzso acids zzso DNA binding domain that consists of three zzso zinc zzso All three zinc fingers are necessary for efficient nuclear zzso deletion of any individual finger results in zzso zzso Fusion of the three zinc fingers to green fluorescent protein zzso targeted zzso to the nucleus, demonstrating that the zinc finger domain is sufficient for nuclear zzso zzso containing zzso to zzso zzso that disrupt the structure of all three fingers retains appropriate nuclear zzso indicating that neither the zzso structure of the zinc fingers nor specific DNA binding are necessary for nuclear zzso We demonstrate that basic zzso within the fingers are the critical zzso for nuclear zzso zzso of these basic zzso to zzso resulted in zzso zzso The basic zzso of all zzso zzso zinc fingers are highly zzso therefore we propose that these basic zzso are a common zzso shared by all zzso family zzso
