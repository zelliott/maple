The St zzso which is present in nearly half of all zzso species, originates from the zzso zzso However, very little is known about the high molecular weight zzso zzso of zzso which are zzso by the St zzso In this paper, we report the isolation from zzso zzso of four sequences zzso zzso zzso of zzso The four genes were all small compared to standard zzso zzso All four sequences resemble zzso zzso rather than zzso However, their zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso which is present in all zzso but very few zzso zzso and their central repetitive zzso included some irregular zzso The indication is therefore that the zzso genes evolved earlier than other modern day zzso so that they represent an intermediate state in the divergence between zzso and zzso zzso No zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso
