We describe a new zzso reporting strategy in which zzso a well-known zzso activates a zzso group in a probe to convert it to a leaving zzso When a zzso zzso probe binds adjacent to a zzso zzso probe, zzso occurs, releasing the zzso and lighting up the zzso This signal change can be used to detect single zzso differences in DNA without zzso or zzso
