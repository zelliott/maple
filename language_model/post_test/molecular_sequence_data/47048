We investigated zzso zzso using molecular dynamics simulations zzso between a 10 zzso water layer model of the 434 zzso zzso protein DNA binding domain zzso zzso acids zzso and DNA of operator zzso and its zzso consisting of 28 zzso base zzso zzso bonding interactions were zzso In addition, van der zzso and zzso interaction energies were zzso zzso acids of the 434 zzso zzso DNA recognition zzso 3 formed both direct and water zzso hydrogen bonds at zzso zzso zzso base and backbone sites within the zzso DNA major groove zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso acids within the loop between zzso 3 and zzso 4 have strong zzso attraction to zzso zzso located within the central zzso of the minor groove between the zzso major groove zzso These interactions together induced significant structural changes in the operator DNA zzso by zzso of the central zzso base pairs and narrowing of the minor groove between the DNA major groove zzso Finally, these findings offer a code for site specific DNA recognition by the 434 zzso zzso zzso
