zzso and peptides can be zzso from the zzso zzso with zzso zzso to produce zzso acid zzso zzso Previous studies in our laboratory indicated that the use of zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso significantly improved the yields and reaction conditions and reduced the number of complicating side products zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study further explores the conditions for formation of the zzso by zzso and examines the zzso of these zzso derivatives into a shortened zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a model zzso and was treated with zzso zzso and zzso at 50 degrees C for 30 zzso and the zzso derivatives were isolated by zzso zzso and characterized by zzso The zzso derivatives were subjected to a variety of zzso conditions, and rate zzso for zzso were zzso zzso with zzso as reported originally by Stark zzso zzso 7, zzso was found to give excellent zzso of the terminal zzso zzso acid, but also led to the formation of stable zzso zzso of the shortened zzso which are poorly suited for subsequent rounds of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso under mild conditions zzso zzso at 50 degrees zzso was found to be more suitable for zzso sequence analysis by the zzso zzso The shortened zzso which could be isolated and subjected to a second round of degradation, and the released zzso zzso acid are formed in good yield zzso Several other small peptides containing 15 different zzso zzso acid side chains were also investigated in order to examine any interfering reactions that might occur when these side chains are encountered in a zzso degradation using the zzso zzso zzso yields of zzso were obtained for all the zzso acids examined with the following zzso low yields were obtained for zzso zzso or zzso and no zzso were obtained for zzso Pro or zzso zzso was found to form zzso zzso zzso at the penultimate position zzso during zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso under these conditions led to the formation of the expected shortened zzso zzso but also to the formation of a shortened zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso could be solved by minimizing the reaction time with zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
