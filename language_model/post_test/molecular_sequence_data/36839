zzso induced arthritis is an experimental animal model of inflammatory zzso that has many features of human zzso zzso Type II collagen is the major zzso protein of zzso cartilage and is a zzso protein which can be presented as an zzso under certain zzso To induce zzso type II collagen is injected zzso with complete zzso zzso zzso to zzso is dependent on the presence of the zzso zzso 1) the zzso zzso on the type II zzso 2) a class II zzso zzso on the accessory cell presenting the zzso zzso and 3) T cells expressing specific V beta chains in their zzso zzso and other zzso background genes also may play a role in zzso to zzso Both cell zzso and zzso immunity are involved in the zzso of zzso To date zzso that have modulated zzso include use of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso directed against specific cellular zzso All of these therapies are able to zzso disease to some extent but lack the specificity and efficacy to make them practical for widespread use in human zzso Most promising, is the use of zzso zzso directed against specific V beta zzso zzso This is potentially a very specific and effective therapy because it will affect only the cells involved in disease while leaving the host otherwise zzso zzso on the horizon include the use of synthetic peptides with sequences zzso to various regions on the zzso zzso and zzso to zzso the immune response and zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
