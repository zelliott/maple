zzso has been zzso to be an zzso zzso in zzso and zzso leading to base substitution hot spots, zzso zzso resulting from spontaneous zzso of zzso to zzso The possibility remains, however, that a second mechanism involving zzso of zzso with A might also contribute to base substitution zzso via zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso could involve preferential zzso of zzso opposite template zzso compared to zzso To investigate this possibility, we zzso a sequence containing zzso at a defined template zzso We compared the zzso of copying zzso versus C and the efficiency of extending mismatched base pairs at the zzso position using three DNA zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso zzso containing no zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso and mismatch extension efficiencies were observed only for the case of zzso reverse zzso zzso reverse zzso was observed to incorporate zzso 4 to zzso more efficiently opposite zzso than zzso zzso extension of a zzso over zzso zzso was also observed with a difference of about zzso In contrast to zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso showed no significant difference when copying either zzso or C sites or when extending zzso involving zzso and zzso zzso of zzso opposite either C or zzso was barely zzso using pol zzso although pol alpha has been observed to form zzso zzso in other zzso While we cannot completely exclude the possibility that zzso might be incorporated opposite zzso in preference to C, our results suggest that contributions of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso hot spots are likely to be minor, lending additional support to the model zzso zzso of zzso
