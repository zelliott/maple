zzso chain reaction zzso offers a simple and robust alternative platform for zzso acid amplification, but its application has been limited because the zzso products are mostly detected by gel zzso separation or zzso zzso In this paper, we report a novel homogeneous zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso as an indicator for detection of zzso zzso zzso For zzso we design two pairs of unique zzso zzso Each pair of zzso contains two adjacent zzso in which one probe is designed with zzso modification at its zzso and the other probe is labeled with zzso at its zzso After the zzso the two adjacent zzso are zzso to form one DNA strand with a zzso label at its zzso and zzso modification at its zzso which is resistant to the zzso I and zzso III zzso When the zzso is added, because of the strong zzso interactions between zzso and DNA, effective zzso resonance energy transfer zzso from the zzso to the zzso DNA can be zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso are zzso to the zzso by zzso I and zzso zzso Introduction of zzso leads to inefficient zzso results because much weaker zzso interactions between the zzso zzso and zzso keep the zzso far away from zzso zzso homogeneous zzso for zzso detection is performed zzso The method is sensitive and specific enough to detect 1 fM zzso zzso DNA zzso It is possible to zzso zzso and accurately determine the zzso frequency as low as zzso This proposed zzso strategy extends the application of zzso and provides a new platform for homogeneous detection of zzso
