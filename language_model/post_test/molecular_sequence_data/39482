The mating type zzso locus of the lentil zzso zzso zzso was cloned and characterized using zzso zzso zzso and inverse zzso with zzso designed to the zzso of zzso zzso A multiplex zzso zzso for mating type was developed based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were designed to specifically amplify zzso from several zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso Four hundred and fifty and 700 zzso fragments were amplified from zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and zzso size correlated perfectly with laboratory crosses using mating type tester zzso zzso zzso allowed rapid scoring of mating type in crude DNA extracts from geographically diverse population samples of zzso zzso from California and Washington State, zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso will be a valuable tool for studying the population structure, biology and epidemiology of these zzso
