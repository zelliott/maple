About zzso identity was observed between the deduced zzso acid sequences of a protein zzso by a gene of the zzso zzso virus zzso strain zzso and a 6 zzso protein of unknown function reported to be produced by an open reading frame expressed early after infection by the zzso Western Reserve zzso virus zzso the open reading frame is absent from zzso strain zzso zzso of sequences reported for zzso virus zzso strains Bangladesh, India, zzso 1970, zzso 1977 and zzso 1966 revealed each zzso a correlate 58 zzso acid zzso The open reading frame was not reported in the original analyses of these sequences because a lower limit of 60 zzso acids was used to identify potential zzso zzso zzso of partial reading frames reported for zzso virus zzso and zzso virus zzso suggested that these viruses might also code for a correlate of the zzso WR zzso DNA sequencing of cloned fragments of zzso and zzso confirmed that both these zzso zzso closely zzso full length zzso of the zzso and zzso open reading zzso The zzso zzso is coded in the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso open reading frame, which we reported is transcribed early zzso moreover, analysis of an zzso zzso showed zzso was zzso indicating that zzso like the zzso zzso is zzso for virus replication in cell zzso The zzso and zzso zzso have about zzso zzso acid sequence resemblance to African zzso fever virus DNA binding protein zzso suggesting an ancestral relation of zzso
