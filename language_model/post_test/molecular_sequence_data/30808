We have identified three different point zzso in the coding region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso Each zzso zzso with the disease in two- or zzso zzso and is not found on the normal zzso of any documented zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso is found in two independent families that contain at least one individual with a mild course of zzso All of these zzso replace charged zzso acids with less polar zzso and are found in the putative zzso sections of the zzso The zzso zzso acids are found to be zzso in both zzso and zzso and lie in a region of zzso that is believed to form a channel in the zzso Although these zzso are rare, they provide important clues to functionally important regions of the zzso
