zzso consist of a single zzso chain which is composed of three tandem zzso zzso Each zzso domain is an actual or putative protein inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso third zzso were already isolated and zzso from 126 species of birds zzso et zzso 1987, zzso This paper adds 27 new zzso A number of zzso are made on the basis of sequences from 153 zzso The zzso that are in contact with the zzso in zzso complexes are zzso zzso While the primary specificity zzso zzso is the most zzso zzso occur predominantly among zzso zzso zzso Consensus sequences for an avian zzso third domain, for a zzso zzso domain zzso a zzso terminal domain of zzso zzso and for a general zzso domain are zzso Finally, the individual new sequences are briefly zzso
