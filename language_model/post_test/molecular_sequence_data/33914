When zzso binds to cells, its zzso to zzso is markedly enhanced compared with the reaction in solution, suggesting that zzso on cell surfaces adopts a zzso distinct from that in zzso However, direct evidence for such zzso changes has not been zzso zzso we developed zzso zzso to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso changes on its interaction with zzso Six zzso zzso zzso 3 distinct zzso that zzso recognized zzso binding sites zzso in zzso were zzso The zzso also zzso recognized zzso bound to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso and zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso and identified zzso sequences containing zzso recognized by the zzso zzso a linear zzso within a domain linking zzso 1 and 2; a zzso zzso contained within the zzso 5 domain and the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso contained within the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Our results identify zzso zzso in soluble zzso that become available when zzso binds to cells and demonstrate that binding of zzso to cells zzso a zzso change in zzso distinct from that of zzso
