The zzso zzso is a G zzso zzso zzso and is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the three zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso indicates the existence of two essential zzso bridges zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso in the zzso segment and zzso in zzso and several specific zzso and zzso interactions zzso zzso and zzso Through molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, an energetically sound zzso hypothesis for the zzso has been calculated that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso the electron density map of zzso as a zzso zzso zzso and a truncated zzso zzso zzso may be zzso in the zzso both within the previously defined TM zzso and within two other regions of the zzso termed zzso sites, defined by the zzso zzso The first zzso site is located outside of the TM zzso between zzso and zzso and the second higher energy site is positioned immediately underneath zzso zzso at both the principal TM binding site and the lower energy zzso sites potentially affects the observed zzso zzso In zzso site I, the side chain of zzso zzso is within zzso distance zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso coordinates both zzso and zzso of the zzso chain, consistent with the zzso in potency of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso to zzso Moreover, the selective reduction in potency of zzso in zzso the zzso zzso zzso is consistent with the hypothesis of direct contact between zzso and zzso zzso Our findings support zzso binding to at least two distinct zzso of the zzso zzso both outside and within the TM zzso The two zzso bridges present in the human zzso zzso play a major role in the structure and stability of the zzso to zzso the zzso within the zzso specifically stretching the zzso over the opening of the TM zzso and thus defining the path of access to the binding zzso
