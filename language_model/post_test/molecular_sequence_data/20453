zzso peptides play an important role in zzso not only as tumor markers but also as transport zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso may serve as very effective delivery tools, as zzso Recently, zzso based on the human hormone zzso zzso have been zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences turned out to have highly efficient zzso zzso zzso these peptides with zzso would generate promising new tools for imaging and therapy applications in zzso However, the influence of the metal zzso on the zzso capacity of zzso has not been zzso yet in zzso In this study we zzso the zzso of zzso modified zzso peptides in zzso cells by using atomic zzso zzso zzso and compared the results to the zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, we measured different zzso rates depending on the attached zzso zzso modification with a zzso complex can have tremendous effects on the zzso zzso The results of these studies support the need of detailed analysis of each carrier zzso zzso especially in the field of metal complex modified zzso
