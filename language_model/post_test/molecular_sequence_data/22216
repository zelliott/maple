zzso of zzso cells zzso with zzso was shown to be effective in the generation of zzso T cells, probably due to the induction of a zzso T cell response directed against multiple zzso To verify this assumption we used zzso generated from zzso zzso or -positive donors, that were zzso with in zzso zzso (in zzso transcript, zzso coding for the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso an expansion of zzso zzso T zzso that recognize zzso zzso presented on different zzso zzso These T zzso are able to lyse zzso zzso with zzso peptides or zzso with the zzso zzso Furthermore, this approach allowed the identification of zzso zzso presented upon zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso with zzso zzso resulted in the induction of zzso T zzso zzso of zzso with zzso coding for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso T zzso specific for peptides derived from both zzso More importantly, zzso T cells could be generated in two of three zzso zzso Finally, functional zzso zzso zzso T zzso were successfully generated from zzso patients after zzso zzso stem cell zzso
