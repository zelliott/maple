To study the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso hearing loss, to carry out the clinical and molecular characterization of five Han Chinese zzso with zzso transmitted zzso and zzso hearing zzso 

Five zzso of zzso transmitted zzso and zzso hearing loss were collected, zzso DNA was zzso and complete zzso zzso and the gap junction protein beta 2 zzso gene were amplified and zzso 

Clinical evaluation revealed a wide range of severity, zzso and zzso zzso of hearing impairment in the zzso relatives in these zzso The zzso rates of hearing loss in these zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with an average of zzso when zzso deafness was zzso zzso analysis of the complete zzso zzso in these zzso identified the known zzso zzso and distinct sets of zzso zzso zzso belonging to Eastern Asian zzso zzso zzso zzso C1 and zzso zzso Of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resided at the highly conservative zzso However, there were no functionally significant zzso in zzso and zzso or secondary known zzso No hearing loss related zzso gene zzso was zzso 

The lack of significant zzso in the ruled out the possible involvement of zzso in the zzso expression of the zzso zzso in those affected zzso However, zzso zzso variations and other nuclear modifier genes may play an important role in the zzso manifestation of the zzso zzso in these Chinese zzso
