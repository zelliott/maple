zzso zzso proteins are intermediate filaments found in the zzso zzso zzso of these proteins is considered an important factor in the assembly of filaments and determination of filament caliber and zzso zzso zzso are composed of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which are zzso Here we used techniques for the mass zzso sequencing of proteins from zzso gels to analyze in zzso zzso sites on zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from rat brain and zzso zzso in zzso The resulting peptides were analyzed and sequence data obtained by zzso mass zzso Four zzso sites have been found in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two of these are found in zzso zzso motifs and two in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 55 in zzso was not found to be zzso which confirms the possible role of zzso and zzso of this site in early zzso zzso The techniques used enable sequence data and characterization of zzso modifications to be obtained for each individual zzso directly from zzso zzso
