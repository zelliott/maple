An zzso to the zzso zzso calcium channels, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was cloned from zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrating that this gene predates the evolution of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein displays all structural features typical for zzso zzso including three zzso repeats, six zzso zzso and a putative pore region between TM V and TM zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso canine kidney zzso cells confirmed that the channel mediates zzso zzso zzso was also permeable to zzso and, to a small extent, to the zzso zzso Thus, in addition to a role in zzso zzso zzso might serve as a zzso for zinc and iron zzso zzso zzso was highly abundant in the zzso but sparsely present in the zzso zzso zzso via zzso in zzso may be subject to the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso as consensus zzso regulatory elements for the respective steroid hormone receptors were found in the upstream regulatory region of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is very zzso when compared with zzso zzso Only one zzso gene seems to exist in the zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding protein clusters together with zzso from zzso upon zzso zzso Thus, the two zzso zzso genes may originate from a single ancestral zzso gene in zzso appearing early in zzso
