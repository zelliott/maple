The genetic causes of zzso zzso zzso are largely zzso A nuclear zzso zzso (also called zzso factor 1), is a key zzso regulator of genes involved in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes zzso disorders of sex development, with or without adrenal failure, but growing experimental evidence from studies in mice suggests a key role for this factor in zzso development and function as zzso 

To test the hypothesis that zzso in zzso cause disorders of zzso development and function, we zzso zzso in four families with histories of both zzso disorders of sex development and zzso primary zzso zzso and in 25 subjects with sporadic zzso zzso None of the affected subjects had clinical signs of adrenal zzso 

Members of each of the four families and 2 of the 25 subjects with isolated zzso zzso carried zzso in the zzso zzso zzso deletions and zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso studies indicated that these zzso substantially impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with a range of zzso anomalies, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso primary zzso zzso We did not observe these zzso in more than 700 control zzso 

zzso zzso are associated with zzso primary zzso zzso and zzso disorders of sex zzso
