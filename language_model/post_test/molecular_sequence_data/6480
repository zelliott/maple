Four zzso motifs are known that zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso all discovered in natural zzso In a single in zzso selection experiment we have isolated representatives of five novel classes of zzso zzso Small versions of three of these showed that a very simple internal loop type of secondary structure is responsible for the zzso One of these was zzso in a zzso form, and compared directly with the zzso zzso for the new zzso the zzso step of the reaction is much faster than the spontaneous rate of zzso bond zzso yet substantially slower than that for the zzso The results suggest that many more zzso zzso zzso sequences can be zzso
