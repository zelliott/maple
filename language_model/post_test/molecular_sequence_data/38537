A dominant zzso of the zzso zzso gene of the mushroom zzso zzso zzso affects pattern formation in the development of fruit body zzso causing zzso zzso which culminate in mature fruit bodies with short zzso zzso analyses revealed zzso of tissue organization and cell zzso in the primordial zzso and suggested that the defects in the primordial zzso interfere with differentiation of the zzso tissue in the zzso zzso The zzso locus was assigned to zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso library as a zzso zzso that brings about the dominant zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a novel type of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and is zzso zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso deletion in the zzso region of the zzso leading to zzso of zzso 18 zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso affects the activity of the zzso zzso
