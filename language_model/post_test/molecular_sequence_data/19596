To identify proteins that are involved in zzso degradation and processing in zzso zzso zzso we zzso proteins with zzso activity by classical zzso zzso One of these proteins showed strong zzso to the zzso initiation factor zzso zzso and was accordingly named zzso initiation factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to be involved in zzso turnover and to bind zzso zzso of zzso is required for zzso binding of zzso This unique zzso modification is restricted to zzso and zzso The exact function of zzso in zzso turnover remained zzso Here we show for the first time that zzso from zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso adjacent to A zzso zzso zzso binding could be shown for zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso but not from zzso coli, while both proteins possess zzso zzso activity, indicating that zzso of zzso is required for zzso binding but not for its zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso form of zzso also shows zzso activity while the unmodified protein does zzso Charged zzso acids in the zzso domain of zzso as well as in the zzso domain, which is highly similar to the cold shock protein A zzso an zzso zzso of zzso coli, are important for zzso zzso zzso zzso our results reveal that activity of zzso depends on its zzso zzso
