We analyzed bacterial communities in two cow zzso zzso derived from the same feed zzso and composted in the same location, but composted with different carbon amendments, and in zzso zzso mixes amended with these zzso zzso communities were characterized by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso analysis of extracted zzso and population fingerprints generated for each sample were zzso zzso analyses of dominant zzso bands revealed that members of the zzso zzso were the most dominant bacteria detected in this study (19 of 31 zzso These analyses demonstrate that bacterial community profiles of individual zzso were highly similar, as were profiles of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso mix profiles differed substantially from the original zzso profiles and from that of the zzso zzso These data indicate that highly similar bacterial populations were active in the two zzso and suggest that the effects of the initial carbon amendment on the mature zzso bacterial communities were minor, while factors such as the feed zzso and composting location may have been more zzso
