The zzso editing of the zzso disease virus zzso P gene has been studied by sequence analysis of cloned viral zzso zzso and zzso Evidence has been obtained for the specific zzso of zzso G zzso the consequence of which is the generation of three populations of P zzso zzso The three populations zzso proteins zzso V and zzso which have a common zzso region, but which zzso three different reading frames at their C zzso Paradoxically, zzso zzso its P gene zzso by the zzso of zzso G zzso in a manner similar to zzso and zzso viruses zzso zzso despite its apparent closer evolutionary relationship to the zzso virus type 5, zzso and related group of viruses which edit a V zzso sequence to generate an zzso to zzso a functional P protein zzso zzso
