zzso are highly specialized innate immune zzso cells that evolved for zzso host zzso In response to inflammatory stimuli and zzso they form zzso zzso traps zzso which capture and kill zzso zzso zzso zzso formation zzso humans to severe infection, but, zzso zzso zzso formation contributes to inflammatory vascular injury and tissue zzso The molecular pathways and signaling mechanisms that control zzso formation remain largely zzso Using primary human zzso and genetically manipulated zzso zzso differentiated to surrogate zzso we found that zzso target of zzso zzso regulates zzso formation by zzso control of expression of zzso factor 1 zzso zzso a critical zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing, zzso of zzso and protein zzso and analysis of zzso deployment by live cell imaging and quantitative zzso release showed that zzso controls zzso formation and translation of zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso and genetic zzso of zzso expression and activity inhibited zzso deployment, and zzso of zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso bacterial zzso Our studies define a zzso to zzso formation involving 2 master regulators of immune cell function and identify potential points of molecular intervention in strategies to modify zzso in zzso
