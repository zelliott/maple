zzso zzso has a potential as zzso agent against a range of plant pathogens on the basis of production of zzso zzso zzso competition for space and zzso or various combinations of zzso To explore genes expressed in zzso zzso a zzso library was constructed from zzso and zzso expressed sequence tags zzso were zzso zzso analysis enabled the identification of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso singleton zzso zzso functions were assigned to zzso zzso that exhibited strong similarity to zzso in public databases zzso containing genes involved in cellular zzso molecular function, and biological zzso Other zzso zzso representing novel genes showed no significant similarity to public database resource of zzso A proportion of genes was identified related to degradation of pathogen cell wall, zzso zzso production, as was estimated in the zzso zzso The paper described is a first step towards the knowledge of the zzso zzso zzso The results present the useful application of zzso analysis on zzso zzso and provide a preliminary indication of gene expression zzso involved in zzso
