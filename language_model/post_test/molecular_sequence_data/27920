The zzso segment which zzso into zzso zzso zzso under zzso condition was zzso labeled with zzso zzso zzso which had been zzso into the zzso interior of the zzso The zzso labeled zzso acid zzso were identified by zzso zzso of the zzso complex, extraction and zzso degradation of the membrane embedded zzso The results are consistent with a notion that the segment exists in the membrane as an zzso and that only one surface of this zzso is exposed to the zzso interior of the zzso zzso models are: zzso a loop of tightly held zzso penetrating deep into the zzso and zzso the zzso being located on the interface between zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso labeling process revealed that the middle part of this segment goes into the zzso first and is then followed by both zzso The penetration rate is comparable to that of the fusion of the zzso zzso of the same composition by zzso at the same zzso which further supports that the penetration is the cause of zzso
