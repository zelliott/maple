The four zzso zzso integral membrane zzso identified so far constitute a discrete family of zzso zzso zzso that are linked to the cell surface via zzso zzso In addition to the zzso anchor and substitution with zzso zzso the members of this family show significant sequence zzso and share a unique and characteristic zzso zzso Starting from an zzso entry that showed significant sequence similarity to zzso and zzso zzso respectively, for human and rat zzso we have isolated a human zzso coding for zzso a novel member of this zzso zzso The gene for this novel zzso zzso maps to zzso In the adult, it is primarily expressed in brain zzso
