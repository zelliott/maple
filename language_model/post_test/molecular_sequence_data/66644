zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso is a member of the nuclear zzso family of zzso factors and is recognized as the molecular target of the zzso zzso zzso zzso promote zzso zzso by inducing genes involved in fatty acid zzso In zzso this is accompanied by zzso zzso and after chronic dosing zzso whereas zzso studies suggest these adverse events are lacking in zzso zzso such as rats and mice appear particularly sensitive to zzso zzso proliferation while humans are zzso These findings question the utility of zzso models for safety monitoring of experimental zzso zzso and highlight the need for additional zzso models that display greater zzso relevance for human zzso Thus we have focused on zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso proliferation by understanding the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso promoter, the zzso step of zzso zzso We have chosen the zzso monkey as a model that is modestly responsive to zzso proliferation and functionally characterized it against the highly responsive rat and zzso human zzso We report the identification of a putative zzso zzso response element zzso within the zzso zzso zzso promoter of the zzso monkey zzso zzso zzso of these promoters using a series of zzso active, zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso within the zzso zzso and human zzso promoters are zzso to zzso whereas the rat zzso is highly zzso These findings were verified in zzso using a small zzso zzso zzso Taken together, we demonstrate zzso regulation of the zzso promoter by zzso in zzso monkeys and humans and suggest that this model is superior to zzso models with respect to zzso evaluation of zzso zzso
