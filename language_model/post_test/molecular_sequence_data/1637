To construct a zzso zzso system and isolate zzso zzso 

A zzso promoter region of zzso from zzso zzso was cloned by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that typical binding sites for several zzso factors in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are located in the zzso To isolate zzso zzso factors, the reporter zzso of a zzso zzso system was constructed on the backbone of the zzso zzso containing the zzso selective marker, with the zzso promoter region and zzso zzso zzso as a reporter zzso The reporter gene contained zzso minimal promoter zzso The zzso zzso zzso strain containing the reporter zzso was transformed with a zzso zzso expression zzso library, and 34 zzso were collected from zzso zzso The isolation of the gene zzso from several zzso showed that the zzso system approach was zzso Then, zzso 59 zzso zzso of zzso was zzso in zzso coli zzso 

The zzso zzso system is suitable for zzso zzso factors of zzso zzso zzso II is a main and universal zzso zzso that controls zzso and zzso zzso regulation in zzso zzso
