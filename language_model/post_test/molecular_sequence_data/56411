In zzso conversion of zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli to zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso was labeled with zzso and then administered zzso to zzso Blood was sampled periodically for 6 zzso The plasma zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were similar to those of human mature zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso In zzso conversion of zzso zzso to mature zzso zzso was examined by zzso of the zzso focusing zzso slab zzso zzso the HDL fraction from each sampling point was zzso applied to zzso It was found that the zzso of zzso zzso migrated to more zzso zzso the conversion was complete within 24 zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso Although the plasma zzso zzso of both human pro zzso zzso and mature zzso zzso were significantly steeper than those of rabbit mature zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively), the conversion rate of human zzso zzso to mature zzso zzso in rabbit was assumed to be zzso In zzso incubation of zzso zzso with rabbit serum produced mature zzso zzso zzso as determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence at the zzso zzso of rabbit zzso zzso showed that the zzso consisted of an alpha zzso with a high probability of a beta turn at zzso which is close to that in zzso Thus, zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is an zzso event, zzso the converting zzso in rabbits can also process human zzso zzso zzso this converting zzso does not specifically and directly attack the zzso bond which links the zzso zzso of the zzso to the zzso zzso of human mature zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and a beta turn at zzso may have a key role in this zzso and zzso the examination of zzso zzso in rabbits helps to explain the early events of HDL zzso
