A bovine zzso clone that zzso to zzso beta zzso was isolated and fragments containing the beta 1, beta 2 and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso regions were zzso Comparisons of these zzso zzso sequences and derived zzso acid sequences to human class II zzso sequences showed that this gene is only zzso identical to zzso beta and about zzso identical to bovine zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences were more divergent from other class II zzso zzso However, structural features such as zzso zzso and regions of zzso acids strongly suggest this to be a class II zzso zzso When zzso fragments were used as zzso zzso on Southern blots of bovine zzso DNA zzso with zzso zzso or zzso II, each zzso zzso to a single zzso Based on these results we have referred to this gene as a novel bovine class II zzso zzso zzso
