The solution structure of zzso K zzso zzso a protein consisting of one zzso chain with 57 zzso zzso from the zzso of the black zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso On the basis of virtually complete zzso zzso zzso assignments, including individual assignments for 38 pairs of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a total of zzso nuclear zzso effect distance constraints and 123 zzso angle constraints were zzso Using this zzso the solution structure of zzso K was calculated with the program zzso and refined by restrained zzso with a modified version of the program zzso The average zzso zzso zzso relative to the mean atomic zzso of the 20 zzso selected to represent the solution structure is zzso A for all backbone atoms zzso C alpha and zzso and zzso A for all zzso of zzso 2 to zzso The solution structure of zzso K is very similar to the solution structure of the basic pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso and the X-ray crystal structure of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso A and zzso A, respectively, for the backbone atoms of zzso 2 to zzso Some local structural differences between zzso K and zzso are directly related to the fact that zzso interactions with two of the four internal molecules of zzso water in zzso are replaced by zzso hydrogen bonds in zzso zzso
