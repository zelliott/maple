This publication marks the beginning of the construction of a zzso index that relates proteins which are resolved on the two-dimensional protein map of zzso zzso with their corresponding zzso We report the identification of 36 novel zzso spots on the zzso protein zzso They zzso to the products of 26 zzso Together with the zzso spots previously identified, this raises to 41 the number of genes whose products have been identified on the protein zzso The proteins identified here are concerned with four major areas of zzso cellular zzso carbon zzso heat zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso Given the molecular weight and zzso point of the identified zzso and the zzso bias of the corresponding zzso it can be estimated that 25 to zzso of all the soluble zzso proteins are zzso under the zzso and running gel conditions used in this zzso
