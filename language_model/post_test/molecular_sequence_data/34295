: There are few studies on zzso zzso and primary and secondary zzso drug resistance zzso in zzso samples in zzso We analyzed zzso zzso diversity and prevalence of zzso associated with zzso in men who have sex with men in all five regions of zzso 

: Using zzso zzso we recruited zzso men who have sex with men in nine zzso 299 zzso were zzso 143 subjects had adequate zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso subjects were zzso zzso zzso and 99 zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso the reverse zzso and zzso regions of the virus and analyzed them for drug resistant zzso using World Health Organization zzso 

: The most common zzso were B zzso C zzso and zzso forms zzso The overall prevalence of primary zzso resistance was zzso zzso among the zzso and secondary zzso was zzso zzso among the zzso The prevalence of resistance to zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The most common resistance zzso for zzso reverse zzso zzso was zzso (17 zzso and for zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso (16 zzso 

: Our data suggest a high level of both primary and secondary zzso in men who have sex with men in zzso Additional studies are needed to identify the zzso and causes of zzso therapy resistance to limit the development of resistance among those in care and the transmission of resistant strains in the wider zzso
