The major protein of bovine seminal zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that exists as a zzso zzso under native zzso The zzso state of this zzso varies with zzso strength and the presence of zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso on the zzso plasma membrane results in an zzso of cholesterol and zzso zzso which is an important step in zzso zzso In this study, zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso was used to analyze zzso zzso from bovine seminal zzso In addition to the previously known zzso zzso four new sequence zzso were identified by zzso mass zzso For example, a protein zzso containing point zzso zzso and zzso was identified along with another form having a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Two other minor zzso could also be identified from the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is naturally produced as a mixture of several protein forms, most of which have not been detected in previous zzso Native mass zzso revealed that zzso is exclusively zzso at low protein zzso suggesting that the protein zzso are zzso bound and can easily be zzso zzso binding to zzso was also investigated, and it was observed that two molecules of zzso bind to each zzso zzso consistent with previous zzso
