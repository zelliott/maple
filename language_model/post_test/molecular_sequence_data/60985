zzso zzso and zzso interactions direct the growth of zzso zzso to their host root zzso These elaborate mechanisms lead to the differentiation of distinct zzso structures, the zzso and the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the use of two-dimensional gel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis has demonstrated the differential expression of cell wall proteins zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso during symbiotic zzso In other zzso these zzso have been suggested to play a role in zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso The recent cloning of the genes for several of these zzso in zzso zzso allows us to address their function in zzso This review summarizes our knowledge of zzso in zzso zzso and considers parallels with other zzso zzso as a possible framework for future zzso
