The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the activity of zzso zzso zzso calcium release zzso it zzso the activity of cardiac zzso zzso channels with high affinity and activates skeletal zzso zzso channels with low zzso The C terminal domain of zzso zzso alone physically binds to zzso and zzso its activity, but it does not bind to zzso We have now used zzso zzso analysis, chemical zzso intrinsic zzso zzso and zzso release studies to determine that the binding site for zzso is in divergent region 3 zzso of zzso The D3 region encompasses zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso shows the binding primarily involves zzso interactions with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all zzso that are present in zzso but not in zzso The significant sequence differences between the D3 regions of zzso and zzso explain why zzso specifically zzso zzso This specific zzso of zzso could zzso zzso cycling and be useful for the treatment of heart zzso zzso zzso during zzso may improve filling of the zzso with zzso and improve zzso
