zzso zzso protein zzso a functional zzso is critical for the formation of zzso which are exclusive sites for replication and packaging of the segmented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As a component of replication zzso zzso is also implicated in various zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities, zzso exhibits zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activities that are zzso by a zzso zzso zzso within a narrow zzso zzso Lack of a zzso zzso is a common feature of the zzso zzso zzso of the packaged zzso segments in zzso zzso all zzso (of group A zzso have a zzso zzso zzso zzso As the only zzso protein with zzso zzso activity, zzso is implicated in the removal of the zzso from the zzso zzso To understand how zzso despite its zzso zzso property, recognizes zzso to zzso the zzso within the zzso zzso we determined a crystal structure of zzso in complex with the zzso consensus sequence of zzso zzso zzso Our studies show that the zzso zzso of the bound zzso interacts extensively with highly zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Although these zzso provide zzso zzso surface zzso resonance studies suggest that the zzso zzso and other basic zzso outside the zzso zzso account for zzso zzso binding of zzso A novel observation from our studies, which may have implications in zzso formation, is that the zzso zzso of zzso exhibits two distinct zzso and engages in zzso zzso which result in the formation of zzso zzso zzso
