The T cell zzso within a native zzso comprise the zzso zzso which are efficiently processed and zzso and the zzso zzso which are poorly processed and zzso if at zzso However, cryptic zzso can induce potent T cell responses in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso lie in between these two zzso The above hierarchy of zzso is of relevance both in defining the zzso of a native zzso and in tolerance induction to self zzso Using the zzso model system, we have studied both the structural context of zzso hierarchy as well as its influence in shaping of the T cell repertoire, and in the induction of zzso In addition, we have examined the T cell response to zzso of individual members of hybrid F1 mouse zzso Our results demonstrate that: zzso each region within zzso zzso zzso zzso is potentially available upon zzso zzso zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso can be modulated by zzso zzso the core zzso zzso the hierarchy of zzso within mouse zzso zzso has a significant influence on shaping of the T cell repertoire directed against this self zzso zzso the zzso relationship of a given zzso within zzso respectively, might be of significance in the induction of zzso and zzso hybrid F1 mice show a broad zzso of response to zzso in comparison to the parental zzso The results of these studies would be of significance in better understanding of the zzso of human zzso zzso
