zzso infection of host cells activates a set of cellular zzso including zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso defense and immune zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso of a member of the human zzso zzso required zzso of the zzso zzso factors zzso factor zzso and zzso B via zzso zzso In the present study, we further characterized the regulatory control of zzso zzso during virus infection using in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the related zzso and zzso B are identified as important in zzso binding factors required for the cooperative induction of zzso zzso after virus zzso Using zzso or zzso cells, we demonstrate that the zzso and strength of zzso zzso zzso are highly dependent on the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Use of dominant negative zzso of either I zzso zzso or zzso demonstrate that disruption of either zzso dramatically zzso the ability of the other to bind and activate zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso leads to synergistic zzso of zzso promoter zzso These studies reveal a model of zzso zzso promoter zzso that involves cooperative zzso between zzso and zzso B zzso
