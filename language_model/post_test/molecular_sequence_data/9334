In the present study, to clarify the role of protein zzso C zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso we examined the regulation mechanism of zzso expression in human zzso zzso cells, an in zzso skeletal muscle zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso a zzso zzso for 24 h resulted in a zzso increase in the amount of zzso acid in the growth zzso In parallel to an increase in zzso acid release from zzso cells, the level of zzso zzso and protein were also significantly increased in zzso zzso A zzso zzso study indicated that zzso stimulation of zzso expression can be zzso through a novel zzso zzso especially zzso Moreover, zzso a selective zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso and zzso analysis suggested that the potential zzso elements zzso played a major role in the observed zzso of zzso expression by zzso Furthermore, we found that small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso promoter zzso Our results show that the effects of zzso on zzso expression are zzso through an indirect zzso partially involving zzso and zzso zzso zzso
