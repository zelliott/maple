zzso is a zzso zzso that plays a critical role in cell survival and zzso Three zzso of zzso have been identified and have been shown to be zzso in human zzso We examined the requirement of these pathways for zzso zzso We generated zzso cells zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso These cells are able to form colonies in zzso and zzso cells formed tumors in zzso zzso zzso efficiently inhibited the zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso growth of both zzso cells, demonstrating the importance of the zzso zzso for transformation by zzso as well as by zzso Moreover, zzso dramatically inhibited the tumor formation by zzso cells in zzso zzso Thus, we demonstrated the importance of zzso zzso zzso in the transformation by zzso both in zzso cells and in animal tumor zzso In contrast, neither the zzso zzso nor the zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso transformation of zzso zzso
