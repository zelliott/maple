We have generated two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the alpha zzso of an zzso bovine zzso zzso channel, alpha zzso The region in which these zzso lie is in the large zzso loop immediately before the second zzso domain zzso of the zzso We have found that when membrane zzso prepared from zzso zzso expressing either zzso or zzso alpha zzso are incorporated into zzso zzso zzso the gating pattern, zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity of the zzso channel are all altered as compared to the zzso zzso The zzso channels exhibit either a reduction or a complete lack of its characteristic zzso behavior, significantly reduced zzso zzso and an approximately zzso decrease in the apparent zzso equilibrium zzso constant zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso was not affected by either zzso On the other hand, both zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso were significantly more permeable to zzso as compared to wild zzso These observations identify a zzso region between zzso acid zzso zzso and 516 of alpha zzso as being important to the regulation of fundamental channel zzso
