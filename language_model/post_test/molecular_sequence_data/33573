zzso changes contributing to zzso differences within or between species have been identified for a handful of traits, but the relationship between zzso underlying zzso zzso and zzso divergence is largely zzso We found that zzso changes in the tan zzso as well as changes linked to the zzso zzso contribute to pigmentation divergence between closely related zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso linked to tan and zzso fixed in one zzso species also contribute to variation within another species, and that multiple zzso zzso similar zzso even within the same zzso These zzso appear to zzso zzso which suggests that standing genetic variation present in the common zzso gave rise to both zzso zzso and zzso zzso
