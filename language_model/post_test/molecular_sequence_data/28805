Known sequence motifs containing key zzso zzso can drive the zzso of zzso zzso To find other zzso a zzso library of zzso zzso was generated in which zzso was zzso The zzso system, which measures zzso zzso association in the zzso coli inner zzso was used to select zzso zzso sequences in this zzso The two most frequently occurring motifs were zzso and zzso zzso zzso of any one of the zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso abolished zzso indicating that the interaction between these positions is specific and requires an extended motif of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling of these sequences produced several chemically plausible structures that contain multiple hydrogen bonds between the zzso and zzso zzso While single zzso or zzso zzso do not appear to promote zzso association, motifs can drive strong and specific association through a cooperative network of zzso hydrogen zzso
