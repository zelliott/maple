zzso zzso zzso zzso are required for the exchange of zzso and zzso across the inner zzso zzso They are essential for life, and most zzso have at least two different zzso zzso Only one gene had been described from zzso and this had not been characterized zzso We show that zzso in this gene zzso to the previously described zzso zzso and zzso Immediately adjacent to this gene is another zzso a second zzso zzso which has zzso identity to that zzso by zzso These two genes are transcribed from a common promoter, and their zzso are produced by differential zzso zzso and zzso suggested that the zzso zzso gene corresponded to zzso a gene identified by an zzso that zzso otherwise zzso zzso hybrids between zzso zzso and its sibling zzso This hypothesis is not supported by our study of the zzso genes of zzso zzso
