A major obstacle to creating precisely expressed zzso lies in the zzso effects of the host zzso that surrounds zzso Here we present a strategy to overcome this problem, employing a zzso zzso zzso to systematically zzso position effects of host zzso and the ability of zzso to counteract these effects at zzso integration zzso randomly distributed throughout the zzso zzso We identify zzso that can be exploited to deliver precise doses of zzso expression to specific zzso Moreover, we uncover a previously zzso property of the gypsy zzso zzso to boost gene expression to levels zzso greater than at most or possibly all zzso zzso in every tissue zzso These findings provide the first opportunity to create a battery of zzso that can be reliably expressed at high levels in virtually any tissue by integration at a single zzso and conversely, to engineer a controlled zzso zzso series by exploiting several zzso The zzso of our approach makes it adaptable to other model systems to identify and modify zzso for optimal zzso zzso
