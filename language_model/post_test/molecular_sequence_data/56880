zzso zzso a skeletal muscle sodium channel specific blocker, was zzso by the solution zzso The whole zzso which is composed of 22 zzso acid zzso including six zzso and three zzso zzso was constructed from three zzso After removal of all protecting groups, the zzso zzso was subjected to an zzso folding reaction at a zzso concentration of 1 zzso zzso zzso Three major products 1, 2 and 3 were formed in a ratio of zzso zzso of the zzso structures in each product revealed them to be zzso zzso with similar zzso in the latter zzso Study of the biological activities of the three products in mice indicated that only product 1, which is a minor zzso has the same potency as the natural zzso Analysis of the folding process at a zzso concentration of 1 zzso zzso M showed that the zzso bond between zzso and zzso was initially formed, thus leading to the zzso generation of products 2 and zzso The optimal conditions for the formation of product 1 zzso zzso were obtained by increasing the zzso concentration in the zzso reaction mixture or by using zzso zzso both of which functioned as promoters for the zzso exchange reaction of the mismatched zzso bond between zzso and zzso
