zzso zzso catalyze the transfer of a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso to a nascent zzso chain via an zzso zzso Although many genes coding for zzso zzso have been zzso the zzso from rabbit and zzso are the best zzso The fungus zzso zzso accumulates zzso during exponential growth, and zzso it at the onset of stationary phase, or when placed at high temperature or starved for zzso Through a zzso methodology, the zzso zzso coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated, and the zzso acid sequence of the protein was zzso The product of the zzso seems to be the only zzso zzso present in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed that it codes for a zzso acids zzso which is very similar to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Gene expression increased during exponential growth, reaching its zzso level at the end of the exponential growth phase, which is consistent with the pattern of zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso is highly regulated at the zzso zzso Under culture conditions that induce heat zzso zzso and carbon zzso expression of the zzso gene was zzso and zzso zzso activity and zzso content behaved zzso
