The 14 species of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are invariably zzso by zzso species zzso zzso which in turn reproduce in the zzso zzso They are distributed mostly in zzso Africa, zzso and the zzso and zzso Islands, but 1 species extends its geographical range all over the Oriental zzso zzso relationships are usually strictly species specific, but exceptions to the zzso rule occur within the group we zzso In order to understand both the zzso history of the zzso species associated with zzso of the zzso zzso and the origins of the specificity breakdown cases, we have used zzso b sequences to reconstruct a zzso of the zzso zzso The results show that the zzso from the zzso region and those from zzso Africa form two distinct zzso which probably zzso after the crossing of the zzso Channel by an ancestral zzso The Oriental zzso species show strong affinities with the African zzso The two zzso exceptions are due to different evolutionary zzso The occurrence of the two West African zzso associated with zzso sur can be explained by successive zzso events of the zzso partner without plant zzso In contrast, we zzso that zzso zzso shifted by horizontal transfer from an unknown, presumably zzso zzso species to zzso zzso after this native zzso zzso species zzso zzso
