The zzso zzso zzso an zzso catalyzing zzso zzso of zzso to zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli, and zzso The single open reading frame translates into a protein of zzso containing zzso zzso zzso It shows 82, 77, and zzso identity with zzso zzso human, and zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso shows the signature sequence motif zzso which defines not only the class II zzso family but also a much broader zzso of proteins containing zzso zzso The coding region was cloned into zzso zzso expression zzso and transformed into zzso coli zzso Star zzso The protein after induction was expressed at high levels, almost zzso of the soluble zzso zzso to near zzso and appears identical to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso
