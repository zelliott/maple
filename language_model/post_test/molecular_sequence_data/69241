In order to investigate the molecular basis for the regulated expression of zzso zzso inhibitor type 2 zzso we sought to identify zzso nuclear factors which interact with the zzso zzso We have explored the application of zzso zzso mapping as an approach for identifying specific zzso interactions and targeting potential regulatory DNA zzso The procedure involves an initial global screening of a crude preparation of nuclear proteins with zzso DNA fragments zzso zzso derived from a large region zzso zzso of zzso The bound DNA fragments are zzso and their location within zzso mapped by Southern zzso zzso zzso We have used this procedure to examine the differential binding of nuclear factors from the zzso zzso cell in the absence and in the presence of the zzso agent, zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to identify proteins that bind specifically to the zzso zzso promoter region and first zzso of zzso Eleven zzso proteins ranging in molecular mass from 27 to 92 zzso were identified, and the results define three regions of the gene which contain zzso sites which may be involved in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso analysis using a series of zzso deletion zzso spanning zzso fused to a zzso zzso reporter gene zzso demonstrates that two of the regions identified by zzso zzso mapping contain elements which can function to zzso zzso expression in transient zzso of zzso zzso
