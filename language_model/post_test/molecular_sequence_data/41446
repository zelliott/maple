zzso heart disease zzso is the most common birth defects in zzso The genetic causes for zzso remain largely zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso a zzso regulator, plays a critical role in the heart zzso zzso in the coding regions of zzso gene have been associated to zzso deletion syndrome with cardiac defects and isolated zzso cases, including zzso zzso zzso zzso To date, zzso gene promoter region has not been analyzed and reported in zzso zzso We hypothesized that the sequence zzso within zzso gene promoter region may change zzso levels and mediate zzso zzso In this study, the promoter regions of zzso gene were genetically and functionally analyzed in 280 zzso patients and 267 healthy zzso Two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in two zzso patients, but in none of zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found more frequent in zzso patients than controls zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that these sequence zzso significantly enhanced zzso activities of zzso gene zzso zzso the sequence zzso within zzso gene promoter may contribute to the zzso zzso by altering the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso or genetic manipulation of zzso gene expression may provide a novel personalized therapy to prevent and treat late cardiac complications for the adult zzso patients carrying these zzso
