zzso is a key zzso factor for regulatory zzso zzso We report the crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain, through which a loose or transient zzso association is formed and zzso accounting for the activity variations introduced by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso function zzso and zzso In particular, we identified human zzso zzso and zzso as key zzso for the zzso change and stability of the zzso zzso which can be regulated by protein zzso modifications such as zzso zzso zzso These studies provide structural and zzso explanations for certain zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso that are commonly found in zzso zzso Overall, the regulatory machinery involving zzso zzso and zzso has been zzso defining atomic insights into the biological and pathological characteristics of the zzso zzso
