In this study, we characterized candidate rare outer membrane zzso proteins with apparent molecular masses of 19, 27, 38, and zzso zzso which had been identified previously in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso and internal zzso acid zzso a probe for the zzso candidate was zzso amplified and used to screen a zzso zzso zzso library in Lambda zzso zzso The corresponding gene zzso zzso a zzso for zzso zzso proteins zzso which reduce zzso zzso A zzso zzso derived from the N zzso of the zzso protein was used to zzso amplify a duplex probe from a zzso zzso zzso library in zzso II zzso With this probe, the corresponding gene zzso was identified and found to code for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso that zzso assists the folding of proteins within the zzso zzso zzso zzso The N zzso of the zzso candidate was blocked to zzso zzso However, internal sequence data revealed that it was basic membrane protein zzso a previously zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso phase zzso revealed that despite its name, zzso is zzso and therefore likely to be zzso The final candidate was also blocked to zzso degradation; as before, a duplex probe was zzso amplified with zzso zzso derived from internal zzso The corresponding gene zzso coded for a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Based upon findings with other zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is thought to be anchored by zzso lipids to the zzso zzso of the zzso membrane and/or zzso The discovery of zzso zzso zzso proteins with potentially defined functions provides fresh insights into a poorly understood aspect of zzso zzso At the same time, however, these findings also raise important issues regarding the use of zzso preparations for identifying rare zzso proteins of zzso zzso
