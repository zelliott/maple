The usefulness of the zzso chain reaction zzso method for diagnosing zzso infections was zzso Several zzso including zzso specific for the zzso region and for enteric zzso types 40 and 41, were zzso The zzso method was validated against cell zzso in routine diagnostic work and against restriction zzso analysis of viral zzso Sixty diagnostic specimens were selected for evaluation by the zzso zzso Twenty of the 60 specimens were found positive on the basis of zzso effects and latex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 16 were identified and typed as zzso by zzso gel zzso zzso was performed on all 60 specimens in parallel directly on diluted stool samples and on viral DNA extracted from cells zzso with the same stool zzso When the general zzso zzso were used 51 of the 60 specimens from infected cell cultures were found positive by zzso whereas only 13 specimens were found positive when zzso was performed directly on stool zzso With the use of selective zzso for enteric zzso 16 of the 60 cell cultures were found to exhibit amplification products by zzso whereas 4 were detected in stool zzso None of the 60 specimens were found positive by zzso when an zzso type zzso primer pair was zzso zzso was found to be a fast, sensitive, and reliable method for the detection of zzso in zzso disease, provided the zzso were performed directly on diluted stool zzso
