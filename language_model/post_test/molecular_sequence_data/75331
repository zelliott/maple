A zzso zzso clone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a rat liver zzso library constructed in the expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis yielded a deduced protein primary structure that was zzso zzso to the zzso alpha zzso III zzso zzso sequence presented in the preceding paper by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hudson, zzso zzso Shields, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with regard to exact matches and zzso zzso when considering chemically zzso zzso The clone also possessed zzso zzso to the putative bait region of a zzso clone zzso of alpha zzso Such sequence data demonstrates that the zzso clone zzso to a member of the family of zzso alpha zzso zzso Furthermore, this report presents the entire zzso sequence corresponding to the zzso of alpha zzso zzso zzso We have zzso zzso zzso to study the expression of alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso under conditions known to alter zzso gene zzso Our data reveal that alpha zzso zzso expression is not only regulated during the zzso response but is also modulated in response to a variety of changing zzso conditions, most notably liver zzso Steady state levels of zzso were zzso using Northern zzso techniques and laser zzso During acute phase response initiated by zzso injection, the relative abundance of alpha zzso zzso decreased zzso over a period of 24 zzso Following partial zzso the zzso liver expressed zzso less alpha zzso zzso than zzso liver after 24 zzso This reduced level was maintained over a zzso zzso We have also demonstrated that alpha zzso zzso expression is zzso zzso Fetal rat liver did not contain zzso zzso of rat alpha zzso zzso even as late as 4 days prior to zzso However, trace amounts were observed from birth until approximately 20 days of age when alpha zzso zzso levels increased zzso to zzso adult quantities over the following 2 or 3 zzso During the course of pregnancy, alpha zzso zzso remained essentially constant until approximately 4 days prior to birth when a precipitous decline to zzso of the original level was zzso zzso normal values were gradually restored over a 30-day zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
