zzso differences between zzso organisms and their respective hosts with respect to metabolism and zzso structure provide zzso for detailed characterization of target proteins and/or zzso as the focus for the development of selective zzso In order to develop a rational approach to zzso chemotherapy, finding differences in the zzso pathways of the zzso with respect to the host it zzso is therefore of primary zzso Like most zzso zzso the zzso zzso is an zzso zzso of zzso and hence for requirement of zzso bases depends on its own zzso salvage zzso Among various zzso acquisition routes used by the zzso the zzso involved in zzso of zzso zzso is unique and differs significantly in the zzso form of the zzso zzso from its corresponding zzso form zzso zzso zzso zzso is the gateway zzso of this zzso and displays zzso activity zzso zzso understanding the zzso mechanism of the zzso its structural complexities and mode of its regulation have emerged as one of the major areas of zzso This review, in general, discusses possible strategies to validate several zzso salvage zzso as targets for zzso manipulation with special reference to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso commonly known as zzso in India, is caused by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The spread of zzso follows the distribution of these zzso in the zzso tropical and zzso regions of the world leading to loss of thousands of human zzso WHO has declared zzso among one of the six major diseases namely zzso malaria, zzso zzso zzso disease and zzso in its Special zzso for Research and Training in Tropical zzso Strategies for better prophylaxis and urgent therapies must be therefore devised to control this menace among poor and under privileged zzso However, the possible availability of zzso vaccines appears remote in near zzso zzso chemotherapy remains the mainstay for the treatment of most zzso zzso zzso of an zzso compound must depend upon its mode of specific zzso of zzso replication leaving host processes zzso In principle, these agents are expected to exert their selective actions against growth of the invading organisms by having one or both of the following zzso zzso Selective zzso of compounds in question by zzso zzso from the invading organisms, which are not present in the zzso zzso zzso Selective zzso of vital zzso which are essential for replication of the zzso In order to design specific compounds with the above zzso it is essential to have a thorough knowledge of the properties of the zzso and/or zzso which are unique to the zzso zzso studies suggested that zzso zzso are relatively zzso zzso cells and indeed their cellular organization differs considerably from their zzso hosts zzso Various zzso zzso or proteins identified in zzso and known to be absent from or zzso different in the zzso hosts were considered as ideal drug zzso Among the various zzso pathways that are presently being studied for their prospects to be exploited as the target for zzso zzso the most important are zzso zzso salvage zzso zzso and zzso metabolism zzso folate zzso zzso DNA replication zzso zzso and zzso fatty acid zzso pathways zzso A number of excellent reviews, describing the prospects and zzso of these zzso already exist in the zzso Our laboratory is engaged in studying the pathways responsible for synthesis and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we zzso for the constraint of space, try to restrict the discussion mostly with the zzso salvage pathways of various zzso zzso with particular reference to the unique features of one of the zzso of the zzso salvage zzso zzso zzso and its prospects as the zzso zzso However, contributions of other workers will also be discussed whenever essential and zzso will be drawn in order to make the reading zzso The zzso zzso goes through a zzso life zzso It exists as a zzso zzso zzso in the sand fly zzso but is converted to an zzso zzso zzso upon entry into zzso zzso During this transformation process, the activities of a large number of proteins and/or zzso have been reported to be zzso altered and hence they could be prospective targets for development of zzso regimen based on the zzso differences of the zzso proteins from their respective host zzso
