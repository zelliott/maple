zzso zzso is one of the major constituents of the zzso bacterial cell zzso Its zzso activity causes the relatively high zzso of zzso zzso Several bacteria harbor zzso zzso that zzso the zzso activity of the zzso Here we evaluated whether two such zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be useful tools for the development of an improved and less zzso zzso zzso zzso We showed that expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso leads to increased and decreased zzso activity of the zzso zzso As expected, zzso activity also resulted in increased zzso activity of whole bacterial zzso However, more unexpectedly, this was also the case for zzso This paradoxical result may be explained, in part, by an increased release of zzso which we observed in the zzso zzso
