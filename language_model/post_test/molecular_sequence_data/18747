zzso zzso was isolated from landfill zzso in a zzso disposal site in zzso zzso zzso An analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the isolate was closely related to members of the zzso zzso sharing the highest sequence similarities with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis based on three zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso provided higher resolution at the species level than that based on zzso zzso gene zzso which was further confirmed by less than zzso zzso zzso between the new isolate and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso and the major zzso was zzso The major cellular fatty acids zzso were zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso and/or zzso zzso analysis indicates that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
