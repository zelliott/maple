zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso by zzso which is released into the circulatory system and protects the lung from the actions of zzso zzso via a zzso transition within a dynamic zzso zzso Relatively common point zzso zzso this transition, causing zzso of zzso and zzso of the circulating zzso zzso carriers to severe lung and liver zzso We have assigned the backbone zzso of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso These assignments provide the starting point for a detailed solution state characterization of the structural properties of this highly dynamic protein via zzso zzso
