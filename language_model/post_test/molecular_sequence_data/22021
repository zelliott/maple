A zzso zzso and zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a tidal flat area of zzso zzso zzso This strain was zzso by means of polar zzso occasionally forming zzso zzso reduced nitrate to zzso required sodium zzso for growth, exhibited zzso and zzso activities and contained zzso as the major zzso and zzso : zzso as the dominant cellular fatty zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that this strain is affiliated with a cluster within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between strain zzso and the most closely related species, zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso between strain zzso and the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were respectively zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso like other zzso zzso possesses carbon monoxide zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso and the zzso data confirmed that strain zzso can be considered to represent a novel zzso in the zzso zzso The name zzso marina zzso zzso is proposed for the tidal flat zzso the type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
