37 CA repeats, 5 zzso 9 zzso and 4 genes were mapped to 19 different intervals of zzso 13 determined by the zzso zzso of 19 different cell lines with zzso deletions or zzso involving various parts of zzso zzso A framework genetic linkage map was constructed from 25 of these zzso zzso to which 26 markers from other genetic maps were zzso Thus, an integrated map of zzso 13 zzso Since the zzso markers included in this study derive from different genetic zzso an approximate regional zzso can now be assigned in principle to any genetic marker on zzso zzso
