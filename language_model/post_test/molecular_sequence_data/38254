A novel family of short zzso nuclear elements zzso has been identified in zzso zzso This family has been called zzso The feature that makes zzso unique among zzso is the presence of zzso terminal zzso zzso Both the number and the sequence of these repeats vary between individual members of the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains at least 160 copies of zzso In a zzso obtained upon gamma zzso of a zzso zzso 13 new zzso insertions were zzso These zzso together with the occurrence of many zzso zzso between zzso within one zzso zzso group and the presence of zzso transcripts in the zzso indicate that zzso is currently active and may contribute to the genetic zzso of zzso zzso Since we have not been able to detect zzso sequences by zzso analyses in other zzso this novel family of zzso seems to be confined to zzso zzso
