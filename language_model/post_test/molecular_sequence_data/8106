The human zzso vinyl zzso is zzso in the liver to zzso zzso which generate various zzso in zzso It has been reported that zzso zzso zzso is excised by a DNA zzso present in human cell zzso whereas protein extracts from zzso coli and zzso were devoid of such an zzso We confirm that the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso This finding was extended to the rat zzso zzso We show, at zzso with the previous report, that pure zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso as well as its zzso counterpart, the zzso zzso zzso zzso A from double stranded zzso that contain a single zzso zzso Both zzso act as DNA zzso The full length and the truncated human zzso 70 and 40 zzso zzso and the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso activities towards zzso A are 2-3 orders of magnitude more efficient than the zzso or zzso zzso for the removal of zzso zzso The zzso of the various proteins were zzso They are 24, 200 and 800 zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso These three proteins efficiently cleave duplex zzso containing zzso A positioned opposite zzso G, C or zzso zzso However the zzso protein zzso A opposite zzso much faster than opposite zzso zzso or zzso
