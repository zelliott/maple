zzso serum was found to contain an inhibitor of pure zzso zzso zzso zzso The inhibitor was a high Mr protein isolated by molecular zzso on zzso zzso followed by zzso exchange zzso on zzso zzso zzso then separation on zzso zzso zzso and finally by zzso zzso zzso separation and subsequent zzso sequence analysis of the active inhibitor preparation showed the presence of two protein zzso identified as rat zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso rat zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso Treatment of the inhibitor preparations with zzso zzso against rat zzso zzso blocked zzso activity in a zzso zzso The results present strong evidence that zzso zzso is capable of acting as an inhibitor of zzso zzso No zzso of zzso zzso zzso could be zzso indicating that the interaction with zzso zzso may have specificity among the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso presented here occurs in zzso and will require further in zzso investigations to determine the precise zzso zzso Independent of the zzso significance is the finding that this interaction occurs in zzso which, pending zzso of the precise mechanism and zzso may provide a new tool for investigations into the functional significance of zzso and potentially for use or design of new zzso of therapeutic value in zzso conditions involving altered levels of zzso
