Three zzso coding for monkey zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3A zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library of a liver from a zzso zzso crab-eating zzso using zzso fragments for human zzso zzso zzso and 3A as respective zzso zzso and zzso were 1901 and zzso zzso long, containing entire coding regions for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso were identical with those of zzso and zzso which had been zzso from liver zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso crab-eating zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso long, zzso a zzso of 449 zzso which is presumed to lack zzso 45 zzso as compared with the sequence for human zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that monkey zzso zzso zzso and 3A zzso were expressed zzso in monkey zzso zzso zzso and 3A zzso were induced by both zzso and zzso while zzso zzso zzso was induced only by zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of four monkey zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso which we isolated zzso were more than zzso identical with those of corresponding human zzso zzso zzso
