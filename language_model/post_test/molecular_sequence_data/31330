zzso zzso functions in the zzso zzso as an alpha zzso Its zzso zzso are thus expected to be zzso in the nucleus and zzso in the zzso as precursors containing signal sequences for zzso zzso We have previously reported the isolation and sequence of a rat liver zzso clone zzso zzso that apparently encodes the zzso precursor to the zzso Here we report the preparation of zzso transcripts of this zzso insert and their in zzso translation to produce labeled protein that can be zzso across the zzso of subsequently added rat liver zzso zzso is accompanied by zzso processing to convert the zzso precursor to the zzso mature form of the zzso The zzso sequence of the mature zzso from the zzso zzso has been determined by sequential zzso degradation and compared with the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso This confirms that the cloned sequence encodes the zzso zzso and establishes that the point of zzso is between zzso and zzso zzso and that the signal sequence consists of 27 zzso The signal sequence shares characteristics of other zzso targeting sequences that have been zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso including the potential to form an zzso zzso zzso is dependent upon the presence of zzso and is inhibited by compounds that diminish zzso membrane zzso zzso of the precursor is effective for precursor produced by the zzso translation system, but is not seen for the product that is translated by a wheat germ zzso indicating that the latter may lack a factor or component that is necessary for the targeting and import zzso
