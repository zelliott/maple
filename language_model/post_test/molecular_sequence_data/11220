zzso zzso protein is important for zzso but its zzso function remains zzso To clarify its role, a zzso zzso system zzso screening was zzso to identify zzso cellular zzso Of 79 zzso clones harboring zzso for putative zzso binding zzso 27 zzso contained the coding region for zzso zzso zzso zzso behaved as bona fide zzso partner in zzso control zzso zzso interaction was confirmed by in zzso binding zzso In particular, zzso zzso was able to capture the zzso zzso from a natural zzso zzso In zzso the interacting region was mapped within zzso zzso which span the structured portion of the zzso including the zzso zzso In zzso zzso portion was restricted to zzso zzso and the tract zzso of zzso domain zzso zzso shown to be essential, though not zzso Attempts to purify a zzso complex from zzso zzso cells were zzso However, zzso was found to markedly zzso zzso levels of both a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso by binding to a zzso might alter zzso function in infected zzso
