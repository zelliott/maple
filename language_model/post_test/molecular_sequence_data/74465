A zzso region of zzso zzso zzso that contains of genes for zzso synthesis was isolated from a zzso zzso The zzso consists of zzso branching zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene organization is similar to that of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was activated by zzso zzso and inhibited by zzso The constructed zzso zzso failed to integrate into the zzso of zzso zzso by marker zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso and the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso showed correlation with other zzso zzso have the zzso gene instead of the zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso The possible evolutionary implications of the results among the zzso are zzso
