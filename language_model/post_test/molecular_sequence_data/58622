zzso disease virus zzso is a highly zzso avian zzso In its natural host, zzso zzso zzso disease zzso a lethal condition characterized by zzso zzso of T zzso Although symptoms of MD may be prevented by zzso no practical pharmacological method of control has been widely zzso zzso replication represents a point at which pharmacological control of zzso infection may be most zzso However, this requires detailed knowledge of viral replication zzso Studies in zzso DNA replication zzso the zzso protein as a key zzso of zzso For example, binding of zzso to zzso origins is a prerequisite for assembly of additional replication zzso In this study, a zzso whose apparent molecular size is similar to that of zzso zzso was identified in extracts of zzso infected cells by western zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso A putative zzso zzso gene was subsequently identified through sequencing of zzso zzso fragments zzso G and zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame zzso which could zzso a protein zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso producing a sequence zzso identical to zzso zzso and zzso identical to zzso gene 51 product zzso zzso zzso zzso shares numerous structural motifs with zzso and zzso zzso zzso including six zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso
