zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso formation in type 2 diabetes and in transplanted zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an effective inhibitor of zzso formation by zzso however, the interactions required for the zzso of zzso zzso formation and for the zzso of zzso fibers are not zzso A range of features have been proposed to be critical for zzso protein zzso including interactions with aromatic zzso interactions with zzso groups, or zzso Using a set of zzso zzso we show that none of these are zzso Studies in which zzso is added to the lag phase of zzso formation shows that it interacts with zzso as well as with zzso and zzso The features of zzso required for effective zzso were zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an effective zzso although less so than zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso which is a less effective zzso zzso only the zzso group of the zzso ring leads to a compound that has more pronounced effects on the lag phase than zzso but is less effective at reducing the amount of zzso zzso of both the zzso group and the zzso zzso results in loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fibers but does not fully zzso them to zzso zzso and the zzso is not the reverse of zzso zzso The ability of the compounds to zzso zzso zzso closely follows their relative ability to inhibit zzso zzso
