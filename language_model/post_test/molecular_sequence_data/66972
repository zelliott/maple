We identified zzso upstream enhancers of two zzso genes and characterized one of them in zzso Although the genes are zzso repeated in the zzso the zzso of each seemed to be individually zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence contained essential elements for driving a correct zzso zzso This zzso can be divided into two distinct zzso The A module was located between zzso positions zzso and zzso upstream of the putative zzso start site, and was necessary for zzso in zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso module lay between zzso positions zzso and zzso and was responsible for zzso in zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso stage and in zzso zzso zzso nerve cord, and muscle lineage cells at later zzso Two putative zzso sites, one located within and the other downstream of the zzso zzso were necessary for the latter zzso zzso at a potential zzso site, located downstream of the zzso zzso caused zzso zzso of the reporter gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests that repression in the zzso zzso is necessary for correct zzso control of the zzso zzso
