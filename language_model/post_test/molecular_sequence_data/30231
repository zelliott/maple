Three start sites and a single start site for zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, have been identified in zzso zzso zzso the zzso start sites are DNA sequences that conform to zzso promoter consensus zzso The two most upstream promoters of the zzso gene function in zzso at comparable efficiency, while the third is not expressed zzso Both zzso and zzso genes possess a DNA sequence with a zzso zzso zzso in their respective regions downstream from the coding zzso The zzso genes are both transcribed in zzso into zzso zzso zzso Upon introduction of an zzso zzso carrying either the zzso or the zzso gene into the zzso and zzso single deletion zzso the zzso levels of zzso from the zzso zzso genes are zzso The zzso and zzso proteins both repress both zzso zzso repression of the zzso gene being less zzso The zzso protein selectively zzso zzso synthesis starting at the zzso promoters in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso fusion zzso but does not have a negative regulatory effect on zzso synthesis from the true zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that the signals for the actions of zzso proteins are located in the DNA regions upstream from the sites near the zzso zzso of the coding regions of the zzso and zzso zzso
