zzso is an important part of zzso process in zzso and the process is characterized by the synthesis and zzso of zzso protein in the developing zzso The zzso proteins in crustaceans mainly consist of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are respectively present in zzso zzso and zzso The site and the process of zzso protein synthesis in crustaceans are still zzso The synthesis site of zzso in a zzso species, zzso zzso is determined by zzso and zzso techniques, and molecular cloning of a zzso zzso the primary structure of zzso in this zzso The zzso is clearly shown to be the synthesis site of zzso in this zzso The length of zzso zzso was estimated as about 6 zzso from Northern zzso zzso The partial primary structure of zzso gene is zzso and the zzso processing are further zzso For the first time, the partial primary structure of zzso gene and the synthesis site of zzso approached by molecular cloning in crustaceans are zzso
