zzso tomato or tobacco varieties with zzso zzso zzso from the fungus zzso zzso causes rapid induction of plant zzso responses leading to programmed cell zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we isolated a novel zzso tomato small zzso modifier protein zzso which specifically interacts with zzso zzso a zzso zzso is a member of the zzso protein zzso It shows zzso to human protein zzso which suppresses zzso necrosis zzso cell zzso zzso plants that express zzso in the sense orientation suppress zzso induction of zzso zzso and cell death, while in the zzso orientation they enhance zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is involved in zzso the signal generated by zzso that leads to induction of plant zzso zzso
