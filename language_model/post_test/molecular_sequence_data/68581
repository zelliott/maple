The accessibility of activated zzso receptors on the zzso surface of zzso adherent to damaged blood vessels or zzso plaques is likely to play a crucial role in subsequent zzso zzso To define better the factors involved in this process, we developed a functional zzso to assess the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso based on their ability to bind zzso containing a high density of zzso coupled zzso peptides zzso zzso readily zzso to zzso coated with zzso type I rat skin collagen and the adherent zzso bound a dense lawn of zzso With zzso wells, zzso zzso increased as the zzso concentration increased, reaching a plateau at about 11 zzso zzso binding to the zzso adherent to zzso showed a paradoxical response, increasing at zzso coating zzso up to approximately 4-6 zzso and then dramatically decreasing at higher zzso zzso zzso electron zzso demonstrated that the zzso of zzso adherent to collagen was similar to that of zzso adherent to low density zzso with extensive zzso formation and zzso In contrast, zzso adherent to high density zzso showed a zzso flattened zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors demonstrated concentration of the receptors on the zzso and depletion of receptors on the flattened portion of the zzso Thus, there is a paradoxical loss of accessible, activated zzso receptors on the zzso surface of zzso adherent to high density zzso Two factors may contribute to this zzso engagement of zzso receptors with zzso on the zzso surface leading to the loss of zzso zzso and loss of zzso zzso that interact with zzso These data provide insight into the differences in zzso between surfaces, and may provide a mechanism for purposefully zzso zzso artificial zzso
