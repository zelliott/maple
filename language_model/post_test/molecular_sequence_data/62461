The Alzheimer's zzso zzso zzso 1 is intimately involved in zzso zzso of zzso precursor protein and other zzso In addition, zzso plays a role in zzso signaling and in the regulation of zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso of zzso is regulated by two independent signaling pathways involving protein zzso zzso A and zzso and that both zzso can directly zzso the large zzso domain of zzso in zzso and in cultured zzso A zzso site at zzso zzso zzso was identified that is selectively zzso by zzso but not by zzso This site is localized within a recognition motif for zzso and zzso strongly zzso zzso processing of zzso by zzso activity during zzso Moreover, zzso zzso reduces the progression of zzso Our data indicate that zzso at the zzso recognition site provides a mechanism to zzso regulate properties of zzso in zzso
