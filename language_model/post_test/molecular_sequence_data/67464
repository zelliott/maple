The zzso zzso teeth of zzso are known to consist of zzso magnetic zzso associated with the maximum zzso and zzso of any zzso Based on our transmission electron zzso analysis of partially zzso teeth, we suggest that the organic zzso within the teeth controls the iron oxide zzso Thus, we used zzso to perform a zzso analysis of the organic zzso in zzso teeth of the zzso zzso zzso in order to identify the proteins involved in the zzso zzso Since the zzso sequence of zzso zzso is not available, zzso similarity searching and de zzso zzso sequencing were used to screen the zzso Our results indicate that several proteins were dominant in the zzso part of the zzso teeth, amongst which, zzso and a highly zzso zzso were identified as possibly involved in the zzso zzso
