We have zzso zzso and examined the expression of genes from pine trees that appear to zzso zzso class II zzso zzso sequence analysis indicates a coding sequence composed of three zzso interrupted by two zzso at locations identical to those found in other zzso genes that possess zzso One of the zzso zzso potentially encodes a protein that shares zzso zzso acid sequence identity through the zzso domain with class II zzso from zzso In contrast, zzso contains a stop zzso in the first zzso and may be a zzso zzso genes are zzso in several species of zzso and appear to comprise a small zzso zzso Treatment of pine cell suspension cultures with the general zzso zzso induced zzso zzso The regulatory sequences associated with the zzso gene were sufficient to direct zzso expression of zzso in transgenic tobacco plants, which indicates that zzso is an actively expressed member of the zzso zzso The observation that the zzso gene from pine (a zzso was appropriately regulated by zzso in tobacco (an zzso suggests that the signaling pathways that mediate zzso zzso are highly zzso in the plant zzso
