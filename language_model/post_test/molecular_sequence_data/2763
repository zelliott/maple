To define zzso of interactions of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso we zzso zzso zzso to substitute either zzso or zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso media of zzso cells demonstrated that the zzso substitution markedly decreased but did not entirely abolish zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso substitution yielded a zzso with absolutely no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formed stable complexes with zzso However, even when zzso inhibitor was present in the medium or zzso zzso was added to plasma that had been rendered zzso in zzso the zzso were present in the free form exclusively judging from results of zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso Thus, despite maintenance of some residual zzso activity associated with preservation of the zzso group at the active site, the zzso zzso did not form stable complexes with zzso The zzso zzso developed so that zzso hindrance or other zzso interactions at the modified active site would be zzso was similarly incapable of forming complexes with zzso These results show that the presence of an active site zzso zzso is necessary for formation of stable complexes between zzso and zzso
