The high-resolution three-dimensional structure of a Bowman Birk zzso zzso from snail medic seeds zzso zzso zzso has been determined in solution by zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso and 27 degrees zzso The structure of zzso comprises two distinct zzso zzso each composed of a zzso zzso containing a zzso type loop, where the active sites are zzso A characteristic geometry of three aromatic zzso zzso stability to this zzso and we observe that this feature is zzso in all the Bowman Birk zzso of known zzso The two active zzso exhibit different zzso features: the second domain displays higher flexibility and zzso with respect to the first one, and these properties have been correlated to a lower zzso zzso zzso in agreement with zzso studies that have shown a zzso ratio zzso of zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso at zzso higher than 2 zzso and the zzso involved in this mechanism are localized at opposite faces of the zzso having the highest positive and negative potential, respectively, thus indicating that zzso zzso interactions are the driving forces for zzso zzso Most of the zzso affected by zzso are highly zzso in zzso from different seeds, suggesting a functional relevance for these charged superficial patches, possibly involved in the interaction with other zzso or zzso thus triggering zzso zzso
