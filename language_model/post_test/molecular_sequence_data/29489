Recently, we identified three novel zzso of the zzso gene in Japanese families with zzso zzso zzso Seven of 11 zzso zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is the most common zzso of the zzso gene in the Japanese zzso After it was recognized that cochlear zzso zzso is of benefit to children with zzso deafness, we have had a number of zzso pediatric zzso zzso Because children carrying the zzso zzso zzso show bilateral zzso profound deafness, they could be enrolled in the zzso program at zzso University Graduate School of zzso The purposes of this study were 1) to analyze the occurrence of the zzso zzso in our 15 zzso pediatric zzso patients in whom the cause of zzso deafness was unknown, and 2) to evaluate the auditory function and zzso speech perception with zzso of those zzso deaf zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of the zzso gene by direct sequencing was performed with zzso DNA from 15 children born profoundly deaf as a result of unknown causes and implanted with zzso zzso zzso evoked auditory zzso response zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The speech perception was evaluated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We identified 4 zzso patients zzso out of 15 children carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso evaluation of the auditory system revealed almost intact cochlear and zzso auditory function in these 4 zzso zzso auditory testing indicates that their speech perception had become significantly higher in comparison with that of other zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso deaf children carrying the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene can benefit from zzso
