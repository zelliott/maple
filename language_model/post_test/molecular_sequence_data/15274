The zzso zzso zzso zzso target, 6 zzso family collects small zzso proteins zzso by zzso zzso particularly in the early phase of zzso There are 23 zzso family members in zzso tuberculosis zzso In a previous work, we identified the zzso dependent regulation of five proteins of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are part of zzso cluster 3, whose expression was already known to be induced by iron zzso 

In this research, we performed zzso experiments and zzso analysis of zzso cluster 3 in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to what we had observed in zzso zzso we found that in zzso zzso zzso cluster 3 responds only to iron and not to zzso In both organisms we identified an internal promoter, a finding which suggests the presence of two zzso units and, by consequence, a differential expression of cluster 3 zzso We compared the expression of zzso and zzso in different growth and stress conditions by means of relative quantitative zzso The expression of zzso and zzso genes was essentially zzso they appeared to be zzso in most of the tested conditions, with the exception of acid stress zzso zzso where zzso was about zzso zzso while zzso was zzso Analysis revealed that in acid stress conditions zzso tuberculosis zzso gene was zzso induced too, while zzso induction was almost zzso 

In contrast with what has been reported for zzso zzso our results suggest that in zzso zzso only zzso regulation is zzso while zinc has no effect on gene zzso The role of cluster 3 in zzso tuberculosis zzso is still to be zzso however, zzso and zzso expression strongly suggests that cluster 3 is highly expressed in the zzso process, and that the cluster contributes to the zzso profile during the course of zzso Moreover, cluster 3 induction in acid stress conditions strengthens the hypothesis that cluster 3 is expressed in the course of zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso genes is broadly similar in differing growth zzso and in stress conditions, with the exception of acid stress zzso zzso zzso in expression between cluster 3 genes can be explained by the presence of internal zzso both in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
