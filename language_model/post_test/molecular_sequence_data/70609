To study the role of the capsule of zzso zzso zzso 2 in zzso we generated two zzso zzso disturbed in capsule zzso For that purpose, we first cloned and characterized a major part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso locus of zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the established zzso 14 open reading frames zzso designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso were zzso Twelve zzso belonged to a single zzso zzso The gene products of 11 of these zzso showed similarity to proteins involved in zzso zzso of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated in the zzso and zzso genes by zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 strain, the zzso strains were highly sensitive to zzso by zzso zzso lung zzso in zzso More importantly, the zzso zzso strains were completely zzso in young zzso pigs after zzso zzso These observations indicate that the capsule of zzso zzso zzso 2 plays an essential role in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso
