The zzso gene from zzso zzso strain zzso is able to complement both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso coli zzso zzso The cloning and the zzso sequence indicated that this gene encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 261 zzso zzso with a molecular weight of zzso The zzso gene product shares a significant degree of sequence similarity with the zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso and with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso to zzso indicating that the zzso zzso and zzso genes are zzso Moreover, the zzso gene is organized into two zzso zzso half the size of the entire zzso typical of all the known zzso zzso and zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso gene supports the zzso evolutionary model suggested by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1994; zzso zzso to explain the zzso zzso and zzso zzso According to this idea, the zzso gene originated from the zzso of an ancestral zzso gene which, in turn, was the result of an earlier gene zzso event involving an ancestral module half the size of the extant zzso zzso reported in this paper also suggest that these two successive zzso gene zzso took probably place in the early steps of molecular evolution of the zzso pathway, well before the diversification of the three zzso and that this zzso was one of the zzso activities of the last common zzso The molecular evolution of the zzso zzso and zzso genes is also zzso
