The alpha zzso inhibitor zzso zzso proteins of mice are zzso by a group of genes whose members are expressed zzso in a zzso pattern and are regulated primarily at the zzso zzso To better understand the zzso and zzso regulation of this gene family, one member that is analogous to the human alpha zzso gene was chosen for zzso zzso analysis of the upstream regulatory region of this gene was performed, spanning from zzso zzso to zzso base pairs relative to the zzso start zzso Two functional positive zzso elements within the 522 bases immediately upstream of the start site for zzso were shown to zzso the level of expression from this promoter when introduced into human or mouse zzso cells, and a third region acted as a negative regulatory element in that its deletion resulted in a two- to zzso increase of expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison between the regulatory zzso of two mouse alpha zzso genes and the human alpha zzso gene showed that the mouse gene contains a novel positive zzso element which is absent in human gene and that a specific zzso difference between species results in a strong positive zzso element in the human gene acting as a negative element in the mouse zzso An zzso located approximately 3,000 base pairs upstream of the major start site for zzso was also zzso This element is position and orientation zzso Several different zzso binding zzso were used to demonstrate that each DNA segment with functional significance in zzso zzso interacts specifically with proteins found in adult mouse liver zzso The major zzso element appeared to be specifically recognized by nuclear proteins found only in zzso that express alpha zzso while the negative element binding proteins were zzso Thus, the zzso regulatory domain including bases zzso to zzso of this zzso alpha zzso gene family member is more complex than was previously zzso It is composed of a set of at least three additional functional zzso regulatory elements besides those which have been mapped by others and has a far upstream zzso
