zzso complementary zzso acid sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1 zzso 1) were cloned from Atlantic cod zzso zzso zzso using reverse zzso and rapid amplification of complementary zzso acid zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction shows that zzso zzso and zzso 1 zzso are widely distributed throughout cod zzso During development, zzso and zzso 1 were detected at the zzso stage and zzso stage, respectively, and expression levels gradually increased up to the hatched zzso zzso 1, but not zzso appeared to be affected by food availability during early zzso In juvenile cod, zzso 1 expression levels increased and remained significantly higher than that of control fed fish throughout 30 days of zzso and during a subsequent 10 days zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expression levels were not affected by 30 days of food zzso but a significant increase in expression levels was observed during the 10 days zzso period in the experimental zzso group as compared to the control fed zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso 1 may be involved in the complex regulation of growth, feeding and metabolism during food deprivation and zzso in Atlantic zzso
