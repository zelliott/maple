The inheritance of particular zzso of major zzso complex class II genes increases the risk for various human zzso diseases; however, only a small percentage of individuals having an zzso associated with zzso develop zzso The identification of zzso zzso more precisely correlated with disease zzso would greatly facilitate clinical screening and zzso zzso gene amplification in zzso was used to determine the zzso sequence of a class II zzso found almost exclusively in patients with the zzso skin disease zzso zzso In addition to clinical zzso the zzso distribution of this zzso should provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying associations between diseases and zzso II zzso
