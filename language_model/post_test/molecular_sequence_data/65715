This study investigated the regulatory mechanisms of seasonal zzso developments of zzso zzso and incubation in zzso zzso a short day breeding zzso Throughout the year, plasma zzso zzso increased in zzso season in spring and summer (from April to early zzso and remained low in the rest of the year, while zzso zzso peaked in August and September and remained low in zzso season (March to zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and decreased zzso secretions, which inhibited zzso development, terminated lay and induced zzso while zzso zzso decreased zzso and increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso Long zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred with increased gene expressions of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso but zzso of zzso zzso was without decreases in gene expressions of zzso beta zzso and zzso Under breeding conditions, terminating incubation decreased zzso but increased zzso zzso and resumed lay in 24 days following recruitment of about 10 large white zzso into zzso zzso Plasma zzso of zzso and zzso peaked at peak zzso whereas zzso zzso exhibited a zzso pattern with zzso at peak lay and incubation when zzso zzso were zzso zzso percent geese exhibited incubation zzso after laying one clutch of approximately eight eggs in approximately 30 zzso In conclusion the seasonal zzso activities in zzso geese is directly inhibited by long zzso and directly zzso by short zzso via zzso and zzso secretions, whose zzso also cause zzso of four to five lay and incubation cycles in the breeding zzso
