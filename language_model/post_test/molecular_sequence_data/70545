Loss of DNA mismatch repair due to zzso or diminished expression of the zzso gene is associated with zzso instability and zzso In this study, we used a zzso model system to examine three circumstances relevant to zzso of zzso zzso First, zzso of zzso zzso was found to cause a strong zzso of zzso rates at three different zzso similar to the zzso effect of zzso gene zzso Second, zzso zzso strains with any of six zzso zzso zzso that mimic germ line zzso found in human cancer patients displayed a strong zzso zzso consistent with loss of mismatch repair zzso Five of these zzso affect zzso acids that are zzso to zzso suggested by recent crystal structure and zzso analysis of zzso coli zzso to participate in zzso binding and zzso Finally, using a highly sensitive reporter zzso we detected a zzso zzso of zzso zzso strains that are zzso for zzso zzso Evidence suggesting that this zzso effect results not from reduced mismatch repair in the zzso cells but rather from loss of the zzso zzso zzso in a fraction of cells is zzso Exposure to zzso or to zzso zzso strongly enhanced zzso in the zzso strain but had little effect on the zzso rate in the zzso zzso This zzso zzso may be relevant to cancer in humans with germ line zzso in only one zzso zzso
