zzso zzso zzso zzso also referred to as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a member of a new family, the members of which are negative regulators of zzso zzso zzso is induced by various zzso however, the zzso mechanism of the zzso gene is not fully zzso Here, we showed that zzso of the mouse zzso gene was initiated from six adjoining sites accompanying three zzso boxes and a single zzso zzso element near them, but not from the zzso box or an zzso zzso We also showed that zzso induced zzso zzso more strongly than zzso in zzso zzso and that this zzso effect was zzso by zzso To determine the signal zzso downstream of zzso zzso activities of several zzso promoters were zzso The region zzso zzso effect of zzso to the gene zzso was localized to the zzso region containing three tandem zzso units, named zzso zzso element zzso while four zzso zzso site zzso elements located far upstream were not related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso induced zzso regulatory zzso zzso binding to zzso but not that of zzso or three components of zzso Furthermore, forced expression of zzso zzso and that of zzso inhibited the zzso effect of zzso on zzso gene zzso Finally, mouse zzso zzso lacking zzso showed impaired zzso zzso induction by zzso These results demonstrated that zzso which is induced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene by zzso via zzso
