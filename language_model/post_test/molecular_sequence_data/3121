The major vault protein is the main component on zzso vault zzso that are likely to play an essential role in normal cell physiology and to be associated with zzso resistance of zzso zzso In order to unravel the function of vaults and their putative contribution to zzso resistance, specific zzso are invaluable zzso Until now, only conventional major vault zzso zzso zzso zzso have been generated, that are most suitable for zzso zzso The zzso display method allows for selection of human zzso fragments with potential use in clinical zzso Furthermore, zzso sequences zzso selected zzso fragments are readily identified, zzso various molecular targeting zzso In order to obtain such human zzso fragments zzso major vault protein we used a large zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displaying major vault zzso zzso were obtained through several rounds of selection on major vault zzso zzso and subsequent amplification in zzso E coli zzso Eventually, one major vault zzso clone was selected and further zzso The zzso vault protein zzso was found suitable for zzso and Western zzso analysis of zzso cell lines and human zzso zzso analysis showed that the binding affinity of the major vault zzso clone almost zzso that of the zzso zzso vault protein zzso The zzso sequence of this human zzso may be exploited to generate an zzso for major vault zzso out zzso Thus, this human zzso zzso should provide a valuable tool in zzso the zzso of major vault zzso to normal physiology and cellular drug resistance zzso
