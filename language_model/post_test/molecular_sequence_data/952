zzso zzso are crucial components in the synthesis of zzso We identified a novel human zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso to zzso zzso fringe connection, zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso was localized within the zzso apparatus following its transient expression in zzso zzso In human zzso zzso and zzso exhibited similar tissue zzso although zzso transcripts showed a 10 times greater abundance than those of zzso The zzso expression of zzso in the zzso revealed the zzso specific transport activity of zzso (for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with apparent zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the zzso cells, zzso transported zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso cells modulated the cell surface zzso zzso expression zzso These results suggest that zzso takes part in the synthesis of zzso zzso by regulating the level of zzso a donor zzso for the zzso zzso zzso
