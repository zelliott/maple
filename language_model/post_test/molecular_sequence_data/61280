A recent report has suggested that the interaction between the head and the rod region of smooth muscle zzso at zzso is important for the zzso regulation of zzso motor activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Sweeney, zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 74, zzso To investigate whether specific zzso acid zzso at zzso or whether the registration of the zzso repeat appearing in the zzso zzso structure of the rod are critical for such an interaction, two smooth muscle zzso zzso were constructed in which the zzso sequences of zzso were deleted to various zzso One zzso contained a deletion of 71 zzso at the position immediately zzso to the zzso zzso zzso linking the zzso domain directly to the downstream sequence of the rod, while in another zzso 53 zzso were deleted at a position 56 zzso downstream of zzso Despite these zzso which change the registration of both the zzso repeat and the zzso repeat found in zzso rod zzso both zzso zzso showed a stable zzso structure by electron microscopic zzso Both the zzso zzso activity and the zzso zzso activity of the zzso were completely regulated by the zzso of the regulatory light zzso The zzso sliding zzso of the two zzso zzso was the same as the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the head zzso critical for zzso filament formation zzso or zzso was unchanged in either zzso These results indicate that neither the specific zzso acid zzso nor the registration of the zzso acid repeat in zzso is critical for the head zzso These results indicate that neither a specific zzso acid sequence at the zzso junction nor the rod sequence registration is critical for the regulation of smooth muscle zzso
