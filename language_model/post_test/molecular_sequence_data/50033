In the present study, we use a novel method, zzso to predict the exact locations and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Whereas most previous studies have used single zzso zzso plots for characterizing of these zzso zzso zzso a system of neural networks and the evolutionary information contained in multiple alignments of related sequences to predict the zzso Present zzso application predicts TM zzso of zzso zzso that in many cases differ significantly from those derived by using earlier zzso Comparisons of zzso wheel projections of the presently derived TM zzso from zzso with those produced earlier reveal different zzso moments as well as zzso and zzso zzso These differences probably alter the character of zzso association within the zzso zzso This new zzso can also be used for other membrane protein complexes and may advance both understanding the principles underlying such complexes formation and design of peptides that can interfere with such TM domain association so as to zzso specific cellular zzso
