A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from zzso Lake in Xinjiang Province, zzso zzso zzso were zzso produced terminal zzso and grew at pH zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso degrees C zzso at zzso degrees zzso and zzso % zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that strain zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso exhibiting the highest sequence similarity with respect to the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso the next most similar zzso zzso gene sequences were those of the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso AS zzso showed a zzso of 55 zzso The major fatty acids of strain zzso zzso were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The zzso type was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was zzso zzso and the zzso respiratory zzso was zzso The major polar lipids were zzso zzso and zzso On the basis of the evidence from this zzso study, strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso as the type zzso
