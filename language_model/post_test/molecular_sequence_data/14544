zzso zzso repeated zzso genes are part of the zzso genetic system required for male fertility in zzso zzso zzso genes zzso a functional zzso of the zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in their zzso zzso disturbances and male zzso zzso genes are represented by clustered copies in the X zzso and carry promoters shared with another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso putative zzso of the nascent zzso zzso Using zzso zzso Shift zzso we revealed in the zzso promoter three zzso zzso zzso the loss of which greatly diminished the reporter gene expression in zzso zzso We identified that these zzso were recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso nuclear zzso All three zzso were preserved in the promoters of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two analogous zzso were detected in the promoters of zzso of the duplicated zzso gene pairs, whereas the zzso lacked these sites but possessed a new binding site for a zzso protein distinct from zzso Here we characterized a new type of zzso core promoter and identified zzso as its interacting zzso zzso
