We have developed a transient zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells to analyze the zzso sequence requirements for zzso regulation of the mouse zzso zzso From deletion analysis, a zzso of the promoter region, from zzso to zzso relative to the zzso cap site, was found to be sufficient for regulated zzso in zzso cells following induction of differentiation by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of this zzso promoter zzso identified three sequence elements required for zzso in zzso zzso These are the zzso sequence at zzso to zzso the zzso sequence between zzso and zzso and the zzso sequence between zzso and zzso In addition, we found a requirement for sequences adjacent to the zzso and zzso consensus zzso Point zzso within the promoter did not abolish zzso regulation following induction of differentiation by zzso zzso However, zzso that resulted in reduced zzso levels in zzso zzso cells gave similarly decreased levels in induced zzso zzso
