The zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso from the sand fly zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice with sand fly zzso zzso extracts or with zzso protects the host against zzso major zzso Because of the potential use of zzso in an zzso zzso we characterized the zzso host zzso response to zzso in the present zzso Our zzso analysis indicated that zzso to zzso were detected in zzso mice, as well as in pigs and humans, from a area in zzso endemic for zzso zzso Previous studies demonstrate that the zzso protein is zzso on the zzso acid zzso Our findings suggested that naturally occurring zzso zzso were recognized specifically by the host immune system and zzso appeared to be associated with zzso sequence zzso Thus, zzso diversity of zzso and possibly of other zzso zzso proteins may dictate the development of zzso zzso
