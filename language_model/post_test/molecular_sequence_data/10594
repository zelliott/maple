The mechanisms allowing remote enhancers to regulate promoters several zzso pairs away are unknown but are blocked by the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso that binds to gypsy zzso insertions between enhancers and zzso zzso bound to a gypsy zzso in the cut gene also appears to act zzso to antagonize zzso interactions on the zzso zzso when activity of the zzso gene is zzso This implicates zzso in zzso zzso We cloned zzso and find that it encodes a zzso of the recently discovered mouse zzso and zzso zzso proteins that bind nuclear zzso domain zzso zzso protein interacts with the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso interacts genetically with zzso showing that these interactions are important for zzso function in zzso zzso zzso also appears to have broad functions beyond interactions with zzso domain zzso zzso is present in all zzso examined and at numerous sites along the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso activity lack segments and show abnormal gap and zzso gene zzso although no zzso domain proteins are known to regulate zzso We conclude that zzso is a ubiquitous zzso factor required for normal expression of diverse genes at many stages of zzso We suggest that zzso zzso with different zzso domain proteins and other factors to structurally support remote zzso zzso
