The aim was to obtain zzso for zzso degradation by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso salt medium zzso at pH zzso and zzso for 7 days of zzso The bacterial growth, chemical oxygen demand zzso reduction, zzso of zzso zzso and productions of zzso compounds revealed that zzso zzso zzso was able to degrade zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso reduced by zzso after 7 days of zzso The maximum activities of zzso zzso zzso of zzso U zzso and zzso zzso of zzso U zzso were observed at 4th and 6th day, zzso The zzso compounds such as zzso 3, zzso and zzso alcohol were formed in the degradation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso 

This study confirmed that zzso zzso zzso could zzso zzso as a sole carbon source and degrade zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso may be useful in the zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso aromatic compounds in zzso zzso Meanwhile, using zzso zzso zzso in treatment of wastewater in pulp and paper industry is a meaningful zzso
