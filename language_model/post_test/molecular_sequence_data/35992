zzso sites were analyzed on zzso zzso leukemia cell lines which have been established from spontaneous zzso zzso in zzso mice and bone zzso zzso Three zzso integration sites were zzso near zzso zzso and zzso Among them the zzso near the zzso were zzso Two cell lines from zzso and a cell line from zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso contained the zzso integration near zzso In all three cell lines the integration of the zzso was found 18 to 20 zzso downstream of the zzso termination zzso The partial sequence analysis of the integrated zzso cell line established from zzso zzso zzso was the same as zzso In contrast, the zzso integrated in a cell line from a bone zzso zzso was different from that of zzso so far zzso
