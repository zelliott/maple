zzso is the only essential zzso zzso in the putative zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso 31, zzso zzso coli cells producing a zzso zzso of zzso showed no zzso zzso A spontaneous zzso zzso was isolated from the cells carrying the zzso zzso zzso which showed moderate resistance to zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso 50 zzso The entire sequencing of the zzso genes revealed two secondary zzso zzso the zzso 40 of zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 17 bases upstream from the initiation zzso of the zzso zzso There was a zzso zzso at position zzso which was a zzso in the zzso zzso region, which caused a decrease in zzso zzso The full expression of the zzso double and the zzso single zzso which were constructed by zzso zzso was deleterious for cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso the deleterious effect of these zzso through reduction of zzso The zzso single zzso introduced into the zzso zzso gene did not affect the level of resistance, although the expression was significantly zzso zzso cells carrying the zzso and zzso zzso plasmids showed a reduced level of zzso zzso due to active zzso whereas no significant zzso zzso was observed in zzso membrane zzso prepared from these zzso zzso The zzso zzso is located at opposite side of the membrane to the zzso zzso in the putative secondary structure of zzso The zzso zzso might mediate its effects through a structural zzso zzso along the zzso zzso
