Several recent studies have indicated that patients infected with human zzso virus zzso exhibit a beneficial effect of zzso with zzso virus C zzso The benefit is demonstrated by slower progression to acquired zzso syndrome zzso and prolonged survival time after the development of zzso In some but not all studies, a significant association between zzso zzso and increased zzso cell counts has been zzso To understand further the possible role that zzso might play in the reduced morbidity and mortality among zzso patients, we sought to examine the presence of different zzso zzso in a cohort of zzso zzso zzso products derived from the zzso region zzso and the second envelope gene zzso were zzso directly and zzso by zzso zzso While zzso analysis delineated the major type, analysis of the complete zzso gene was required for identification of group 2 zzso designated zzso and zzso Among 35 patients tested, zzso zzso was determined for zzso two patients were infected with zzso 1, 12 with type zzso and 19 with type zzso Clinical data were available for 25 zzso zzso one infected with zzso 1, nine with zzso zzso and 15 with type zzso zzso cell counts tended to be lower in patients infected with zzso zzso compared with those with zzso zzso zzso zzso 136 vs 430 zzso zzso P zzso zzso Additional studies with larger zzso from separate geographical regions are needed to determine whether a particular zzso zzso is associated with reduced morbidity or mortality among zzso zzso zzso
