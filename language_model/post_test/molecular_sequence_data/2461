We describe the attachment of a zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso to the zzso end of a DNA zzso and the zzso and the zzso of this zzso with a complementary target site on an zzso zzso zzso was coupled to a variety of DNA zzso to investigate the structural requirements for addition to the zzso zzso zzso zzso were made on specific zzso by designing an zzso site at an zzso zzso in the zzso strand within the zzso zzso The optimal location for this site was five zzso from the zzso zzso end and just zzso to the target zzso zzso Because the attachment of the zzso to the zzso is through a zzso bond, the DNA zzso can be removed with reduction to leave zzso attached to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso made in this way will be useful for subsequent zzso and zzso zzso
