zzso conventional DNA templates for in zzso zzso zzso involves zzso amplification of the DNA gene coding for the zzso of interest from zzso or zzso DNA, subsequent amplification with zzso containing a zzso zzso promoter region, and confirmation of the amplified DNA zzso zzso arise in applications where long, zzso sequences are desired in the final zzso zzso Here we describe a zzso method for the preparation of long synthetic DNA templates for in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso partially complementary DNA zzso coding for the zzso sequence of interest are zzso extended into the full-length zzso DNA, and amplified in a single zzso Long zzso zzso or deletions are zzso prior to in zzso zzso by simple substitution of zzso
