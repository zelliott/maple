We isolated and characterized a novel small zzso from zzso zzso We termed this zzso zzso zzso from the length of its mature form zzso zzso and located the corresponding gene at the zzso zzso region on the zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso revealed that it is transcribed in zzso growing cells and that the amount of zzso zzso decreased in the middle of the zzso zzso A zzso prediction of the zzso zzso secondary structure revealed three characteristic zzso zzso Despite active expression during the zzso phase, growth of the knockout zzso was not affected by depletion of zzso zzso A zzso comparison of the sequence of the zzso zzso with other zzso species including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggests that the sequence is unique to zzso zzso
