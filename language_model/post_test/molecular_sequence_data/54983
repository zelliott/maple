In the zzso zzso formation of a bone zzso protein zzso zzso zzso requires transport of a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a protein shuttling zzso Although the core components of the shuttling zzso zzso zzso and Twisted zzso zzso been identified, key aspects of this shuttling system remain mechanistically zzso Recently, we discovered that the zzso zzso protein collagen IV is important for zzso zzso zzso Here, we formulate a molecular mechanism of zzso shuttling that is zzso by collagen zzso We show that zzso is the only zzso zzso in zzso that binds collagen zzso A collagen IV zzso zzso zzso signals at longer range in zzso indicating that collagen IV functions to zzso free zzso in the zzso We also provide in zzso evidence that collagen IV functions as a scaffold to promote shuttling complex assembly in a zzso zzso After binding of zzso and zzso to collagen IV, protein interactions are zzso generating an intermediate complex in which zzso is poised for release by zzso through specific disruption of a collagen zzso zzso Because all components are zzso zzso we propose that regulation of zzso shuttling and zzso through zzso zzso interactions is widely used, both during development and in tissue zzso to achieve a precise zzso zzso zzso
