A zzso protein zzso in zzso crab zzso that zzso with zzso against a zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and its zzso was zzso The zzso pair zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso base pairs, zzso a zzso acid signal sequence followed by a mature protein of 197 zzso The sequence of zzso exhibits strong similarity to that of zzso B, a zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso activity with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso for a zzso zzso this activity is inhibited by zzso A but is not affected by zzso Although the zzso precursor possesses an zzso zzso zzso signal zzso unlike other zzso B zzso it lacks a zzso zzso zzso zzso retention signal and it contains a central zzso acid zzso Although zzso is zzso into the culture media of zzso expressed zzso cells, it is not detected in zzso crab zzso plasma but rather is localized to the zzso large zzso the regulated zzso zzso that are zzso upon zzso These results indicate that zzso is a new zzso zzso in the regulated zzso zzso and is thus designated zzso zzso This first report of a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso crab zzso suggests that such zzso proteins may constitute a key quality control system for stored proteins in zzso zzso
