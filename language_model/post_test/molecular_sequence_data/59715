The zzso of most human zzso zzso messages has made them difficult to detect specifically and zzso zzso the evaluation of the relative expression of the various zzso genes and their role in normal and pathological zzso For this reason, we developed competitive reverse zzso chain reaction zzso methods to measure the airway zzso zzso and zzso zzso pairs were designed that specifically detect zzso and zzso as demonstrated by the size and sequence of the zzso product and the expected tissue zzso The zzso zzso zzso were used to zzso internal competitive standards, called zzso Using this zzso the relative expression of these messages was analyzed in zzso or zzso cultures of normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso with these observations and in contrast to a previous report, zzso cultures produced at least an order of magnitude less zzso and zzso message than zzso zzso In zzso this paper describes methodology that can be applied to the specific and quantitative measurement of zzso messages and demonstrates that, in zzso cells, the level of zzso and zzso zzso is increased by zzso
