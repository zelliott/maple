To expand the zzso understanding of zzso zzso zzso in dogs, zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso strain isolated from a puppy showing zzso were zzso After isolation in cell culture, the novel isolate was zzso by zzso and the zzso obtained were zzso In order to characterize the growth properties of the zzso the size of the zzso the temperature of zzso and the zzso of growth were zzso Moreover, the novel strain was used to perform a zzso study on 86 canine serum samples and 81 zzso zzso by zzso zzso The comparative analysis of zzso and zzso acid sequences of the zzso named zzso revealed the highest identity to strain zzso The growth kinetic revealed that strain zzso grew more rapidly than zzso zzso By zzso zzso dogs from the same region of the isolate showed zzso against the zzso zzso strain in zzso zzso of zzso while zzso against the zzso were found in seven zzso zzso In cats zzso zzso against zzso strain were recovered in zzso zzso of samples tested, even if 38 zzso were zzso for zzso strain with similar zzso or zzso In three cats zzso to zzso alone was zzso Our results confirmed the zzso circulation of zzso strains among different animal species, but new investigations are needed to establish whether zzso is zzso in the dog and the role of zzso circulation in pathogen zzso
