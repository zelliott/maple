The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso library by using a screen in zzso coli to detect zzso genes zzso exported proteins zzso fused to the zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 80 zzso and about 50% zzso acid sequence identity to both the zzso and zzso zzso receptors of zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared from zzso zzso coli cultures supported growth of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of the iron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was induced by low iron zzso and zzso expression appeared to be dependent upon the presence of the sequence contained within 370 zzso upstream of the zzso structural zzso An internal zzso of the zzso structural gene and zzso regions were shown by Southern analysis to be highly zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso greatly impaired their ability to grow in the presence of zzso and zzso These findings suggest that zzso produced by other respiratory zzso could aid in the colonization of the respiratory tract by zzso zzso
