The zzso structure formed in the zzso and the zzso of zzso a zzso protein from the zzso zzso zzso serves as an zzso binding site for the protein to suppress the zzso synthesis upon zzso Using a zzso model zzso the structures of the zzso binding site zzso in the presence and absence of the protein were investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance assignments and spectral comparisons indicated that the zzso internal loop is dynamic in the free zzso but becomes ordered in the presence of zzso zzso Although the zzso in the loop region are sharper and more disperse in the bound zzso their assignment was extremely challenging, due to spectral complexity and broadened zzso caused by local zzso Two strategies, namely zzso and zzso analyses of five complexes with zzso zzso were used to overcome these zzso Only using these approaches could assignment of the internal loop zzso and identification of the unusual zzso and zzso zzso within the internal loop be zzso In the case of structural determination of the zzso complex, it was critical to be able to take advantage of the available zzso information in order to complete the structure zzso
