The molecular diversity of zzso arises from alternative zzso zzso at regions termed zzso zzso and zzso We investigated the zzso patterns of zzso zzso at both zzso and zzso regions in various human liver zzso with an emphasis on the expression of the alternative cell adhesive site zzso within the zzso zzso The relative abundance of the zzso zzso containing the zzso sequence was significantly increased in both fetal and zzso liver zzso although it was not affected in zzso zzso with chronic zzso and zzso Similarly, the relative abundance of the zzso zzso containing the zzso region was also increased in both fetal liver and liver tumors, showing a close zzso with the zzso pattern at the zzso zzso zzso examination of zzso liver zzso with zzso zzso directed to the zzso and zzso segments revealed that the zzso zzso containing these extra zzso segments were specifically deposited in the tumor zzso Other genes zzso zzso gamma chain of zzso and zzso protein zzso all of which had been shown to be alternatively zzso did not show any significant zzso in the zzso pattern in zzso liver zzso These results indicate that the alternative zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso regions is zzso modulated in both fetal and zzso liver zzso toward inclusion of the extra zzso segments and that not all but only selected genes are susceptible for zzso zzso of alternative zzso zzso in zzso liver zzso
