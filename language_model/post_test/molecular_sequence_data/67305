During infections zzso zzso zzso uses zzso as an iron source, which it captures from human zzso using the Iron regulated surface zzso zzso zzso On the cell surface two related zzso surface receptors called zzso and zzso bind to zzso and extract its zzso Both receptors contain multiple zzso iron zzso zzso zzso that either bind to zzso or to zzso All previous structural studies have investigated individual zzso zzso and have not explored how the zzso might interact with one another to zzso extract zzso from zzso Here, we report the near complete zzso zzso and zzso backbone resonance assignments of a zzso unit from zzso that contains the zzso and zzso zzso zzso which bind to zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso 39 zzso The assigned backbone zzso lay the foundation for future zzso studies that will explore the molecular basis of zzso zzso
