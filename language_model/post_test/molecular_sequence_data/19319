Six strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from human zzso Based on zzso analysis, zzso zzso cellular fatty acid profiles and zzso profiles, these strains could be included within the zzso zzso and made up two zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that five strains were most closely related to zzso zzso sharing about 92 % sequence zzso the remaining strain was most closely related to zzso zzso sharing about 90 % sequence zzso All six strains were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cellular fatty acid compositions of the six strains differed significantly from those of other zzso zzso Five strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contained zzso zzso and the major zzso of these strains were zzso zzso and zzso The major zzso of zzso were zzso and zzso Based on zzso and zzso findings, two novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are proposed, representing the two different strain zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso The type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
