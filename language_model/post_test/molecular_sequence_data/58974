zzso is an inner membrane protein with three zzso a zzso zzso and zzso central and zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with outer membrane zzso of zzso coli was zzso Western zzso analyses of cell extracts with zzso zzso indicated that zzso forms high molecular weight complexes specifically with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not with zzso The interaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was also zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso via its central domain, but not with either their zzso zzso forms or zzso Moreover, the presence or absence of zzso associated with zzso zzso did not modify the zzso These results suggest that the specific interaction of zzso with outer membrane zzso might be relevant to the function of zzso zzso
