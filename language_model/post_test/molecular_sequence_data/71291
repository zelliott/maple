The folding reactions of some small proteins show clear evidence of a zzso process, whereas others, lacking zzso zzso do zzso Evidence from folding zzso and transition states suggests that folding begins locally, and that the formation of native secondary structure precedes the formation of zzso zzso not the zzso Some notable examples in the literature have been interpreted to the zzso For these examples, we have simulated the local structures that form when folding begins by using the zzso program with zzso interactions turned zzso Our results support a zzso model of protein zzso
