The zzso characteristics of zzso zzso strains that reacted with zzso group M zzso were zzso Group M zzso have not been proposed as a species to zzso Four strains of the group M zzso isolated from dog were located within the zzso group of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the group M strains were located a short distance away from all other members of the zzso The zzso values of zzso zzso gene sequences between group M strains and all other zzso zzso Group M strains exhibited low levels of zzso zzso to other zzso zzso Some zzso traits, such as zzso activity and acid production from zzso could distinguish these group M strains from other closely related zzso Thus, these strains are proposed to constitute a new species zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
