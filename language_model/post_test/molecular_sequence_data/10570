The zzso zzso of zzso plants exhibiting zzso zzso male zzso zzso contain a repeated DNA region designated zzso This region was found to be rearranged in the zzso of all zzso zzso zzso fertile plants in all nuclear backgrounds zzso A zzso zzso transcribed from the R region in zzso of sterile plants was absent from all zzso zzso zzso The nuclear gene zzso which suppresses the zzso zzso was found to have a specific effect on the expression of the R zzso the abundance of the major R zzso including the zzso zzso zzso is decreased in zzso of restored zzso zzso sequence analysis of R has revealed similarities to the zzso zzso found in some South American zzso races with zzso zzso to the zzso zzso found in one source of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso gene and its 3' zzso zzso and also to a region 3' to the zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence of the R region predicts two open reading frames zzso These zzso contain the similarities to zzso zzso zzso and zzso The present report reveals the zzso nature of the R region, describes the complex effect of zzso on the expression of the R sequence and implicates R in the sterile zzso of zzso zzso
