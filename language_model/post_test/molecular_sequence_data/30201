zzso zzso I, II, and III share three zzso that are zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes that zzso these zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated and zzso and their zzso start sites were zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso These genes are single zzso reside on different zzso and are essential for zzso The fact that the genes are single zzso corroborates previous evidence suggesting that each of the common zzso is identical in zzso zzso I, II, and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso proteins whose sizes are consistent with zzso zzso I, II, and III zzso zzso similarity between the zzso zzso protein and a previously characterized human zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that the common zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso are well zzso among zzso The presence of these zzso and essential zzso in all three nuclear zzso zzso and the absence of recognizable sequence motifs for DNA and zzso zzso indicate that the common zzso do not have a zzso role but are important for a function shared by the zzso zzso such as zzso efficiency, nuclear zzso zzso stability, or coordinate regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
