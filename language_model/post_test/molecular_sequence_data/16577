In higher plants, although several genes involved in shoot zzso zzso zzso formation and organ separation have been isolated, the molecular mechanisms by which they function are largely zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso are examples of two such genes that zzso the zzso domain zzso This study investigated the molecular basis for their zzso Nuclear zzso zzso indicated that green fluorescent protein zzso proteins accumulate in the zzso zzso zzso and transient expression zzso demonstrated that the zzso domain zzso of the zzso has zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that the functional specificity of the zzso for promoting zzso shoot formation resides in the highly zzso zzso domain, not in the zzso in which motifs specific to the zzso zzso are zzso Taken together, these observations suggest that zzso proteins zzso the target genes involved in SAM formation and organ separation through a specific interaction between the zzso domain and the promoter region of the target zzso
