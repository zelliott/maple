zzso patterning of polar and zzso zzso acids has been used as the key design feature for constructing large zzso libraries of de zzso zzso Each position in a zzso patterned sequence is designed explicitly to be either polar or zzso however, the precise identities of these zzso acids are varied zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso strategy zzso explicit design of particular side chains at specified zzso zzso packing interactions cannot be specified a zzso To assess whether the zzso code strategy can nonetheless produce zzso de zzso zzso we constructed a second-generation library based upon a new structural scaffold designed to fold into zzso zzso zzso zzso of five proteins chosen arbitrarily from this new library revealed that zzso all are zzso and quite zzso zzso four of the five contain an abundance of zzso interactions indicative of zzso zzso and zzso one protein forms a zzso structure with zzso zzso The proteins from this new zzso library are substantially more stable and dramatically more zzso than those from an earlier zzso patterned library of zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that chain length is a crucial zzso of structural order in libraries of de zzso zzso zzso Moreover, these results show that the zzso code zzso applied to an appropriately designed structural zzso generate large collections of zzso folded and/or zzso zzso
