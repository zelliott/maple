zzso zzso the zzso zzso is a globally invasive zzso that causes serious agricultural damage by zzso plant zzso This zzso forms a cryptic species complex that displays zzso indistinguishable zzso Among them, the B and Q zzso are the most important zzso zzso Because they have different levels of zzso resistance, these zzso must be identified in order to achieve proper zzso zzso zzso a convenient, rapid and specific detection method for identifying the two zzso is zzso 

zzso zzso amplification zzso was employed for rapid identification of zzso zzso B and Q zzso By combining a quick DNA extraction method, identification of the two zzso was achieved within 1 h of detection zzso The zzso zzso was applied to study the dynamics of zzso zzso zzso both in the field and in zzso It was found that, while temperature may be important for population dynamics of the zzso in the field, population dynamics in greenhouse conditions may be influenced by the types of zzso 

The newly designed zzso zzso is a simple, rapid and accurate method for identifying the B and Q zzso It can be conducted by zzso and can contribute to zzso zzso
