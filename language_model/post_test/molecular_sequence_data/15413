A zzso zzso nuclear protein 1 zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso were produced and subsequently used in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso was specifically expressed in the anterior silk zzso zzso and the middle silk zzso zzso but not in the zzso silk zzso zzso There were two bands that suggested the existence of an zzso of zzso The expression profiles of zzso in zzso and zzso were similar, and they zzso a high level of expression throughout the period during which silk zzso grew zzso zzso results revealed that zzso was zzso from the nucleus into the zzso when larvae developed from the zzso into the 5th zzso zzso zzso promotes the zzso while the zzso zzso juvenile hormone zzso zzso zzso the zzso Our findings indicate that zzso is involved in silk produce along with the rapid growth of zzso and zzso during the last zzso larvae, and the process could be regulated by hormones via control of zzso zzso from the nucleus to the zzso
