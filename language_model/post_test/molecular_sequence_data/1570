zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso an extraordinarily complex conversion reaction, including two zzso two zzso bond zzso and a dehydration, to form the zzso analogue zzso from a zzso zzso and zzso Of these zzso the two zzso bond zzso are especially noteworthy because previous experiments have indicated that they proceed via a zzso reaction, one of the most widely used reactions in organic zzso The structural evidence that zzso zzso an zzso zzso reaction has been reported recently zzso et zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso structure as well as the zzso structure of zzso are similar to those of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso reaction of zzso zzso Here, the structure of zzso is described in detail and compared with that of zzso zzso Both zzso have a zzso fold and are classified as belonging to the zzso zzso based on their reaction zzso The basic principles for zzso bond formation used by both zzso and zzso zzso are the same with regard to zzso the zzso zzso and inducing subsequent zzso The major differences in the active sites between these two zzso are the recognition mechanisms of the second zzso zzso and zzso zzso
