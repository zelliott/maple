zzso for genetic diseases were run and sequence analysis of DNA was carried out by zzso of zzso transcripts with zzso array zzso zzso gel pads zzso zzso 100 zzso 20 zzso were fixed on a glass slide of the microchip and contained zzso immobilized zzso zzso The zzso transcripts of zzso zzso DNA were zzso labeled by zzso or chemical methods and zzso with the zzso The simultaneous measurement in real time of the zzso and melting on the entire zzso array was carried out with a zzso microscope equipped with zzso zzso The monitoring of the zzso specificity for duplexes with different zzso and AT content was enhanced by its measurement at zzso discrimination temperatures on melting zzso zzso zzso were zzso by choosing the proper zzso zzso from among the set of overlapping zzso The accuracy of zzso detection can be increased by simultaneous zzso of the microchip with two differently labeled samples and by parallel monitoring their zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The efficiency and reliability of the sequence analysis were demonstrated with zzso for zzso zzso
