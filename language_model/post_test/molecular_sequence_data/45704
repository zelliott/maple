The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a major role in zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso and therefore is crucial for maintaining normal blood zzso The human gene for zzso zzso produces two major transcripts by alternative promoter usage zzso originally cloned from kidney and zzso zzso zzso Though rare, zzso zzso zzso have been reported in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso short zzso and zzso zzso A 27-year-old male presented with these zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular pathology responsible for this patient's clinical zzso 

A comprehensive zzso examination was performed, detailed zzso and systemic medical histories were taken and past medical records were zzso zzso screening was performed by using direct zzso sequencing of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso was made by expressing the zzso and zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso 

We identified a novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso in our patient who had zzso short zzso zzso zzso and bilateral zzso disease zzso glaucoma, and band zzso The patient also had a medical history of zzso migraine with transient zzso attacks, and slight zzso The zzso zzso failed to induce zzso transport zzso The zzso was not effectively transported to the zzso membrane and thus was unable to act as a zzso zzso 

This novel zzso increases our understanding of the zzso aspects of the zzso protein and the molecular basis of the zzso zzso associated with its zzso
