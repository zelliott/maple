zzso host factor zzso is a small zzso protein that specifically binds to DNA and functions as an architectural factor in many cellular processes in zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso zzso with 35 zzso of zzso The DNA is wrapped around the protein and bent by zzso degrees, thus reversing the direction of the zzso axis within a very short zzso Much of the zzso occurs at two large zzso where the base stacking is interrupted by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso contacts the DNA exclusively via the zzso backbone and the minor groove and relies heavily on indirect zzso to recognize its binding zzso One such zzso involves a zzso A zzso providing evidence for the importance of a narrow minor zzso
