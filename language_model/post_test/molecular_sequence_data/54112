A zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from zzso of the reef builder coral zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso Channel, zzso zzso zzso The strain was zzso and zzso and required zzso for zzso Its zzso position was in the zzso zzso and the closest related species were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the isolate exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarities of zzso with the type strains of these zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities with other type strains of the zzso zzso were below zzso zzso zzso between strain zzso and the type strains of the zzso closest species of the zzso zzso revealed less than zzso zzso zzso supporting the novel species status of the zzso zzso characterization revealed that the strain was able to grow at zzso zzso and in medium containing up to zzso zzso The isolate could be differentiated from zzso related species by several features, including its ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso acid and zzso acid, but not zzso or zzso It produced zzso zzso but did not have zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso It possessed zzso zzso summed feature 3 zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso as major cellular fatty zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate this novel zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
