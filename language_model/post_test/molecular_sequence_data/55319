zzso zzso is a key zzso zzso involved in various aromatic compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of growing on zzso and zzso was proposed to zzso a zzso involved in this zzso by its disruption in the zzso zzso zzso Its zzso characterization by zzso zzso using zzso zzso has not been previously zzso 

In this study, zzso characterization of zzso by zzso zzso with zzso zzso demonstrated that it specifically transported zzso into the cells with zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of dry weight and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, and no activity was detected for either zzso or zzso When zzso was absent in strain zzso zzso it retained zzso of its original transport activity at pH zzso compared to that of strain zzso However, it lost zzso and zzso activity at pH zzso and zzso zzso A number of competing zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso by more than zzso Through zzso zzso eight zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso regions and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were shown to be important for zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively were changed to zzso both zzso retained approximately 50% activity and were able to partially complement the ability of strain zzso zzso to grow on zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso is an active zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso transport was also shown to be a limiting step for the zzso zzso by this zzso This enhances our understanding of zzso transport in the microbial degradation of aromatic zzso
