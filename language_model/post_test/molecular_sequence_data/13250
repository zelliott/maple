zzso of zzso zzso is a periodically expressed gene that is required for entry into S phase and for the coordination of S phase with zzso zzso is related to the zzso zzso gene zzso which has also been implicated in the control of DNA zzso We have identified a new zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes an zzso protein with zzso acid sequence motifs zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is essential for zzso zzso spores lacking the zzso gene are capable of undergoing one or more rounds of DNA replication but fail to progress further, arresting as long cells with a variety of zzso nuclear zzso Unlike zzso zzso is expressed zzso during the cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso belong to a family of related genes that also includes the gene zzso which encodes a zzso of the origin recognition complex zzso of zzso zzso The products of this gene family share a zzso acid domain that is highly zzso in evolution and contains several characteristic zzso including a consensus zzso zzso zzso Among the members of this gene family, zzso is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso Thus, the protein zzso by zzso may represent a component of an zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is also closely related to an zzso putative human zzso It is likely that the members of the zzso family play key roles in the regulation of DNA replication during the cell cycle of diverse species from zzso to zzso
