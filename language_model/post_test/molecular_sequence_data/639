The roles of zzso and zzso of point zzso in the origin of new zzso zzso characteristics have been hypothesized, but it is not known which are essential to zzso We studied zzso differences between zzso zzso strains isolated from successive stool specimens of an oral zzso vaccine zzso The studied strains included three zzso zzso with increasing numbers of zzso in the zzso zzso two of the three with an zzso acid change zzso in the zzso of zzso their putative zzso parent and strains zzso 1 and zzso Growth of these viruses was examined in three cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The main observation was a higher growth rate between 4 and 6 h zzso of the two zzso with the zzso zzso All zzso grew at a higher rate than parental strains in the exponential phase of the replication zzso In a temperature sensitivity test, the zzso zzso zzso equally well at an elevated zzso Complete zzso sequencing of the three zzso revealed 12 zzso 19 zzso and 27 zzso zzso zzso zzso differences from zzso zzso were located in regions defining zzso temperature sensitivity, zzso and the zzso replicating zzso The zzso site was in the zzso end of zzso In a competition zzso the most zzso zzso beat parental zzso in all three cell lines, strongly suggesting that this virus has an zzso Two independent zzso zzso zzso and zzso also showed similar growth advantages, but they also contained several point zzso Thus, our data defend the hypothesis that zzso of certain advantageous zzso plays a key role in gaining increased zzso
