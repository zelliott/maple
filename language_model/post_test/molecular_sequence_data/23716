zzso pancreatic necrosis virus zzso a zzso virus of the family zzso exhibits a high degree of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso A encodes all the structural zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso B encodes the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso We tested 3 different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated during field outbreaks in Norway for their ability to cause mortality in zzso and zzso of Atlantic salmon zzso zzso zzso The cumulative mortality following experimental challenge in zzso was zzso for zzso followed by zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso In zzso the corresponding mortality rates were 79, 46 and zzso zzso Comparisons of the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso A and B of all 3 zzso strains revealed zzso of zzso in 13 positions, of which 6 are in zzso 2 in zzso and 5 in zzso Our results suggest that these zzso especially those in the outer zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso Genome zzso A of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and contains a major open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso which zzso at the second zzso start zzso at zzso zzso This was zzso by making zzso of zzso A clone using zzso zzso followed by in zzso zzso translation reaction and zzso zzso In addition, zzso A also encodes a 15 zzso zzso zzso protein from a small ORF, preceding and partially overlapping the zzso ORF, which is truncated to 12 zzso in the virulent zzso zzso Moreover, zzso A could zzso a novel, putative 25 zzso protein from another zzso between zzso and zzso coding regions, which is only detected in the zzso zzso zzso B is zzso zzso long and encodes in a single large zzso (a zzso of 844 zzso acid zzso zzso
