zzso zzso has been exploited to produce transgenic plants with resistance to viral pathogens via zzso gene zzso zzso In some cases, this technology is difficult to apply due to the instability of zzso repeat zzso zzso during cloning and plant zzso Although such zzso have been shown to be stabilized with zzso and efficiently induce zzso zzso we found that the zzso zzso did not stabilize South African zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso zzso we developed a method for producing long zzso zzso zzso through zzso base pair zzso on the sense arm prior to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mismatched zzso zzso in the model test plant zzso zzso resulted in a reduction in viral zzso transcript levels, hence viral zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso more efficiently in a zzso zzso callus system than zzso zzso zzso Our novel method for zzso construct generation should be zzso to many sequences where the generation of these zzso has proven difficult in the zzso
