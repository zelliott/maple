zzso membrane zzso zzso is a critical step regulating zzso zzso have evolved multiple strategies to zzso zzso for their own zzso Thus, many viruses code for proteins that act on zzso and control zzso of infected zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso to zzso zzso and induce zzso which is often accompanied by zzso swelling and zzso From a structural point of view, all the viral zzso proteins discovered so far contain zzso zzso that are necessary for the zzso effects and seem to have zzso properties, as it has been shown for zzso from human zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso B virus zzso In contrast, zzso viral proteins zzso zzso from zzso virus, zzso from zzso virus and zzso from zzso zzso contain zzso targeting sequences zzso in their zzso that are zzso to zzso zzso These zzso are similar to those present in many proteins of the zzso family and are responsible for inserting the protein in the outer zzso membrane leaving the zzso of the protein facing the zzso The zzso proteins zzso and zzso from avian zzso virus zzso and viral zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso from zzso are capable of binding zzso zzso proteins such as zzso zzso activated zzso 3, zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, viruses zzso zzso at the zzso level by multiple different zzso
