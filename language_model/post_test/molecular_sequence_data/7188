Since their introduction, the interaction trap and other zzso systems have been used to study zzso zzso Despite their general use, little is known about the extent to which the degree of protein interaction determined by zzso approaches parallels the degree of interaction determined by zzso zzso In this study, we used a set of zzso and zzso reporters to zzso the interaction zzso For the zzso we used two sets of zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso versions of the zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that the strength of interaction as predicted by the zzso approach generally zzso with that determined in zzso permitting discrimination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but there was no single reporter for which the amount of gene expression zzso reflected affinity measured in zzso However, some reporters showed thresholds and only responded to stronger zzso Finally, some interactions were subject to zzso and their apparent strength depended on the reporter zzso Taken together, our results provide a cautionary framework for interpreting affinities from zzso zzso
