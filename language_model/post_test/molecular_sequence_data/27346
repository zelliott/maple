The zzso zzso factor zzso has emerged as a pivotal regulator of zzso zzso zzso by controlling the expression of many zzso antioxidants and phase II zzso zzso Upon zzso stress, zzso is induced at protein levels through zzso modifications on zzso zzso of zzso a component of the zzso zzso zzso that targets zzso for zzso zzso The zzso activated protein zzso zzso have previously been proposed to regulate zzso in response to zzso zzso However, the exact role of zzso and the underlying molecular mechanism remain poorly zzso Here we report the first evidence that zzso is zzso in zzso by zzso We have identified multiple zzso zzso as major targets of zzso zzso Combined zzso substitution on those zzso leads to a moderate decrease in the zzso activity of zzso most likely due to a slight reduction in its nuclear zzso More importantly, zzso protein stability, primarily controlled by zzso is not altered by zzso zzso in zzso These data indicate that direct zzso of zzso by zzso has limited contribution in modulating zzso zzso We suggest that zzso regulate the zzso signaling zzso mainly through indirect zzso
