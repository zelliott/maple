zzso growth zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso associates with zzso growth factor zzso We analyzed the reaction of zzso with zzso type zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that promotes zzso zzso and cellular zzso zzso zzso single chain zzso zzso between zzso and zzso converting the zzso into zzso active zzso zzso zzso as shown by zzso zzso sequence analysis, and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso reaction were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso yielding a zzso efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also activated zzso bound to receptors on zzso zzso as demonstrated by the generation of zzso activity against a zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso may initiate zzso cell surface zzso and therefore enhance zzso activities that require cellular migration and/or tissue zzso
