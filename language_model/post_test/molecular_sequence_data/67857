zzso fever is the most important zzso infection found in tropical regions around the zzso zzso of the zzso and an increase in migratory flow between countries have led to large zzso and severe clinical zzso such as dengue zzso fever and dengue shock zzso This study zzso the genetic zzso of the dengue virus zzso 1 zzso in Brazil with regard to the full-length structural genes zzso among 34 strains isolated during zzso that occurred in the country between zzso zzso zzso and time of divergence were also evaluated with only the E gene of the strains isolated from zzso An analysis of zzso acid differences between these strains and the French zzso strain zzso revealed the presence of important zzso zzso in the zzso acid zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso analysis of E proteins comparing the studied zzso and other strains selected from the zzso database showed that the Brazilian zzso strains since 1982 belonged to zzso zzso This analysis also showed that different introductions of strains from the 1990s represented lineage replacement, with the identification of three lineages that cluster all zzso from the zzso An analysis of the divergence time of zzso indicated that the lineage circulating in Brazil emerged from an ancestral lineage that originated approximately zzso years zzso
