A recent comparison of two zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the region at the right end of the zzso zzso component zzso zzso genetic zzso similar to those observed in serially zzso human zzso zzso To determine the coding content of authentic zzso zzso in this region, the zzso sequence was amplified from virus obtained from naturally infected zzso zzso without passage in zzso A total of 24 open reading frames zzso potentially zzso zzso zzso acid zzso were identified, 10 of which are related to zzso zzso and 15 to previously listed zzso zzso In addition, the analysis revealed a cluster of three novel alpha zzso zzso bringing the number of predicted alpha zzso genes in this region to zzso Three of these six genes exhibit a high level of sequence diversity, as has been observed for the zzso alpha zzso gene zzso
