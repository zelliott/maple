zzso cells release zzso oxide zzso acutely in response to increased zzso fluid zzso stress, and the increase is correlated with enhanced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid analysis of zzso from bovine zzso zzso cells labeled with zzso demonstrated that only zzso was present in zzso under both zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso stress induced zzso incorporation into two specific zzso zzso peptides as early as 30 s after initiation of zzso The zzso zzso zzso were zzso separated by zzso zzso with intermittent zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso in a tandem mass zzso Two zzso sequences determined by tandem mass zzso zzso and zzso were confirmed as the two zzso zzso by zzso with synthetic zzso Because the sequence zzso contains a consensus zzso site for protein zzso B zzso or zzso we demonstrated that zzso an inhibitor of the upstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso by zzso and NO production by zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso in zzso at the same site zzso in the cell and increased zzso zzso activity by zzso
