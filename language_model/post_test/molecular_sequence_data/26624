The closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are excellent zzso zzso We previously described the activity of a zzso zzso zzso from an industrial strain of zzso subsequently reclassified as zzso We now report the identification of the gene zzso this zzso zzso This was retrieved from zzso zzso using a zzso primer zzso strategy, based on zzso regions from the zzso acid sequences of three zzso bacterial zzso zzso This sequence is zzso identical to another, zzso from zzso type zzso zzso was zzso ascribed to the major zzso zzso The putative zzso acid sequence of zzso and zzso presented a zzso pattern compatible with plasma membrane zzso The last was functionally expressed in zzso zzso The sensitivity of transport activity to a zzso confirmed its dependence on zzso motive force, as expected from a zzso We named zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso from zzso zzso Based on the very high zzso we suggested that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may also zzso zzso zzso zzso
