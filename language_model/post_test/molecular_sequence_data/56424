zzso of human zzso after zzso and preparation of the zzso for zzso involves profound zzso zzso zzso zzso cell growth factor zzso is a recently identified growth factor with significant zzso zzso Four species of zzso zzso zzso were identified in human zzso and zzso All species were present throughout the zzso zzso Two species, zzso and zzso were present in peripheral zzso indicating zzso zzso of the two other zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was not restricted to vascular smooth muscle but was present in zzso and zzso cells of zzso throughout the cycle, and the distribution changed during the course of the zzso All four species of zzso were expressed by the zzso zzso cell lines Ishikawa, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso zzso zzso zzso medium from these cells possessed zzso activity that was depleted by passage through a zzso affinity zzso None of the cell lines demonstrated zzso for zzso or basic zzso growth factor zzso despite previous reports of the identification of zzso basic zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings show that zzso not zzso are the principal zzso growth factors zzso by these cells and that human zzso expresses a zzso zzso growth factor whose site of expression changes during the zzso zzso
