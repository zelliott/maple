zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein that binds to a variety of cell types and that influences zzso zzso It has a zzso structure with regions zzso to zzso growth factor zzso repeats, zzso zzso type II repeats, and the beta and gamma chains of zzso zzso The current study demonstrates that a fusion protein corresponding to the sixth zzso type III repeat in zzso zzso supported cell attachment and promoted an increase in the number of cells with zzso in both central and peripheral zzso in tissue zzso The third zzso type III zzso zzso like intact zzso supported attachment of peripheral zzso but not of central zzso and, while it caused an increase in zzso zzso it did not increase the number of cells that zzso zzso When zzso and zzso were combined, an increase in both the number of cells zzso zzso and in zzso length was observed for peripheral zzso that resembled their response to intact zzso Cell attachment to zzso was inhibited in the presence of zzso zzso against beta 1 zzso In contrast, the interaction with zzso was not inhibited by zzso to beta 1 zzso but was inhibited by zzso zzso The results suggest that cell binding to zzso involves two different sites within the zzso and occurs via different receptors which may be zzso expressed on different zzso cell zzso The location of these sites within the whole zzso in the context of other adhesive and zzso zzso may zzso their influence on cellular responses such as cell attachment and zzso zzso
