zzso and zzso growth factor zzso receptors are zzso proteins consisting of two zzso two zzso and members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso triggers a cascade of zzso events, which begins with zzso of several zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso The triple cluster in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso is the earliest and major zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso of these three zzso by zzso of both insulin and zzso receptors practically abolish any zzso of cellular signaling zzso We have studied the effect of double zzso zzso on zzso induced zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and cell proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso zzso blocks any zzso zzso whereas substitution of zzso zzso or zzso only reduces zzso levels in some clones by approximately zzso Nevertheless, all the cells expressing zzso receptors with double zzso zzso demonstrated markedly reduced signaling through zzso and zzso zzso In addition, they were unable to respond to zzso cell growth in culture, and tumor formation in nude mice was zzso These data suggest that the presence of zzso zzso or zzso essential for zzso zzso whereas the presence of each of these zzso is necessary for a fully functional zzso
