A protein which selectively binds zzso and zzso sequence repeats in single stranded DNA has been identified in human zzso This zzso designated zzso has been zzso at least zzso by ammonium zzso zzso followed by zzso column zzso and affinity zzso in a column of zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that the zzso protein bound most avidly zzso and zzso tracts of zzso zzso zzso It also bound other zzso DNA sequence repeats, including zzso zzso with lower zzso It did not manifest significant binding affinities to single stranded zzso DNA, or to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or to various DNA sequence repeats which do not contain G zzso such as zzso and zzso It did not bind double stranded zzso tracts or other double stranded DNA zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso activities zzso as a homogeneous protein species having an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an estimated native molecular weight of 190,000 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the protein contains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which bind zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso gel zzso of the zzso protein followed by silver zzso indicated that it may also contain other zzso that do not contact the zzso It is proposed that binding of the zzso protein to single stranded zzso or zzso tracts in double stranded zzso restricted DNA may stimulate strand separation and formation of triple zzso or other unusual DNA zzso
