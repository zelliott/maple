The multiple biological activities of tumor necrosis factor zzso are zzso by two distinct cell surface receptors of 55 zzso zzso and 75 zzso zzso Using gene zzso we generated a zzso mouse zzso zzso from zzso mice lack expression of zzso but display normal numbers of high affinity zzso zzso zzso development and zzso populations are zzso and zzso deletion of potentially zzso T cells is not zzso However, zzso signaling is largely zzso as judged by the failure of zzso to induce zzso B in T zzso from zzso zzso The loss of zzso function renders mice resistant to lethal zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso mice are severely impaired to clear zzso zzso and readily succumb to zzso Thus, the 55 zzso zzso plays a decisive role in the zzso defense against zzso and their zzso zzso
