The zzso development of the zzso zzso zzso system in the rat brain is a zzso and zzso zzso In an attempt to analyze the molecular mechanism by which the dramatic change of gene expression of the zzso occurs we have examined the level of zzso zzso in the zzso area zzso and cerebral zzso in development from fetal to zzso stages of female zzso We used zzso chain reaction to zzso from zzso zzso the zzso corresponding to the zzso domain of the zzso forms zzso and zzso zzso as well as the region around the zzso site zzso of the putative zzso form zzso zzso A quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was used to measure the level of zzso for zzso forms zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form zzso There was a regional difference in the zzso distribution between the total and form zzso zzso indicating possible distinct mechanisms responsible for regulating the expression of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the brain, already zzso 2 days before birth, increased at early zzso zzso The total zzso zzso in the zzso developed in a manner essentially similar to the zzso protein at the early zzso but, surprisingly, unlike the zzso the messages remained high at the later stages from day 18 to 8 weeks of zzso On the other hand, the zzso of the cortical zzso for form zzso which predominantly existed in the region, resembled that of the cortical zzso zzso In the zzso the zzso development of the form zzso zzso was also roughly similar to the zzso These results suggest zzso and zzso gene expression of the zzso zzso system in the developing brain: gene expression of form zzso seems to be zzso first, zzso zzso around birth, followed by form zzso zzso expression around days zzso Moreover, lowered levels of the cortical zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso together with suppressed zzso level, indicate a possible regulatory role of zzso hormone on gene expression of the cortical zzso
