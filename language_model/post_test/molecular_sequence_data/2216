We reported previously that the zzso in C1 and D zzso toxins specifically zzso zzso of an Mr 22,000 zzso zzso protein and that this zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso has an zzso acid sequence zzso to that deduced from the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we have determined the zzso acid sequence at its zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by C1 zzso toxin and zzso with zzso The radioactive peptides were isolated by zzso high performance liquid zzso and zzso further either with zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso or with zzso zzso and zzso By this procedure three radioactive peptides were zzso and their zzso acid sequences were zzso zzso and zzso in which no zzso acid peak was found in zzso During the sequencing the zzso zzso zzso to the sequencing filter and was not zzso with either of the identified zzso acid zzso Analysis of the protein without the zzso yielded the corresponding sequence as zzso which zzso to zzso in the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso zzso is the zzso site in the zzso gene zzso This zzso protein bond was stable in zzso M zzso at pH zzso at 37 degrees C for at least 5 zzso The zzso of this protein affected neither its zzso nor its zzso zzso zzso
