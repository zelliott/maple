We have used solution state zzso zzso to characterize the secondary structure and backbone dynamics of the proteins zzso and zzso in their zzso zzso zzso zzso of the results with those previously obtained for the Parkinson's zzso protein zzso shows that structural differences between the three zzso zzso family members are directly related to variations in their primary zzso acid zzso An zzso deletion in the zzso domain of zzso leads to the zzso of an entire segment of the zzso zzso structure containing the deletion zzso The zzso zzso tail region of zzso which displays extensive sequence zzso is more highly zzso than the corresponding regions in the other two family zzso The observed structural differences are likely to mediate functional variations between the three zzso with differences between zzso and zzso expected to revolve around their zzso zzso while differences in zzso function are expected to result from different zzso interactions zzso by its unique zzso zzso
