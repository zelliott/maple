zzso zzso zzso is a zzso toxin composed of an zzso component zzso and a binding component zzso We investigated the role of the zzso zzso motif of zzso in the zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso increased with an increase in the concentration of zzso zzso A surface zzso resonance analysis showed that the binding of zzso to the zzso of zzso is dependent on the concentration of zzso However, the addition of zzso had no effect on the binding of zzso zzso to the zzso We replaced zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso motif of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound to the cell and formed an zzso at about half of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso was about zzso less than that of zzso zzso zzso study showed that these zzso were zzso in the early zzso like zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the cells, but these zzso did zzso The result indicates that the zzso zzso motif in the zzso region of zzso plays a role in the interaction of zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso
