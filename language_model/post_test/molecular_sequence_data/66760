zzso B cells and their zzso precursors play an important role in the immune response of the zzso cavity and zzso surfaces in zzso We have previously shown that zzso and zzso B lineage cells are unlikely to be significantly linked in zzso However, the status of the zzso remains zzso Here, using zzso we observed that zzso zzso B cells and occasional clusters of B cells were present in the zzso and that plasma cells, predominantly with zzso zzso G zzso were zzso We zzso sequences of zzso genes amplified using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso from the normal human greater zzso and describe the characteristics of variable region genes used by zzso zzso and zzso We focused on the properties of zzso and zzso families to allow comparisons of like with like between different zzso zzso and cells from different immune zzso We observed that the zzso genes were derived from a mixed population with zzso and zzso zzso zzso All zzso and zzso genes used by zzso and zzso from zzso cells showed evidence of zzso zzso but the load of zzso was not significantly different to that seen in either the systemic or the zzso zzso The trends observed, including the dominance of zzso plasma cells, the zzso ratio being biased towards zzso zzso zzso and a moderate level of zzso zzso link zzso B lineage cells with the systemic zzso These observations reinforce previous studies highlighting the difference between human and zzso zzso compartments and their relationship to the zzso immune zzso
