The zzso zzso comprises up to 35 species, of which 20 are responsible for human zzso However, the zzso status for many of them is under zzso The small Heat zzso zzso zzso are zzso relevant, protecting cellular proteins from zzso and maintaining cellular viability under intensive stress zzso In zzso a protein of this class was previously zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso which is zzso by a single zzso In the present study, we used this target, alone or in combination with zzso zzso to investigate the zzso relationships among zzso zzso Using a pair of zzso zzso it was possible amplifying a zzso zzso of the zzso coding region in 39 strains of very different geographic origins, representing in total 16 zzso species zzso if zzso zzso and zzso zzso are considered synonymous names of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were readily obtained by direct sequencing of the amplification zzso Both zzso trees and networks based on either zzso sequences or combined zzso of zzso and zzso sequences were zzso These zzso analyses supported the division of the zzso zzso into nine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso major, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Additionally, by network analysis, the subspecies zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were recognized within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso species, zzso zzso zzso gene was found to be a suitable molecular marker for zzso typing and zzso zzso In addition, this study represents a solid contribution to the objective of establishing a more reliable zzso for the zzso zzso
