In order to determine base requirements in zzso 2 and 4 of the hairpin zzso a comprehensive zzso analysis of the wild type sequence was zzso Each base position in these two zzso was zzso to contain each of the three zzso type zzso and the effects of these zzso were analyzed using zzso zzso The method of data analysis allowed for the determination of zzso rates as well as the fraction of transcripts produced which were zzso Three positions in loop 2 zzso zzso and zzso and one position in loop 4 zzso resulted in no zzso zzso when zzso to any of the zzso type zzso The remainder of the base positions showed varying degrees of tolerance to base zzso with respect to their support of zzso Evidence was obtained for the presence of a zzso base pair between zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso of the hairpin zzso On the basis of these results, a two-dimensional model for the hairpin zzso is zzso
