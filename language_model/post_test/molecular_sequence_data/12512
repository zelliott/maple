zzso zzso is a retrograde zzso motor thought to participate in zzso transport and some aspects of minus zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of binding to zzso and zzso is zzso Based on zzso with the zzso zzso outer arm zzso intermediate chains zzso we proposed a role for the zzso zzso zzso in linking the motor protein to zzso and zzso In this study two different zzso zzso were used in zzso overlay and zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso In zzso of complex protein samples, the zzso bound specifically to zzso of 150 and 135 zzso identified as the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso overlay zzso zzso specifically recognized the zzso zzso from total zzso cell zzso rat brain zzso and rat brain zzso further identified the zzso complex as a specific target for zzso zzso using zzso zzso the sites of interaction were mapped to zzso acids zzso of zzso and zzso acids zzso of zzso While zzso zzso and zzso have been implicated in a common zzso by genetic analysis, our findings identify a direct interaction between two specific component zzso and support a role for zzso as a zzso zzso Our data also suggest, however, that this interaction must be highly zzso
