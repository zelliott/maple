zzso of zzso and zzso zzso linked by zzso proteins to zzso zzso stabilize the red blood cell zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso can result in severe zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in mice and zzso Four mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso affect the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso 1 and cause severe HS and zzso Here we describe the molecular zzso in zzso and their consequences in zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso the skipping of zzso 41 and premature protein termination before the site required for zzso of zzso with zzso A nonsense zzso in zzso 52, zzso eliminates the zzso 13 zzso zzso Both defects result in instability of the red cell membrane and loss of membrane surface zzso In zzso barely zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso decreased synthesis of zzso protein are primarily responsible for the zzso zzso By contrast, zzso mice zzso the truncated zzso in which the zzso zzso acids are deleted at higher levels than normal, but they cannot retain this zzso protein in the zzso The zzso deletion is near the zzso region at the zzso complex providing new evidence that this zzso acid segment at the zzso of zzso is crucial to the stability of the zzso zzso
