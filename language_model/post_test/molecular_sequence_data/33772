zzso viruses enter cells by viral zzso binding to host cells and subsequent fusion of virus and host cell zzso For the zzso viral spike zzso proteins execute these cell entry zzso The S proteins are set apart from other viral and cellular membrane fusion proteins by their extensively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are generally required for zzso zzso but their precise roles in the process are zzso To obtain additional insights into the zzso membrane fusion process, we focused on these zzso zzso zzso zzso Substituting zzso for the zzso that are subject to zzso had effects on both S incorporation into zzso and zzso membrane zzso In specifically zzso the effects of zzso zzso on the fusion process, we used zzso zzso repeat peptides that bind only to folding zzso in the zzso fusion process and found that zzso lacking three zzso zzso remained in transitional folding states nearly 10 times longer than native S zzso This slower zzso was also reflected in the paucity of zzso zzso bundle zzso among the zzso S zzso zzso with fewer zzso S protein zzso entered cells slowly and had reduced specific zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso S proteins into virus zzso are necessary for the zzso productive S protein zzso events that culminate in membrane zzso These studies reveal a previously unappreciated role for zzso attached lipids on the zzso of viral proteins zzso membrane fusion zzso
