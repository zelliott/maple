Fish vary in the ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty acids zzso with marine fish such as cod being inefficient in comparison to freshwater and zzso zzso We investigated differences in the gene promoters of zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso a critical zzso in zzso zzso in cod and zzso Progressive deletions and targeted zzso of the promoters were tested for activity in a zzso Atlantic salmon zzso cell line under low or high zzso treatment, and regions sufficient to direct zzso were zzso zzso of these regions with sequences of corresponding regions of zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso and fish indicated a remarkable conservation of binding sites for zzso and zzso In addition to these sites, a site was identified in salmon with similarity to that zzso by zzso zzso factor, and which was required for full expression of the salmon zzso zzso zzso The cod promoter was less active and lacked the zzso zzso zzso acid suppressed zzso synthesis in AS cells and also suppressed activity of the salmon zzso zzso promoter although this activity was likely zzso through sites other than zzso possibly similar to those zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso
