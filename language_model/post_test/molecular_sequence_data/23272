zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were prepared containing single sites of zzso at zzso zzso and zzso (12 zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso were obtained to determine a complete set of zzso zzso zzso and zzso involving the labeled carbon and nearby zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso group zzso of each zzso In parallel theoretical studies, the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso involving zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso angles in zzso model compounds were zzso using density functional theory zzso and a special basis set designed to reliably recover the Fermi contact contribution to the zzso Complete zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso were obtained and used to zzso new equations zzso these zzso to omega and/or zzso zzso zzso were also tested for accuracy by measuring zzso in zzso zzso derivatives of zzso and zzso in which values of omega and zzso were zzso Using a new computer program, zzso designed to zzso multiple zzso sensitive to zzso zzso zzso the ensemble of experimental zzso observed in zzso were analyzed to yield preferred zzso populations about omega and zzso zzso due to the sensitivity of some zzso most notably zzso zzso and zzso to both omega and zzso unique information on correlated zzso about both zzso angles was zzso The latter treatment represents a means of evaluating correlated zzso in zzso zzso since zzso and zzso are redundant in these zzso In the latter regard, zzso redundant zzso zzso originating from both sides of the zzso linkage can be used collectively to evaluate zzso correlations between zzso and zzso bond zzso
