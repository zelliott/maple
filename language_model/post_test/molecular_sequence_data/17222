zzso identification is a prerequisite to understand zzso regulation of gene zzso From analysis of a limited number of zzso gene zzso sequence comparison has proved a robust and efficient way to locate zzso Human and mouse zzso genes zzso a critical zzso zzso factor zzso in expression and zzso Proper control of zzso zzso is critical in regulating zzso lineage zzso and zzso Here, we compared sequence and systematically mapped position of zzso I hypersensitive sites, zzso status of zzso zzso and in zzso binding of zzso factors over approximately 120 zzso zzso the human zzso gene and the corresponding region in zzso Despite lying in approximately 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso segment, the zzso structures of the 2 zzso zzso are zzso zzso The 2 previously unidentified zzso zzso one in each species, are not zzso in position and sequence and have zzso activity in zzso zzso In zzso they both bind the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso More broadly, there are both zzso and regulatory zzso patterns of zzso factor zzso These findings suggest that some zzso regulating human and mouse zzso genes zzso More generally, mouse human sequence comparison may fail to identify all zzso
