zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso proteins involved in the zzso of light by zzso zzso zzso also was identified as an zzso in the degenerative disease of the zzso known as zzso zzso zzso a zzso syndrome zzso zzso events lead to the zzso of zzso in some individuals with zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso is expressed in the lung tumor of a zzso patient but not in similar tumors obtained from individuals without the associated zzso zzso was identified zzso by Western zzso analysis of the zzso patient's biopsy tissue by using zzso zzso generated against different regions of the zzso zzso In addition, cultured cells from the biopsy tissue expressed zzso as demonstrated by reverse zzso using zzso extracted from the zzso The zzso region of zzso also was determined in this study by a zzso zzso employing overlapping zzso encompassing the entire zzso zzso Two linear stretches of zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso made up the major zzso One of the same regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso also was uniquely zzso causing zzso zzso upon zzso of Lewis rats with the corresponding zzso These data demonstrate that the neural zzso zzso more than likely is responsible for the zzso events associated with vision loss in some patients with zzso These data also establish zzso as one of the few zzso diseases for which the specific zzso is zzso
