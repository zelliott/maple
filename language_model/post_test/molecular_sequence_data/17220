Plant zzso contain various kinds of repetitive sequences such as zzso zzso zzso tandem repeats and zzso zzso Most of them, with the exception of zzso zzso do not allow us to trace their origins nor to follow the process of their integration into the host zzso Recent discoveries of zzso sequences in plant zzso led us to set the objective of zzso the origin of the repetitive zzso zzso rice zzso zzso virus zzso sequences zzso have been found throughout the rice zzso Here, we reconstructed putative virus structures from zzso sequences in the rice zzso and characterized to understand evolutionary zzso integration manner and zzso of zzso virus segments in the corresponding disease zzso 

We have collected zzso from the rice zzso They contain rearranged structures and no intact zzso The identified zzso segments were shown to be zzso divided into three zzso For each zzso zzso we were able to make a consensus alignment for a circular zzso structure carrying two complete zzso Comparisons of DNA and zzso acid sequences suggested the closely relationship between zzso and zzso The zzso zzso species vary in the zzso copy zzso The species carrying zzso of zzso segments have been reported to be extremely susceptible to zzso The DNA zzso state of the zzso sequences was correlated with their copy number in the zzso 

These zzso segments are unlikely to have functional potential as a zzso However, these sequences facilitate to establish putative virus that provided information underlying virus integration and evolutionary relationship with existing zzso zzso of zzso among the zzso zzso species allowed us to speculate a possible role of zzso virus segments against its related zzso
