We have cloned and zzso the zzso zzso zzso locus of zzso zzso The locus seems to be organized in an zzso zzso four zzso The first three zzso zzso highly similar to the product of the coding sequences characterizing the zzso zzso of zzso The sequencing of the conditional lethal zzso zzso localized in the zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso targeted in the internal region of zzso and zzso demonstrated the essential role of this zzso The fourth ORF, zzso part of the putative zzso which is not similar to any known zzso is also zzso The regulation of expression of the zzso monitored by zzso zzso zzso is similar to the regulation of the functionally relevant zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso was induced by zzso zzso and its expression was directly or indirectly affected by zzso zzso zzso and functional analysis strongly indicates that in zzso zzso the class I zzso zzso zzso by this zzso zzso is zzso distant from the zzso class I zzso of zzso
