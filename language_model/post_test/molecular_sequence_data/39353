zzso of the hot water extract of Chlorella zzso was performed using a combination of ethanol zzso size exclusion zzso and zzso exchange zzso One fraction contained a new zzso and this compound was shown to be a zzso zzso from its zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a molecular weight of 15 zzso from zzso zzso zzso A number of other zzso were shown to have the same repeating unit as the previously identified zzso However, zzso from different zzso were shown by zzso zzso to have different molecular zzso which ranged from 27 to zzso zzso zzso with molecular weights measured for some of these zzso by zzso was very good, further confirming the relationship established by zzso et zzso between molecular weights of neutral zzso and zzso zzso The smaller molecular weight zzso the zzso and the 27 and 50 zzso zzso were shown to be close to zzso by analysis of the zzso of the zzso zzso for the zzso The larger zzso had considerable variation in their molecular weights zzso zzso 109 zzso and zzso zzso 370 zzso Only the two larger zzso showed zzso zzso
