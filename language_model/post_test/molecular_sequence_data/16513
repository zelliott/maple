zzso zzso arthritis, which may result from zzso zzso is associated with zzso to a T cell zzso of zzso protein A zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This syndrome has been noted primarily in the United States where only zzso is present, and rarely in Europe where zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso To gain a better understanding of this zzso we identified its zzso zzso determined their zzso and characterized the contribution of individual zzso zzso Based on published sequences the zzso zzso differed from the zzso zzso in six of the nine core zzso zzso acids zzso whereas the zzso zzso usually differed in three of the nine zzso zzso from seven patients with zzso zzso arthritis proliferated in response to the zzso zzso but not to the zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso were critical for the zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, consistent with the geographic distribution of the illness, the European zzso agents of zzso zzso usually lack the putative zzso zzso zzso These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that T cell recognition of this zzso is important in the induction of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
