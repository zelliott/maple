The molecular dynamics of nuclear protein import were examined in a solution binding zzso by testing for interactions between a protein containing a nuclear zzso signal zzso the transport factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso or zzso repeat regions of zzso We found that zzso alpha and beta cooperate to bind zzso but not zzso repeat zzso zzso of the zzso protein to zzso alpha was enhanced by zzso zzso Two novel reactions were zzso First, incubation of a zzso zzso protein complex with an zzso repeat region zzso the zzso of the zzso protein from the zzso zzso Second, incubation of the zzso zzso with zzso (or with a Ran zzso that cannot zzso zzso led to the zzso of zzso alpha from beta and to an association of Ran with zzso zzso zzso had no zzso We propose that movement of zzso proteins across the nuclear pore complex is a zzso process that operates via repeated zzso zzso
