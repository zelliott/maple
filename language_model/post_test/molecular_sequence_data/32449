zzso a gene frequently lost in various zzso encodes a protein with zzso finger, zzso and zzso zzso that belongs to the zzso family of zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso is an unstable protein with zzso activity in zzso and in zzso zzso that zzso acts as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is dependent on an intact zzso domain, as zzso deficient zzso fail to drive zzso in zzso and are stabilized in zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso enabled the identification of several putative zzso interacting proteins localized to the zzso zzso zzso including zzso protein zzso a protein indispensable for zzso degradation zzso zzso we also show that zzso regulates the degradation of the known zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso rule zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso establishing zzso as a novel zzso zzso involved in zzso Finally, we show that zzso contains a zzso zzso domain indispensable for its zzso to the zzso and that zzso zzso with several zzso proteins as analyzed by high-resolution zzso In zzso these data are all consistent with a function for zzso as an zzso zzso zzso zzso
