We have shown previously that the zzso ends of the genes for the alpha zzso and alpha zzso collagen chains lie head-to-head on zzso and are deleted in patients with zzso syndrome zzso diffuse zzso In this study, we raised a rabbit zzso alpha zzso zzso demonstrated its specificity by the analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso all six type IV zzso and studied the distribution of the alpha zzso chain in relation to the alpha zzso and alpha zzso chains in human adult and fetal zzso involved in AS and diffuse zzso The alpha zzso chain zzso with the alpha zzso chain in basement zzso zzso of many zzso but not in zzso zzso These data exclude the alpha zzso chain as a site for AS zzso The head-to-head zzso pairing of the alpha zzso and alpha 6 zzso genes implies coordinate zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso of the alpha zzso and alpha zzso chains shows that the two chains are not always zzso zzso The alpha zzso chain, together with the alpha zzso zzso zzso was absent from all zzso zzso in eight patients with zzso AS while the alpha zzso and alpha zzso chains were zzso The data support the existence of two independent collagen networks, one for the alpha zzso zzso chains and one for the alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso
