We have characterized the distribution, zzso and hormonal regulation of gap junctions in primary cultures of rat zzso cells zzso and three zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a continuous zzso cell line, zzso All cell lines we examined were functionally zzso zzso zzso were the more strongly zzso while zzso and zzso were moderately coupled and zzso and zzso were zzso zzso Exposure to zzso hormone zzso for 1 h increased functional zzso in zzso cells in a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso an analog of zzso with binds to the zzso zzso and thus zzso zzso zzso zzso also attenuated zzso functional zzso in zzso This suggests that zzso increases functional zzso partly through a zzso zzso A 1 h exposure to zzso did not affect zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso To examine whether zzso zzso a specific gap junction zzso is present in functionally coupled zzso cells, we characterized zzso distribution and zzso zzso zzso with zzso to zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso showed little if any zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein were detected by Northern zzso analysis and zzso analysis, respectively, in all cell lines zzso including zzso Our findings suggest that acute exposure to zzso regulates gap junction zzso in a zzso dependent manner, in zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
