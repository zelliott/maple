Three copies of zzso and three copies of zzso have been identified and zzso from a zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso line, zzso One of the copies of zzso lacked zzso 2 and 3 and appeared to be a zzso The two other copies of zzso and two of the three copies of zzso were isolated from a bacterial artificial zzso library of zzso Using an zzso line zzso with a zzso zzso of the zzso gene which resulted in a change from complete zzso to complete resistance to zzso zzso experiments were carried out with the two versions of zzso and the two versions of zzso When transformed into zzso all four zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to both mechanical and zzso challenge with zzso One of the copies of zzso did not appear to support viral replication as successfully as the other copy of zzso or the two copies of zzso The results show that zzso can use both zzso and zzso from zzso zzso for replication and, for the first time, that a virus can use zzso and zzso from multiple zzso of a single host zzso
