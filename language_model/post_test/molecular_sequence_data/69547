A strategy has been developed to express and purify a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso c zzso in zzso zzso in quantities necessary for extensive zzso zzso It involves zzso in the same zzso zzso the zzso gene with a functional gene copy for zzso in a selective zzso The functional gene encodes a product with an engineered zzso zzso site zzso and zzso that enables efficient separation of the two zzso by immobilized zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein possesses a binding site for zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso of several derivatives of this zzso show striking similarities to those of corresponding derivatives of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The use of a zzso zzso for zzso c expression together with zzso separation opens the way for the engineering of zzso with dramatically altered structural and zzso zzso
