The zzso acid sequence of mouse brain beta zzso zzso zzso deduced from the zzso sequence of complementary DNA zzso reveals that this zzso beta zzso comprises zzso zzso with a molecular weight of zzso zzso Brain beta zzso contains three structural zzso and we suggest the position of several functional zzso including zzso zzso I, zzso and zzso self association zzso Analysis of deduced zzso acid sequences indicated striking zzso and similar structural characteristics of brain beta zzso repeats beta 11 and beta 12 to zzso In zzso analysis has demonstrated that zzso is capable of specific attachment to brain zzso suggesting possible new functions in electron transfer, oxygen zzso zzso oxide binding or zzso zzso
