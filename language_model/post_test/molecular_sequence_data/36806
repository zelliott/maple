In this study, we present a model compound for zzso zzso zzso zzso I, zzso zzso zzso interacts through contacts with the minor zzso Secondary structure of zzso I, zzso zzso constrained by two zzso bridges and connected by zzso contributes significantly to its DNA zzso The present results give valuable information for design of zzso DNA binding zzso based on zzso zzso
