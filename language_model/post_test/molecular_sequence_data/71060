Ten genes zzso required for the zzso of zzso an zzso compound composed of a zzso zzso linked to a zzso zzso were identified within a zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of eight zzso genes were similar to the zzso acid sequences of genes with known zzso functions, including type I zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso or a zzso resistance gene in each of these genes abolished zzso production by zzso The presumed functions of the eight zzso products are consistent with zzso transformations involved in zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso labeling studies demonstrated that zzso is the primary precursor to the zzso zzso of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the product of another zzso zzso zzso is similar to those of members of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are transcribed zzso from the zzso gene zzso and a sequence with the characteristics of a zzso binding site was identified within the zzso zzso region separating zzso from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso assessed with zzso zzso to an ice nucleation reporter zzso was significantly greater in zzso than in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is proposed to be a zzso zzso of linked zzso zzso zzso
