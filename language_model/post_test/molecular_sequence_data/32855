A rat brain zzso zzso for a novel protein with zzso activity was cloned and functionally zzso The protein was expressed as a zzso fusion product with a molecular weight of about 63 zzso zzso zzso was strictly dependent on zzso zzso and zzso values were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The product zzso was a linear competitive inhibitor zzso zzso The zzso zzso metal zzso requirement and pH optimum zzso coincide with those reported for zzso coli zzso the best characterized of the zzso However, as indicated by the zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein was about zzso less efficient than the bacterial zzso The deduced zzso sequence revealed great differences with all known zzso thus excluding the protein from the zzso zzso It was, however, highly identical zzso to the predicted sequences for fragments of hypothetical or unnamed zzso zzso zzso As a zzso the zzso activity is zzso to a protein with an active site that zzso catalyze a reaction other than the one it evolved to zzso
