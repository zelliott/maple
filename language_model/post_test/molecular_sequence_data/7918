The mechanisms regulating expression of mouse zzso tumor virus zzso zzso from the viral sag gene are largely unknown, due to problems with detection and zzso of these zzso zzso To study the expression and regulation of the zzso sag zzso we have developed a sensitive and quantitative reporter gene zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso alkaline zzso fusion zzso High zzso expression in zzso an early zzso cell line, depends on enhancers in either of the viral long terminal repeats zzso and is largely independent of promoters in the zzso zzso The same zzso region is also required for general expression of zzso genes from the zzso zzso The zzso was mapped to a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso lying within sag and shown to be sufficient to stimulate expression from a zzso zzso virus 40 zzso No zzso activity of the zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso cells, which are zzso for zzso Our results demonstrate a major role for this zzso in zzso gene expression in early zzso zzso
