zzso zzso is a zzso protein which is expressed zzso by zzso during late stages of zzso We have found that a zzso element is present within the rat OC gene (between zzso zzso and zzso overlapping the OC signal zzso zzso The presence of this sequence in OC zzso reporter zzso suppresses promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso which do not express zzso by up to zzso This is the first demonstration of contribution from zzso sequences to zzso of animal zzso The element appears to be zzso zzso activity requires both the zzso sequence zzso to zzso and the zzso to zzso zzso zzso 1 border zzso Both of these zzso contain sequences highly similar to zzso motifs in several other zzso including chicken zzso as well as rat collagen type II, insulin, and growth zzso OC zzso activity is fully retained when the element is placed outside the zzso region, 3' but not zzso of the zzso fusion zzso zzso activity is orientation independent in the native position but requires the native orientation when located in 3' zzso zzso The zzso does not inhibit the activity of the zzso zzso early zzso These results suggest interaction between the transcribed zzso and specific OC promoter zzso residing farther zzso The OC transcribed zzso may contribute to zzso control of OC zzso
