The zzso sequence of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso of the zzso fatty acid synthesis zzso of zzso coli, has been determined by the zzso sequencing zzso Most of the sequence was obtained by sequencing zzso insertions of the zzso zzso isolated in zzso A synthetic primer complementary to a portion of the zzso repeat sequences at the ends of the zzso was used to prime DNA synthesis into the zzso zzso zzso The gene is composed of 516 zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso a protein with a molecular weight of zzso zzso half of the derived zzso acid sequence was confirmed by automated zzso sequencing of peptides obtained by zzso zzso zzso The active site zzso zzso zzso has been identified by analysis of the peptides labeled by reaction with zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso adjacent to the active site zzso may play the role in zzso previously assigned to a zzso zzso We also report a simplified zzso process for the zzso beginning with extracts of a brain which greatly zzso the zzso
