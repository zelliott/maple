Limited zzso zzso of zzso zzso from seven related individuals zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of a novel zzso with a molecular weight of 78 zzso and a zzso decrease in the alpha I domain zzso zzso which is the domain involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the normal members of this white family exhibited a normal zzso pattern, as compared with zzso The abnormal zzso pattern was associated with a decreased ability of zzso zzso to zzso In this zzso in which three generations were available for study, the clinical manifestations were quite variable and ranged from the zzso HE carrier state to zzso HE or to severe anemia requiring zzso The severity of the disease appeared to be correlated both with the amount of zzso zzso zzso to zzso and with the excess of the zzso zzso found in the membrane zzso to zzso compared with a normal value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing showed that the alpha zzso zzso resulted from zzso at zzso zzso 10 of the alpha zzso zzso zzso of the zzso structure of cloned zzso DNA zzso the alpha I domain allowed us to amplify in zzso a DNA zzso containing the third zzso of the zzso zzso The amplified zzso was zzso and zzso A G to T zzso was found in the 39th zzso zzso for zzso which changed the normal zzso to a zzso zzso of amplified zzso with zzso zzso corresponding to the normal and zzso sequences confirmed the presence of the zzso in three other HE members of the family (the zzso mother, brother, and zzso
