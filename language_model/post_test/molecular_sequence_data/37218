Many zzso zzso interact with nuclear receptors in a zzso and zzso zzso function zzso zzso These include zzso signal zzso 2 zzso a recently isolated zzso zzso zzso which is amplified in human zzso and stimulates zzso by nuclear receptors and numerous other zzso zzso In this report, we show that zzso belongs to a zzso complex of approximately 2 zzso zzso complex zzso in zzso zzso zzso contains zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso group proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso In particular, zzso and zzso contain a highly zzso zzso to zzso motif termed the zzso domain, which was recently implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibit very weak but specific zzso 4 zzso activities in zzso and zzso by zzso acid zzso appears to involve zzso recruitment of zzso and subsequent transient zzso 4 zzso of the promoter region in zzso Thus, zzso may represent a distinct zzso complex of nuclear zzso Further characterization of zzso will lead to a better understanding of how nuclear receptors and other zzso factors mediate zzso zzso
