zzso and neutral zzso were isolated from a human gastric zzso and binding of zzso zzso to the isolated zzso was assessed using the zzso binding zzso The isolated zzso were characterized using fast atom zzso mass zzso and by binding of zzso and zzso The zzso neutral zzso were found to migrate in the zzso to zzso regions as revealed by zzso zzso and detection with zzso No binding of zzso zzso to these compounds was zzso The most abundant zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso were not recognized by the zzso Instead, zzso zzso selectively zzso with zzso low abundant zzso not detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated and characterized by mass zzso zzso nuclear magnetic zzso and zzso binding as zzso zzso and zzso zzso
