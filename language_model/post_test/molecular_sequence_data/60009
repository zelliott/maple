The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a model for branching regions in zzso has been investigated by one-dimensional zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso effect zzso zzso experiments at 30 degrees C in water and in the zzso mixture water : zzso zzso (7 : zzso zzso rates were obtained from the zzso experiments and interpreted as zzso zzso From zzso zzso Carlo and zzso dynamics simulations, distances were calculated and compared to those obtained from zzso Using the previously determined dynamics from zzso zzso relaxation zzso of the zzso in the zzso mixture, zzso zzso distances could be obtained that were in excellent to reasonable agreement with those calculated from zzso In water, the isolated zzso approximation was used for comparison of zzso zzso The zzso derived distances in both zzso showed that the zzso distances were shorter between the zzso zzso of the zzso group and the zzso at the linkage position, respectively, than to the zzso on the adjacent carbon on the zzso zzso The zzso distances calculated from the computer simulations, performed with three different force fields, namely zzso zzso and zzso resulted in the reverse order in all cases but zzso
