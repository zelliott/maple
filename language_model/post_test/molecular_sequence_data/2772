To define the V gene family repertoire of human zzso zzso zzso type b zzso zzso we zzso six zzso and nine zzso zzso zzso to zzso from immune serum of six individuals and performed zzso zzso acid sequence zzso Of the 15 zzso zzso we zzso all H chain V regions were of the zzso zzso In contrast, the L chains of these zzso were clearly from at least four different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and V zzso zzso zzso family expression correlated with the zzso of these zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso did not zzso whereas zzso expressing V zzso zzso or zzso generally zzso We conclude that L chain V regions are very important contributors to the limited zzso in this zzso zzso
