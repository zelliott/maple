zzso is one of the most abundant modified bases in zzso However, little is known concerning the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify molecular zzso that are necessary for zzso activity, we have developed a zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using this zzso we have identified zzso zzso that are critical for the activity of zzso an zzso coli zzso We also show that the zzso gene product, a putative zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso formation, providing the first zzso demonstration that zzso zzso encodes an active zzso
