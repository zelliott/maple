zzso a gene isolated as a potential zzso of zzso disc zzso in zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso is zzso identical to those of human zzso In cultured zzso discs, zzso transcript levels and zzso zzso activity increase in response to the steroid hormone, zzso In zzso zzso transcript and zzso activity appear in developing zzso muscles by late stage 13, well before the onset of muscular zzso High levels of transcript and zzso activity persist throughout zzso and throughout zzso zzso The gene has been localized by in zzso zzso and zzso mapping to zzso on the third zzso zzso activity is reduced to approximately 50% of wild type in animals zzso for a zzso that removes the zzso zzso zzso deficient for the zzso region lack zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is the only gene that encodes zzso in zzso
