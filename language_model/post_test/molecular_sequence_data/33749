zzso zzso a recently recognized pathogen of human, is one of several zzso zzso in the United States that causes a spotted fever zzso To gain insights into its biology and zzso we applied the zzso approach to establish a two-dimensional gel zzso reference map and combined this technique with cell surface zzso to identify zzso proteins of a zzso isolate of zzso zzso obtained from a zzso We identified 91 proteins by zzso laser zzso zzso time of flight mass zzso Of these, 28 were characterized as surface zzso including zzso proteins zzso outer membrane protein A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with serum from the zzso zzso index patient was zzso to identify the zzso proteins as potential targets for diagnosis and vaccine zzso In addition to the known zzso zzso zzso and zzso we identified translation initiation factor 2, cell division protein zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso The zzso map with corresponding cell surface protein analysis and zzso detection will facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms of zzso zzso
