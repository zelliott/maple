A stable zzso enrichment culture was obtained that zzso zzso with zzso as an electron zzso The zzso degradation rate was zzso zzso zzso per day, which is similar to reported zzso zzso degradation rates but zzso times higher than reported for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of part of the zzso zzso zzso cloning and sequencing showed that the culture had a stable composition after the seventh zzso Five bacterial clones were further zzso Two clones corresponded to bacteria closely related to zzso zzso zzso The three other clones corresponded to bacteria closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of cultures grown with different electron donors and zzso indicated that the zzso related to zzso zzso zzso is able to degrade zzso coupled to zzso zzso The role of the other bacteria could not be zzso zzso The zzso related to zzso zzso zzso can be enriched with zzso and zzso but not with zzso and zzso while the zzso related to zzso zzso grows with zzso and zzso but not with zzso and zzso As oxygen is produced during zzso reduction, an zzso zzso of zzso degradation is most zzso
