The zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso revealed a new gene zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso a commonly used zzso ammonium zzso and the zzso dye zzso zzso zzso in zzso isolated from the food zzso The 107 zzso acid zzso protein showing zzso identity to the zzso zzso resistance protein zzso is a new member of the small zzso resistance zzso protein zzso zzso zzso resistance via zzso dependent zzso An additional zzso on zzso zzso a protein with extensive similarity to replication proteins of other zzso zzso Gene zzso containing the zzso and zzso gene region combined with the zzso or zzso promoter, respectively, indicated that zzso is more efficient than zzso and that zzso has a weaker zzso zzso zzso cells could be adapted to withstand higher zzso of zzso Adapted zzso cells showed increased resistance mainly to zzso In contrast, adaptation of sensitive cells showed zzso development to a range of zzso zzso of zzso zzso was observed for zzso zzso cells not containing zzso The ability of zzso zzso of BC to develop zzso and induce zzso mechanisms could be of practical zzso it should be considered before use of any new zzso and in the design of better zzso zzso
