Experimental zzso zzso is an zzso disease induced in mice, which involves the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso T cells into the normally zzso zzso zzso is produced in the target organ following the zzso of zzso and zzso T cells and by the release of zzso zzso such as NO by activated zzso The majority of immune cells zzso into the zzso are zzso zzso cells, but, despite the presence of these zzso relatively limited numbers of T cells are observed in the zzso during the disease zzso These T cells do not zzso when zzso are isolated from the zzso and zzso in zzso although they do produce both zzso and zzso T cell proliferation was restored by depleting the zzso cells from the cultures and zzso those isolated zzso cells were able to regulate the proliferation of other T zzso The ability of zzso to regulate proliferation depends on zzso by T zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling in the zzso cells via zzso In the absence of zzso zzso relative T cell expansion in the zzso is increased, indicating that regulatory zzso cells may also act in zzso However, zzso signaling is also required for zzso but not T cells, to migrate into the target zzso Thus, in zzso knock out mice, the amplification of zzso is zzso leading to resistance to experimental zzso zzso zzso
