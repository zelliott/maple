In zzso selection techniques are useful means of zzso the functions of both natural and artificial zzso Using a zzso zzso containing the zzso coli zzso P zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso Harris ME, Pace zzso 1994, zzso zzso we have devised a method to select for zzso active zzso of the zzso P zzso A selection experiment was performed to probe the structural and sequence constraints that operate on a highly zzso region of zzso zzso the zzso region, which lies within the core of zzso P and is thought to bind zzso essential zzso zzso zzso ME et zzso 1994, zzso J zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1995, zzso J zzso Harris ME, Pace zzso 1995, zzso zzso We sought to determine which, if any, of the nearly zzso zzso within zzso are required for zzso zzso Twenty-two zzso in the zzso component of zzso P zzso were zzso and, surprisingly, after only 10 generations, each of the zzso positions returned to the zzso zzso This indicates that every position in zzso contributes to optimal zzso zzso These results contrast sharply with selections involving other large zzso which evolve improved zzso function readily in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1994, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Joyce zzso 1994, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kumar zzso Ellington zzso 1995, zzso J zzso The zzso conservation of zzso coupled with the results reported here, suggests that the contribution of this structure to zzso zzso was zzso very early in evolution, before the last common zzso of all zzso
