zzso bee workers use zzso for the zzso of the colony and themselves when they are exposed to dangers and zzso It is produced by a long thin, convoluted, and zzso zzso and consists of several toxic proteins and zzso The present study was undertaken in order to identify the mechanisms that protect the zzso zzso zzso cells against these harmful zzso zzso of whole zzso zzso including the interconnected zzso were separated by two-dimensional gel zzso and the most abundant protein spots were subjected to mass zzso identification using zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso study revealed four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso A zzso zzso 2540 zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso A zzso Although zzso zzso has also been associated with zzso detoxification, the protein we found belongs to the zzso zzso class which is known to protect against zzso stress zzso Moreover, we could demonstrate that the zzso and zzso activity of the zzso zzso was low and moderate, respectively, when compared to other zzso from the adult honey zzso Several proteins involved in other forms of stress were likewise found but it remains uncertain what their function is in the zzso zzso In addition to major royal jelly protein 9 zzso already found in a previous zzso study, we identified zzso as second member of the zzso protein family to be associated with the zzso zzso zzso of both zzso were amplified and zzso Two zzso structural proteins were abundantly present in the zzso and most probably represent a structural component of the zzso lining that protects the zzso cells from the toxins they zzso
