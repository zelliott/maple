zzso factor zzso inhibitor is the major potent zzso inhibitor of tissue zzso zzso Several potential binding sites for zzso factors have been described in the 750 zzso of the zzso zzso region of the human tissue factor zzso inhibitor gene reported zzso To identify elements that regulate the expression of tissue factor zzso inhibitor in zzso zzso and zzso cells, the sequence of an additional 770 zzso of tissue factor zzso inhibitor was zzso zzso of this new sequence as well as that reported earlier with consensus sequences for zzso factor binding sites provided matches for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, plasmids containing deletion zzso of the zzso tissue factor zzso inhibitor promoter region and the zzso reporter gene were zzso into zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three negative regulatory elements were localized between zzso to zzso - 390 to zzso and zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start, respectively, in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
