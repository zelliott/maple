To investigate whether or not alternative zzso might be a mechanism by which in zzso zzso diversity is generated in zzso of the novel zzso family of zzso zzso processing zzso we determined structural and functional characteristics of the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed zzso transcripts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso By comparative zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 10 coding zzso were identified and, together with Northern zzso analysis using zzso zzso evidence was obtained that the four transcripts are generated by alternative zzso and zzso The apparently complete open reading frames of three zzso zzso revealed that these coded for three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which possessed common but also unique structural zzso These various zzso of zzso in zzso were characterized in gene transfer studies using zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso transcripts was found in Northern zzso analysis of zzso from various zzso stages of zzso zzso in zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso and zzso zzso are expressed in zzso sets of zzso during zzso zzso In gene transfer experiments in which the zzso zzso and zzso proteins were expressed at high levels together with the precursor of the beta zzso of zzso a member of the transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso or the precursor of von zzso factor, all three proteins appeared capable of processing these zzso Our studies indicate that the zzso gene encodes structurally different zzso zzso processing zzso with distinct zzso functions in zzso
