Using a human transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso zzso zzso probe, we have detected an zzso species zzso at about zzso zzso in cultured primary chicken zzso zzso that is distinct from chicken zzso beta zzso The cloning and sequencing of zzso corresponding to this zzso zzso demonstrate that it represents a new member of the zzso beta family, which we have named zzso beta zzso Unlike previously described zzso beta which are 390 to zzso zzso acids long, the predicted precursor protein of zzso beta 4 is only 304 zzso acids and does not appear to contain a signal zzso Also unique to this new zzso beta is an zzso of two zzso acids near the zzso of the processed zzso which would result in a 114 zzso acid mature protein after zzso from the precursor at a zzso zzso zzso The nine zzso zzso characteristic of all zzso beta are zzso zzso beta 4 shows zzso zzso and zzso identity with the zzso acid sequences of processed zzso beta 1, 2, and 3, zzso
