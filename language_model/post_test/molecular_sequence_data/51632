We have discovered a new zzso protein component associated with the outer membrane of the ancestral zzso zzso zzso In electron zzso the zzso zzso zzso appears as a zzso zzso that spans the zzso connecting the outer membrane to the inner cell zzso zzso zzso characterization and sequencing of zzso alpha suggest that it is a zzso composed of two zzso of 380 zzso acids with a calculated zzso of zzso and a zzso of zzso The sequence of the zzso alpha gene indicates a zzso organization of the protein with a zzso zzso domain of 64 zzso followed by a putative zzso segment of 300 zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The predicted length of the zzso segment zzso zzso zzso closely with the spacing between the inner and outer zzso Despite sequence similarity to a large number of zzso proteins and high scores in a zzso prediction algorithm, the sequence of the central zzso domain of zzso alpha does not have the typical zzso zzso of zzso proteins but rather has a zzso of zzso zzso Such a zzso was also found in the central domain of zzso M protein and zzso and might be indicative of a zzso of zzso proteins with packing interactions that are distinct from the ones seen in other zzso zzso
