zzso of human zzso DNA corresponding to the promoter region of the gene for the zzso zzso have been cloned upstream of the bacterial gene for zzso zzso and these zzso used to assess promoter activity following zzso into a human zzso cell zzso Progressive zzso deletions as well as internal zzso zzso support a critical role in gene expression of a sequence element approximately 70 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso In this region, the zzso gene was found to contain zzso that are identical to a segment of the enhancers of zzso virus and zzso A zzso encompassing this element was shown to increase gene expression when the zzso was placed in either orientation upstream of the remainder of the zzso zzso promoter but the same zzso did not activate an zzso zzso zzso zzso from within the zzso promoter of three potential binding sites for the zzso factor zzso did not decrease the zzso zzso
