Progressive loss of lung function resulting from the inflammatory response to bacterial colonization is the leading cause of mortality in zzso zzso zzso zzso A greater understanding of these bacterial infections is needed to improve lung disease zzso As zzso diagnoses are associated with fundamental zzso we used terminal restriction zzso zzso length zzso profiling and zzso zzso clone data to zzso without prior zzso the bacterial community in 71 zzso from 34 adult zzso zzso zzso species from 15 zzso were identified in 53 zzso zzso clones from three zzso Of these, 15 species have not previously been reported in zzso lung infections and many were species requiring strict zzso conditions for zzso The species richness and zzso were determined from the zzso length and volume for the 71 zzso Species richness was on average zzso zzso zzso per sample and zzso zzso zzso per zzso On average, the zzso bands of the lowest and highest volumes represented zzso and zzso of the total volume in each profile, zzso The second through fifth most dominant zzso bands represented zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the total profile volume, zzso On average, the remaining zzso bands represented zzso of the total profile zzso The zzso band corresponding to zzso zzso had the highest volume in zzso of the zzso However, 18 other zzso band lengths were dominant in at least one zzso In conclusion, this reveals the enormous complexity of bacteria within the zzso zzso Although their significance is yet to be determined, these findings alter our perception of zzso lung zzso
