The human gene zzso the zzso factor zzso alpha was isolated from an zzso zzso zzso library screened by low stringency zzso Two overlapping clones were characterized by restriction zzso analysis and included zzso zzso of the zzso alpha zzso The entire gene and zzso zzso of the promoter were zzso The human zzso alpha gene is zzso zzso long and encodes a zzso zzso acid long zzso which is the same in length as for rat zzso zzso Compared to rat zzso zzso there are two insertions of two zzso acids and one deletion of zzso The zzso acid similarity between the two proteins is over zzso The human zzso alpha gene was found to be expressed at the highest levels in zzso High expression was also found in liver, zzso skeletal muscle, zzso small zzso colon and in peripheral blood zzso However, the expression was zzso or very low in brain, zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results show that the human zzso alpha gene is expressed in a tissue restricted zzso
