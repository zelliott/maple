zzso isolation, and identification of individual virus infected cells during long term infection are critical to advance our understanding of mechanisms of zzso for zzso zzso However, current approaches to study these viruses in zzso have been hampered by low sensitivity and effects of zzso on expression of viral zzso reporter zzso We have designed a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso system to overcome these problems, and thereby enable tracking and isolation of individual in zzso infected zzso 

zzso zzso 68 zzso was used as a zzso persistent model zzso A zzso expressing zzso virus was constructed and zzso The virus is attenuated both in zzso virus zzso producing zzso lower lung virus zzso than wild type virus, and in the establishment of zzso However, despite this zzso when the zzso mouse line containing a zzso enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso was infected with the zzso expressing virus, sites of zzso and persistent virus infection could be identified within B cells and zzso of the zzso system on the basis of zzso zzso zzso the use of the zzso mouse line which expresses high levels of zzso allowed individual virus positive cells to be zzso by zzso zzso gene expression could be detected in these zzso Low numbers of zzso positive cells could also be detected in the bone zzso 

The use of this novel zzso zzso system allowed identification of individual zzso infected cells in zzso and may be useful for the study and long-term monitoring of other zzso virus zzso
