zzso loss of zzso and zzso in vulnerable regions of the brain is one of the most important pathological features of Alzheimer's disease zzso Increased zzso stress has been shown to contribute to the neurodegenerative process in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso plaques is one of the defining features of Alzheimer's zzso Indeed, zzso has been shown to induce zzso stress and zzso in many in zzso and in zzso models of zzso We now report that zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein initially identified as an interaction partner of zzso like zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family), is expressed in cortical zzso and in neural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso expression in cortical zzso zzso of zzso induction zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppressed zzso production, inhibited zzso formation and membrane zzso zzso and protected against zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a novel zzso factor and it may protect against zzso zzso through its effects on suppressing the production of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso may therefore represent a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention of zzso in both sporadic and familial forms of zzso
