zzso marginal zone zzso zzso zzso are thought to develop from zzso infiltrates that represent immune responses to external or zzso Except for gastric zzso the zzso triggers of zzso development are mostly unknown, although a subset of zzso zzso have been associated with zzso zzso zzso To further evaluate whether a common zzso may be promoting the development of zzso zzso the zzso heavy chain variable zzso genes from eight USA cases were zzso and zzso All used zzso family gene zzso with zzso using the same zzso segment, zzso using the closely related zzso or zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso showing evidence of ongoing zzso Many of the zzso region zzso zzso also showed similarities in length and displayed zzso zzso acid motifs in the zzso areas between the diversity and joining zzso The use of similar zzso gene segments and zzso zzso zzso acid motifs suggests that some of these zzso zzso may bind the same or similar zzso via their surface zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso present in many of the zzso genes was also consistent with zzso directly stimulating the growth of zzso zzso
