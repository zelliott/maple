Many studies have used zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso or zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso to search for zzso proteins that are related to the presence of breast zzso We review the zzso discovered or targeted measured by these methods and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these zzso We highlight two proteins that were most often related to breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fragments of zzso zzso inhibitor heavy chain zzso zzso In addition, we elaborate on three important zzso aspects related to these zzso protein zzso specificity of the zzso and disease zzso Finally, we propose some points to be addressed in future zzso These include the use of other zzso measurement techniques, need of protein zzso the importance of identical sample handling protocols for cases and controls, and the zzso of the results according to molecular zzso and stages of breast zzso Ultimately this may lead to the discovery of new and valid breast cancer specific zzso
