zzso zzso are zzso small zzso zzso that repress their targets at post zzso zzso Single zzso zzso zzso in zzso can lead to severe defects to the functions of zzso and might result in zzso Although several studies have tried to identify the zzso in human zzso genes or only in the mature zzso there are only limited endeavors to explain the distribution of zzso in these important zzso After a zzso scan for zzso in human zzso we totally identified zzso zzso in 961 out of the zzso reported zzso precursors of human, which is the most complete list of zzso in human zzso to zzso More importantly, to explain the zzso of zzso existed in human zzso we zzso and systematically analyzed the identified zzso in zzso from several zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso context, secondary structure, and functional importance of human zzso affect the zzso of zzso in these zzso Our results also show that the number of zzso with significantly different zzso among various populations in the zzso and 1000 Genome Project data are consistent with the geographical zzso of these zzso These analyses provide a better insight of zzso in human zzso and the spreading of the zzso in zzso in different zzso
