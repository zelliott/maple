zzso DNA of the zzso zzso zzso can be zzso and specifically altered by transforming zzso or zzso zzso cells directly with synthetic zzso zzso forms of zzso c were generated by transforming a zzso zzso with zzso and selecting for at least partially functional zzso the zzso contained a sequence that corrected the zzso zzso and produced additional zzso at nearby zzso Transformation has been accomplished with zzso as short as 20 zzso and with amounts as low as 100 zzso This method of zzso zzso in zzso has been used to produce zzso in the zzso region of zzso c in which the zzso zzso is excised and the penultimate zzso is zzso
