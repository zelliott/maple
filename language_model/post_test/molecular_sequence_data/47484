zzso genes are typically organized into zzso zzso units that give rise to complex sets of zzso and zzso overlapping zzso through a series of processing zzso The zzso zzso contains genes for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso complexes which are needed in different amounts during zzso zzso The functional significance of gene organization in this zzso unit, containing information for two different complexes, is not known and is of zzso To determine the organization and expression of these complexes, studies have been carried out on crop plants by different groups, but not much information is known about zzso We present the zzso sequences of zzso genes and zzso profiles of the genes located in the zzso zzso from zzso zzso a tree zzso Although the gene organization of this zzso in zzso zzso is similar to that in other species, a few variations have been observed in the processing zzso
