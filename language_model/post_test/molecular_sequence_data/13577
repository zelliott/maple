zzso zzso structure is known to play critical roles in zzso recognition and zzso zzso To examine how DNA zzso structure might relate to zzso structure, we performed in zzso selection experiments to identify zzso zzso that specifically bind zzso and compared the results with analogous experiments performed with zzso In the case of zzso a motif related to the zzso binding site in human zzso virus zzso zzso was commonly found, whereas in the case of DNA, two novel motifs and no zzso structures were zzso One DNA zzso found in approximately zzso of the cloned zzso forms of hairpin structure with a highly zzso 10 zzso loop, whereas the second motif is especially rich in G zzso Chemical interference and zzso experiments identified zzso in both motifs that form specific zzso binding sites, and zzso zzso experiments identified single zzso zzso in both that are protected from zzso in the presence of zzso suggesting possible sites of zzso contact or zzso changes in the zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that both zzso undergo zzso changes upon zzso binding and that the zzso zzso group alone is responsible for zzso A model for the zzso motif is proposed in which mixed zzso and zzso quartets may form a novel DNA zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso should provide useful model systems for studying zzso acid zzso zzso
