zzso zzso zzso is a newly discovered zzso zzso which is regulated by zzso and implicated in the regulation of zzso zzso in the zzso We searched the human zzso database and determined that the human zzso gene comprises six zzso as has been shown for human zzso We used rapid amplification of zzso ends to clone a full-length zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and found it to be highly zzso between human and zzso at both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is predicted to be 60 zzso acids in the zzso as in other species, and the region of zzso zzso that shows zzso to the zzso 13 zzso acids of zzso is perfectly zzso We mapped the distribution of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso of the zzso by in zzso zzso and observed that, as in zzso species, the expression of zzso zzso is confined to the zzso nucleus, median zzso and zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso we found that nearly all zzso zzso zzso cells in the zzso nucleus also express zzso for the long form of the zzso zzso These findings suggest that a zzso signaling zzso exists in a zzso zzso
