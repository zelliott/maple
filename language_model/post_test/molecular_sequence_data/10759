Two distinct families of repetitive DNA elements zzso and zzso zzso were identified from zzso zzso zzso DNA of four strains of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso with zzso an zzso sequence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The sequence zzso zzso zzso in zzso with features characteristic of an zzso element, has a terminal zzso repeat of 8 zzso which can be further extended to 23 or 48 zzso with 9 and 26 zzso zzso It displays zzso identity in 967 zzso of overlap with zzso of zzso zzso The zzso contains three open reading frames which have zzso usage almost similar to 56 different coding genes of zzso zzso In Southern blots of restricted zzso zzso zzso with zzso each of the several strains of zzso zzso gives a distinctive zzso zzso is present in the range of zzso copies per zzso in the four strains zzso
