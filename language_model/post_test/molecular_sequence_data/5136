Mouse mast cell zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso are members of a family of related zzso zzso whose genes reside within an approximately zzso zzso zzso complex on zzso 14 that does not readily undergo crossover zzso While mapping the zzso zzso we isolated a novel gene that encodes a zzso zzso zzso designated zzso The zzso and zzso genes are only approximately 7 zzso apart on the zzso and are oriented back to zzso The proximity of the zzso and zzso genes now suggests that the low zzso frequency of the complex is due to the closeness of some of its zzso The zzso transcript and protein were observed in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in normal zzso mice, zzso transcript and protein were found only in those mast cells that reside in the zzso Thus, the expression of zzso differs from that of all other zzso The observation that zzso mouse bone zzso mast cells developed with zzso zzso 10 and zzso zzso contain zzso transcript, whereas those developed with zzso do not, indicates that the expression of this particular zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso Comparative protein structure modeling revealed that zzso is the only known zzso zzso with three positively charged regions on its zzso This property may allow zzso to form zzso complexes with zzso zzso and other zzso charged proteins inside the zzso Although zzso exhibits a zzso overall zzso acid sequence identity with its zzso zzso it has a unique zzso zzso This finding suggests that each member of the zzso 14 family of zzso zzso evolved to degrade a distinct group of zzso
