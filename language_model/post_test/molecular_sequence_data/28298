zzso zzso the alpha chain of Cap Z has been isolated by screening a zzso zzso library with zzso zzso A single zzso insert zzso zzso of zzso base pairs zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso which is incomplete at its zzso zzso The technique of zzso amplification of zzso zzso has been used to extend the zzso end of this open reading frame to a potential zzso initiation site that is preceded by 320 zzso of an apparently untranslated zzso The protein predicted by the resulting zzso sequence has a Mr of zzso and contains four regions that show close zzso with four zzso zzso fragments of the alpha zzso The zzso acid composition of the alpha chain of Cap Z and the predicted protein are also zzso Northern zzso analysis of whole chicken zzso shows two zzso species of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, that zzso with zzso Three potential zzso signals in two regions of zzso 460 zzso apart are identified, suggesting that the two messages may result from the use of alternative zzso zzso zzso of the sequence data with that of other known zzso and severing proteins shows no significant zzso suggesting that Cap Z may be a member of a unique group of zzso zzso zzso
