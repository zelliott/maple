A zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso which we designated zzso has been cloned from human spinal zzso The longest open reading frame was zzso zzso zzso A zzso search revealed that the human zzso gene was located at zzso zzso and contained 13 zzso the gene structure being similar to that of zzso whose gene is also located on zzso zzso has a simple type II zzso structure, consisting of, from the N zzso a short zzso domain, a zzso domain, a stem region containing a scavenger zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso it carries no low density zzso zzso domain in the stem zzso The zzso region carries five zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso domain carried the essential zzso zzso zzso and zzso and showed some similarity to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sharing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity, zzso The putative mature zzso domain preceded by zzso was produced in zzso coli, zzso and successfully activated by immobilized zzso Its optimal pH was about zzso It zzso synthetic zzso for zzso which is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso or zzso Northern zzso analysis against zzso from human zzso including liver, zzso zzso and heart demonstrated a specific expression of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso in their zzso and at the zzso of zzso in the spinal zzso In addition, some zzso were clearly zzso These results indicate that zzso is transported to the zzso through the zzso after its synthesis in the zzso and may play important roles at the zzso Further analyses are required to clarify its roles at the zzso and in zzso
