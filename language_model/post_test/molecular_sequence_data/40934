Recent discoveries have highlighted the fact that alternative zzso and alternative transcripts are the rule, rather than the exception, in zzso zzso Since multiple transcript and protein zzso expressed by the same gene are, by definition, structurally distinct and need not to be functionally zzso the concept of gene zzso should be extended to the transcript level in order to describe evolutionary relationships between structurally similar transcript zzso In other words, the identification of true zzso relationships between gene products now should progress beyond primary sequence and zzso zzso consisting in zzso shared zzso structures, is required to define zzso zzso at transcript zzso 

As a starting step in this direction, in this work we performed a large scale zzso mouse gene comparison with a twofold goal: first, to assess if and to which extent traditional gene zzso such as zzso capture genuine zzso zzso second, to provide a more detailed zzso and zzso of true zzso zzso transcripts defined as transcripts of zzso genes exhibiting the same zzso zzso 

We observed an identical zzso structure for zzso of human and mouse zzso zzso This figure increases to zzso using less stringent criteria for gene structure zzso thus zzso that for about zzso of the human zzso zzso genes (and about zzso of the corresponding zzso we could not identify any mouse transcript showing sufficient similarity to be confidently assigned as a zzso zzso Our data suggest that current gene and transcript data may still be rather incomplete - with several zzso zzso still zzso The observation that alternative zzso produces large numbers of alternative transcripts and zzso some of them zzso across species and others truly zzso suggests that, still maintaining the conventional definition of gene zzso a new concept of zzso zzso can be defined at transcript zzso
