Three zzso zzso zzso zzso that neutralize zzso zzso virus zzso zzso were identified and zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso recognized the major envelope zzso zzso zzso by open reading frame zzso 5 in zzso and by zzso All three zzso were used to compare the zzso isolate of zzso and zzso zzso zzso escape zzso with the vaccine virus and 19 independent field zzso of zzso by virus zzso The different abilities of the zzso to neutralize virus zzso indicated that they recognize zzso zzso zzso to virus zzso could not be used to distinguish viruses from acutely and persistently infected zzso zzso of the zzso 5 zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence from zzso and zzso virus zzso revealed zzso acid sequence changes at positions 99 and 100 which correlate with the zzso zzso Additional unique changes in the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso viruses at positions 96 and 113 may also contribute to zzso zzso The sequence data further showed that the zzso viruses contain one zzso site, whereas the field zzso zzso and zzso possess two sites, both of which are zzso Most of the zzso zzso acid sequence changes were located within the second half of the zzso zzso zzso zzso changes within the first half of the zzso zzso the predicted zzso domain and the zzso zzso domain were mainly silent base zzso or resulted in conservative zzso acid zzso suggesting that these regions of the protein are functionally zzso
