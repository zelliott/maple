zzso zzso zzso zzso has a crucial role in integration of signals from zzso and growth factor zzso In this study, we demonstrate that growth factor receptors including zzso growth factor zzso Met, zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso directly zzso zzso on zzso in the zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Upon binding to Met or zzso zzso may undergo zzso changes, which renders zzso accessible for zzso zzso of zzso with zzso significantly suppresses the zzso of zzso by zzso In contrast, substitution of zzso with zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso on zzso may cause zzso changes in the zzso domain, which zzso the zzso zzso interaction between the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, substitution of the basic zzso in the zzso patch in the zzso domain with Ala zzso the effect of the zzso substitution on zzso zzso thus suggesting that the interactions between the zzso zzso and the basic resides in the zzso patch may allow zzso to be activated through relief of its zzso zzso this study provides the first example to explain how zzso is activated by zzso zzso zzso
