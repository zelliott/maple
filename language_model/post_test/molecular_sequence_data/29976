The synthesis of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso is regulated zzso by zzso This is zzso by iron responsive elements zzso in the zzso and zzso regions, respectively, of zzso and zzso zzso Although these zzso have different zzso they both form a characteristic zzso We used competition zzso and partial zzso mapping of zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes to show that the zzso protein binding to the zzso zzso the zzso element binding protein zzso also binds to zzso zzso To identify the structural requirements necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso which contained altered secondary structures and base zzso zzso of these zzso for zzso were zzso in zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso of the stem prevented zzso zzso zzso which restored zzso also restored zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso binds to both zzso and zzso zzso and recognizes a particular zzso zzso
