zzso zzso zzso is an zzso manifestation of a zzso syndrome zzso zzso reactions to retinal zzso zzso expressed in tumor cells lead to the zzso of retinal zzso zzso In our previous study zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and heat shock zzso protein 70 zzso zzso were identified as zzso recognized by zzso from patients with zzso zzso we suggested that zzso reactions against both zzso and zzso 70 might be involved in the zzso of zzso To zzso the initial step of the molecular pathology of zzso we examined the expression of zzso and zzso 70 by reverse zzso and Western zzso using cell lines of several kinds of zzso including lung small cell zzso lung zzso gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, zzso cervical cancer, zzso cancer, and zzso zzso was expressed in 21 of the 31 cancer cell zzso The expression levels of zzso 70 were significantly higher in cancer cell lines than in zzso cell zzso However, no difference in the expression levels of zzso 70 was observed between zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso labeling by the zzso zzso zzso revealed the zzso to zzso as a zzso pattern within the cancer zzso Lung zzso zzso cells, which did not express zzso exhibited a significant reduction in cell proliferation upon zzso with human zzso zzso Taken together, our present data suggest that the zzso zzso protein zzso is expressed in more than 50% of a variety of cancer cells and may play a significant role in the cell proliferation of these tumor zzso
