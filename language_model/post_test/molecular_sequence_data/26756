zzso is a small protein found associated with zzso coli zzso zzso The role of zzso if any, in zzso is not zzso We have cloned the zzso gene zzso so that we can produce large amounts of omega by zzso and to introduce zzso in its zzso We determined the zzso zzso acid zzso sequence of omega by zzso zzso Using the sequence we zzso an zzso ambiguous zzso zzso probe and screened an zzso coli zzso library using the base composition independent method of zzso reported by Wood et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 82 zzso zzso With this method we isolated a clone that contained part of zzso which we used as a probe to isolate the complete zzso The sequence of the region containing the zzso gene predicts a highly charged protein of 91 zzso with an Mr of 10 zzso In addition, upstream from the gene is a good zzso zzso We have verified by zzso mapping that in zzso transcripts originate from this promoter and possibly from a second promoter farther zzso
