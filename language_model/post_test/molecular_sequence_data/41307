It has recently been reported that the zzso zzso leukemia zzso virus zzso derives from a laboratory zzso However, sequences with characteristics of the zzso half of zzso zzso zzso have been identified in several laboratory mouse zzso and cell lines suggesting parts of the zzso zzso exist as naturally occurring zzso in zzso We compare here zzso gag sequence diversity in mice to that of reported zzso sequences by testing a panel of wild mouse and common zzso laboratory mouse strain zzso zzso and by using high zzso zzso zzso zzso with features typical of previously reported zzso zzso among them a 24 zzso zzso were repeatedly identified in different wild mice and zzso mouse strains within a high background of zzso zzso However, zzso sequencing of clones from zzso failed to retrieve such sequences zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso gag sequences from mice, cell lines and patient samples belong to the same zzso young zzso and that such sequences are diverse and widespread within zzso zzso zzso and laboratory mice derived from this zzso No evidence of zzso like gag sequences could be obtained outside of the zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that accurate determination of presence, absence and relationships of specific zzso zzso strains benefit greatly from deep sequencing zzso
