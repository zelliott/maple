A detailed analysis of zzso selectivity within the zzso zzso 2 zzso family is zzso From a consideration of specific interactions between drug zzso for human zzso family zzso and the putative active sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso it is likely that the number and disposition of hydrogen bond zzso and aromatic rings within the various zzso zzso molecules determines their zzso selectivity and binding zzso together with directing their preferred routes of metabolism by the zzso zzso zzso Although many zzso zzso are present in most zzso active sites, it would appear that their main contribution centers around zzso interactions and zzso processes accompanying zzso zzso zzso modeling studies based on the recent zzso crystal structure appear to show close agreement with zzso zzso experiments and with information on zzso metabolism and selectivity within the zzso zzso
