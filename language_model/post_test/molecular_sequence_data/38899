The zzso gene from zzso encodes a zzso that is related to the zzso zzso proteins zzso of higher plants and green zzso However, despite this zzso zzso gene expression is not coordinated with that of cab genes and is regulated differently by light, suggesting a different role for zzso zzso We show here that, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso is not tightly embedded into the zzso zzso and is localized in zzso zzso Moreover, during zzso development, zzso zzso accumulates before zzso zzso We also show that the zzso zzso forms with certain zzso zzso proteins zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso a natural group that is distinct from those constituted by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso proteins zzso Such an association suggests a very ancient origin for this group of zzso which predates the division of the early zzso zzso into green zzso red zzso and brown zzso zzso zzso roles for the zzso zzso are zzso
