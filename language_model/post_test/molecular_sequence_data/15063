zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a genetically zzso zzso zzso could be associated with zzso manifestations that define specific syndromes such as Usher syndrome zzso characterized by retinal zzso and zzso hearing loss zzso The zzso type II zzso associates zzso and zzso zzso with preserved zzso zzso At least three genes zzso the very large zzso zzso zzso and zzso are responsible for zzso zzso Here, we report on the segregation of zzso zzso and zzso syndrome in a zzso zzso family, which was previously used to define zzso zzso With regard to the zzso of these two different zzso clinical and genetic zzso of the extended family showed zzso zzso zzso within zzso patients and zzso excluded linkage to zzso zzso Indeed, linkage analysis disclosed the zzso of the zzso zzso with the zzso locus zzso zzso and zzso whereas the zzso perfectly zzso with zzso zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed two new zzso zzso zzso and zzso occurring in zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our results show that the zzso locus at zzso zzso does not exist, and we therefore withdraw this locus zzso The combination of molecular findings for zzso and zzso genes enable us to explain the zzso zzso and particularly the severe zzso affection first observed in one zzso zzso This report presents an illustration of how zzso could increase familial zzso of multiple zzso diseases within the same zzso
