We have examined the appearance of amplification of 2 genes involved in resistance to chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients receiving zzso zzso zzso tumor samples were obtained from zzso patients with clinical zzso disease, using zzso zzso The presence of amplification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was determined using zzso in 185 zzso zzso from 37 zzso None of the initial samples of each patient showed zzso However, in 7 of the 37 patients zzso we detected development of gene zzso in 2 cases of zzso zzso and in 5 cases of zzso zzso Five of the 7 patients with amplification were receiving zzso zzso treatment after failing to respond to zzso
