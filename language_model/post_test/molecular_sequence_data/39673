zzso to the standard genetic code have been found in both zzso and zzso This finding demolished the central dogma of molecular biology, zzso by zzso in 1968, of an zzso and universal genetic code and raised the question of how organisms survive genetic code zzso Recent studies suggest that genetic code zzso are driven by selection using a mechanism that requires zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is zzso as zzso through structural zzso of the zzso machinery, in particular, of a zzso which has dual identity and novel decoding zzso Here, we review the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso focusing on the structural change of the zzso machinery and on the impact that such zzso had on the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso
