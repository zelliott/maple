zzso in the promoter region of the factor IX gene result in zzso B zzso which is characterized by considerable improvement in the disease after zzso We have found that distinct zzso zzso at the zzso position in the zzso zzso region are associated with a different severity of zzso zzso The zzso zzso 2) from one family is a severe zzso with factor IX activity zzso and zzso zzso levels less than zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels in two affected uncles are approximately zzso of normal zzso The zzso region was targeted for analysis because the zzso suggested the inheritance of a factor IX zzso zzso An abnormal zzso zzso pattern was found in amplified DNA from the zzso and sequencing showed a zzso to C zzso that was linked to the disease in the zzso In another family, two brothers zzso 8 and 9) suffer from mild zzso with zzso ranging from 7 to 10 zzso and zzso from 3 to 4 zzso They are the only documented members of the family with a bleeding zzso zzso zzso gel zzso on amplified fragments from one of the patient's zzso DNA corresponding to the 8 zzso and zzso sequences of the factor IX gene suggested a zzso only in a segment from the zzso zzso This segment showed an altered zzso zzso pattern, and sequencing demonstrated a zzso to A transition that was traced to the patient's mother and a zzso The different zzso associated with the zzso to A zzso zzso transition compared with a zzso to C zzso provide evidence that this area is directly involved in the regulation of the human factor IX gene expression in zzso by binding of regulatory zzso The ability to predict that the conditions of a zzso B patient will improve with age has important implications for genetic counseling of the zzso zzso the zzso region should always be included when scanning the factor IX gene for zzso
