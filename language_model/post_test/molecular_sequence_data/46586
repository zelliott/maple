A few duplicated genes have been found useful to root the universal tree of zzso Despite controversial results, the consensus led to locate the root in the zzso zzso However, we demonstrated zzso and zzso zzso that all these markers were in fact zzso for any firm conclusion, mainly because of their high level of zzso zzso which masks a major part of the zzso zzso But then, the very persistence of signal for events as early as the separation of the three zzso becomes zzso This paradox was studied here for translation zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso which appeared to be one of the least confusing zzso We showed that these proteins do not conform to a classical zzso pattern, as those modeled by a gamma law, but rather to a zzso model, because the evolutionary rate of a given position often changes between zzso zzso Conservation of the very ancient signal can thus be better explained by the zzso model: a substitution can occur in deep zzso and the position remains constant afterward, as zzso by a change of zzso As no reconstruction method has up to now taken into account this complex model, we devised a simple method for zzso the zzso zzso by considering the zzso of sequence positions within zzso zzso zzso We showed that noise zzso prevailed upon zzso zzso will produce erroneous zzso because it has to minimize primarily the number of steps of the zzso In contrast, our method effectively concentrated the signal and was more suitable for zzso ancient zzso We consequently found the zzso rooting to be presumably due to a long branch attraction artifact, because of the higher evolutionary rate of zzso for these zzso Among the two other rooting possibilities, the zzso rooting appeared to be more supported, although not enough to be zzso
