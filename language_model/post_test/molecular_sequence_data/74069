The zzso hairpin of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso is essential for virus zzso zzso forms the binding site for the zzso zzso protein zzso and multiple additional zzso functions have been zzso We previously constructed an zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso control mechanism is replaced by the components of the zzso regulatory zzso In this context, the surprising finding was that zzso can be truncated or even deleted, but partial zzso deletions that destabilize the stem structure cause a severe replication zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso requires a stable hairpin at its zzso because zzso zzso sequences affect the proper folding of the untranslated leader zzso zzso multiple zzso functions are affected by partial zzso zzso Upon evolution of such zzso zzso the replication capacity was repaired through the acquisition of additional zzso zzso that restore the local zzso zzso thus preventing the zzso effect on the leader zzso
