The zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso of the zzso growth factor II zzso zzso can activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso beta zzso zzso zzso of the beta zzso zzso zzso zzso can activate the zzso protein zzso In zzso zzso zzso and beta zzso activate zzso and zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso We constructed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by converting its native zzso 14 sequence to the beta zzso zzso In cells expressing beta zzso membrane zzso zzso activity markedly increased without zzso and was further promoted by zzso This was verified by measuring zzso zzso zzso activity in beta zzso cells with zzso of a zzso response zzso zzso This study shows not only the conversion of zzso specificity of a zzso from zzso to zzso but also the simulation of G zzso zzso signals by using a short zzso region and intact zzso These findings indicate that the G zzso signals are zzso zzso structural motifs that function in the setting of either a zzso or zzso zzso
