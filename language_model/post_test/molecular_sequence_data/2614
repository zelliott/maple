zzso zzso a widely used over-the-counter zzso is known to cause zzso when zzso in large quantities in both animals and man, especially when administered after chronic ethanol zzso zzso stems from zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso that binds to tissue zzso thereby initiating cellular zzso Alcohol consumption also causes the induction of zzso a liver zzso zzso that in zzso studies has proven to be an effective catalyst of zzso zzso Thus, elevated zzso zzso levels could explain not only the known increase in zzso zzso activity of liver zzso after prolonged ethanol zzso but also the enhanced zzso to zzso zzso We therefore examined the role of zzso in human liver zzso zzso zzso Liver zzso from seven zzso subjects were found to convert 1 zzso zzso to a zzso intermediate zzso as an zzso zzso by zzso liquid zzso at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas at 10 zzso this rate increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In a zzso system, zzso human liver zzso zzso zzso zzso at rates zzso higher than those obtained with zzso whereas two other human zzso zzso and zzso exhibited negligible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against human zzso inhibited zzso zzso in each of the human samples, with zzso zzso zzso averaging zzso zzso zzso zzso of the rates determined in the presence of control zzso The ability of zzso zzso to inhibit only one-half of the total zzso zzso by zzso suggests, however, that other zzso zzso besides zzso contribute to zzso of this compound in human zzso Of the other zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso liver zzso promoted zzso zzso at rates even higher than those obtained with human zzso The extensive zzso capacity of this zzso zzso designated zzso based upon its similarity to rat zzso and rabbit form 4 in terms of zzso zzso acid zzso spectral zzso zzso properties, and zzso by zzso agrees with previous reports concerning the zzso zzso specificity of the rat and rabbit zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
