zzso zzso zzso constitute one of the largest zzso zzso with over 60,000 zzso sequences in the database, many of which need a correct functional zzso Among them, the gene zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso has been assigned in zzso both as a zzso zzso zzso and, as an zzso zzso zzso both zzso being of zzso zzso When the gene was zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso the zzso zzso was not active toward zzso whereas it was active toward zzso and zzso However, the relative activities toward zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were low compared with that toward zzso Thus, the zzso could be considered zzso zzso zzso with very low activity toward zzso which could increase its zzso interest for determining zzso without the unspecific zzso of added zzso in food and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso showed similar zzso efficiency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to other zzso zzso for zzso with an optimum pH of zzso and an optimum temperature of 37 zzso The zzso was also more zzso than other reported zzso ammonium zzso being the best stabilizer in this respect, increasing the melting temperature zzso up to zzso zzso The zzso can also be considered as a new member of the zzso independent zzso family since no effect on activity was detected in the presence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso Finally, its in zzso analysis enabled the specific zzso sequence blocks that are the fingerprints of bacterial zzso zzso and mainly located at zzso of the zzso to be determined for the first zzso This knowledge will facilitate future data zzso of present databases and a better functional assignment of newly described zzso
