zzso is well known as the zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso complex targeting zzso for zzso zzso also forms complexes with zzso A, which is particularly abundant in cancer cells due to frequent zzso zzso but the mechanism and significance of this interaction remain zzso Here, we report that zzso A interaction is zzso by novel interaction sequences on both zzso and zzso A, distinguishing it from the well known zzso patch interaction between zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, a short zzso derived from the mapped zzso A binding sequences of zzso can block zzso A interaction but not zzso A interaction, whereas a previously identified zzso zzso can block zzso A interaction but not zzso A zzso zzso zzso A interaction is zzso from zzso ability to mediate zzso zzso Rather, zzso A interaction serves to directly protect zzso zzso from zzso by zzso through competitive zzso Finally, we show that disruption of zzso A binding with point zzso in the zzso A binding domain of zzso compromises the ability of zzso zzso to counter cell cycle arrest by a zzso cell cycle checkpoint without affecting its ability to cause degradation of cellular zzso and zzso These findings reveal a new functional mechanism of zzso and a new regulatory mechanism of zzso zzso
