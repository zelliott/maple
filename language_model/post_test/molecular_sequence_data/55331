zzso fish are a group that is especially susceptible to zzso loss as they often exist naturally in small, fragmented populations that are vulnerable to habitat degradation, pollution and introduction of exotic zzso Relatively little is known about spatial dynamics of zzso populations of zzso freshwater fish zzso This study examined population genetic structure of the purple spotted zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso freshwater fish that is widely distributed in eastern zzso The species is threatened in parts of its range but is common in coastal zzso of central zzso where this study took zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso variation was assessed for nine sites from four stream sections in two drainage zzso Very high levels of among population structure were observed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and evidence for contemporary migration among populations was rare and limited to sites within the same section of zzso zzso structuring of variation was best explained by stream section rather than by drainage zzso Estimates of contemporary effective population size for each site was low zzso 28 - 63, zzso zzso but compared favorably with similar estimates for other freshwater fish species, and there was no genetic evidence for zzso or recent population zzso In conclusion, within a stable part of its range, M zzso exists as a series of small, demographically stable populations that are highly isolated from one zzso zzso patterns in zzso and zzso indicate this structuring is the result of long-term processes that have developed over a remarkably small spatial zzso High population structure and limited zzso mean that zzso of locally extinct populations is only likely to occur from closely situated populations within stream zzso Limited potential for zzso should be considered as an important factor in conservation and management of this zzso
