Seventy-five zzso zzso have been isolated from a zzso zzso zzso with soil from zzso The column was maintained at 10 degrees C and continuously fed with a zzso medium to enrich zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected for further characterization on the basis of zzso and production of clearing zones on skim milk zzso zzso tests indicated that the strains were mainly zzso and presented a high zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso activities tested were optimal at neutral pH and between 30 and 45 degrees zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analyses showed that the zzso was zzso by a wide variety of zzso belonging to various bacterial divisions: zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and high zzso zzso bacteria and low zzso zzso zzso Some strains represent candidates for new species of the zzso zzso and zzso This diversity demonstrates that the zzso is an efficient enrichment tool compared to traditional isolation zzso
