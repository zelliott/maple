A putative zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso in the so-called zzso zzso zzso pathway, from the enteric zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso encodes a protein of 299 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso zzso showed high zzso to zzso from zzso and another enteric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks both the zzso zzso binding domain and the zzso zzso acid regions containing the zzso zzso (of zzso coli zzso in the zzso binding domain shown to be crucial for zzso which are present in other organisms including higher zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso to zzso utilizing zzso and, less zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso zzso parameters of zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso for example the preference of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso from bacteria, plants and zzso the zzso protein is present as a zzso as demonstrated by gel zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained zzso activity of 26 zzso zzso zzso per zzso per zzso of zzso protein in the reverse direction, which consisted zzso of a total soluble zzso Altogether, this zzso represents a unique zzso zzso that possesses both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reinforcing the biological importance of zzso metabolism in this zzso zzso acid sequence comparison and zzso analysis of various zzso sequences showed that zzso zzso forms a highly supported zzso group with another enteric zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
