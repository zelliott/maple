zzso is a zzso zzso widely used as food zzso Its mode of action on the bacterial zzso membrane is zzso It should form zzso channels but a molecular description of the interaction between zzso and zzso is zzso The interactions between zzso and a membrane and the influence of zzso are here zzso by molecular zzso The zzso structures of zzso in a zzso environment were previously determined (Van den zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 235 zzso zzso Those structures were used to start zzso They were refined by running a zzso Carlo procedure at a model zzso zzso It was shown that zzso is zzso onto the zzso with its zzso zzso more deeply inserted in lipids than the zzso indicating distinct zzso properties of the zzso and zzso zzso we suggest that the zzso part is implied in the zzso of zzso in zzso while the zzso zzso could be involved in the initial interaction with the membrane zzso zzso the interaction of zzso with different neutral or zzso zzso shows that it zzso the zzso zzso The zzso is zzso with zzso In this system, zzso zzso the surface of zzso layer round suggesting it could induce zzso zzso This could be a preliminary step to pore zzso It suggests that zzso could have a direct action on zzso zzso and on zzso channel zzso zzso of a zzso also agrees with the zzso zzso proposed in the literature for the zzso pore zzso
