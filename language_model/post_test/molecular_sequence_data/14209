Modern intensive zzso practices can create poor indoor air quality, with high levels of airborne dust, zzso zzso and zzso Air in a sow breeding barn was investigated to determine the biomass composition of zzso using molecular methods supplemented with microscopic and zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso zzso air and zzso zzso zzso were zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso constituted zzso of the total microbial zzso zzso and zzso zzso percent of all zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso with a general bacterial probe zzso zzso FISH of the bacterial consortium revealed zzso as the dominant group with zzso as the major zzso while zzso constituted zzso of the zzso zzso Additionally, the study revealed an abundant and diverse zzso community including species not previously found in similar zzso The most abundant zzso zzso zzso gene clone sequences identified affiliated with the zzso zzso but among others, species of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso For both zzso and zzso bacteria, a zzso zzso diversity was found in zzso from a modern sow breeding barn, which potentially could create poor indoor air quality, although their effect on the health of zzso and stock still is not zzso
