The zzso zzso box zzso factor zzso recruits the redundant zzso and zzso proteins to effect zzso but the mode of action of the trio remains zzso We identify here a highly zzso zzso sequence 10 zzso upstream of the zzso gene for zzso a most essential cartilage zzso and key marker of zzso zzso This sequence directs expression of a minimal promoter in both embryonic and adult cartilage in transgenic mice, in a manner that matches zzso zzso The zzso trio is required and sufficient to mediate the activity of this zzso It acts directly, zzso binding to a critical zzso element and zzso binding to three additional zzso which are zzso zzso Upon binding to their specific sites, zzso increases the efficiency of zzso binding to its own recognition site and thereby robustly zzso the ability of zzso to activate the zzso zzso similarly zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso This study thus zzso critical zzso elements and zzso factors driving zzso expression in cartilage and increases understanding of the mode of action of the zzso Sox zzso
