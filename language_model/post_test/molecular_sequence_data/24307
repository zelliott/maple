The zinc zzso zzso is a group of zzso related proteins that are predominantly zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The common structural scaffold of the zzso consists of an zzso zzso flanked by six zzso Previous zzso while acknowledging the likely divergent origins of zzso zzso zzso A and the zzso zzso of the zzso H clan based on their structural zzso have failed to find any zzso between the active sites in zzso zzso and the zzso H clan zzso Here we show that these two groups of zzso zzso have overlapping zzso centers where one of the two zinc atoms is zzso in each zzso zzso A and zzso zzso on the other hand, no longer share any zzso zzso zzso At least three zzso zzso sites have existed in the structural scaffold over the period of history defined by available zzso zzso of zzso complexes show that major zzso of the zzso site has occurred in association with each change in zinc zzso in the binding zzso These changes involve zzso and zzso of the zzso Some zzso important to the zzso mechanism are not zzso amongst zzso We discuss how molecules acting in trans may have facilitated the zzso of zzso important zzso in the active site in this zzso
