A high percentage of patients with zzso syndrome and zzso syndrome have zzso deletions on zzso zzso The shortest region of overlap is currently estimated to be around 55 zzso Two segments of DNA from zzso zzso located 160 zzso apart, were cloned because they contained zzso restriction zzso zzso In the current study we demonstrate that these segments are absent from zzso 22 carrying zzso of two different zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso and Southern zzso zzso was further used to show that this locus is within the zzso critical zzso zzso zzso sequences adjacent to one human cell zzso zzso isolated with a probe from this segment showed it to contain the gene for zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this gene in zzso syndrome and zzso syndrome may contribute to the mental zzso seen in the zzso
