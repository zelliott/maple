zzso zzso virus encodes a zzso called zzso that enhances viral gene zzso and is essential for zzso zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso has been reported to rely on two zzso basic motifs zzso and zzso that likely function together as a zzso nuclear zzso zzso In this study, we report that mutating zzso but not zzso zzso zzso from the nucleus to the zzso suggesting an essential role for zzso in the nuclear zzso of zzso Although not affecting the nuclear zzso of zzso mutating zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reveal that the zzso zzso are vital for the binding of zzso to viral promoter zzso Moreover, mutating zzso in zzso zzso zzso replication to a much greater extent than mutating zzso zzso our findings suggest that zzso directly participate in zzso binding to viral promoter DNA and are zzso for zzso zzso zzso
