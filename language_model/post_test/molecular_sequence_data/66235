This paper reports the identification and zzso of a zzso surface protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso subspecies zzso zzso and describes its diagnostic zzso zzso zzso and presence in zzso of zzso functional zzso suggested a structural and functional relationship with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a basic membrane zzso A zzso was developed, and it resulted in a high specificity for zzso infections after evaluation with 125 goat zzso The comparison with an zzso zzso based on whole zzso cell zzso showed that the two zzso have comparable sensitivities, but the zzso has the significant advantage of a greater zzso zzso indicate that zzso is a potential marker of zzso infection, especially useful in areas where the presence of zzso zzso subspecies zzso is also zzso
