To clone and identify human genes zzso by zzso by constructing a zzso zzso library with suppression zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso techniques were used for screening and cloning of the target genes zzso by zzso zzso The zzso was isolated from zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso empty zzso respectively, and zzso technique was employed to analyze the zzso expressed DNA sequence between the two zzso After zzso with restriction zzso zzso I, small size zzso were zzso Then tester zzso was divided into two groups and zzso to the specific zzso 1 and zzso 2, zzso The tester zzso was zzso with driver zzso twice and subjected to zzso zzso for two times, and then zzso into zzso zzso zzso to set up the zzso zzso zzso of the library was carried out with zzso coli strain zzso The zzso was zzso and analyzed in zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso software after zzso zzso 

The zzso library of genes zzso by zzso was constructed zzso The amplified library contained 90 positive zzso Colony zzso showed that 70 clones contained zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed in 30 clones randomly, and the full-length sequences were obtained by zzso zzso zzso 24 coding sequences were zzso which consisted of 23 known and 1 zzso One novel gene with unknown functions was found and named as zzso after being zzso zzso and deposited in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is closely correlated with zzso zzso zzso signal zzso formation mechanism of zzso fibrosis, and occurrence and development of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins may help to bring some new clues for further studying the biological functions of zzso zzso
