Gene zzso are common driver events in zzso and solid zzso here we present zzso a tool dedicated to the identification of driver fusion zzso in human cancer through the analysis of zzso zzso zzso sequencing zzso We initially tested zzso by using a set of in zzso randomly generated sequencing data from 20 known human zzso occurring in cancer and subsequently using zzso data from three chronic and three acute zzso zzso zzso in all the cases our tool was invariably able to detect the presence of the correct driver fusion zzso with high zzso In one of the acute zzso zzso samples, zzso identified a novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso A fully zzso zzso interface and a flexible filtering system allow complex analyses to be run in the absence of any a zzso programming or zzso zzso zzso we propose zzso as an efficient and robust zzso tool for the identification of functional zzso in the context of zzso zzso sequencing zzso
