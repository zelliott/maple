zzso hormone zzso plays an important role in the zzso development of the zzso zzso particularly within the first 2 weeks of zzso zzso This action is exerted through the regulation of specific genes during development and is zzso by zzso and zzso proteins that determine zzso repression or zzso zzso Thus, we hypothesized that the effect of zzso on zzso zzso development could be influenced by the relative amounts of zzso and zzso proteins in zzso These ratios might be modulated in an zzso manner and/or by hormones to generate the zzso zzso of zzso zzso To examine this hypothesis, we cloned rat complementary DNA fragments corresponding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and studied the zzso changes in their corresponding zzso zzso in rat zzso of normal and zzso rats during zzso development, using a zzso protection zzso We found an increased expression of zzso and zzso as well as of zzso during rat zzso development but no change in the expression of zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso hormone status did not affect the expression of zzso and zzso genes in the zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibit differential expression through zzso development but are not regulated by zzso during this zzso
