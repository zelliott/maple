zzso plaques are known to develop and progress where the zzso is subjected to turbulent blood zzso We have applied zzso zzso difference analysis zzso to study vascular gene expression in mouse zzso in a model for zzso 

Gene expression profiles were investigated in zzso and zzso zzso in the ascending zzso and arch in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Total zzso was extracted and two rounds of zzso were zzso the difference products were characterized in detail by shotgun cloning and analysis of more than 2,700 gene zzso 

The identified zzso expressed gene sequences include both genes with known involvement in vascular gene expression and genes previously not implicated in vascular zzso For example, zzso and zzso previously reported for their participation in the progression of zzso were found to have an increased expression in vessel zzso thought to be especially susceptible to plaque zzso 

This report provides new in zzso information of expressed genes that can be useful for further investigations of the molecular mechanisms in focal zzso of zzso
