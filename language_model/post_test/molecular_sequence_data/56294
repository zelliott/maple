zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso transformed by the zzso zzso A contributing factor to cellular resistance to transformation is the limited tolerance to zzso zzso zzso Here we present data suggesting that long-term zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso results in increased tolerance to zzso zzso leading to expression of the transformed zzso zzso transformed cell lines that expressed high levels of zzso and could be maintained in the absence of hormone were zzso In three out of four lines zzso the zzso zzso gene was expressed at a low zzso In one of these lines, low zzso expression was paralleled by lack of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that progression to hormone independence was not paralleled by zzso in the zzso zzso We propose that a decreased expression of zzso genes may result in increased tolerance to zzso zzso
