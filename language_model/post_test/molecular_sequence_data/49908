The zzso family consists of 19 members, which function as zzso of calcium signals in a zzso zzso Upon calcium zzso the zzso of many zzso proteins changes zzso Several zzso zzso are exposed, allowing the zzso proteins to interact with their target zzso and thereby to zzso calcium signals into specific biological zzso To further zzso the exact contribution of the zzso zzso in the calcium zzso zzso several groups have applied the zzso zzso technology to identify putative target proteins for the various zzso zzso zzso large screens using zzso proteins as zzso have confirmed the zzso and structural feature of zzso which enable them to form zzso and the ability of some members to form specific zzso in zzso zzso zzso investigations have allowed the identification of zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are crucial for the stabilization of zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, this method clearly zzso that the zzso and zzso mechanisms differ among the members of the zzso zzso However, several lines of evidence strongly suggest that zzso methodology is limited to the analysis of interactions that are zzso since no target proteins other than zzso family members themselves have been detected with this zzso
