Aedes aegypti is a highly zzso zzso responsible for the transmission of dengue and yellow fever around the zzso Like other zzso the biting and host preference behaviors of this disease zzso are largely influenced by its sense of zzso which is presumably facilitated by G zzso zzso signaling zzso Here, we report the identification and characterization of zzso the first candidate zzso zzso from zzso zzso This zzso displays extremely high primary zzso acid conservation with zzso another candidate zzso zzso identified in the zzso malaria zzso zzso zzso as well as several previously identified candidate zzso receptors in zzso zzso and other zzso Its transcript is expressed in adult zzso zzso and during several stages of zzso aegypti zzso Within the adult zzso system, zzso protein is found specifically within most zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as in a subset of zzso zzso These results are consistent with a role for zzso in zzso and zzso supporting the hypothesis that zzso and its zzso may be of general importance to zzso processes throughout the lifetime of an zzso
