After zzso amplification with conservative zzso zzso a 520 zzso putative partial sequence of the DNA zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso comparison revealed zzso to DNA zzso genes from various beta zzso viruses and a zzso was constructed depicting the relationship of zzso to other members of the zzso zzso The zzso indicates that zzso is indeed a beta zzso virus that is more closely related to human zzso virus types 6 and 7 than to type zzso To address the difficulties encountered during conventional zzso detection and characterization a set of zzso zzso zzso were constructed which generated DNA fragments of 415 and zzso zzso from the DNA zzso zzso The zzso zzso system proved specific for zzso and provided a novel means for the detection of this poorly characterized zzso virus in pig zzso vaccines and in zzso used in zzso
