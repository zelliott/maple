zzso regulation contributes to plasticity in metabolism and growth that enables plants to survive in a dynamic zzso Here, we used the precise mapping of zzso zzso zzso on zzso to investigate zzso regulation under control and zzso zzso stress conditions in zzso of zzso zzso zzso were obtained by differential zzso or zzso and were zzso with zzso I to generate footprint fragments that were zzso zzso of zzso number and position on zzso regions with fragmented total and zzso zzso illuminated numerous aspects of zzso and zzso control under both growth zzso When zzso were zzso the frequency of zzso at the start zzso was reduced, consistent with a global decline in initiation of zzso zzso gene transcripts increased in zzso complexes during the stress, but the number of zzso per transcript relative to zzso conditions was not zzso On the other hand, many zzso with limited change in zzso abundance had significantly fewer zzso but with an overall similar distribution under zzso consistent with restriction of initiation rather than zzso of zzso zzso profiling also exposed the zzso effect of upstream zzso on the translation of downstream zzso regions under zzso which was further modulated by zzso The data document translation of alternatively spliced zzso and expose zzso association with some zzso zzso Altogether, we present an experimental approach that illuminates prevalent and nuanced regulation of protein synthesis under optimal and zzso zzso
