It has been reported that inflammatory cell zzso can be detected in patients with zzso negative zzso zzso disease zzso as well as those with zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined the expression of zzso for zzso zzso a potent zzso for zzso in the zzso zzso of patients with zzso and compared the results with their zzso findings and zzso 

zzso samples were obtained from 80 zzso zzso diagnosis was performed according to the Los Angeles zzso Patients with typical symptoms such as heartburn despite normal zzso findings were classified as the zzso zzso zzso Total cellular zzso was extracted from the biopsy samples and zzso zzso was zzso by real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso of zzso protein in the zzso zzso was done by zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso was correlated with the zzso grade of zzso or with inflammatory cell zzso but not with the symptoms of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also detected in all patients with zzso zzso The level of zzso expression in zzso zzso was low compared with that in zzso zzso but was higher than that in normal zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso layers of the zzso zzso Administration of zzso a zzso zzso decreased both zzso zzso and protein levels in the zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso in the zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso including zzso zzso
