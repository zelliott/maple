zzso zzso interactions are crucial in signaling networks and for the assembly of zzso complexes, and represent a challenging goal for protein zzso zzso interaction specificity requires both positive design, the stabilization of a desired interaction, and negative design, the zzso of zzso zzso Currently, no automated zzso zzso use explicit negative design to guide a sequence zzso We describe a zzso framework for engineering specificity that selects sequences maximizing the transfer free energy of a protein from a target zzso to a set of zzso competitor zzso To test the zzso zzso we engineered zzso zzso that direct the formation of either zzso or zzso The zzso identified three specificity motifs that have not been observed in naturally occurring coiled zzso In all cases, experimental results confirm the predicted zzso
