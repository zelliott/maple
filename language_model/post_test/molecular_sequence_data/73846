zzso binding properties of five single zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of human zzso growth factor I zzso were analyzed with respect to their binding affinities and binding zzso to zzso zzso binding protein 1 zzso and a soluble form of the zzso type I zzso zzso zzso Side chains of the zzso zzso are all predicted to be the most surface exposed in the zzso portion of the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were produced as fusion proteins to a zzso binding protein domain, zzso zzso binding kinetic rates were determined using zzso zzso interaction analysis zzso All zzso zzso showed altered binding affinities to both zzso I and zzso Secondary structure content of the zzso zzso was estimated using zzso circular zzso zzso followed by variable selection secondary structure zzso The amount of calculated zzso is reduced for all the zzso most predominantly for zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, most of the effects of reduced binding affinities to both target proteins are attributed to lowered zzso of zzso and these are correlated with the amount of zzso in each zzso zzso In addition, in some of the zzso zzso lowered zzso of binding are zzso From the results, we propose that zzso is unusually sensitive to structural changes by surface zzso acid zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or biological properties of zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso cannot be used in a straightforward way to dissect the direct involvement in binding of individual zzso acid zzso since structural changes may be zzso
