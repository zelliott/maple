An zzso capture plate zzso zzso has been developed to zzso specifically, and sensitively detect zzso zzso from zzso zzso Several in zzso studies have been performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the test, and in zzso studies have validated this technique in zzso zzso suggest that the zzso detects zzso zzso zzso in a pure culture and gives a positive result when zzso zzso is present in a ratio of zzso in a mixed culture, and the probe does not zzso with other related species found in the upper respiratory zzso This zzso is more sensitive than culture for detection of the zzso from zzso zzso and zzso
