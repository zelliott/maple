zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso the major component of zzso inclusions in several neurodegenerative zzso Here, we describe zzso experiments conducted on human zzso in the presence of zzso zzso Our aim was to unravel molecular features of zzso zzso using the limited zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso K, as well as the zzso zzso were used as zzso zzso While zzso at neutral pH is easily zzso to a variety of relatively small fragments, in the presence of 10 zzso zzso the zzso of the protein is rather zzso zzso fragments zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso are obtained when zzso zzso K, and zzso zzso respectively, are zzso These results are in line with a zzso model of zzso in which it acquires a folded zzso structure in the zzso region in its zzso zzso At the same time, they indicate that the zzso portion of the zzso is rather zzso as seen in its relative resistance to extensive zzso zzso It is likely that, under the specific experimental conditions of zzso in the presence of zzso the zzso charged zzso region can be zzso by binding a calcium zzso as shown before with intact zzso In this study, some evidence of calcium binding properties of isolated zzso fragments zzso zzso and zzso was obtained by mass zzso zzso since molecular masses for zzso fragments were zzso Our results indicate that the zzso portion of the zzso zzso is quite rigid and zzso at zzso from current models of the zzso protein deduced mostly from zzso Considering that the zzso process of zzso is modulated by its zzso tail, the results of this study may provide useful insights into the behavior of zzso in a zzso zzso
