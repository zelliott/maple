A strategy is described that allows the isolation of DNA sequences that can bind to gene regulatory zzso Total zzso DNA is first converted to a form that is suitable for amplification by the zzso chain reaction zzso Genome zzso and the DNA sequences of interest are selected by binding to the regulatory protein and immune zzso Because sequences recovered from the selection step can be amplified by zzso the selection process can be designed for maximum enrichment with little concern about zzso Furthermore, the selection process can be repeated as often as zzso zzso recovered after amplification can be cloned and/or used as zzso zzso As a test of this strategy, we selected human sequences that bound to zzso zzso factor zzso zzso Seven clones were isolated that were on the average zzso identical to the previously described 61 zzso binding site of zzso This strategy could be adapted to isolate sequences that can be selected by any physical or biological zzso
