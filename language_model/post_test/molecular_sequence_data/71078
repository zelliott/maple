To investigate the relationship between zzso processing of the zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso and its assembly into the zzso zzso zzso complex we used zzso proteins in which the zzso had been changed by zzso zzso of the cloned zzso protein zzso so that the recognition sites for the zzso processing zzso or the zzso intermediate zzso zzso had been zzso When zzso strain zzso in which the gene for the zzso protein is deleted, was transformed with these zzso on a single copy expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso complexes isolated from these strains accumulated intermediate length zzso proteins in zzso The zzso zzso complex activities of these zzso and zzso complexes indicate that intermediate zzso protein zzso has full activity when compared with that of mature sized zzso protein zzso Therefore the zzso cluster must have been inserted before processing of zzso to zzso by zzso When zzso protein is imported into zzso in zzso zzso interacts with components of the zzso complex before it is processed to zzso These results establish that the zzso cluster is inserted into the zzso before zzso zzso off the second part of the zzso and that this second processing step takes place after zzso has been assembled into the zzso zzso
