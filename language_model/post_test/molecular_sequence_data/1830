Several zzso forms of the zzso zzso gene zzso have been associated with red hair, fair skin and an increased risk for zzso Their involvement in melanoma zzso is apparently linked both to skin sensitivity and to zzso zzso We investigated the frequency of the zzso zzso in the Italian region of zzso where the occurrence and zzso of melanoma are low and primary zzso is characterized by prevalence of the zzso zzso zzso founder zzso Additionally, we attempted to establish the frequency of the red zzso skin zzso in our zzso As predicted by anecdotal evidence, the frequency of red zzso I was very low zzso zzso of 17 zzso individuals and their zzso relatives, zzso controls and 214 melanoma patients zzso for hair color but all of zzso zzso led to the detection of 8 novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 novel deletion zzso zzso and 3 novel synonymous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation seems to indicate that other genes involved in the regulation of human pigmentation may mask the zzso action of zzso zzso zzso thus determining the low frequency of zzso zzso and of zzso and/or zzso of melanoma in zzso
