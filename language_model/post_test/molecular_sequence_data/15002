The malaria zzso zzso zzso replicates within an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the host cell allows release zzso of daughter zzso which invade fresh zzso We previously showed that a zzso zzso called zzso regulates zzso by being discharged into the zzso in the final stages of zzso development to zzso modify the zzso family of zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso has a further role in zzso the zzso prior to zzso The major protein complex on the zzso surface comprises three proteins called zzso surface protein 1 zzso zzso and zzso We show that just before zzso all undergo zzso maturation by zzso zzso of zzso activity results in the zzso of zzso zzso on the zzso surface, and zzso invasion is significantly zzso We propose that zzso is a zzso processing zzso with an essential role in both zzso of the malaria zzso and zzso of its surface in preparation for zzso zzso
