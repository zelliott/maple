Common zzso on zzso zzso a potent zzso inducing experimental zzso zzso zzso and on human tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso are revealed with zzso zzso zzso to zzso which inhibit zzso zzso The minimal common sequence for zzso recognition is zzso in the zzso alpha zzso acid zzso zzso zzso containing this sequence motif exhibit zzso zzso capacity analogous to the zzso zzso capacity of zzso alpha zzso In zzso this activity is located at zzso zzso zzso zzso 40 to 50), corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso alpha the zzso zzso capacity zzso to zzso zzso 31 to 53, corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso is competing for zzso zzso and zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso to zzso compete with zzso zzso but not zzso zzso for binding to zzso zzso and zzso In human retinal zzso zzso zzso is localized at the zzso zzso zzso and is zzso in the human zzso 4 zzso zzso Competition experiments with zzso 4 zzso zzso and zzso 5 zzso zzso indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso play an important role for internal image recognition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso define common functional structures in the zzso and zzso alpha zzso The data suggest regulatory functions of the peptides in zzso zzso network regulation and in zzso
