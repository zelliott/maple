zzso zzso zzso group 1) is a DNA repair protein that forms complexes with DNA zzso beta zzso DNA zzso III and zzso zzso in the repair of DNA single strand zzso The zzso in zzso have been determined, and characterization of the zzso interaction in the zzso complex has provided information on the specificity and mechanism of zzso The domain structure of zzso determined using limited zzso was found to include an zzso domain zzso a central zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were relatively stable to zzso suggestive of a zzso zzso of the zzso A predicted inner domain was found not to be stable to zzso Using zzso experiments, zzso was found to bind intact zzso and the zzso 31 zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to bind zzso the zzso 31 zzso domain and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the interaction was further localized to zzso zzso The zzso 31 zzso domain complex was stable at high salt (1 M zzso indicative of a zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso screen, zzso expressed from two zzso zzso which included zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to interact with zzso the zzso 31 zzso domain, and the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso expressed from the respective zzso zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso was found to interact with a zzso zzso zzso A third zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no interaction with zzso In quantitative gel zzso and zzso zzso experiments, the zzso found to bind zzso and its 31 zzso domain in a zzso complex with high affinity zzso of zzso zzso The combined results indicate a zzso specific zzso interaction between the zzso zzso that is of an affinity comparable to other binding interactions involving zzso
