zzso zzso is an opportunistic pathogen that causes severe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso to acquire iron under zzso conditions encountered in the zzso zzso the zzso of this strain has three zzso genes zzso proteins for energy zzso functions needed for the active transport of zzso including iron, through the outer zzso zzso analysis indicates that these zzso zzso which are present in the zzso of all zzso zzso zzso zzso were acquired from different zzso Two of these genes occur as components of zzso zzso and one as a zzso zzso all are actively transcribed in zzso zzso The abilities of components of these zzso systems to complement the growth zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso under zzso conditions further support the roles of these zzso systems in iron zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso numbers represent different copies of genes or zzso and zzso supports this zzso their zzso results in growth defects in zzso media, without affecting zzso zzso or the production of the zzso outer membrane zzso protein zzso In zzso zzso using zzso zzso show that each zzso protein is involved in, but not essential for, bacterial zzso in this infection zzso Furthermore, we observed that zzso plays a role in the ability of bacteria to bind to zzso and to adhere to zzso cells by zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso produces three independent zzso zzso which appear to provide the zzso functions needed for iron acquisition and cellular processes that play a role in the zzso of this zzso
