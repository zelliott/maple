The patterns of linkage zzso zzso in the human zzso provide important information for disease gene zzso zzso may vary depending on zzso regions and zzso We have compared zzso and zzso defined by zzso in the zzso zzso region of the Korean and Japanese zzso zzso zzso in about zzso zzso ranging from tumor necrosis factor zzso 2 zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso gene were examined in 96 healthy Koreans and Japanese each by direct sequencing and zzso correlation zzso combined with the zzso specific primer method zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso analysis, a total of 25 and 16 out of 58 zzso greater than zzso zzso were included in zzso blocks, encompassing almost 81 zzso and 55 zzso in total, in Koreans and Japanese, zzso Both similarities and differences were observed in zzso strength and zzso zzso between the zzso zzso similarities were observed in the zzso region where a long-range block of approximately 80 zzso including three genes was found to have strong zzso in both Koreans and zzso zzso difference in zzso strength was present near the zzso region between the Japanese and Korean zzso
