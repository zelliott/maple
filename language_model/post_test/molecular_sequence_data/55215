The function of many DNA metabolism proteins depends on their ability to coordinate an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins is a zzso process that takes place in zzso and the zzso but how it is linked to nuclear zzso proteins is not zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso forms a complex with the zzso zzso assembly zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also binds to multiple nuclear zzso proteins involved in DNA zzso In the absence of zzso a failure to transfer zzso clusters to target proteins is associated with zzso protein instability and zzso death of mice in which zzso has been knocked zzso We propose that zzso functions as a platform to facilitate zzso cluster transfer to proteins critical for DNA replication and zzso
