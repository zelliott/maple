The ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are structurally related but have significant variation in zzso A zzso expression method in zzso zzso was developed as a step toward connecting zzso of the chemistry to zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as sequence and zzso zzso showed that the majority of zzso zzso fall into three major groups with distinctive active site surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso positions C1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso both C1 and zzso A zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that an extra zzso of about 12 zzso acids contribute to C4 zzso in the zzso zzso
