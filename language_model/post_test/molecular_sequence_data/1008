zzso zzso zzso of Wheat streak mosaic virus strain Sidney 81 zzso zzso was systematically replaced with the corresponding zzso derived from four strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and El zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso the zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso and zzso mosaic virus zzso or the zzso zzso etch virus zzso and zzso mosaic virus zzso These zzso proteins varied in zzso acid sequence identity shared with zzso of zzso 81 from high zzso of zzso at approximately zzso to moderate zzso at zzso to low zzso and zzso at approximately zzso Surprisingly, all zzso viral zzso examined were capable of systemic infection of wheat upon zzso with zzso transcripts produced in zzso zzso replacements derived from zzso did not alter host range relative to zzso 81, as each of these zzso viruses was able to zzso zzso zzso zzso and corn line zzso These results indicate that differences in host range among zzso including the inability of zzso to zzso wheat or the inability of zzso strains Type and El zzso 3 to zzso zzso corn, are not determined by zzso In contrast, all zzso viruses bearing zzso replacements derived from zzso or zzso were unable to zzso zzso corn and zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso from zzso related virus species of the family zzso are competent to provide zzso 81 with all functions necessary for infection of a zzso host zzso and that zzso interactions required for systemic infection of zzso and zzso corn are more zzso Changes in symptom severity or mechanical transmission efficiency observed for some zzso viruses further suggest that zzso affects zzso in zzso
