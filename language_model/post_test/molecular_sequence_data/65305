A zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a zzso aromatic zzso soil in New zzso Two additional strains were recovered from a zzso heap in Belgium zzso zzso and from the zzso of zzso in the Netherlands zzso zzso The three strains had virtually identical zzso zzso gene sequences and zzso protein profiles, and they were identified as members of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso as their closest zzso zzso zzso had a DNA zzso content of zzso zzso and could be distinguished from zzso zzso based on a range of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed levels of zzso zzso towards the type strain of zzso zzso and those of other recognized zzso species of less than 30 zzso The results of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, zzso zzso experiments and zzso and zzso tests allowed the differentiation of strain zzso from all recognized species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are therefore considered to represent a single novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
