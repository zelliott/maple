We cloned and functionally characterized the zzso regulatory region of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a remarkably versatile carrier responsible for zzso of zzso zzso acid and zzso Two potential zzso start sites were determined by zzso and found to be at zzso and zzso Two distinct promoters zzso and zzso were zzso Both putative promoter sequences were zzso zzso contained highly zzso sites, and had multiple putative regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The activities of the putative promoters were confirmed using a zzso zzso reporter gene zzso system following transient zzso into three cultured human cell zzso zzso zzso and vascular smooth muscle zzso The minimal region required for zzso activity of the zzso promoter was also determined by generating a series of deletion zzso and found to be zzso by a sequence between zzso to zzso for zzso and between zzso to zzso for zzso relative to the translation initiation zzso These results demonstrate the first molecular characterization of the regulatory region of this important human zzso
