All known zzso protein 10 zzso molecules are zzso of seven identical zzso that are linked together by zzso zzso Here, we report the first characterization of a zzso protein from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alignment of zzso zzso zzso zzso shows high zzso with zzso zzso zzso except for a unique zzso zzso extension not found in any other zzso zzso zzso adopts a zzso structure in solution at pH values above 4 (20 degrees zzso Both zzso and zzso are folded at 20 degrees C, although the zzso stability of the zzso zzso 3; zzso approximately 58 degrees zzso is lower than that of the zzso zzso 7; zzso approximately 115 degrees zzso zzso functions in a zzso in zzso activity zzso Taken together, zzso appears similar in secondary, zzso and zzso structure, as well as in many zzso features, to its zzso counterparts despite a functional temperature of 90 degrees zzso
