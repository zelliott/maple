Seven zzso zzso zzso zzso have been prepared and shown to be fair to excellent zzso for zzso zzso by zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso parameters of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, were determined at pH zzso for zzso zzso the zzso rate constant for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso rate constant for reaction of the free zzso and zzso There is a weak correlation between log zzso and the zzso of the zzso alcohol leaving group, which is attributed to stabilization of the zzso complex by zzso interactions between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the zzso leaving zzso These binding interactions are probably both productive and expressed in the value of zzso and zzso and expressed in the value of zzso The negative values of beta zzso are inconsistent with zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The values of beta zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso lie between those observed for the spontaneous zzso zzso approximately zzso and zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso of zzso and these pathways are therefore excluded for the zzso zzso zzso of the metal zzso zzso from the zzso causes a approximately zzso unit decrease in zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso The interpretation of this change in beta zzso is zzso The zzso zzso for the zzso reaction are consistent with participation by an essential zzso zzso in concerted zzso zzso of zzso of the zzso bond of zzso and/or stabilization of developing negative charge at the zzso oxygen by interaction with the zzso zzso zzso
