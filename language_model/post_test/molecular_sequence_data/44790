The zzso activity of zzso the principal hormonal zzso of body size, is zzso by zzso growth factor I zzso Most of the zzso in plasma zzso in a zzso complex that contains zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex serves as a zzso of zzso and determines its zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso complex depends upon the synthesis of zzso which is zzso primarily in liver and is regulated by zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso stimulates ALS gene zzso in rat liver and ALS promoter activity in a rat zzso cell zzso ALS zzso zzso zzso and ALS nuclear transcripts were decreased to similar zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso ALS zzso within zzso h to about zzso of the levels seen in zzso control zzso To confirm that zzso zzso ALS gene transcription, we zzso zzso an ALS zzso reporter gene construct into zzso rat zzso cells and primary rat zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso promoter activity about zzso In contrast, zzso promoter activity was lower, and zzso stimulation was absent when the ALS reporter construct was zzso into zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso stimulation of ALS promoter activity in zzso cells was zzso by functional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gave identical stimulation to zzso and stimulation by zzso occurred at zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso was present in zzso cells at approximately zzso of the level seen in rat zzso zzso also induced the expression of the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the signaling zzso necessary for the zzso of gene expression by zzso was intact in zzso zzso Thus, zzso cells are a zzso liver cell line that should provide a useful system in which to study the molecular mechanism of zzso regulation by zzso of ALS and other zzso zzso
