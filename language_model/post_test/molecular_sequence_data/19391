The zzso zzso toxin zzso gene clusters of zzso coli strain zzso and zzso fetus strain zzso were cloned and zzso to understand the importance of zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso genes of zzso coli and zzso fetus consist of three closely linked genes termed zzso zzso zzso whose sizes are zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 546 zzso zzso The zzso of each zzso of zzso genes between zzso zzso and zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso coli and zzso fetus are zzso zzso or zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso for zzso zzso Colony zzso zzso revealed that the genes zzso to the zzso gene were distributed in all 27, 19, 20 strains of zzso zzso zzso coli, and zzso zzso respectively, isolated from patients and animals in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso sequence of the zzso zzso including zzso region, of 10 strains of each species indicated that though the size of the zzso gene was zzso in each species, those of zzso and zzso genes varied particularly among zzso coli zzso zzso acid zzso demonstrated to be important for toxin activity in zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso were also zzso in zzso and zzso The zzso gene cluster was located in different sites among different species but in the same site of zzso of the same zzso zzso activity produced by zzso zzso and zzso fetus varied among zzso however, any zzso coli strains exhibited zzso activity on zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso gene may have a potential for zzso factor at least in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
