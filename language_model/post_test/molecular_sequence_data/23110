Desert locust swarms occasionally cause severe ecological and economic damage, particularly in countries of northwest zzso However, the zzso mechanisms underlying locust phase transition, the switch of the zzso to the gregarious phase, remain zzso zzso identification of molecular changes linked to this phenomenon represents a primary requirement to start unraveling this zzso The present paper provides novel information on zzso molecular markers for locust phase zzso We present a detailed quantitative real-time zzso analysis of two distinct zzso precursor transcripts zzso and zzso in the brain and in abdominal zzso of gregarious and zzso desert zzso zzso zzso Our data reveal different zzso changes of these transcripts in the fat body during the adult stage of both zzso zzso zzso present novel scientific evidence for a zzso regulation of these particular zzso hormone zzso transcripts and assign them as possible molecular markers in the process of locust phase zzso
