A zzso zzso protein zzso that binds zzso zzso zzso and is a zzso for zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso within zzso zzso finger abolished zzso as did zzso of zzso Several zzso zzso finger zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assessed for their ability to facilitate zzso zzso In all cases, zzso was zzso The zzso fingers were implicated directly in this activity through zzso of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso These findings suggest that a large number of zzso zzso zzso with otherwise diverse structures and functions, may play previously unappreciated roles in modulating protein levels via zzso
