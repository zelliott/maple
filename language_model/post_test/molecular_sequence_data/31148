The production and zzso stability of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso part of the zzso precursor were studied in small cell lung cancer cell lines using zzso developed against these two parts of the zzso In three otherwise different cell lines zzso zzso and zzso similar zzso patterns of mainly zzso and some zzso along with large fragments of the zzso counterpart of the precursor were found to be stored in the zzso In tissue culture zzso gel zzso zzso indicated that zzso limited zzso of the zzso precursor fragments zzso The amount of accumulated zzso varied among the three cell lines and between the two parts of the zzso In medium in which only low amounts of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was zzso zzso When incubated with zzso zzso disappeared within a few hours, whereas the zzso precursor fragments were zzso It is concluded that the zzso stability of peptides excised from the zzso precursor in small cell lung cancer cells varies under tissue culture conditions, but zzso in the zzso part of the precursor are more stable in plasma than the small zzso peptides and, thus, may serve as a better indicator than zzso itself for expression of the zzso precursor in cancer zzso
