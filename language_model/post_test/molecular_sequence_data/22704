zzso from various environmental zzso were screened using zzso zzso and Fast Blue zzso for a novel zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the initial insert DNA zzso zzso using restriction zzso selected to exclude already known zzso with subsequent screenings resulted in a positive clone with a zzso DNA zzso The cloned sequence included an open reading frame consisting of zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of about zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis revealed only moderate identity zzso or zzso zzso to the known zzso in the databases containing the zzso sequence motifs of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the putative zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was functionally zzso in a soluble form in zzso coli with optimal activity at pH zzso and 25 degrees zzso The zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity toward zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso chains zzso or zzso zzso with the highest activity toward zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with chain lengths zzso or zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso is an zzso originated most likely from a zzso zzso in zzso zzso efficiently zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso with slight zzso toward zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates that functional screening combined with the sequential uses of restriction zzso to exclude already known zzso is a useful approach for zzso novel zzso from a zzso
