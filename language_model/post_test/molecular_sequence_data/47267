zzso form a recently identified family of proteins that mediate zzso signaling of the transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso bind to DNA and act as zzso zzso zzso interact with a variety of zzso factors, and the interaction is likely to determine the target specificity of gene zzso zzso also associate with zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the ability of zzso to bind zzso is required for the zzso Here we determined the zzso interaction domain zzso in zzso and found that two adjacent regions are required for the zzso One of the regions is the zzso domain zzso between zzso and zzso and the other is a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing SID inhibit zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso the interaction of zzso with a zzso zzso that contains SID but lacks the zzso binding zzso We found that zzso interacts specifically with zzso zzso suggesting a novel mechanism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
