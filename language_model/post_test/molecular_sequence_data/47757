To determine whether the envelope zzso region from zzso zzso A, C or D had the same probability of being present in zzso zzso zzso 

The envelope zzso and the gag zzso regions from one hundred infants infected zzso in Tanzania were compared using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exact tests were used to assess if various zzso regions were more likely to be overrepresented in zzso zzso 

Of one hundred zzso positive infants zzso zzso zzso showed exclusively zzso A sequence in gag and zzso zzso C accounted for zzso infants zzso whereas zzso infants zzso were infected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accounted for zzso infections zzso The zzso region from zzso A was found in all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso region from zzso C was found in all twelve zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D gag sequences were zzso represented in the gag of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso region of zzso A was generally surrounded by zzso A zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso region from zzso C was surrounded by zzso D zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso differences were not found in the number of zzso A or zzso C sequences in zzso zzso 

We have shown that several zzso zzso viruses have been generated and efficiently transmitted to infants in zzso The zzso patterns showed that the zzso region of zzso A or C was always selected in zzso and zzso zzso This selection suggests that the fitness of zzso zzso in zzso transmission may be reduced with respect to zzso from zzso A and/or zzso zzso The elevated number of zzso transmitted zzso suggests that zzso or zzso by two zzso zzso is not uncommon in this zzso
