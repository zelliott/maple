zzso caused by zzso is the most common zzso problem in humans and pigs zzso No vaccines are available for the prevention of zzso zzso In the present study, the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso cloned and zzso zzso acid sequence alignment indicated that zzso was highly zzso between different zzso and shared the highest identity zzso with zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was successfully expressed in zzso zzso The ability of the zzso for inducing immune protective responses against challenge infection with zzso zzso zzso was evaluated in zzso zzso The immune response was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the reduction rate of recovery zzso The results showed that the mice zzso with zzso developed a high level of specific zzso responses against zzso zzso a strong zzso response, and significant levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso production, compared with the other groups zzso with empty zzso or blank controls, zzso There was a zzso reduction zzso in larvae recovery compared with that in the blank control zzso Our data indicated that zzso zzso zzso is a potential vaccine candidate against zzso zzso zzso
