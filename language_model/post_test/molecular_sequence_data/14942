zzso zzso zzso zzso in Man zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disorder mainly due to zzso in the gene for zzso zzso the most severe form of zzso is classic zzso We zzso the entire gene for zzso zzso in 51 unrelated zzso patients from Southern zzso The entire locus was zzso in 46 out of 51 zzso patients, and 32 different zzso zzso were zzso The zzso nature of two novel gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso was demonstrated by in zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that involves the accepting site of zzso 7; it causes the complete skipping of zzso 7 and results in the truncated zzso zzso The second gene zzso zzso has very low residual zzso activity zzso zzso which may be zzso in part, to a low expression level zzso Both the decreased zzso activity and the low expression level are supported by analysis of the zzso structure of the zzso The putative structural zzso induced by zzso are compatible with protein instability and zzso of zzso interactions within zzso and zzso although they do not affect the zzso zzso In zzso studies showed zzso responsiveness in the zzso carrier but not in the zzso zzso We next investigated zzso correlations and found that zzso was a good predictor of zzso in zzso of zzso However, zzso zzso occurred in approximately zzso of our patients, mainly those bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
