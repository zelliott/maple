zzso zzso variable fragments zzso of zzso make it possible to zzso zzso and zzso zzso identify protective zzso and can be exploited for the design of improved diagnostic tests and zzso A zzso zzso as well as other potential zzso sites of a zzso zzso disease virus zzso were identified using zzso zzso Three unique zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Further characterization of these zzso revealed that only zzso was capable of zzso the zzso virus and was used to generate zzso virus zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region of virus escaping zzso revealed a zzso change from His to zzso at position 159 of the zzso zzso zzso 159 is not only surface exposed but is also located at the zzso base of the zzso loop, a known zzso region of zzso A synthetic zzso of which the sequence corresponded to the predicted zzso site of the zzso zzso loop of zzso inhibited binding of zzso to zzso in a zzso zzso This region can therefore be considered in the design of zzso vaccine seed viruses for the regional control of zzso in zzso
