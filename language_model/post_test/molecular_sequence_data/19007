Communities of organisms inhabiting extreme zzso environments provide a unique opportunity to study evolutionary forces that drive population structure and genetic diversity under the combined challenges posed by multiple zzso zzso High abundance of an invasive zzso earthworm (and the absence of indigenous zzso zzso in the zzso geothermal field zzso Miguel Island, zzso indicates its remarkable tolerance to high soil temperature, exceptionally high carbon dioxide and low oxygen levels, and elevated metal zzso conditions which are lethal for the majority of zzso zzso zzso and nuclear markers were used to analyze the relationship between populations living inside and outside the geothermal zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to be a genetically zzso complex within the zzso Miguel landscape and is probably differentiated into cryptic zzso The population exposed to the hostile soil conditions within the volcanic zzso possesses the lowest zzso zzso diversity but an unexpectedly high degree of nuclear zzso with several zzso zzso positive selection, parameters indicative of a genetically unique population only zzso related to zzso living outside the zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso inhabiting active volcanic soil is a discrete zzso population that has evolved by tolerating a mixture of zzso chemical and physical zzso
