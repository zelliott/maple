Recently, zzso zzso zzso stress responses have been suggested to play important roles in maintaining various cellular functions and to zzso many tissue zzso In this study, we first identified zzso with zzso zzso 2 zzso as an zzso zzso gene by analyzing a zzso analysis of zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso is also shown to be immediately induced by treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso sequence of the mouse zzso promoter, we found a typical zzso stress responsible element zzso which is well zzso among various zzso Using a zzso reporter zzso we demonstrated that the zzso in mouse zzso is functional and responds to zzso and zzso Each zzso of zzso or zzso sites in the zzso of the mouse zzso promoter dramatically decreased both the zzso activity and responsiveness toward the zzso stress zzso Our study suggests that zzso could be a novel zzso in regulating the onset and progression of various zzso zzso zzso
