The zzso zzso zzso zzso converts zzso the precursor of the plant hormone zzso to zzso and zzso This zzso has been identified in soil bacteria and has been proposed to play a key role in zzso zzso A soluble zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of molecular weight 41 zzso has been zzso zzso and zzso It showed selectivity and high activity towards the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at pH zzso and 22 degrees zzso The zzso displayed optimal activity at pH zzso with a sharp decline to essentially no activity below pH zzso and a slightly less severe tapering in activity at higher pH resulting in loss of activity at zzso The major component of the zzso secondary structure was determined to be zzso by circular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso unfolded at 60 degrees C as determined by its CD temperature profile as well as by differential scanning zzso zzso zzso activity was knocked out in the point zzso zzso Modeling this zzso into the known zzso zzso structure shed light on the role this highly zzso zzso plays in allowing zzso accessibility to the active zzso This zzso zzso and zzso properties will serve as an important reference point to which newly isolated zzso zzso from other organisms can be zzso
