zzso is a zzso cell zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso of chemical zzso to isolated rat liver plasma zzso intact zzso cells and zzso preparations of zzso stabilized one major zzso product whose apparent molecular mass was approximately twice that of the zzso zzso The failure to detect additional proteins after zzso of the zzso species demonstrated that zzso exists as zzso linked zzso both in solution and on the cell zzso zzso occurred to the same extent in adherent zzso and in single cell zzso indicating that zzso formation was the result of zzso within the zzso of individual zzso Using zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso were found to be involved in zzso forming predominantly zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso modulated the level of zzso formation, suggesting a role for regulated zzso in the functional activity of zzso
