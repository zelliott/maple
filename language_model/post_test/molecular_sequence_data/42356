The cortical collecting zzso zzso of the zzso kidney zzso sodium and zzso processes that are zzso by zzso and zzso zzso is also an important site for zzso zzso which is driven, in part, by zzso zzso and zzso are members of the zzso zzso gene zzso They are closely related plasma membrane proteins which consist of alpha beta zzso The urinary zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is the zzso counterpart of zzso zzso We have previously characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells, a zzso cell line derived from the zzso zzso which expresses zzso sodium zzso In the present study, we report the primary sequence and functional expression of a novel beta zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso isolated from a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso The deduced zzso is 299 zzso acids in length and has a predicted molecular mass of 33 zzso The beta zzso protein exhibits zzso zzso acid identity to the previously characterized beta 1 of zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity with beta 3 of zzso zzso zzso It shares 38% identity with the zzso beta gastric zzso and zzso with the zzso beta 2 zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that a zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed at a high level in zzso zzso cells and eye and at a trace level in zzso it is not zzso in significant amounts in the stomach, colon and small zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
