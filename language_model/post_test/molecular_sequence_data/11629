The gene on zzso 12 coding for the human protein zzso has been cloned and partially zzso It consists of five zzso the first and last of which include long untranslated zzso The zzso zzso includes a zzso tract and a zzso zzso zzso zzso II, III and IV zzso 51 and 33 zzso are dispersed over zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso separately zzso the three basic DNA binding zzso zzso zzso zzso IV encodes an 11 zzso acid sequence characteristic of zzso and absent from the human zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Reeves, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 21, zzso whilst zzso V encodes the zzso zzso domain, which is subject to multiple zzso The zzso gene is thus a striking example of the separation of functional protein elements into different coding zzso
