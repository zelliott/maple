zzso zzso gene is zzso activated following virus infection of various cell types such as zzso In the previous studies, regulatory DNA sequences that mediate the zzso zzso zzso have been identified within the zzso region (up to around zzso respect to the zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso The sequences contain binding sites zzso to zzso for a zzso zzso zzso the gene of which is also zzso In the present study, we focused on an additional zzso located between the zzso binding sites and zzso zzso Interestingly, the element zzso with the previously identified elements for the zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso zzso The element, when zzso zzso functions in zzso the zzso gene expression in either zzso or zzso manner depending on the cell zzso The results suggest the importance of cooperation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor in the zzso zzso gene zzso
