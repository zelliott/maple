zzso zzso are molecular switches that regulate many essential cellular zzso including zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have isolated the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and examined its potential role during zzso movements in early zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso undergoing extensive zzso changes, such as the deep layers of zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso interferes with zzso extension movements in intact zzso zzso animal zzso and zzso marginal zone zzso These effects occur without affecting zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso leads to the decrease and increase of cell zzso of zzso respectively, as demonstrated by the cell zzso zzso In addition, when zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit zzso zzso extension in animal cap zzso This zzso can be rescued by zzso of zzso zzso zzso that zzso acts downstream of the zzso signaling zzso involving zzso zzso zzso also lies downstream of zzso in the regulation of zzso cell zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso plays a role in the regulation of zzso extension movements during zzso through the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso
