The gene expression of zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein and the major fish zzso was significantly increased in the zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso as examined using a zzso zzso zzso Using the real-time quantitative zzso we further confirmed the increased zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso base pairs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clone was fully zzso and found to contain a coding region of 330 zzso which encodes a 108 zzso acids protein with a molecular weight of zzso and an calculated zzso point of zzso The predicted secondary structure of zzso is comprised of seven alpha zzso It contains two characteristic zzso zzso zzso one zzso and five zzso zzso II consensus zzso zzso The zzso is highly zzso to the selected fish zzso at a similarity ranging from zzso to zzso The zzso tree analysis showed that the zzso is closest to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso was found to express in the heart, muscle, zzso zzso brain and zzso of adult fish by zzso zzso In zzso zzso also revealed that the zzso was highly expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion protein was generated and zzso by zzso to remove the zzso zzso Further Western analysis showed that the zzso protein was zzso to an zzso zzso zzso Those results suggest that zzso is zzso zzso in zzso
