zzso zzso a zzso zzso produced by zzso and zzso cells, regulates immune responses, zzso reactions against bacterial infections, and zzso After cloning and sequencing of zzso zzso the expression pattern of zzso zzso zzso was evaluated through real-time zzso using zzso immune cells zzso cells and zzso zzso following stimulation with zzso The sequence has been reported to zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence was different at the 89th and zzso positions in comparison with zzso but only at the zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso of human, zzso zzso and mouse showed zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso sequence and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was induced by stimulation with zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso peaked at 2 h and decreased sharply to control levels at 4 zzso whereas it peaked at 14 h and decreased at 24 h in zzso cells after stimulation with zzso (1 zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso expression in zzso immune cells is zzso specific and the results of this study could be used as the basis for research on the zzso immune zzso
