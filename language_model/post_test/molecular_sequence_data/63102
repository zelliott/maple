While genetically modified zzso cotton zzso zzso zzso varieties are ranked among the most successful genetically modified organisms zzso there is little knowledge on zzso integration in the cotton zzso partly because of the difficulty in obtaining large numbers of transgenic zzso In this study, we analyzed 139 independently derived zzso transgenic cotton plants transformed by zzso zzso strain zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso It was found by zzso that as many as zzso of the plants had integration of zzso backbone zzso Of the 110 plants with good zzso Southern zzso results, 37% had integration of a single zzso zzso had two zzso copies and zzso had three or more zzso Multiple copies of the zzso existed either as repeats in complex zzso or zzso zzso Our further analysis of two zzso populations showed that zzso with a single zzso and no zzso sequence could be obtained from zzso plants having multiple zzso copies and zzso zzso Out of the 57 zzso junctions cloned from complex zzso 27 had zzso zzso tandem repeats, the rest zzso had deletions to zzso or had inclusion of zzso zzso Overlapping zzso was present for most of the zzso junctions zzso Right border zzso ends of the zzso were precise while most left border zzso ends zzso had zzso to internal border zzso zzso of zzso zzso integration outside LB in 33 plants gave evidence that zzso zzso sequence was determined in zzso zzso Among the 130 plants with characterized zzso zzso zzso had the zzso integrated into coding zzso zzso into repetitive zzso zzso into zzso Interestingly, zzso had the zzso integrated into zzso derived zzso zzso sequence comparison of target sites in cotton zzso before and after zzso integration revealed overlapping zzso between target sites and the zzso zzso deletions to cotton zzso in most cases studied zzso and some also had zzso sequences zzso This information on zzso integration in cotton will facilitate functional zzso studies and further crop zzso
