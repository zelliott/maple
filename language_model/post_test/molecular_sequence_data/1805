zzso are membrane zzso closely related to the zzso proteins of the zzso zzso Their functions include zzso zzso pumping in zzso and light detection in algae and animals, using the zzso retinal as a zzso prosthetic zzso We describe a gene of zzso zzso zzso coding for a zzso resembling zzso and zzso proteins and zzso to the genes of the zzso pathway, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso is induced by light and is zzso in zzso zzso The same regulation pattern is exhibited by zzso and zzso and common zzso DNA elements are found in the three zzso Heat shock resulted in a modest induction of zzso transcription, similar to the one exhibited by zzso confirming a common zzso zzso zzso of zzso produced no apparent zzso zzso including no change in the zzso of zzso zzso
