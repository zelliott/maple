The zzso zzso factors zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding zzso interact with zzso and are hypothesized to mediate zzso zzso We have cloned a zzso expressed zzso zzso family member, zzso zzso binds a zzso zzso DNA motif and interacts with the zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have identified two regions in zzso required for zzso zzso One of these interacts with zzso while the other constitutes a zzso zzso zzso in zzso and expression of a zzso zzso zzso cause a segment polarity zzso and affect expression of the zzso target genes zzso and zzso zzso analysis positions zzso downstream of zzso The zzso complex mediates zzso signaling as a zzso zzso zzso
