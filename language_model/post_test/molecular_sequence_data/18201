Previously, a zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso was identified in a zzso extract of the zzso zzso membrane of zzso zzso a zzso green zzso zzso zzso was raised against a synthetic zzso zzso with an zzso acid sequence corresponding to the highly zzso region of the putative zzso B proteins of 3 land zzso In this report, zzso reacting strongly and specifically with this zzso was detected in the equivalent zzso extract prepared from zzso zzso of spinach and zzso One strong reaction zzso band from tobacco zzso was zzso from zzso gel and subjected to zzso zzso C zzso The resulting zzso were separated by zzso zzso zzso sequencing of 3 zzso zzso revealed that the protein is zzso by the zzso zzso identified from DNA sequence zzso
