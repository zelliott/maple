zzso is a zzso member of the zzso family of proteins involved in the regulation of genetically programmed cell death in zzso zzso It has been shown that zzso expression of zzso in several zzso species, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also zzso cell zzso In this study we investigated the effects of zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell death inducing expression of zzso required a synthetic zzso gene that was zzso for expression in zzso zzso zzso of this zzso gene resulted in growth zzso and cell zzso By fusing zzso with the zzso enhanced green fluorescent protein of zzso zzso the cell zzso effect of zzso was increased due to reduced zzso degradation of zzso Using this fusion protein we showed that, upon expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso Furthermore, we showed for the first time that expression of zzso in zzso causes the zzso which are normally distributed throughout the cell, to cluster in the zzso zzso
