zzso zzso zzso is the zzso responsible for the zzso modification of specific zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso base, zzso In zzso coli this zzso zzso the exchange of zzso in the zzso with zzso which is subsequently further modified to zzso There is evidence that such zzso zzso molecules may play a role in the control of cell proliferation and zzso In order to perform detailed, in zzso zzso studies and to probe the zzso interaction, we have generated unmodified zzso coli zzso and truncated zzso using an in zzso zzso synthesis system suggested by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso 180, zzso From this system we have generated three zzso zzso totally devoid of any zzso zzso In order to compare the unmodified zzso with the true zzso zzso for zzso that is, zzso that contains all modified bases except zzso we have isolated zzso coli zzso from an zzso clone in a zzso strain of zzso zzso We report here that zzso full-length zzso serves as a zzso for zzso with kinetic parameters that are, within experimental error, the same as those for in zzso isolated zzso This indicates that other zzso modifications have negligible effects upon zzso recognition of zzso A zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso loop and zzso is also a zzso for zzso with only a zzso loss in zzso versus the full-length zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
