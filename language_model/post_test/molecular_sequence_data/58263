The goal of this research was to zzso a zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso of the translated product from an zzso zzso were mapped using computer modeling zzso The corresponding zzso sequences of zzso zzso were examined for unique restriction sites to allow zzso of a synthetic bovine zzso alpha gene zzso which zzso the first 26 zzso zzso A zzso zzso was zzso which contained the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso A 46 zzso zzso protein zzso was produced from zzso zzso zzso coli cells containing zzso that was identified with zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso in four sites along the back against zzso zzso zzso zzso crude zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) at week 0, 4, 7, and zzso zzso and booster zzso contained ca 300 zzso of zzso zzso in complete zzso zzso and incomplete zzso zzso zzso Blood samples collected at week 0, 6, 8, and 19 were evaluated for their ability to bind zzso 32 zzso bovine zzso and bovine zzso alpha zzso using zzso Mean zzso zzso at week 19 were zzso in rabbits zzso against zzso or crude zzso and zzso in rabbits zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso were nonexistent in zzso from zzso rabbits and rabbits zzso against zzso Mean zzso zzso at week 19 were zzso and zzso in rabbits zzso against crude zzso or zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso alpha zzso zzso at week 19 were zzso and zzso in rabbits zzso against crude or zzso zzso zzso We conclude that genetic engineering of zzso alpha zzso into the zzso zzso of zzso provides potential for the development of an zzso zzso
