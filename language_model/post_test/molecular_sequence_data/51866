A zzso zzso of zzso zzso resistant to zzso and lacking the zzso outer membrane zzso protein zzso was zzso The zzso could be zzso to zzso zzso and zzso by a cloned zzso zzso zzso of DNA from the region of zzso of the zzso strain surrounding the site of zzso zzso However, this zzso did not contain the zzso structural gene as judged by its inability to zzso with an zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso DNA sequencing of zzso zzso of the region surrounding the zzso zzso site revealed three large open reading zzso one of which would be interrupted by the zzso zzso in the zzso This latter open reading frame, named zzso (for putative regulator of zzso zzso predicted a zzso protein of zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso the zzso structural gene was cloned and expressed in zzso coli on a zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing predicted a zzso zzso acid mature zzso protein with a 23 zzso acid signal zzso
