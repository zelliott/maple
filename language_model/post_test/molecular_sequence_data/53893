A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso wall zzso zzso was zzso by zzso exchange and zzso zzso from a commercial zzso preparation from zzso zzso zzso exhibited optimal pH at zzso and zzso zzso zzso coli more efficiently than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was inhibited by zzso strongly and by zzso to a lesser extent, suggesting that it is probably a zzso zzso acid composition and mass zzso analyses for the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso was established by a combination of zzso degradation and mass zzso for peptides obtained by zzso zzso I zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso consists of a single zzso chain of 177 zzso acid zzso with one zzso bond, zzso zzso was found to be zzso to zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Its sequence identity with zzso is zzso but the zzso acid zzso functioning as zinc zzso in zzso are absent in zzso These results suggest that zzso is a new type of zzso zzso
