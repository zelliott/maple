We have characterized the cellular proteins which are rapidly zzso by zzso 2 zzso 2) in a human zzso 2 dependent cell zzso When treated with zzso 2, the zzso of five zzso 65, 50, 37, 24, and 21 zzso was found in zzso 2 dependent cell lines by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso After cell conversion from an zzso 2 dependent state to an zzso 2 independent state, one of the five zzso the zzso zzso became zzso zzso even without addition of zzso zzso Also, in other zzso 2 independent cell lines, such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein occurred without zzso zzso So our researchers were focused on zzso characterization of the zzso zzso It was found that the zzso protein was one of the major cellular proteins by comparing the results of two-dimensional gel zzso analysis of zzso and zzso cellular proteins and zzso mapping zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that the zzso protein is a zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso from zzso of a human T cell line, and its zzso acid composition and zzso acid sequences of its three zzso were zzso It was found that the zzso protein is identical with zzso
