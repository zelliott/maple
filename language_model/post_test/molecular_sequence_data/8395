An in-house zzso chain reaction zzso test using zzso zzso gene zzso was compared with zzso zzso detection zzso and culture for the detection of zzso zzso Five hundred and zzso fresh zzso zzso zzso and 174 zzso zzso at the same zzso from patients attending a zzso diseases clinic were zzso zzso zzso and culture detected zzso in 43, 35 and 42 zzso respectively from the 43 resolved positive zzso The specificity on the resolved negative specimens was zzso for each of the zzso From the zzso zzso and zzso detected the zzso in 16 and 15 cases respectively of the 23 resolved positive males tested but in only 2 and 3 cases respectively of the 9 resolved positive females zzso zzso were zzso in all zzso Both of the zzso tests zzso problems with urine due to zzso activity (in zzso zzso or excessive debris (in zzso zzso in about zzso of the zzso Culture of the zzso yielded sensitivities of zzso in the males and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was more sensitive than either culture or zzso on both zzso and cervical zzso and zzso The zzso yielded less than three-quarters the number of zzso that was obtained from the zzso and were considered to be an unsatisfactory zzso for zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso is a satisfactory alternative to culture on zzso zzso and may be preferable in situations where the viability of the organisms is in zzso zzso remains useful because of its speed and simplicity but is insufficiently sensitive to be relied upon by zzso
