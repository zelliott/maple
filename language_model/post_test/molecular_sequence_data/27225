Two members of the zzso family zzso and zzso recently emerged as novel regulators of several cellular zzso The degree of structural similarity between the zzso proteins is typical for proteins that belong to the same zzso Furthermore, the experiments with knockout mice lacking these proteins may be interpreted as suggesting that functions of zzso proteins in T zzso zzso At the same time, zzso and zzso exhibit clear functional zzso starting with the finding that a zzso zzso domain present in both proteins exhibits remarkable differences in zzso zzso zzso is an active zzso capable of zzso multiple zzso zzso whereas the zzso activity of zzso is extremely zzso In contrast, zzso but not zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso in T zzso In spite of their apparent importance, the functional role of zzso proteins is not well zzso In particular, the role of functional zzso between them remains zzso
