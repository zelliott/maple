A novel zzso zzso condition, zzso zzso with zzso zzso syndrome, has been identified in the Canadian zzso zzso population, zzso by early onset zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth failure, and zzso zzso 

To map zzso syndrome and identify the zzso underlying this zzso 

A zzso wide scan was undertaken on zzso zzso families using a zzso mapping approach in order to identify the zzso associated zzso zzso zzso analysis was carried out on zzso candidate genes in this region by zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso analyses were then used to zzso the zzso and determine its effect on the protein zzso 

The association of zzso syndrome with a zzso zzso region of zzso zzso was zzso A disease associated zzso was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso a zzso domain containing protein of previously unknown function zzso Gene ID zzso 

The zzso protein was previously zzso to the zzso in cardiac zzso and shares sequence and zzso similarity with proteins from several species including two zzso zzso inner membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a component of the zzso inner zzso membrane zzso zzso suggesting that the unique zzso of zzso may be the result of defective zzso protein zzso It is only the second human disorder caused by defects in this zzso that has been zzso
