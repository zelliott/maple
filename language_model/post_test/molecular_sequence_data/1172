zzso mosaic virus zzso is able to zzso and multiply zzso to high levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we obtained a zzso zzso zzso which expresses a coat protein with a truncated zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso induced necrosis that resembled the hypersensitive response and caused more pronounced disease symptoms than wild type zzso in zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso burst occurred prior to this zzso We found that expression of the zzso gene zzso was induced by zzso infection, and also by infection with wild type zzso but only in zzso zzso plants, not in zzso transgenic zzso These results suggested that zzso expression is dependent on the salicylic acid signaling pathway, but is independent of zzso
