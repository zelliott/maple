Base zzso zzso in the zzso of two different zzso coli zzso have been isolated that allow suppression of a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso of a U between positions 34 and 35 of zzso or addition of a G between positions 36 and 37 of zzso expand the zzso of both zzso similarly to zzso and allow decoding of complementary zzso zzso Analysis of the suppressed zzso sequences suggests that suppression occurs by pairing of the expanded zzso to all four bases of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso are identical to the zzso class of zzso zzso isolated both in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli by zzso and Roth and previously thought to affect zzso
