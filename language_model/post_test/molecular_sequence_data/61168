zzso zzso zzso are involved in the zzso of core zzso which is an important event in zzso regulation in zzso through zzso in the zzso zzso We cloned zzso and zzso zzso zzso two chicken zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso localized in zzso Treatment with zzso A reduced the zzso activities in zzso obtained with zzso and zzso zzso Using gene targeting techniques, we generated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso devoid of two zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The protein patterns on two-dimensional PAGE definitely changed for zzso and the amounts of the zzso zzso and zzso increased in zzso Of the two zzso zzso forms, the zzso form zzso increased in zzso but the zzso form zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was transcribed more in zzso than in zzso zzso In the zzso the alternative processing of zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred, resulting in an increase in the amount of zzso zzso whereas the stability of the two types of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso In zzso cells, treatment with zzso A increased both the amounts of zzso zzso zzso and the switch from zzso to zzso zzso Based on these results, we propose a model for a role of zzso in both the zzso and alternative processing steps, resulting in control of the amount of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso
