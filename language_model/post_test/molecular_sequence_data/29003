The zzso 3 zzso zzso (3 zzso is essential for the zzso of all active steroid zzso It exists as multiple zzso in humans and zzso each the product of a distinct zzso Human 3 zzso I in zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso and thus is essential for the maintenance of zzso The zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso is the only zzso expressed in giant zzso cells during the first half of mouse zzso This study was designed to identify the zzso zzso and the associated zzso factors required for zzso expression of 3 zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso and zzso cells identified a novel zzso zzso zzso element located between zzso and zzso of the 3 zzso VI zzso zzso protection analysis of the zzso element identified three zzso binding sites, zzso zzso and zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with zzso representing the protected zzso zzso and zzso and nuclear extracts isolated from human zzso cells and from mouse zzso cells, demonstrated the same binding pattern that was distinct from the binding pattern with mouse zzso cell nuclear zzso Further zzso mobility shift zzso identified zzso gamma and the zzso zzso zzso 3, as the zzso factors that specifically bind to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in each of the binding sites eliminated zzso activity indicating that zzso gamma and zzso 3, together with an additional zzso zzso that are zzso between humans and mice, are required for zzso expression of 3 zzso zzso
