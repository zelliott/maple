zzso muscle cells switch between differentiated and zzso zzso in response to zzso cues, but the zzso mechanisms that zzso such zzso plasticity remain zzso zzso response factor zzso activates genes involved in smooth muscle differentiation and proliferation by recruiting zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso complex factors zzso of the zzso family, zzso Here we show that growth signals repress smooth muscle genes by triggering the displacement of zzso from zzso by zzso a zzso that acts as a zzso zzso The opposing influences of zzso and zzso on smooth muscle gene expression are zzso by structurally related zzso motifs that compete for a common zzso site on zzso A zzso smooth muscle promoter, retaining responsiveness to zzso and zzso but defective in zzso zzso directs zzso zzso in the embryonic heart, demonstrating a role for zzso in suppression of smooth muscle gene expression in zzso We conclude that growth and zzso signals zzso smooth muscle gene expression by regulating the association of zzso with zzso zzso
