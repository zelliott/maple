zzso zzso are widely distributed across all zzso whereas zzso zzso are generally thought to be restricted to zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when developing zzso and that a zzso zzso deletion strain fails to zzso zzso and is defective in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso and shown to effectively zzso zzso from zzso in zzso demonstrating that it is a functional zzso zzso A zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso protein zzso is linked to the zzso zzso and when deleted is deficient in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and differential scanning zzso zzso analyses demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to, and is stabilized by zzso but not zzso This study thus provides evidence that zzso has a crucial role in regulating zzso zzso The involvement of zzso in regulating bacterial development has broader implications as several zzso bacteria contain a similar zzso coupled by the observation that zzso zzso also zzso zzso when inducing zzso
