The zzso zzso gene zzso from the zzso producer zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso that zzso and thereby zzso the zzso zzso Two promoters were identified upstream of and oriented toward the zzso coding zzso One promoter zzso initiated zzso at the A of the zzso zzso initiation zzso or one to two bases zzso zzso made in this promoter region identified functionally important zzso and verified that the zzso transcript was translated to yield the zzso zzso despite the lack of a conventional zzso binding zzso A second zzso promoter, zzso initiated zzso 315 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso but gave transcripts that appeared to terminate before reaching the coding zzso Multiple zzso initiation sites zzso were identified also in the zzso regulatory region oriented in the opposite direction to zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso transcripts overlap with zzso such that zzso zzso in zzso also reduce zzso from the overlapping zzso zzso
