zzso perform many diverse functions in the zzso The well-studied pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso of food, whereas a related zzso zzso zzso zzso functions in the degradation of other zzso Several members of the zzso gene family zzso D, zzso M and N) are more selective zzso and are thought to play a role in the processing of zzso zzso zzso Three other members of the zzso gene family do not appear to zzso active zzso these members have been designated zzso zzso and zzso In this review, we focus on the recently discovered zzso Z zzso This zzso removes zzso zzso zzso from synthetic zzso as do many of the other members of the gene zzso However, zzso differs from the other zzso in that zzso is enriched in the zzso zzso and is broadly distributed during early zzso In addition to containing a zzso domain, zzso also contains a zzso domain that has zzso to zzso zzso zzso are important signaling molecules during zzso Although the exact function of zzso is not yet known, it is likely that this protein plays a role in development by one of several possible zzso
