zzso is an abundant structural component of bacterial zzso and influences many cellular zzso including zzso zzso and zzso We have studied the mechanism of action of zzso at the zzso regulated zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with a curved DNA element located downstream of the zzso promoter is required for normal regulation of zzso zzso curved sequences can replace the regulatory role of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso reporter zzso which differ in the presence or absence of a curve, can indicate very different patterns of zzso zzso interacts zzso with these curved DNA elements in zzso Furthermore, in zzso the interaction of zzso with curved DNA zzso in the control of zzso linking zzso The data suggest that zzso changes in DNA zzso play a role in the zzso of zzso zzso
