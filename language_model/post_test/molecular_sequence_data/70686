The transport of zzso into the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso membrane protein that is delivered to the plasma membrane via the zzso zzso Experimental results led to the proposal of a two-dimensional model of the zzso zzso According to this model, the membrane domain of zzso contains three charged zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso in the members of the zzso family of zzso zzso We have previously shown that a zzso zzso leading to the replacement of zzso by zzso severely zzso the function of zzso zzso In the present paper, the role of the three charged zzso present in the zzso regions of zzso was further investigated by using zzso zzso The zzso zzso were correctly targeted to the plasma membrane and their zzso were similar to that of the zzso zzso The effect of the zzso was studied by measuring the zzso zzso for zzso on whole cells and equilibrium binding parameters on plasma zzso zzso We found no evidence for zzso interaction between either of the zzso zzso in zzso segments 3 and 9 and the zzso zzso in zzso segment zzso Of the three charged zzso only zzso was important for the transport activity of the zzso Its replacement by Ala, zzso or even zzso strongly impaired both the binding and the zzso of zzso
