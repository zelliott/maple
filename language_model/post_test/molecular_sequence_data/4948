Human zzso zzso contains genes that are imprinted and expressed from only one parental zzso zzso syndrome zzso is due to the loss of expression of one or more zzso expressed genes on zzso human zzso zzso most often by deletion or maternal zzso zzso Several candidate genes and a putative zzso zzso have been identified in the deletion zzso We report that the human zzso gene zzso is within the zzso portion of the zzso deletion region, between the two imprinted genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a nuclear protein expressed exclusively in differentiated zzso in the zzso zzso is zzso to govern the permanent arrest of cell growth of zzso zzso during zzso nervous system zzso We have localized the mouse locus zzso zzso zzso to zzso 7 in a region of zzso zzso with human zzso zzso by genetic mapping in an zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that expression of zzso is limited to the paternal zzso in zzso from newborn mouse zzso zzso of zzso is detected in many human zzso with highest levels of expression in brain and zzso zzso is expressed exclusively from the zzso inherited zzso in human zzso Loss of zzso gene expression may contribute to the disorder of brain development in individuals with zzso
