The zzso of major zzso complex zzso class I genes has been often involved in the zzso to a variety of infectious and zzso zzso In this work, the complete sequence of the coding region of a major zzso complex zzso class I gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The length of the corresponding open reading frame was zzso zzso zzso a mature protein of 337 zzso zzso zzso of additional clones allowed us to identify a second locus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that, after performing a zzso zzso analysis, happened to cluster with a bovine zzso zzso class I zzso zzso zzso class I molecules display low levels of zzso and fulfill an important zzso role in the zzso to inhibit maternal zzso This initial description of the gene content of the goat zzso class I region will contribute to the zzso in this zzso species, of one of the most important genetic factors in the zzso of innate and zzso immune responses against zzso
