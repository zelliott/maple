We report the complete coding sequence and the partial zzso acid sequence zzso by chemical zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The first zzso shows an extended sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the second one resembles the zzso zzso produced by that zzso The region directly upstream of the sequence coding for the mature protein in both zzso displays significant zzso to the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso respectively, thus suggesting that the zzso zzso may also be produced as zzso Furthermore, we report some biological properties of the zzso zzso contributing to a better understanding of its role as a possible zzso zzso The zzso activity of this zzso was rapidly and efficiently inhibited by human zzso however, human zzso as well as zzso zzso C and zzso were not zzso Moreover, the zzso was capable of zzso by limited zzso both zzso and zzso but neither zzso nor zzso zzso
