zzso citrus fruit undergo zzso changes which can be enhanced by zzso zzso In order to identify genes induced by zzso in citrus fruit peel, we cloned the gene zzso zzso corresponding to zzso increased gradually in the peel during natural fruit maturation and in response to zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso effect of zzso zzso of zzso increased also in juice zzso but the effect of zzso was much less zzso zzso is zzso to zzso and plant genes zzso for an zzso belonging to the zzso of zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso is involved in citrus fruit zzso
