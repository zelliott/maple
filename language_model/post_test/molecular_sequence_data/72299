We have carried out a DNA binding site screen of a zzso human zzso zzso library using a consensus zzso binding site as a zzso This study represents the first library screen carried out to isolate zzso genes from the human zzso We have shown that three zzso genes known to be expressed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also expressed in the zzso We have also identified a novel zzso zzso zzso that shows zzso sequence identity with the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore represents a new member of the zzso family of zzso zzso This is the first evidence that members of the zzso family of zzso genes are expressed in the zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso has been assigned to human zzso zzso This places zzso in the same region of zzso 17 as another member of the zzso family, zzso zzso et zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene cluster zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Members of the zzso family zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are found as closely linked pairs on human zzso zzso et zzso zzso We predict that zzso and zzso are closely linked and have arisen through gene zzso and divergence from a common ancestral zzso
