zzso in zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso repeat zzso 2 zzso are a common cause of Parkinson zzso zzso has been suggested to influence the zzso as zzso zzso reduce zzso outgrowth and cause an zzso of zzso zzso This might cause zzso in the dynamic instability of zzso suggested to contribute to the zzso of Parkinson zzso Here, we describe a direct interaction between zzso and zzso This interaction is zzso by the zzso zzso domain and is disrupted by the familial zzso zzso and artificial zzso domain zzso that mimic zzso zzso selectively interacts with three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso one of which zzso is zzso in the movement disorder zzso type 4 zzso zzso specificity is determined by zzso 362 and zzso 364 of zzso zzso modeling was used to map the interaction surface to the zzso face of zzso zzso in close proximity to the zzso 40 zzso site in zzso This location is predicted to be poorly accessible within mature stabilized zzso but exposed in dynamic zzso zzso zzso with this finding, zzso zzso displays a preferential zzso to dynamic zzso within growth cones, rather than adjacent zzso zzso zzso This interaction is functionally relevant to zzso zzso as mouse embryonic zzso derived from zzso zzso mice display increased zzso zzso Taken together, our data shed light on the nature of the zzso interaction, and indicate that zzso in zzso stability caused by changes in zzso might contribute to the zzso of Parkinson zzso
