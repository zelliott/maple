We have determined a zzso A crystal structure for human zzso zzso zzso the zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has a structure similar to that of the bacterial zzso with the zzso active sites zzso within an zzso chamber formed by face-to-face assembly of the two zzso zzso The zzso zzso peptides of the zzso are bound within the narrow (12 zzso zzso channel, positioned to interact with unfolded zzso zzso there by the associated zzso zzso zzso or deletion of these zzso causes a drastic decrease in zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso form a mobile loop that extends above the ring surface and is also required for zzso The 28 zzso acid zzso domain, a unique feature of zzso zzso zzso lies on the periphery of the ring, with its zzso portion forming a loop that extends out from the ring zzso zzso at the start of the zzso domain impinge on zzso zzso within the ring and affect zzso assembly and zzso We propose that the zzso zzso of zzso is a structural component of the zzso zzso channel and may play an important functional role as zzso
