A defining feature of multiple sclerosis zzso is the occurrence of clinical relapses separated by periods of clinical zzso Better understanding of the events underlying clinical zzso might suggest new approaches to zzso The objective of this study was to measure changes in the expression of zzso in the blood during zzso We used zzso to measure zzso expression in paired samples from 14 zzso patients during clinical zzso and while zzso Seventy-one transcripts changed expression at the P zzso zzso significance zzso The most notable finding was decreased expression of transcripts with regulatory function, expressed primarily in zzso zzso These decreased transcripts included the zzso zzso zzso which had a corresponding decrease in the protein concentration in zzso zzso with increased expression were expressed primarily in T zzso Pathways analysis suggested involvement of the zzso network, zzso and complement zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso We conclude that there are zzso of zzso expression in both T cells and zzso cells during zzso zzso
