The facilitated diffusion of zzso across the plasma membrane is carried out by a set of zzso transport proteins known as the zzso zzso These integral membrane proteins are members of a gene family where zzso expression of one or more members will determine in part the net rate of zzso entry into the zzso The regulation of zzso zzso gene expression is a critical feature of cellular zzso as defects in specific zzso expression can lead to profound zzso in cellular zzso In this review, we provide a brief descriptive background on the family of zzso zzso and examine in depth the regulation of the two zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso
