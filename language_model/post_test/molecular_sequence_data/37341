zzso functions as a zzso for zzso zzso virus zzso and a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of two zzso generated by zzso zzso of a larger precursor at six zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso and zzso zzso remain tightly associated via two complementary pairs of zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso Additional zzso proteins have been identified in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both contain zzso zzso zzso but do not undergo zzso zzso Thus, the significance of the zzso and zzso of zzso remains zzso Here, we describe the isolation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso using a genetic screen based on conservation of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso supports zzso complex formation and is more similar to zzso zzso than other zzso We show that full-length zzso expressed in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso giving rise to tightly associated zzso and zzso zzso As with zzso the zzso and zzso elements of zzso are separated by a large central region, however, this sequence lacks obvious zzso to the zzso repeats required for zzso zzso The conservation of zzso processing in insect cells argues that formation of separate zzso and zzso zzso is important for zzso zzso
