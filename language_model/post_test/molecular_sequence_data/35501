The replication of Long Terminal Repeat zzso zzso which can constitute over zzso of higher plant zzso resembles that of zzso A major question for zzso and zzso is how the two conflicting roles of their zzso in translation and reverse transcription, are zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso despite its organization into just one open reading frame, produces three distinct classes of zzso One is zzso zzso and zzso but cannot be copied into zzso The second is not capped or zzso but is destined for packaging and ultimate reverse zzso The third class is zzso zzso and spliced to favor production of a zzso zzso zzso only zzso the protein forming zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso which cannot zzso zzso and is zzso on zzso does not produce the spliced zzso zzso for translation but does make the replication competent zzso which are packaged into zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is first demonstration of distinct zzso pools for translation and zzso for any zzso
