The generation of human zzso zzso is critical for understanding zzso immune response in zzso In this study, zzso gene repertoire cloning was performed from a regional zzso zzso of a patient with idiopathic zzso zzso zzso and the resulting zzso zzso library was screened with bovine zzso chain zzso acid zzso zzso one of the zzso in zzso After three rounds of affinity selection, we isolated three human zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso zzso and zzso that specifically react with zzso by zzso Interestingly, zzso showed weak zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso another zzso zzso found in primary zzso zzso zzso and their zzso light chain genes have zzso zzso with a light chain of the human zzso zzso Although the exact zzso effect of zzso zzso is still unknown in zzso the potential binding specificity and limited light chain gene usage of our zzso zzso molecules may shed light on the initial mechanism as to how zzso start developing in zzso
