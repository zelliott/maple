zzso family proteins are involved in cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome protein zzso a zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso directly binds with zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso formation is inhibited by zzso binding protein 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso was observed when they were zzso zzso growth factor zzso induced zzso formation in zzso zzso However, transient expression of zzso suppressed zzso zzso formation by zzso zzso in the zzso These results indicate that zzso regulates zzso of zzso thus zzso regulating the function of zzso in the zzso
