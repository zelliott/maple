zzso is an zzso protein serving as an electron transport intermediate for two zzso zzso zzso zzso We have cloned and zzso three human adrenal zzso zzso The longest zzso region was 131 bases long, and the coding zzso identical in all three zzso predict a zzso of 180 zzso zzso The zzso regions were zzso zzso and zzso bases long due to the presence of alternate zzso zzso zzso transfer blots showed multiple size species of zzso zzso consistent with finding multiple zzso zzso Similar sized zzso zzso species are found abundantly in the adrenal and zzso and to a lesser degree in zzso from human fetal brain, zzso zzso zzso liver, and zzso as well as in cultured zzso suggesting the same or a very similar zzso protein is found in zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells, a transformed zzso line of zzso origin, accumulate zzso for zzso zzso (the zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso when zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso D to such cultures blocked zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso or zzso to such cultures substantially reduced zzso levels and markedly attenuated the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso but zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in additive and zzso fashions, zzso These data indicate that the zzso synthesis of the zzso machinery is not wholly dependent on zzso protein zzso
