zzso zzso zzso zzso of the binding of zzso zzso and zzso derivatives of zzso zzso to the basic zzso from winged bean zzso zzso zzso I, have been carried zzso Each of the zzso binding to zzso I displayed the same zzso of one per zzso (29 zzso of zzso zzso The binding zzso for various derivatives are essentially independent of temperature and show complementary changes with respect to binding zzso Replacement of the zzso group by zzso or hydrogen on zzso and C4 of the zzso eliminates binding to the zzso consistent with zzso and zzso acting as hydrogen bond zzso The affinity for C2 derivatives of zzso decreases in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with Gal zzso zzso which suggests that both polar and zzso zzso surround the C2 locus of zzso consistent with the observed high affinity of zzso I toward zzso where the zzso group at C2 position is probably stabilized by both zzso interactions with the zzso group and polar interactions with the zzso zzso The binding of zzso derivatives follows the order Gal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso indicating the presence of zzso polar interactions with a hydrogen bond donor in the zzso On the basis of these results the hydrogen bond zzso relationship of the zzso of zzso with the primary combining site of zzso I is zzso
