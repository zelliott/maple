Type 1 diabetes in the zzso diabetic zzso mouse arises as a consequence of T zzso destruction of the zzso beta cells of the zzso Although little is known of the events that initiate and subsequently drive zzso destruction it is clear that the entire process is under complex genetic zzso At present 19 zzso have been mapped that influence the development of diabetes either at the level of initiation of zzso or at the level of progression from zzso to overt diabetes, or zzso Previously, we have mapped one of these zzso zzso to a zzso zzso on zzso mouse zzso zzso In the present study we have narrowed the map position of this locus to an zzso of zzso zzso by a combination of novel zzso strains and an ancestral zzso analysis zzso We have constructed a physical zzso in bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones across the minimal zzso zzso mapping of the zzso zzso placed the maximum size of the zzso zzso at zzso zzso between the markers zzso and zzso To refine further the zzso zzso we developed a series of novel single zzso zzso zzso and carried out zzso analysis on DNA from mouse strains known to carry either zzso zzso or protective zzso This zzso analysis identified a zzso segment of ancestral DNA between the zzso marker zzso and the zzso zzso One zzso of this ancestral segment of DNA is found in mouse strains carrying an zzso zzso zzso and another is found in mouse strains carrying an zzso protective zzso Within the zzso zzso defined zzso this zzso segment represents the most likely location for zzso The zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso 2 zzso maps to this zzso and is a strong candidate for zzso To investigate whether sequence variation exists in the promoter region of the zzso zzso which might alter its zzso we zzso the promoter region of the zzso gene from mouse strains carrying either an zzso zzso or resistance zzso Two sequence zzso were identified, neither of which fell in known regulatory elements within the zzso zzso In agreement with this observation zzso zzso zzso levels showed no variation between susceptible and resistant mouse zzso These data suggest that the profound protection from diabetes seen in zzso mice carrying an zzso protective zzso is unlikely to be due to differences in the level of expression of the zzso zzso Instead, all of the current data support our hypothesis that zzso zzso to zzso acid variation at the zzso zzso of zzso
