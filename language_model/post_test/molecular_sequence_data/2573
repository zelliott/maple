A strategy, called zzso zzso was used to identify specific side chains in human growth hormone zzso that strongly zzso binding to the zzso zzso cloned from human zzso Single zzso zzso (62 in total) were introduced at every zzso contained within the three zzso segments of zzso zzso 2 to 19, 54 to 74, and 167 to zzso that have been implicated in zzso zzso The zzso scan revealed a cluster of a dozen large side chains that when zzso to zzso each showed more than a four times lower binding affinity to the zzso zzso Many of these zzso that promote binding to the zzso zzso are altered in zzso of zzso (such as zzso zzso and zzso that do not bind tightly to the zzso zzso The overall folding of these zzso proteins was indistinguishable from that of the zzso zzso as determined by strong zzso with seven different zzso sensitive zzso zzso The zzso scan also identified at least one side chain, zzso that hindered binding because when it was zzso to zzso the zzso affinity increased by more than a factor of zzso
