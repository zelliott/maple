zzso zzso expresses a set of zzso zzso by the zzso gene zzso In this report a structure model is proposed for a cloned member of the zzso the zzso zzso The structure consists of an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso interconnected by an zzso The zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso binds to zzso in a selective zzso Six synthetic zzso peptides from the zzso adhere onto the surface of zzso cells and two of these peptides specifically inhibit the zzso interaction, indicating that they are the zzso sites of the zzso Thus, zzso and other related members of the family appear to be good candidates to play an important role in zzso zzso infection via a zzso zzso zzso zzso
