zzso cryptic deletions of the zzso band of human zzso 22 have been associated with a number of psychiatric and zzso zzso including zzso Here we report the isolation and characterization of zzso a human zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso responsible for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is localized at zzso zzso in a region deleted in some psychiatric zzso We also isolated the mouse zzso of zzso zzso identified a zzso in this gene in the zzso zzso mouse strain and found that these mice have a deficit in zzso gating accompanied by regional zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gating is a neural filtering process that allows attention to be focused on a given zzso and is affected in patients with zzso zzso Furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that zzso may serve as a zzso of synaptic transmission in the zzso zzso Our zzso in conjunction with the zzso location of zzso suggest a potential involvement of this gene in the zzso psychiatric and zzso zzso
