The cell division cycle of the zzso zzso zzso is driven by one zzso zzso zzso which becomes active when bound to one of nine zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso proteins is essential for a full understanding of the cell zzso Here, we report the results of a targeted zzso study using affinity zzso coupled to mass zzso Our study identified numerous proteins in association with particular zzso zzso These included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Some associations were previously known, and for others, we confirmed their specificity and biological zzso Using a zzso mass zzso approach, we also mapped in zzso zzso at zzso consensus zzso peptides within several zzso candidate zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that this approach can be used to detect a host of transient and dynamic protein associations within a biological zzso
