zzso type II receptors zzso including zzso and zzso are zzso zzso receptors that form complexes with type I receptors to transmit zzso signaling of zzso zzso myostatin and a subset of bone zzso zzso zzso are unique among zzso zzso receptors in that they associate with proteins having zzso zzso large and zzso zzso zzso In our previous studies, we reported specific interactions of zzso with two independent zzso proteins named zzso zzso proteins 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso reduce zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation of two zzso of zzso named zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso recognize zzso zzso of zzso that match a zzso consensus zzso zzso and its zzso have one zzso domain in the zzso region, and interact with zzso Although zzso zzso containing zzso motifs of zzso and zzso are identical to that of zzso their zzso sequences differ from that of zzso Interestingly, unlike zzso zzso of zzso or zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso actions of zzso on zzso zzso zzso is widely distributed in mouse zzso zzso is expressed in more restricted zzso such as heart, brain, zzso and zzso Our results indicate that although both zzso and zzso interact with zzso zzso they regulate zzso function in a different zzso
