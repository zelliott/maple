zzso studies have implicated important roles for the basic zzso zzso factor zzso in the development of both zzso and zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Early zzso zzso expression is observed in developing zzso and in zzso pancreatic zzso Analysis of zzso and insulin expression reveals a population of zzso precursors that, throughout early development, are temporally and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso confirms early divergence of these zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso lack differentiated zzso zzso but maintain normal differentiation and organization of the principal zzso In addition to the zzso zzso zzso zzso also reduces the prevalence of a small population of anterior zzso cells normally found outside the principal zzso Together, these findings suggest the presence of distinct zzso and zzso precursor populations in developing zzso zzso
