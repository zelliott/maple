To gain a more detailed understanding of the molecular structure of the zzso genes in Australian zzso the zzso zzso sequences of the DR B zzso were determined in an zzso who was tissue typed as zzso and a probable zzso zzso zzso Both peripheral blood zzso and a zzso cell line were zzso with the majority of zzso zzso but also with half of the zzso zzso With the use of zzso specific for the zzso regions zzso the first domain, the zzso chain reaction technique was used to amplify zzso synthesis products prepared from the cell zzso Two distinct zzso sequences were zzso One was virtually identical to the reported zzso sequence present in an Asian zzso differing only by a single silent zzso substitution at the third position of zzso 36 (A to zzso A second zzso zzso was closely related to two recently published and nearly identical sequences for zzso with zzso acid differences at positions 67 and 85 of the first zzso zzso zzso studies on this cell line using the zzso I restriction zzso indicated bands previously described for the zzso and zzso zzso
