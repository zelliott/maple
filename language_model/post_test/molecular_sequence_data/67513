High molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso by the genes at zzso zzso in wheat and its related species, are significant in the determination of grain processing zzso However, the diversity and variations of zzso are relatively low in bread zzso More interests are now focused on wheat wild relatives in zzso The zzso zzso represents an important zzso for novel zzso and other useful genes for wheat genetic zzso 

Six novel zzso zzso and zzso were identified and characterized from three species of zzso section zzso zzso zzso Both open reading frames zzso and promoter regions of these zzso zzso were zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso genes are approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although the primary structures of zzso zzso are similar to those of previously reported ones, all six zzso or zzso zzso have the large zzso zzso Our comparative analyses of the deduced zzso acid sequences verified that zzso section zzso species zzso novel zzso with their molecular weights larger than almost all other known zzso The zzso promoter sequences share the high zzso among S zzso Our zzso analyses by both network and NJ tree indicated that there is a close zzso evolutionary relationship of zzso and zzso zzso between S and D zzso 

The large molecular weight of zzso from S zzso is a unique feature identified in this zzso Such large zzso are resulted from the zzso of repetitive zzso in zzso zzso The unequal crossover events are the most likely mechanism of variations in zzso zzso The S zzso zzso zzso and zzso have independent origins, although they share similar evolutionary zzso As zzso play a key role in wheat baking quality, these large zzso zzso zzso can be used as special genetic resources for wheat quality zzso
