We studied the growth of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using a fluorescent dye zzso zzso which zzso growing zzso zzso but does not stain other zzso zzso We used a zzso culture of zzso zzso that was synchronized by silicon zzso zzso zzso was performed in two different ways with cells stained by the addition of zzso acid and the zzso Individual cells immobilized on glass were observed during the first zzso zzso following the zzso of zzso acid after silicon zzso zzso we examined cells of a batch culture at time intervals during 36 h after the zzso of zzso acid using zzso and zzso zzso The addition of zzso acid and zzso resulted in the rapid zzso zzso formation of several dozen green fluorescent zzso particles zzso in the zzso which was accompanied by the zzso of fluorescent zzso inside zzso deposition zzso zzso along their full zzso In zzso zzso zzso disappeared from the zzso zzso zzso valves were formed within the zzso during the subsequent zzso zzso In the next 8-10 zzso zzso appeared again in the zzso of daughter zzso The data obtained confirm observations about the zzso mechanism of silicon zzso which includes rapid silicon zzso zzso zzso followed by slow zzso zzso It is likely that the observed zzso are silicon transport zzso which were first proposed by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso
