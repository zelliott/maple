We report here the isolation of zzso zzso in cultured cells of zzso zzso line zzso zzso zzso zzso of cultured alfalfa cells due to zzso of protein synthesis on the zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistant to zzso zzso were identified by their ability to form green shoots on plant zzso medium containing selective zzso zzso in the range of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene revealed that zzso resistance is due to zzso in a zzso stem structure of the zzso zzso zzso plants transferred to the greenhouse developed normally and produced zzso seed zzso In light of their absence in zzso a related zzso plant, the isolation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was zzso The new zzso are useful for the study of zzso zzso as demonstrated by detection of predominantly paternal zzso inheritance in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and can be used as selective markers in zzso transformation zzso to obtain zzso zzso
