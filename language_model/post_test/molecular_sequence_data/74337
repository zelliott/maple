We have shown that the zzso of the South American zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a long-lasting zzso effect zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Despite being zzso by zzso zzso prolonged treatment with the zzso zzso does not cause the development of peripheral tolerance or zzso symptoms upon zzso In the present study, we have isolated and chemically characterized a novel and potent zzso zzso responsible for the oral zzso activity of this zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of this zzso designated zzso was determined by mass zzso and zzso by zzso synthesis to be zzso where zzso is zzso acid and the two zzso zzso forming a zzso zzso This zzso zzso sequence is identical to the zzso sequence of zzso a zzso component of this snake zzso zzso when orally administered zzso zzso zzso effect in the zzso zzso and zzso mechanical zzso models in rats and in the zzso test in zzso zzso was also effective when administered by intravenous zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In the mechanical zzso models, zzso shows a long-lasting (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, did not alter the zzso effect of the zzso whereas zzso an zzso of zzso zzso blocked this zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso of zzso receptors and may contribute to the zzso effect of the zzso zzso
