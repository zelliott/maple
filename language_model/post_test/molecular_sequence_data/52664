Upon characterization of zzso a gene mapping to the zzso syndrome critical region and at its zzso similar to the zzso zzso group zzso we identified a novel protein domain designated zzso zzso To gain insight into its structure, evolutionary conservation and its potential functional role, we performed database searches to identify other zzso zzso zzso We retrieved 39 zzso and a multiple alignment shows that the domain spans some 70 zzso zzso It is present in proteins of nuclear origin and plays a role in cell growth and zzso Due to its position, the composition of zzso acids close to the zzso motif and the pattern of other zzso present, we zzso that the domain is involved in zzso zzso
