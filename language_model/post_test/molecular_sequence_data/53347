zzso zzso transgenic T cells recognize two zzso zzso a foreign zzso bovine zzso zzso on zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso Because the latter recognition event zzso a disease closely resembling human zzso arthritis, we investigated the structural basis of this zzso zzso dual zzso While zzso recognition is altered to a minor degree between the zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso critically depends upon a zzso contact zzso completely zzso in the foreign and self zzso Further, the altered recognition of zzso derives from discrete differences on the zzso recognition surfaces and not the disparate binding zzso This work provides a detailed structural comparison of an zzso zzso interactions with naturally occurring peptides on distinct zzso zzso The capacity to interact with multiple zzso in this manner increases the number of potentially zzso zzso available to a T zzso
