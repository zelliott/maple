To zzso the role of zzso zzso produced in zzso as part of the pathological response of zzso arthritis zzso we studied zzso production and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso and its effects on zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso production by zzso zzso cells was estimated by zzso Western zzso analysis, and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso cells and local production of zzso were estimated by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso 

zzso enhanced zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso and production of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso treatment of zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso enhances total zzso activity in the zzso zzso was exclusively expressed on zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso into the zzso in patients with zzso Both zzso zzso T zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso cells zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acts as a zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso cells by zzso induced rapid zzso of zzso from zzso into zzso of zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso regulation of zzso zzso cell functions by zzso affects zzso zzso of zzso release, such as zzso inhibited proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings emphasize the importance of zzso locally produced by zzso T zzso for zzso zzso cell functions in zzso and suggest possible clinical application of zzso zzso
