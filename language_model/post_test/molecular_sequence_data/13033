zzso zzso to 3' zzso the counterpart of the human zzso and zzso zzso zzso performs zzso zzso of both zzso and DNA and is implicated in Okazaki zzso processing and DNA zzso The zzso for zzso activity is a primer zzso to a template but with a zzso zzso zzso The results presented here demonstrate that the zzso must enter the zzso end of the zzso tail and then slide to the region of zzso where the zzso zzso The presence of bound protein or a primer at any point on the zzso tail prevents zzso However, zzso of a zzso at the zzso end or internal to the tail does not prevent zzso The sliding process is zzso If the zzso slides onto the tail, later binding of a primer to the tail traps the zzso between the primer binding site and the zzso site, preventing the zzso from departing from the zzso zzso A model for zzso entry, zzso and zzso is zzso The possible role of this unusual mechanism in Okazaki zzso processing, DNA repair, and protection of the replication fork from inappropriate zzso zzso is zzso
