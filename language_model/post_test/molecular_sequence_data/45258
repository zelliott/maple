zzso is a fundamental cellular event in membrane retrieval after zzso and in the regulation of zzso signal zzso In contrast to the well-studied zzso membrane recycling, little is known about the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso receptors in zzso Here we investigated the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in rat sensory zzso using a membrane zzso zzso The time constant of zzso zzso of zzso was determined as zzso zzso The zzso zzso was blocked by zzso against zzso zzso and zzso However, block of zzso was without zzso The zzso zzso was confirmed independently by a single zzso image technique using a zzso zzso Finally, the receptors were zzso in response to zzso as determined by zzso zzso We conclude that zzso binding leads to rapid zzso in the zzso of rat zzso root zzso zzso
