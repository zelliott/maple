A mouse liver zzso zzso zzso coding for a zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso clone zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso Based upon its predicted zzso acid zzso this clone was assumed to belong to the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed 94, 84, 83, and zzso identity with zzso of rats, zzso rabbits and humans, respectively, while it showed only zzso identity with human zzso and zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso and zzso and guinea-pig zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the mouse zzso was also expressed in the lung and kidney and to lesser zzso in the heart, zzso zzso and zzso Mouse zzso expressed in zzso showed activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso associated with the zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso a substance known to induce a zzso syndrome in zzso was also zzso by the mouse zzso The zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso were determined to be zzso zzso 435 zzso zzso This is the first report to show that an expressed zzso can metabolize a zzso zzso
