The zzso toxin zzso by zzso zzso is considered to be an important zzso factor in the zzso of zzso zzso disease and gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso structures and can form zzso membrane zzso The goal of this study was to characterize zzso interactions that may mediate assembly of zzso zzso into higher order zzso We investigated potential interactions between two zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions were detected in this system, whereas zzso and zzso interactions were not zzso Several zzso proteins containing internal deletion zzso were unable to interact with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Introduction of these same deletion zzso into the zzso zzso zzso gene resulted in zzso of zzso zzso proteins that failed to assemble into large zzso structures and that lacked zzso toxic activity for zzso zzso Additional mapping studies in the zzso zzso system indicated that only the zzso portion of the zzso domain is required for zzso zzso To characterize further zzso zzso we engineered an zzso zzso strain that produced a zzso toxin containing an zzso zzso site located between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in complete zzso of zzso into zzso and zzso zzso which remained physically associated within zzso structures and retained zzso zzso zzso These results provide evidence that interactions between zzso and zzso zzso play an important role in zzso assembly into zzso zzso
