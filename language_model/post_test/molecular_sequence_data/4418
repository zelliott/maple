zzso from 10 patients infected with zzso zzso were used in Western zzso analysis of zzso protein preparations of zzso zzso All 10 zzso were zzso with a protein zzso of 116 zzso zzso from another 17 patients were used in Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 of these zzso were zzso with the 116 zzso zzso zzso zzso of whole zzso zzso cells demonstrated the surface location of this zzso zzso of DNA which contained the gene for this protein identified an zzso of zzso zzso zzso a protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso for the 116 zzso protein had zzso zzso identity with the zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso An zzso which was identified zzso to the 116 zzso protein zzso coded for a 16 zzso protein and had zzso zzso identity with the zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso identity with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso detected a zzso zzso transcript with a single initiation site zzso to the zzso zzso the 16 zzso zzso The coding sequences for both the 16 zzso protein and the 116 zzso protein were present in this transcript, indicating that they were part of an zzso and suggesting a possible functional zzso
