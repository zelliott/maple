Rapid evolution of zzso zzso zzso gene promoters often prevents their recognition in a foreign zzso Unlike animal systems, we show that foreign plant zzso gene promoters are recognized in an alien species, but tend to program zzso by a different zzso In plants, zzso zzso I transcripts initiate at a zzso element zzso is zzso important for promoter strength and zzso zzso However, transcripts initiate from zzso following zzso of a tomato promoter into zzso The zzso gene promoter of a more closely related species, zzso zzso programs both zzso and zzso zzso A point zzso at zzso improving the identity between the zzso and zzso promoters increases zzso transcription, indicating a role for the zzso element in zzso zzso zzso transcripts can be translated to express a zzso reporter zzso implicating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that disrupt zzso protein zzso interactions inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins bearing zzso zzso restore zzso zzso and zzso activity, suggesting a direct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is unaffected by the zzso zzso suggesting that in the context of pol I recognition, the zzso zzso element serves a function other than zzso zzso
