zzso expressed zzso are linked to the regulation of zzso and/or tumor suppression genes within the cell signal zzso zzso network, thereby contributing to zzso zzso function can be zzso thus representing a novel zzso approach for integrated cancer zzso In this study, we designed zzso zzso that functionally zzso the expression of zzso and zzso which are related to glioblastoma, to overcome the low efficiency of gene zzso In addition, we generated novel zzso whose 3' ends were zzso in the region complementary to the target zzso zzso seed region to reduce the stability of binding with the zzso Various zzso levels of zzso were zzso classic zzso yielded the greatest reduction in zzso levels, followed by zzso zzso and the blank control, as determined by zzso These results were confirmed by the protein expression of zzso the validated target of zzso the effect on cell cycle arrest in zzso phase, and the impact on cell zzso These results suggested that we could produce zzso zzso by zzso that zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso and that the level of repression and the effect on the function of a specific zzso could be achieved in a zzso zzso
