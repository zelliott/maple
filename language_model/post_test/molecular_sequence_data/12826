Previously, we reported that a synthetic zzso zzso and its zzso have potent zzso activities against both zzso and zzso zzso Here we examined the mode of action of zzso with special reference to its effect on bacterial zzso We found that both the outer and inner membrane of zzso coli become permeable to low molecular mass substances when treated with this zzso Under these conditions, the bacteria lost the ability to zzso zzso and to transport zzso suggesting that their zzso membrane potential was zzso This zzso appears to form numerous channels in bacterial zzso that interfere with membrane functions, resulting in cell zzso
