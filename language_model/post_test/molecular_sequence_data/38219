zzso protein zzso zzso folding of the 16 S zzso 3' major domain, which ultimately forms the head of the 30 S zzso zzso Recent crystal structures indicate that zzso lies on the interface side of the 30 S zzso near the zzso binding sites of the zzso To map the functional surface of zzso we have zzso the protein with a zzso zzso A recognition site and engineered zzso zzso that target each exposed, zzso zzso We have also deleted zzso features of zzso using its structure to guide our zzso By zzso the tag sequence using zzso zzso A, we are able to track the zzso of each zzso protein into 30 zzso 70 zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso a growth zzso and we observe a striking correlation between this zzso and proficiency in 30 S zzso assembly among our collection of zzso We find that the side chain of zzso is required for efficient assembly of zzso into 30 S zzso in zzso whereas those of at least 17 other zzso exposed zzso are not zzso In addition, an zzso zzso lacking the zzso 17 zzso causes zzso to accumulate on zzso to zzso high levels, indicating that our approach can yield interesting zzso zzso
