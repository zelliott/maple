Using data derived from zzso sequencing of zzso a protein zzso induced during zzso nerve zzso in zzso we have isolated zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a goldfish zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein comprises 411 zzso zzso possesses a zzso of zzso and shows significant zzso to the zzso zzso marker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated, by both Northern zzso analysis and zzso protection zzso to be induced as much as zzso in zzso goldfish zzso at 20 days after nerve zzso Analysis of total zzso samples from various zzso showed a broad distribution of zzso zzso with the highest levels observed in zzso zzso The data obtained strongly suggest that zzso is identical or very similar to zzso The molecular cloning of zzso provides the means for a more detailed analysis of its function in nerve zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso and zzso suggests that further investigation may provide additional insight into the role of these proteins in the nervous zzso
