The Oct and Sox zzso factors control many different aspects of neural development and zzso often binding to adjacent sites on DNA, and interacting with one another through their DNA binding zzso to regulate zzso zzso Oct proteins contain two DNA binding zzso zzso and zzso connected by a flexible zzso which interact with DNA in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso complex reveal that the two zzso are characterized by distinct alignment zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso We show that this difference is due to a fast microscopic zzso process involving alternative binding modes for the weaker binding zzso domain in the zzso zzso Upon binding of zzso to an adjacent site in the zzso regulatory element, all components of the zzso zzso complex share a single alignment zzso Thus zzso complex formation increases the zzso affinity of zzso for DNA by effectively zzso the zzso domain in a single orientation on the zzso The solution zzso structure of the zzso 42 zzso zzso complex, determined by novel procedures based on zzso restraints from zzso zzso and zzso rigid zzso angle zzso reveals that zzso and zzso interact through a predominantly zzso zzso surrounded by a ring of zzso zzso These observations suggest a mechanism of zzso control involving direct zzso interactions on the DNA zzso zzso in conjunction with a zzso zzso factor provide zzso zzso zzso
