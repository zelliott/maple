The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and zzso The corresponding gene was zzso and compared with its zzso zzso from the same zzso The zzso were found to differ in zzso zzso molecular mass and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso consisting of two zzso zzso with strict specificity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and has a presumed function of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The zzso zzso supplies the zzso with zzso for further zzso processes linked with zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed the existence of two distinct families of these zzso in nature, which differ in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the small zzso family that occurs almost exclusively in zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso displays a close relationship with the large zzso family of the zzso which is found in zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso The zzso origin of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests an occurrence of horizontal gene transfer from a zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso The presence of both zzso and zzso type of zzso zzso in different compartments of a single zzso cell appears to be unique in zzso
