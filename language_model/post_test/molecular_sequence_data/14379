In higher zzso replication program zzso in different cell types remains to be fully zzso We show for seven human cell lines that about half of the zzso is divided in zzso that display a characteristic zzso replication timing profile with early initiation zones at borders and late replication at zzso zzso overlap is observed between zzso of different cell lines and also with zzso replication zzso exhibiting a zzso zzso compositional zzso From the demonstration that the average fork polarity is directly reflected by both the compositional skew and the zzso of the replication timing profile, we argue that the fact that this zzso displays a zzso in zzso sustains the existence of large-scale zzso of replication fork polarity in zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso interaction zzso and zzso marker data reveals that zzso zzso to zzso zzso structural zzso We discuss possible models for replication origin zzso within zzso The zzso of the zzso into replication zzso provides new insights on the organization of the replication program in the human zzso
