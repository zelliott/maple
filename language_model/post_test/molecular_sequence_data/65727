zzso bacteria residing in the zzso chambers of zzso zzso larvae may be useful in zzso approaches to reduce zzso zzso activities on agricultural zzso We compared the bacterial community profiles associated with the zzso walls of individual zzso zzso zzso larvae over 2 years and those associated with their plant root food source among different geographic zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis was used with universal and zzso zzso zzso zzso to reveal a number of zzso that were found consistently in all zzso zzso larvae but not in samples from their food source, zzso zzso These zzso included representatives from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and were related to previously described bacteria from the zzso of other zzso larvae and zzso These universally distributed zzso have the potential to form vertically transmitted symbiotic associations with these zzso
