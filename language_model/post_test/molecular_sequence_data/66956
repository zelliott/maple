The enrichment of open reading frames zzso from large gene libraries and the presentation of the corresponding zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently used to identify binding partners of unknown zzso In particular zzso display is a valuable tool for the identification of zzso zzso and a first step for the development of new zzso and zzso Here, we introduce a significant improvement of zzso zzso enrichment by using zzso a zzso with a truncated zzso The methods allow both the enrichment of zzso from zzso libraries and the display of the corresponding zzso on zzso thus combining zzso enrichment with a screening for binding in one step without any further zzso zzso We demonstrated the benefits of the method by zzso the sequences zzso two predicted zzso zzso of the outer membrane protein D zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso Here, we showed that when using a mixture of three zzso with only one containing an zzso solely this correct construct could be zzso in zzso zzso zzso both zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating correct translation of fusion zzso Furthermore, the enrichment system was evaluated by the enrichment of zzso from total zzso of zzso Here, we could show that zzso of the zzso contained zzso which is an increase of an order of magnitude compared with conventional zzso expression zzso Together these data show that the zzso enrichment system significantly improves the enrichment of zzso and directly allows the display of the corresponding zzso on zzso zzso
