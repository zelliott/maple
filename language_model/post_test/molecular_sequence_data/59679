A zzso substance zzso that was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso migrated as proteins of about 300 and 45 zzso upon sodium zzso zzso gel zzso under reducing zzso In this study, we cloned the gene zzso the zzso protein and predicted its structure and zzso Based on the zzso zzso acid zzso sequence of this zzso we cloned the region for its zzso We cloned the entire gene by means of gene walking using zzso chain reaction and Southern zzso The zzso sequences of cloned fragments revealed an open reading frame zzso a zzso of 330 zzso zzso zzso This zzso displayed high zzso to those of zzso of zzso zzso Using the zzso system, the zzso protein was produced in zzso zzso Our results suggested that the zzso protein of zzso zzso is a component of the zzso complex, and that it is the major outer membrane zzso
