zzso sodium channels zzso are essential to the normal function of the zzso nervous zzso zzso function of zzso zzso a variety of disorders, including zzso zzso and zzso A large number of animal toxins target these zzso channels and may have significant therapeutic zzso Most of these zzso however, have not been characterized in zzso Here, by combining patch clamp zzso and zzso binding studies with zzso zzso zzso structure determination, and molecular zzso we have revealed key molecular zzso of the interaction between the zzso toxin zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Nine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were important for block of zzso and zzso zzso molecular dynamics simulations and zzso studies indicated that folding was normal for several key zzso suggesting that these zzso acids probably make specific interactions with sodium channel zzso Additionally, we identified several zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are involved in zzso zzso zzso Our structural and functional data were used to model the zzso of zzso into the domain II zzso sensor of zzso The model predicts that a zzso patch composed of zzso and zzso along with the basic zzso zzso zzso into a groove formed by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results provide new insight into the structural and molecular basis of sodium channel block by zzso and may provide a basis for the rational design of zzso peptides with improved zzso potency and/or zzso
