The crystal structure of the zzso binding domain of the zzso the zzso group II zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso The core resembles the zzso domain of zzso but lacks the zzso zzso implied in binding of zzso to group I zzso Rather, a large zzso surface patch is found in a novel zzso zzso which is characteristic of all group II zzso including the zzso zzso zzso Models of the zzso which are consistent with zzso electron zzso data, suggest a dual role of this zzso zzso in zzso binding and controlling access to the central cavity independent of a zzso zzso
