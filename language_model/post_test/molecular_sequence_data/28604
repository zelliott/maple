zzso of major zzso class I zzso molecules is a viral strategy for survival in the zzso zzso virus, a member of the zzso family responsible for rabbit zzso can zzso the expression of zzso zzso but the viral zzso has not been zzso We cloned and characterized a gene coding for an zzso zzso zzso protein containing an zzso zinc finger and two zzso zzso which we called zzso virus zzso protein zzso zzso zzso surface zzso and zzso molecules upon zzso the mechanism probably involves an zzso of zzso and was lost when the zzso retention signal was zzso In addition, the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso target cells was significantly reduced, revealing a strong correlation between zzso zzso by zzso and zzso killing in zzso In zzso experiments with a knockout virus showed that zzso is a zzso factor, potentially involved in the zzso characteristic of zzso Data bank analysis revealed that zzso has zzso in zzso and other zzso We propose the name zzso to define a new group of zzso surface cellular zzso zzso zzso The zzso of cell surface molecules by zzso probably helps protect infected cells during viral zzso
