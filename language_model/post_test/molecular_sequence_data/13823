The control of zzso synthesis in response to both zzso and zzso signals has been a subject of interest to microbial zzso for nearly four decades, beginning with the observations that zzso zzso cells grown on rich medium are larger and contain more zzso than those grown on poor zzso This was followed shortly by the discovery of the stringent response in zzso coli, which has continued to be the zzso of choice for the study of zzso zzso In this review, we zzso four general areas of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso stringent control, growth rate regulation, upstream zzso and zzso We also cite similar mechanisms in other bacteria and zzso The separation of growth zzso control of zzso synthesis from stringent control continues to be a subject of zzso One model holds that the zzso zzso is the key zzso for both mechanisms, while another school holds that it is unlikely that zzso or any other single zzso is solely responsible for growth zzso zzso Recent studies on zzso of zzso synthesis by zzso upstream sequences has led to the discovery of a new class of promoters that make contact with zzso zzso at a third position, called the UP element, in addition to the well-known zzso and zzso zzso Lastly, clues as to the role of zzso in zzso zzso have begun to zzso zzso complexes modified at the zzso site appear to zzso faster and are resistant to the zzso effects of zzso during the stringent zzso
