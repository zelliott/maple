zzso zzso promoters zzso and zzso direct zzso synthesis in divergent zzso from start sites 82 base pairs zzso We had previously determined that the presence on the same DNA zzso of a wild type zzso promoter zzso with the zzso of the zzso zzso The results reported here concern the effects of changing the distance between the start sites by zzso or deletion of 5 or 10 base zzso Three different techniques zzso transcription, gel mobility shift, and zzso zzso were employed to monitor complex formation at zzso Unexpectedly we find that deletion of 10 base pairs between the start sites zzso the zzso whereas zzso of 10 base pairs does zzso zzso of 5 base pairs, however, essentially prevents joint complex formation at zzso and zzso These findings suggest several ways in which for the wild type separation of the two promoters the zzso of zzso could be affected by an zzso zzso at zzso In addition to direct zzso zzso these include the obstruction of access to DNA sites necessary for optimal contact with the zzso zzso
