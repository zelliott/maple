zzso zzso zzso name) and zzso zzso are closely zzso zzso similar marine bacteria that form zzso zzso with marine zzso Despite their zzso however, these bacteria can be distinguished zzso by sequence divergence of their zzso zzso zzso by the presence zzso zzso or the absence zzso zzso of zzso and, as shown here, by the sequence divergence of genes involved in the synthesis of zzso zzso To gain insight into the possibility that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are ecologically zzso we used these zzso criteria to determine the zzso of zzso zzso as a zzso zzso of marine zzso Five fish species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to harbor zzso zzso in their light zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso together as zzso of the same light zzso Regardless of zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and it was the apparently exclusive zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was found to be the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and it appears to be the exclusive zzso of other zzso zzso and a zzso zzso A zzso test for zzso revealed no evidence of zzso between zzso zzso and its host fishes, indicating that zzso apparently is not the basis for this zzso host zzso These results, which are the first report of bacterial zzso in fish light zzso and the first demonstration that zzso zzso is not the exclusive light organ zzso of zzso fishes, demonstrate that the host species ranges of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are substantially zzso The host range difference underscores possible differences in the environmental zzso and zzso of these two bacterial zzso
