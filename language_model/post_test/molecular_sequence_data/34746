Surface characterization of peptides may provide useful information about functionality and potential interactions with other zzso A description of a protein site through a surface that models the shape zzso by the exposed zzso is an effective tool for the analysis and the modeling of proteins that may highlight similarities and relationships not zzso through comparisons at level of primary, secondary, and zzso zzso This study concerns the development of a tool that extracts the zzso that zzso to the shape modeling of the surface of a protein or a portion of zzso This task is accomplished without taking into account the order of the zzso acids in the primary structure, but only according to the selection of a portion of the protein indicated through geometric parameters or an explicit list of zzso acids belonging to the site of zzso Both in the case of an entire protein and in the case of a portion of it, the method provides the mesh that models the surface described by the exposed zzso that constitute the external zzso The developed tool which allows the extraction of the exposed zzso and thus of the potential function zzso is applied to identify the zzso acids that zzso to the structural interaction in several protein zzso
