We determined the zzso status of six zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by using the results of zzso zzso gene sequence and cellular fatty acid composition zzso zzso analysis clustered these species closely with the zzso zzso Like the zzso species, the six zzso species contained zzso fatty acid as a major cellular fatty zzso The use of a specific zzso primer designed for zzso the zzso zzso from other members of the zzso showed that the six zzso species had the same amplified zzso zzso gene zzso as members of the zzso zzso Based on these observations and other zzso zzso the six zzso species were transferred to the zzso zzso In addition, we propose zzso of the zzso zzso
