The molecular basis for the recruitment of maternal zzso after zzso is poorly zzso since there is little information available regarding the identity of such zzso An zzso based on reverse zzso and zzso was used to identify a maternal zzso that zzso a transient zzso after zzso the length of the zzso tail increases from zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso egg to approximately 250 3 h after zzso and then decreases to about 180 around the time of zzso formation, that is 7 h after zzso The DNA sequence of this zzso which encodes the zzso signal zzso contains a zzso sequence that may serve as the zzso zzso element observed in other maternal zzso that are recruited after zzso
