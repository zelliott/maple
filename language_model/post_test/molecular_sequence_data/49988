We have characterized a cluster of single zzso variable zzso domain receptors zzso of the major zzso complex zzso on human zzso zzso In addition to triggering zzso expressed on zzso cells zzso and zzso the cluster contains zzso a triggering zzso whose expression is limited to zzso zzso We identified three new related genes and two gene fragments within a cluster of approximately 200 zzso Two of the three new genes lack charged zzso in their zzso domain zzso Further, one of the genes contains two potential zzso zzso motifs in its zzso tail, suggesting that it delivers zzso zzso The human and mouse zzso clusters appear to have zzso such that there are unique sequences in each zzso Finally, each gene in the zzso cluster was expressed in a different range of cell zzso
