zzso immunity plays a crucial role in host defenses against zzso zzso zzso zzso the identification of zzso zzso capable of producing zzso responses, such as zzso hypersensitivity zzso zzso may be useful in the development of zzso strategies to control zzso In order to characterize zzso zzso culture zzso from the zzso zzso strain were separated by zzso zzso After further zzso by zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso a zzso protein with an apparent molecular mass of 25 zzso was found to produce zzso as evidenced by increased zzso swelling in mice zzso with culture zzso relative to zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the zzso protein was used to search data of the zzso zzso Genome zzso Based on the zzso DNA zzso a DNA probe was used to screen a zzso zzso library prepared from strain zzso zzso were isolated containing the full-length gene zzso which showed zzso with a number of zzso zzso from zzso and zzso The zzso zzso protein expressed in zzso coli was similar to the natural one in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso with either the natural or the zzso protein prolonged survival and decreased zzso burden in mice challenged with the highly virulent zzso zzso strain zzso In conclusion, we have described the first zzso gene whose product, a zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to induce protective immunity zzso
