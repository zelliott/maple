The zzso virus zzso a zzso immune response associated with zzso specific for the fusion zzso To map the linear zzso recognition sites of the fusion zzso protein of the zzso virus, we have reacted a complete set of 108 overlapping zzso with zzso zzso obtained from donor zzso with elevated zzso zzso The zzso recognized about zzso of the peptides and generated a characteristic binding pattern, defining about 6 or 7 distinctive regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which include the major zzso segment zzso of the zzso region and the zzso zzso zzso The binding sites were located in close proximity of the few zzso defined T cell zzso This pairing of T and B cell zzso was zzso by zzso T cell zzso The significance of a zzso association of T and B cell zzso for processing and presentation is zzso It is speculated that in long-term immunity against zzso zzso zzso B cells of the same zzso specificity play an important role both as zzso presenting cells and as zzso producing zzso In contrast to human zzso from late zzso donors, mouse and rabbit zzso zzso with high zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso specific zzso zzso did not react with the zzso
