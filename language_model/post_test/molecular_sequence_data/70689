We have used zzso zzso based on the crystal structure of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso to obtain the three-dimensional structures of rat zzso and rat zzso zzso bound to zzso The resulting models highlight two zzso at positions 208 and zzso that could be important for zzso either directly or zzso zzso specificity for zzso among the zzso zzso zzso at these positions were zzso in human zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso in the active rat zzso to those in the inactive zzso and in the inactive human zzso and rat zzso to those in the active rat zzso These studies show clearly that, in all three zzso an zzso zzso at position 208 is a prerequisite for high activity in zzso zzso although this alone is not zzso other zzso in the vicinity, particularly zzso zzso are important, perhaps for the optimal orientation of the zzso in the active site for zzso to zzso
