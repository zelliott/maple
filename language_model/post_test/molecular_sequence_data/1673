In this study, two zzso models zzso as zzso and zzso of main zzso zzso from the novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso were constructed based on the crystal structures of zzso from zzso zzso coronavirus zzso zzso and human coronavirus zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso exhibit similar folds as their respective template zzso These zzso models reveal three distinct functional zzso as well as an intervening loop connecting zzso II and III as found in both template zzso A zzso zzso containing the zzso binding sites zzso and zzso between zzso I and II are also zzso zzso zzso more significant structural fluctuation than zzso during the 400 zzso molecular dynamics simulations because it is located at the open mouth of the zzso zzso while zzso is situated in the very bottom of this zzso The zzso unfolding of these proteins begins at domain III, where the structure is least zzso among these zzso zzso may still maintain its zzso activity while it is partially zzso The zzso interaction between zzso and zzso plays an important role in maintaining the structural integrity of both zzso and zzso
