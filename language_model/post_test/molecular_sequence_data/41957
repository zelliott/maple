zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes is induced by zzso and zzso and is inhibited by insulin in zzso cells, as it is in zzso In contrast, zzso expression in zzso cells is not affected by insulin but is induced by zzso which in turn is zzso by zzso zzso were introduced into well defined zzso factor binding sites to investigate possible interactions between the zzso regulatory element zzso binding protein zzso and zzso response unit zzso binding zzso zzso rat zzso cells were zzso with zzso plasmids with or without an expression zzso for protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso activity was dependent upon the zzso and was decreased in plasmids lacking the zzso To determine the direct effects of zzso the DNA binding and zzso domain of zzso was zzso for that of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was replaced with a zzso binding site zzso zzso elevated zzso and zzso activities of zzso equally and restored responsiveness to zzso The zzso activity of zzso was not diminished by zzso treatment with zzso plus its inhibitor zzso zzso or by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso regions of the zzso zzso domain from zzso diminished zzso zzso without affecting induction by zzso The zzso level of zzso activity decreased in proportion to the reduced ability of zzso to activate zzso zzso zzso by zzso in the absence or presence of zzso was not affected by zzso indicating that interaction of zzso factors with zzso is not required for zzso induction of zzso These results indicate that zzso is directly involved in zzso and zzso expression of zzso and that zzso supports zzso zzso expression through its positive effect on zzso zzso
