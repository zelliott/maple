zzso binding protein zzso zzso is a recently cloned member of the zzso family of zzso factors and is expressed exclusively in cells of zzso zzso The human zzso gene is transcribed by two alternative zzso zzso and zzso A combination of differential zzso and alternative use of promoters generates four zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso These transcripts can zzso three proteins of calculated molecular mass zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Western blots with zzso specific for the zzso domain, that is common to all forms, identify multiple zzso zzso zzso was greatly induced during in zzso zzso differentiation of human primary zzso zzso zzso acid treatment of zzso zzso leukemia cells for 24 zzso induced zzso zzso levels by zzso while prolonged treatment gradually reduced zzso expression to zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments with expression zzso for two of the zzso demonstrated that the zzso protein is an zzso of zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso promoter, while the zzso protein is zzso Thus, zzso is regulated in a complex fashion and may play a role in the regulation of genes involved in zzso zzso
