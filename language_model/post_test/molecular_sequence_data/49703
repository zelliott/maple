The zzso are a family of zzso zzso proteins involved in zzso transport between the zzso network and zzso zzso Here we confirm reports that zzso are targeted to the zzso via interaction between the zzso domain and zzso and we present the structure of the zzso domain of human zzso completing the structural description of the folded zzso of zzso zzso The zzso domain possesses an all zzso fold with a zzso zzso zzso zzso two independent zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso binding by zzso is exclusively governed by the zzso zzso zzso and, using an in zzso recruitment zzso we show that zzso binding by this small structure is required and sufficient for zzso targeting of zzso
