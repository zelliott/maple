Based on the results of zzso studies of linear and zzso zzso peptides such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso a new zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and tested for its zzso activity and selectivity at both the peripheral and central zzso zzso all the synthetic compounds described so far, zzso appears to be the most highly zzso probe zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso This selectivity was confirmed by the results of pharmacological studies, including zzso of zzso analgesia and behavioral changes in zzso In the later test, zzso was shown to increase the rearing activity after IV administration at very low zzso zzso zzso and this effect was reversed by the zzso zzso zzso No zzso response was observed at a zzso higher zzso Thanks to its zzso stability and its zzso zzso is the first zzso active, highly selective delta zzso and should therefore be useful to characterize the zzso role of zzso zzso
