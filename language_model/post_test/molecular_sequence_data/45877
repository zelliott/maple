zzso binding proteins zzso are zzso proteins involved in nuclear zzso zzso and in zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso information on zzso is available for their zzso domain, responsible for zzso zzso zzso and for the zzso domain, involved in zzso and zzso On the contrary, little is known about the structure of zzso zzso region ( approximately 90 zzso hosting sites for zzso zzso In the present communication we apply a combined approach based on zzso nuclear magnetic zzso circular zzso zzso and zzso X-ray zzso and we show that the zzso zzso region is zzso zzso in the full-length zzso and in zzso lacking the zzso and/or the zzso zzso The flexible nature of this protein region, and its structural zzso may be instrumental for zzso recognition and binding to diverse molecular zzso
