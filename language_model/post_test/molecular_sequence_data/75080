We have analyzed the solution structure of zzso containing the branch zzso zzso site region of the first intervening sequence zzso of human zzso zzso by zzso mapping and zzso zzso mapping indicates that there are two distinct structural zzso one contains the branch point region, and the other includes the 3' zzso site and second zzso zzso In the branch point domain, the zzso at which the zzso branch forms appears to be in the loop of a zzso zzso The branch point structure does not appear to interact with other parts of the zzso since its unique zzso zzso pattern is zzso among transcripts containing the entire zzso or only the branch point zzso This is confirmed by a comparison of the zzso zzso of two zzso zzso a distinct set of zzso appears in the zzso of the zzso containing only branch sequences or including 3' zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso studies further show that the 3' zzso zzso 2 domain has a lower melting temperature than the branch point domain, suggesting that the two regions are distinct zzso as well as zzso zzso mapping studies of zzso major late zzso indicate that this zzso has structural features in common with the human zzso zzso
