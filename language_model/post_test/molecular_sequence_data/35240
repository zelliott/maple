zzso zzso which include the new commercial zzso zzso are an exciting new class of chemistry that target insect zzso zzso These receptors regulate release of stored zzso calcium and play a critical role in muscle zzso As with insects, zzso express zzso receptors and are sensitive to the plant zzso zzso However the plant zzso zzso zzso zzso is insensitive to zzso zzso zzso of a full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso in an insect cell line zzso sensitivity to the zzso agents, caffeine and zzso along with zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso Replacement of a 46 zzso acid segment in a highly divergent region of the zzso zzso with that from zzso results in a functional zzso which lack sensitivity to zzso zzso These findings indicate that this region is critical to zzso sensitivity in insect zzso zzso Furthermore, this region may contribute to our understanding of the differential selectivity zzso exhibit for insect over zzso zzso zzso
