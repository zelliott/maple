In zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by two independent and zzso regulated genes zzso and zzso These genes and their products have been implicated in the control of a zzso flux during zzso zzso To investigate the significance of zzso and zzso in this process, we generated stable transgenic zzso lines in which the expression of these two expressed zzso of zzso zzso was knocked down in a zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso exhibited variable growth rates in either the zzso or the zzso stage, as compared with the parental zzso Their differentiation processes were impaired when the zzso were grown under in zzso zzso In zzso studies in a zzso model system revealed that zzso of these zzso lines were unable to form significant numbers of tissue zzso and to establish a chronic zzso Most importantly, all mice that were initially infected with zzso of either of the four zzso zzso lines survived a subsequent challenge with zzso of the parental zzso zzso a dose that usually causes zzso zzso suggesting that live vaccination of mice with the zzso zzso zzso can zzso protection against zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso expression is essential for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso expression gave rise to zzso zzso that were unable to exhibit a significant brain zzso burden in a zzso model of chronic zzso
