We have used a zzso zzso identification zzso zzso to isolate regions from rat zzso DNA zzso that can act as zzso zzso in zzso Three independent fragments having zzso capability have been mapped to three general regions of the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso are found within and around the zzso and zzso b zzso respectively, while the third, zzso is located at the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso into host cells which carried temperature sensitive zzso in the termination factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso temperatures suggested that zzso acted as a zzso termination element while the other two, zzso and zzso were dependent on zzso protein (or a zzso zzso for efficient zzso zzso
