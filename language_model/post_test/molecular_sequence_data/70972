Partly because of the lack of a suitable in zzso model, the zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso genes are largely zzso We have analyzed the zzso potential of human zzso zzso our zzso model of zzso center B cell zzso These cells are surface zzso zzso and, in the absence of T cells, switch to zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso zzso engagement and exposure to appropriate zzso We show here that zzso cells can be induced to effectively mutate the expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and V zzso J zzso zzso transcripts before and after zzso class switching in a zzso zzso In these cells, induction of zzso zzso required zzso of the surface zzso for zzso and T cell contact through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The induced zzso showed intrinsic features of zzso zzso zzso in that they comprised 110 base zzso zzso in the heavy chain and 13 in the zzso and only 2 deletions and targeted zzso virtually sparing zzso and C zzso These zzso were more abundant in secondary zzso gamma than primary zzso zzso transcripts and in zzso than V zzso J zzso zzso zzso These zzso were also associated with coding DNA strand polarity and showed an overall rate of zzso zzso zzso base zzso division in zzso zzso zzso were favored over zzso and G zzso were zzso targeted, mainly in the context of AG zzso Thus, in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso is readily zzso by stimuli different from those required for class switching and displays discrete base substitution zzso
