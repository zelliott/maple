The zzso constitute a major barrier to the environment and provide the first line of defense against invading zzso zzso peptides are emerging as participants in the defense system of zzso barriers in zzso Originally we isolated the human zzso zzso zzso from zzso The gene zzso or zzso zzso zzso coding for this zzso belongs to the zzso family, whose members contain a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The human zzso seems to have only one gene of this family, whereas some zzso species have several zzso zzso In the present work we demonstrate zzso of this human zzso gene in inflammatory skin disorders, whereas in normal skin no induction was zzso By in zzso zzso and zzso the transcript and the zzso were located in zzso throughout the zzso of the inflammatory zzso In addition, the zzso was detected in partially pure zzso derived from zzso scales by zzso These zzso also exhibited zzso zzso We propose a protective role for zzso when the integrity of the skin barrier is damaged, participating in the first line of defense, and preventing local infection and systemic invasion of zzso
