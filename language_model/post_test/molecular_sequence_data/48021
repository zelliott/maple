A high positive charge is the common characteristic shared by the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso consisting of nine zzso This raises the question that the positively charged zzso may play a role in recognition of zzso To test this hypothesis, two studies were carried out using synthetic zzso In the first study, zzso zzso possessing zzso acid sequences from both the zzso and the zzso region of zzso were used as models to study the functional role of the zzso region of zzso The attachment of positively charged zzso to the zzso zzso sequence of zzso was found to enhance the ability of the peptides in zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the second study, two peptides containing nine zzso and the zzso signal sequence of zzso were used as models to study the zzso binding mechanism of zzso zzso of high positive charges such as zzso One zzso did not show signaling activity as indicated by the lack of calcium influx while another zzso induced unusual calcium influx distinct from that induced by the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the signal induced by the zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso the first study provides experimental support for the role of the highly positive zzso region of zzso in zzso zzso The second study suggests that the binding site of zzso in zzso may partially overlap with that of the zzso zzso zzso Both findings should be valuable for the design of zzso zzso and zzso
