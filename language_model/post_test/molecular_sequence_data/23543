The zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the sequence analysis showed that this zzso differs in just three zzso acid zzso from the zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ala, and zzso zzso zzso X-ray zzso was used to determine the structure of zzso zzso from zzso showing that it is very similar to the published structure of zzso zzso from zzso A detailed zzso and kinetic characterization of these two zzso zzso zzso was performed by using zzso and visible zzso The results obtained show that the network of zzso between the zzso and zzso centers is consistent with a zzso process to stimulate the hydrogen zzso activity of zzso This is achieved by increasing the affinity of the zzso for zzso through binding electrons and, zzso by favoring a concerted zzso transfer assisted by the binding of zzso The data were analyzed within the framework of the differences in the primary and zzso structures of the two zzso showing that zzso 88, close to zzso I, is the main cause for the differences in the microscopic zzso parameters obtained for these two zzso zzso This comparison reveals how replacement of a single zzso acid can tune the functional properties of zzso zzso so that they can be zzso to suit the zzso constraints of specific zzso
