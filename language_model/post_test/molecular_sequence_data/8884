zzso zzso type 2 zzso is continuously evolving through point zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, genetic affiliations of 40 zzso strains were determined by amplification, sequencing and zzso analyses during the nationwide molecular epidemiology investigation from 2009 to 2010 in mainland zzso The results revealed that zzso was the zzso zzso in mainland China from 2009 to 2010 and zzso within zzso zzso was an emerging zzso zzso More interestingly, five strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were classified into a novel cluster along with the two main zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further analyses revealed that this novel cluster arose from zzso between zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso search on zzso zzso revealed that zzso strains of the novel cluster also emerged in zzso Indonesia and zzso indicating that the novel cluster of zzso has also been circulating in some other Asian zzso This study is the first time to perform comprehensive analyses to demonstrate a cluster of zzso strains derived from the same type of zzso zzso zzso Our findings provide valuable information on zzso zzso
