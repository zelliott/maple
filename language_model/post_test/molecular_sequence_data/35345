zzso zzso are a common cause of acute zzso zzso and until now, little is known about its ability to spread outside the zzso 

We aim to investigate the role of zzso causing zzso in children hospitalized for zzso as well as to correlate the presence of zzso zzso in serum with clinical severity and stool viral zzso 

zzso stool and serum samples were collected from 85 pediatric patients under 6 years hospitalized for zzso from March to September 2012 in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso quantitative zzso zzso were used to detect and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the partial zzso region was used to zzso the strains zzso 

zzso were detected in zzso zzso of stool zzso By zzso we found a high rate of zzso zzso in serum samples zzso among zzso zzso cases, and was associated with a longer hospitalization zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as with a higher stool viral load zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were classified as zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The same zzso was found in paired stool and serum zzso 

zzso and molecular characterization of zzso zzso in paired stool and serum samples suggest that the dissemination of zzso to the blood stream is not zzso but the role of viruses spread outside the gut and the relationship with disease severity need to be further zzso
