We have isolated and analyzed the structure of the genes coding for the alpha and beta forms of the human cardiac zzso heavy chain zzso zzso analysis of four overlapping zzso zzso clones shows that the zzso and zzso genes constitute a total length of 51 zzso and are zzso zzso The zzso zzso predominantly expressed in the normal human zzso and also in zzso skeletal muscle, is located zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso which is predominantly expressed in normal human zzso We have determined the zzso sequences of the beta form of the zzso zzso which is zzso zzso to the cardiac zzso zzso clone zzso It is unlikely that the divergence of a few zzso sequences from the cardiac zzso zzso clone zzso reported in a zzso zzso clone zzso from skeletal muscle is due to a zzso zzso This finding suggests that the same beta form of the cardiac zzso gene is expressed in both zzso and zzso skeletal zzso The promoter regions of both zzso and zzso zzso as well as the first four coding regions in the respective zzso have also been zzso The sequences in the zzso region of the zzso and zzso genes diverge extensively from one another, suggesting that expression of the zzso and zzso genes is independently zzso
