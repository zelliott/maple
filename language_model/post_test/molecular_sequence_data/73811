The gene for zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso studies zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso was zzso by two open reading frames zzso Based on sequence zzso these zzso were designated zzso and zzso for the large and small zzso of zzso zzso A putative zzso promoter preceded zzso and a potential internal promoter was found upstream of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso which agreed well with the measured value for the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso which fell within the range of zzso of small zzso from other zzso zzso analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed a close relationship between the zzso of zzso and zzso to the exclusion of other zzso in this family, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso found in zzso zzso Thus, this family of zzso probably arose prior to the divergence of the zzso and zzso Moreover, the higher plant zzso and the red zzso zzso were related to the zzso II of zzso coli and the zzso zzso zzso For this reason, these genes appear to have been acquired by the zzso during the zzso that gave rise to the zzso and zzso zzso One of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso possesses high similarity to the zzso zzso zzso indicating that it is an authentic zzso
