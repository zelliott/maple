The promoter of mouse zzso tumor virus contains three overlapping sequence elements related to the zzso consensus zzso that are largely contained within two 10 zzso direct repeats zzso separated by a 2 zzso zzso between 60 and 39 relative to the start of zzso zzso zzso mobility shift competition zzso demonstrate that the most zzso of these zzso elements is recognized by a protein that also binds to the most zzso element, while the central zzso element is not efficiently zzso zzso zzso zzso with altered promoters reveal that the portion of the 10 zzso repeat that is not related to the zzso consensus appears not to be important for zzso The zzso and zzso zzso elements are, at least to some extent, functionally zzso Complete deletion of one element has little or no effect on promoter activity so long as certain spacing constraints among remaining promoter elements are zzso zzso variation of such spacing reveals a zzso effect on promoter activity corresponding to the zzso of zzso DNA, suggesting functional interactions between proteins bound to adjacent zzso
