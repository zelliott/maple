With the recent availability of complete zzso sequences of many organisms, zzso and zzso systems for gene cloning and functional analysis are in great zzso Although zzso zzso cloning systems, such as Gateway cloning technology, are extremely useful for efficient transfer of DNA fragments into multiple destination zzso the zzso cloning process is time consuming and zzso Here, we report a zero background zzso cloning system that provides simple and zzso direct cloning of zzso DNA fragments with almost no zzso The improved zzso system takes advantage of the restriction zzso zzso to generate a zzso after zzso and the negative selection marker gene zzso to eliminate the zzso background after zzso We demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the technology by developing a set of transient and stable transformation zzso for zzso gene zzso gene zzso protein zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and promoter zzso activity analysis in zzso Because the system can be easily adapted for developing specialized expression zzso for other organisms, zero background zzso provides a general, cost-efficient, and zzso platform that zzso the Gateway cloning system for gene cloning and functional zzso
