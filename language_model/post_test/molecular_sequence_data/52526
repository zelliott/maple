We analyzed a zzso protein zzso with an zzso to cartilage zzso zzso protein zzso in the developing rat zzso zzso with the zzso zzso in the developing rat liver increased during zzso and was strongest in the zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso in the liver was not detected at eight days after birth or zzso The stained cells were found to be zzso We partially zzso the protein showing zzso with the zzso to zzso from a zzso cells fraction in zzso zzso rat zzso The molecular weight of this protein zzso 95 zzso was close to the molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to part of zzso zzso was detected in cartilage, but not in zzso of fetal liver or bone zzso Based on these results, the fetal rat liver zzso protein that reacted with the zzso against zzso was thought to contain a common zzso with zzso from cartilage, but to be a different protein from zzso
