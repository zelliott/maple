zzso zzso contain a number of proteins that interact with components of the zzso system that promote or inhibit events leading to zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso binds zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso for zzso and triggers signal zzso Here, the zzso A resolution crystal structure of zzso is zzso In common with other members of this zzso protein family, zzso is an zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso with other family members allows a set of zzso zzso that form a zzso surface to be zzso implicated in zzso zzso Unlike other family members, with the exception of zzso zzso zzso forms an zzso zzso This zzso structure is consistent with zzso zzso zzso molecules on the surface of zzso and as a result promoting signal zzso zzso The zzso structure and the location of the putative binding sites suggest a model for this zzso zzso zzso
