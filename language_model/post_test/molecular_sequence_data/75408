The zzso sequence of the zzso gene zzso zzso and the upstream DNA zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso gene can be translated into a zzso of 55 zzso in excellent agreement with the molecular mass of the zzso zzso required for synthesis of the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso usage showed a high frequency zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene compared to that found in zzso coli genes zzso and its absence in the zzso B and D zzso The low zzso content of the zzso gene and upstream DNA zzso compared to that found in the other zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso was primarily due to a stretch of 500 zzso with only a zzso zzso content, extending from 200 zzso inside zzso C to 300 zzso zzso Moreover, an open reading frame did not extend for more than 48 zzso between the zzso gene and 600 zzso upstream at which point a gene transcribed in the opposite direction zzso As the zzso system in the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a regulatory gene immediately upstream of zzso transcribed in the same direction, these results show that the organization and regulation of the zzso genes have zzso in different zzso zzso
