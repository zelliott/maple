The zzso zzso the most prevalent zzso bacteria of the zzso zzso carries a plethora of the mobile zzso such as plasmids and zzso and zzso zzso which are probably responsible for the spreading of resistance zzso zzso of zzso is the most important resistance mechanism including zzso resistance to zzso agents in species of the zzso zzso zzso In our previous study, the zzso gene was detected in zzso zzso species, which encodes a clinically significant zzso zzso responsible for widespread resistance to zzso and other zzso Such gene has been associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso the aim of this study was to detect the association between the zzso gene and the presence of zzso zzso in 53 zzso strains isolated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by zzso zzso The zzso gene was detected in 11 strains and the zzso in zzso The zzso sequence revealed similarities of approximately zzso with the zzso zzso sequence which has been deposited in zzso zzso zzso was performed in attempt to detect the zzso gene in the zzso It was possible to associate the zzso gene in 11 of 15 strains that zzso zzso Among such zzso 9 presented the zzso gene as well as zzso but in 2 strains the zzso gene was not detected by zzso zzso Our results confirm the involvement of zzso in spreading the zzso gene in zzso zzso
