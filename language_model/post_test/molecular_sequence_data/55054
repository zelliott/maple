zzso the Ras zzso Enriched in zzso is a zzso protein whose gene was discovered during a screen for zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso This zzso zzso acid protein is intermediate in size between small zzso zzso proteins and zzso of zzso G zzso It is most closely related to another zzso zzso protein termed zzso or zzso Although subsequent studies have shown that the zzso gene is expressed in other brain areas in addition to zzso the zzso expression level is relatively high, and zzso protein is likely to play a vital role in zzso physiology and zzso Indeed, it has recently been shown to interact with the zzso protein and play a pivotal role in the selective vulnerability of zzso in zzso disease zzso Not surprisingly, zzso can interact with multiple proteins to affect zzso physiology at multiple zzso zzso studies have indicated that zzso plays a role in signaling by zzso G zzso receptors zzso although the details of the mechanism remain to be zzso zzso has been shown to bind to both zzso and zzso of zzso G proteins and to affect signaling by both zzso and zzso zzso In this context, zzso can be classified as a member of the family of accessory proteins to zzso zzso With documented effects in zzso and zzso behaviors, an interaction with zzso hormone systems and a role in HD pathology, zzso is emerging as an important protein in zzso physiology and zzso
