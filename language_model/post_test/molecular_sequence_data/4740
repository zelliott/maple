zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with zzso binding protein zzso High levels of expression were zzso The fusion protein was zzso from bacterial zzso by affinity zzso with an zzso zzso and found to be zzso zzso zzso was separated from zzso by zzso with zzso zzso and zzso to zzso by zzso zzso zzso A specific activity of zzso zzso and respective apparent zzso values for zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained for the zzso zzso These values are similar to those previously reported for zzso zzso zzso isolated from a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso implicated in zzso binding were changed to zzso zzso using zzso based zzso zzso of the bacterial fusion zzso zzso zzso containing zzso changes of zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso zzso and characterized by initial rate kinetic zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited respective zzso and zzso increases in zzso values for zzso relative to the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso values for zzso were, respectively, unchanged and increased zzso The most significant reductions in zzso values were obtained for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso binding zzso are highly zzso between bacterial and zzso zzso despite low overall zzso
