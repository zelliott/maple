A survey of six bee viruses on a large geographic scale was undertaken by using seemingly healthy bee colonies and the zzso zzso zzso of adult bees and zzso were collected from 36 zzso in the spring, summer, and autumn during zzso zzso zzso samples were collected at the end of summer following zzso zzso In adult zzso during the year zzso wing virus zzso was found at least once in zzso of the zzso zzso virus zzso was found in zzso of the zzso chronic bee paralysis virus zzso was found in zzso of the zzso acute bee paralysis virus zzso was found in zzso of the zzso black queen cell virus zzso was found in zzso of the zzso and Kashmir bee virus zzso was found in zzso of the zzso For zzso the following zzso were zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso none of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso In zzso samples, the following four viruses were zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso The latter findings support the putative role of zzso in zzso these zzso Taken together, these data indicate that bee virus infections occur persistently in bee populations despite the lack of clinical signs, suggesting that colony disease outbreaks might result from environmental factors that lead to zzso of viral replication in zzso
