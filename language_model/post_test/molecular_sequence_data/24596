We identified a novel zzso acid zzso designated zzso (for zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso exhibited relatively low but significant sequence similarity to the members of the zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso responsible for the zzso bond formation between zzso zzso zzso and heavy chain zzso in the zzso zzso acid zzso is zzso for zzso zzso is, however, not zzso with the already known heavy chains such as zzso heavy chain zzso or related to zzso zzso acid zzso zzso in mouse zzso Because zzso solely expressed or zzso with zzso or zzso did not induce functional activity, we generated fusion proteins in which zzso is connected with zzso or zzso The fusion proteins were sorted to the plasma membrane and expressed the function corresponding to the zzso small neutral zzso acid transport system zzso zzso from the already identified system zzso zzso zzso which is associated with zzso zzso transport is less zzso and did not accept some of the high affinity zzso of zzso such as zzso acid and zzso zzso message was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso and skeletal zzso In zzso zzso protein was present in the zzso cells lining collecting zzso In the Western zzso analysis on mouse zzso and zzso zzso was detected as multiple bands in the zzso condition, whereas the bands shifted to a single band at lower molecular weight, suggesting the association of zzso with other zzso via a zzso zzso The finding of zzso would lead to the establishment of a new zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso family which includes zzso associated not with zzso or zzso but with other unknown heavy zzso
