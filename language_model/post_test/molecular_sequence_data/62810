The zzso of two zzso zzso common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso were isolated from a vascular zzso zzso library from common zzso a zzso plant transporting zzso plus zzso in its zzso Here, we describe the kinetic characterization of these zzso zzso by functional expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso and for the first time the zzso of plant zzso in specific cell types of the vascular zzso In the zzso system, both proteins were shown to be zzso sensitive and could be characterized as zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso value for the zzso zzso zzso is 12 zzso for zzso and even higher for zzso which showed an almost linear increase in zzso transport rates up to 20 zzso These data were confirmed in the zzso zzso system, where zzso was analyzed in detail and characterized as a zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso against zzso or zzso and simultaneous labeling with the zzso zzso zzso raised against the companion zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso were localized to companion cells of the zzso in common zzso source zzso These analyses revealed two different types of companion cells in the common zzso zzso younger cells expressing zzso at higher levels and older cells expressing lower levels of zzso plus both zzso zzso The putative role of these zzso zzso in zzso loading is zzso
