We have cloned a zzso zzso III zzso from a marine zzso zzso zzso This sequence is arranged in tandem in zzso up to 20 zzso in size and represents more than zzso of the total zzso zzso The basic zzso unit was isolated from zzso zzso zzso DNA and cloned into zzso zzso analysis of seven clones revealed that the sequence is AT rich zzso and can be separated from main band DNA by equilibrium density zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso dye zzso zzso The sequence is highly zzso and is changed only by single base substitution zzso in the different zzso Use of this sequence as a probe demonstrated varying degrees of zzso with DNA isolated from a wide range of other zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed the presence of zzso zzso to the repeat in zzso eggs but zzso of this sequence was not evident in the adult zzso
