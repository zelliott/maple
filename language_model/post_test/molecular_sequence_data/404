zzso 3 zzso is a highly zzso zzso envelope protein which has been reported as being present in the zzso of zzso type I, while missing in the type II zzso zzso zzso We zzso present evidence that zzso is indeed incorporated in the virus particles of a North American strain of zzso zzso at a density that is consistent with the minor structural role assigned to zzso in members of the zzso zzso Two zzso peptides corresponding to two different zzso linear zzso of zzso derived from the North American strain of zzso zzso were used as zzso to generate a rabbit zzso zzso to this zzso The specificity of this zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso using zzso cells zzso with zzso expressing zzso zzso cells infected with zzso zzso as well as by zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso To test if zzso is a structural component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso through a zzso zzso zzso followed by a second round of zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in specific zzso zzso by radioactive counts and further confirmed by viral zzso zzso in MARC 145 zzso The zzso was detected in zzso zzso containing zzso zzso by zzso using zzso zzso zzso the zzso was less abundant in zzso zzso than other major structural envelope proteins such as zzso and zzso Further evidence of the presence of zzso at the level of zzso zzso envelope was obtained by zzso zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso of infected cells with zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso is a minor structural component of the zzso type II zzso zzso zzso as had been previously described for zzso type zzso
