Human zzso zzso zzso group II zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae and cultured zzso insect cells by infection with a zzso zzso Active zzso with correct zzso zzso processing, was not zzso by zzso cells in zzso The zzso was isolated from their zzso without any need for zzso or zzso of the zzso The zzso was extracted from the zzso zzso with 1 M zzso and isolated by zzso on a zzso exchange column followed by zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso The yield of active zzso zzso zzso zzso was comparable to yields obtained in zzso cells or zzso coli by other zzso The zzso zzso had the correct zzso zzso expected molecular weight, and reacted with zzso raised against peptides zzso from the zzso sequence of the natural zzso zzso zzso were raised against the zzso zzso and they permitted the isolation of the natural zzso from human serum by zzso The zzso zzso showed a preference for zzso zzso with a net negative zzso The zzso expression system provided active zzso that can be produced economically in insects, zzso simply, had zzso kinetic properties, and should be useful in studies of inflammatory zzso
