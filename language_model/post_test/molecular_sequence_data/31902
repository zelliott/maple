The zzso zzso have to be excluded from the specified pathogen free experimental animal zzso Despite the biological and economic importance of zzso in relation to experimental animals just a few molecular based methods are available for their detection and zzso The aim of the present investigation was to develop a multiplex zzso zzso allowing detection of all zzso zzso and identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the most prevalent members of the zzso For this, a zzso common forward primer located on the zzso zzso gene was used in conjunction with four different reverse zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a common reverse primer for all zzso zzso all targeting the zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso The performance characteristics of the zzso were tested against 125 zzso zzso belonging to zzso different species and including 34 strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso 44 strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 37 strains of zzso zzso Additionally, eight other mouse associated bacterial species which could pose a diagnostic problem were zzso The zzso showed zzso sensitivity and zzso Identification of the clinical zzso was validated by ITS profiling and when necessary by zzso zzso gene zzso This multiplex zzso represents the first molecular tool able to detect and differentiate in a single zzso among the zzso found in laboratory mouse and may become a reliable alternative to the present diagnostic zzso
