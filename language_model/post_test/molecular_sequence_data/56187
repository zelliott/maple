The role of zzso presentation as a possible mechanism underlying major zzso complex zzso association of zzso disease has been studied in non-obese diabetic zzso zzso By screening for zzso of zzso presentation to zzso T cell zzso we have selected a synthetic zzso zzso zzso letters zzso D zzso zzso that efficiently blocks zzso presentation by the zzso class II zzso zzso A alpha zzso beta zzso zzso in zzso The zzso is zzso selective, in that it does not affect zzso presentation by the zzso and zzso zzso and has only a marginal effect on presentation by the zzso zzso This zzso also zzso the zzso for zzso T cell responses in zzso and prevents the spontaneous development of diabetes in female zzso mice, when administered chronically from 3 zzso of age zzso zzso treatment with a control zzso zzso that fails to bind to zzso has no effect on the zzso These data indicate that zzso presentation by the zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in the induction of zzso zzso Furthermore, the results demonstrate that interference with zzso presentation by a class II zzso can prevent the onset of spontaneous zzso disease associated with the same zzso
