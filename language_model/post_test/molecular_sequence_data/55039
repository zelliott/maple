zzso zzso zzso is an zzso involved in zzso zzso in higher zzso We isolated a zzso zzso zzso from zzso and named it zzso The putative zzso acid sequence of zzso contained zzso zzso motifs and metal binding zzso zzso zzso zzso not only zzso but also zzso The optimum pH for the zzso activity of zzso was zzso Its zzso activity required zzso and was inhibited by zzso and zzso Its fluorescence, fused with green zzso protein in onion cells and zzso of tobacco zzso cells, was observed in both the zzso and zzso The expression of zzso zzso and protein was clearly correlated with zzso acid zzso contents of zzso cells during zzso The zzso contents of zzso over expression lines were higher than those of empty lines at 13 d after zzso This suggests that zzso contributes slightly to zzso zzso
