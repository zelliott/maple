The three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso entry zzso zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis zzso was determined and refined at zzso A (1 zzso zzso zzso The zzso unit of the crystal contains two zzso each of which we propose to be the functional zzso zzso This is supported by zzso zzso studies, which show the zzso to be zzso in zzso The structure of each zzso consists of an zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso zzso The active site comprises zzso from two adjacent zzso across an zzso and is located at the zzso side of the zzso zzso A comparison with the other known zzso structures shows that the overall architecture of the active site is largely zzso albeit the zzso relay motif zzso zzso zzso and zzso appears to be zzso The kinetic parameters of the zzso are reported: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso is zzso higher than the corresponding value for zzso coli zzso and the zzso is insensitive to feedback zzso by zzso This can be explained by the three-dimensional structure, which shows that the zzso site is not zzso in zzso when compared with zzso zzso that are known to be inhibited by zzso A selection of zzso from the zzso family of zzso acids do not inhibit this zzso A comprehensive understanding of the structure and function of this important zzso from the zzso zzso zzso may provide the key for the design of new antibiotics to combat zzso
