Studies on zzso function and on zzso relationships of human milk zzso have been zzso In this study, we have introduced the human zzso zzso into zzso designed for expression in zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression system resulted in high-level expression of zzso zzso The zzso zzso localized zzso in zzso coli, was zzso to zzso and compared with zzso native zzso in particular with respect to zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso with the zzso zzso native human zzso zzso on zzso An zzso zzso containing all tentative zzso sites was isolated from the zzso protein and analyzed by mass zzso The molecular mass as well as the migration of this zzso on zzso zzso confirmed that it was zzso
