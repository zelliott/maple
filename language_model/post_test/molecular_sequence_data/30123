zzso zzso and high field shifted zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso were assigned to specific zzso acid zzso by analyses of the two-dimensional zzso zzso in comparison with the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso These assignments were subsequently correlated to those of free zzso zzso zzso & zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The spatial zzso of zzso acid zzso as zzso by zzso zzso were found to be quite similar among free zzso zzso and the inhibitor complexes, showing that large zzso changes did not occur upon complex zzso However, small but appreciable zzso changes were zzso which were reflected by the systematic chemical shift changes of some zzso acid zzso in the active zzso Furthermore, we confirmed that zzso zzso contains two specific binding sites, one for the zzso base and the other for the zzso zzso The zzso are forced to adapt their zzso to fit the zzso base and the zzso zzso to each binding site on the zzso This is consistent with our previous studies that zzso and zzso take the zzso form as a bound zzso while zzso takes the anti zzso around zzso bonds zzso et zzso zzso zzso 24, zzso The zzso process between free and bound forms involving zzso and zzso was found to be specific to the recognition of the zzso zzso
