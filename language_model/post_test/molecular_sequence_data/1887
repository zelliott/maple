zzso C virus zzso displays a high degree of genetic zzso Six zzso and more than 50 zzso have been identified to zzso In this report, kinetic profiles were determined for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealing no major differences in zzso In zzso sensitivity studies with zzso zzso showed a decrease in affinity for zzso of zzso 2 and 3 zzso 80 to 90 zzso compared to zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso To understand the reduced sensitivity of zzso 2 and 3 to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the proximity of the inhibitor binding site were replaced in the zzso zzso with the corresponding zzso or zzso zzso The replacement of five zzso at positions 78, 79, 80, zzso and 132 accounted for most of the reduced sensitivity of zzso zzso while replacement of zzso zzso alone could account for the reduced sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso remains a potent inhibitor of these zzso zzso zzso with zzso values below 100 zzso This in zzso zzso in conjunction with the good zzso data reported for humans, suggests that there is potential for zzso zzso as an zzso agent for individuals infected with zzso zzso
