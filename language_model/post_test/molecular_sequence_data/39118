The ability of nerve cells to regulate the expression of specific neurotransmitter receptors is of central importance to nervous system function, but little is known about the DNA elements that mediate zzso specific gene zzso The type A zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso which is expressed exclusively in zzso zzso cells, presents a unique opportunity to study the zzso elements involved in restricting gene expression to a distinct zzso zzso In an effort to identify the regulatory elements that govern zzso zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso regions for the human, zzso and mouse zzso genes were cloned and zzso and a major zzso initiation site was identified in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of rat zzso zzso zzso in primary zzso cultures reveals that a zzso zzso promoter region zzso to zzso zzso constitutes a minimal promoter that can drive zzso zzso zzso zzso Internal deletion and decoy competition studies demonstrate that the minimal promoter contains a zzso region zzso to zzso zzso that is critical for enhanced promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the compromised promoter containing the deletion cannot be rescued by placing the zzso region downstream of the reporter zzso demonstrating that it is not a classical zzso but rather a zzso dependent zzso An additional zzso zzso sequence is located between zzso and zzso zzso and a downstream negative regulatory region zzso to zzso has been shown to be active in zzso but inactive in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the results suggest a possible mechanism for the control of zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
