zzso are capable of degrading proteins in their environment by zzso zzso However, the link between zzso zzso and zzso zzso has scarcely been zzso zzso zzso of the zzso fungus zzso zzso were screened for zzso zzso zzso Five distinct zzso activities with specificity for the zzso zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The native zzso responsible for the removal of zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by ammonium zzso zzso followed by five successive zzso zzso The zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed a zzso specificity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso or zzso zzso This zzso zzso was zzso active at pH zzso and 50 degrees zzso zzso sequencing facilitated the design of zzso zzso from zzso sequences zzso putative zzso zzso zzso enabling subsequent cloning of the zzso zzso was shown to be relatively zzso by classical zzso zzso zzso and to be sensitive to selected zzso and zzso zzso yet gene sequence analysis identified the protein as a zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis indicated that zzso zzso levels were regulated by the composition of the growth zzso zzso zzso transcript levels were observed when the fungus was grown in medium containing zzso and the protein hydrolysate zzso Interestingly, both the induction profile and zzso preference of this zzso suggest potential zzso between zzso and zzso zzso in this zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that the zzso exists as a zzso zzso zzso whereas most bacterial zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso analysis of known zzso revealed two diverse zzso that are distinguishable on the basis of primary and secondary structure and appear to correlate with the zzso composition of the native zzso zzso comparisons revealed that zzso with key zzso zzso features are widespread in bacterial and zzso zzso and this study identified many putative zzso candidates within zzso zzso This work represents, to our knowledge, the first detailed zzso and molecular analysis of an zzso zzso from a zzso and the first zzso zzso isolated from the zzso fungus zzso zzso
