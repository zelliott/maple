A zzso sequence coding for rat zzso alpha zzso zzso has been isolated from a zzso library that was prepared with zzso derived from zzso rat zzso zzso by using human zzso alpha zzso as a zzso The rat zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso protein which is zzso zzso to human zzso zzso The rat zzso sequence under zzso early promoter directed the synthesis of biologically active zzso in monkey zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso is not expressed in zzso zzso liver or brain, and is also not expressed in these zzso of zzso rat except zzso This suggests that zzso alpha is not produced zzso in various zzso and zzso is not sufficient to induce zzso alpha in most zzso Our data indicate that the zzso activities which have been reported to be produced in the brain are not of alpha zzso We have constructed a zzso expressing the zzso terminal 156 zzso acids in zzso zzso zzso rat zzso alpha produced in zzso cells or zzso coli has zzso activity against the human melanoma cell line zzso zzso zzso which has been reported to be sensitive to human zzso alpha and zzso zzso This suggests that zzso activity is common to zzso derived from various zzso
