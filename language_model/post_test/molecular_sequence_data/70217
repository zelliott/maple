Secondary structures of zzso from five plant species have been calculated by the method based on the theory of zzso and long-range interactions in zzso It has been shown that the predicted content of the elements of secondary structure in different zzso molecules varies at standard conditions for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and random zzso zzso A model for the zzso of the zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso from 205 to 350 has been zzso
