zzso by zzso zzso zzso is the leading cause of death and morbidity in Africa due to snake zzso Despite its medical importance, there have been few investigations into the toxin composition of the zzso of this zzso Here, we report the cloning of zzso sequences zzso four groups or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso All these SP sequences zzso the zzso zzso scaffold that form the zzso bonds responsible for the characteristic zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso All the zzso zzso zzso groups showed varying degrees of sequence similarity to published zzso zzso zzso However, these groups also showed marked zzso sequence conservation across them which were significantly different from that of previously published zzso zzso Because zzso zzso zzso exhibit a high degree of sequence similarity and yet exert profoundly different effects on the zzso zzso system, no attempt was made to assign functionality to the new zzso zzso zzso on the basis of sequence zzso The extraordinary level of zzso and zzso sequence conservation exhibited by the zzso zzso zzso and analogous zzso zzso from other zzso species leads us to speculate that zzso to representative molecules should zzso zzso we will zzso by zzso DNA zzso the biological function of this important group of zzso toxins in zzso that are distributed throughout Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian zzso
