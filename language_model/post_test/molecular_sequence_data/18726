zzso disease viruses zzso from zzso A exhibit high zzso zzso Within the Middle East, a strain called zzso emerged in 2003, and subsequently replaced the zzso and zzso strains that were previously circulating in the zzso zzso from this strain did not zzso match with the established zzso zzso although most early samples matched with the older zzso zzso However, many viruses from this strain collected after 2006 had poor zzso match with the zzso vaccine zzso the development of a new vaccine strain zzso More recently, viruses from the region now exhibit lower zzso with the zzso zzso highlighting the zzso of the zzso A vaccines used in the zzso In order to understand the genetic basis of these zzso zzso we have determined the full zzso sequence for 57 Middle Eastern viruses isolated between 1996 and 2011 and zzso these data in context of zzso relationship zzso values that were generated using zzso to zzso and zzso Comparisons of zzso sequences identified zzso in zzso zzso sites zzso 2 and zzso which either individually or together zzso these observed zzso zzso
