zzso zzso and zzso zzso B1 were prepared by direct addition of zzso B1 zzso to zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to reaction of zzso B1 zzso with zzso which exhibits a limiting zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Stone, zzso zzso & Harris, zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso 111, zzso reaction of zzso B1 zzso with zzso exhibits a limiting zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments, zzso zzso zzso relaxation zzso and zzso chemical shift zzso demonstrate that in both modified zzso the zzso zzso is zzso above the zzso of the modified zzso The zzso remain zzso and zzso of the zzso structure is localized adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are observed between zzso and the zzso base pair and include both the major groove and the minor zzso The zzso zzso and zzso ring zzso face into the minor zzso the zzso ring zzso face into the major zzso No zzso is observed between the zzso zzso of the modified base pair and the zzso zzso of the zzso base zzso sequential zzso between zzso base and zzso zzso are interrupted in both zzso strands on the zzso of the modified zzso The zzso at zzso and zzso of the zzso terminal zzso ring exhibit slower zzso relaxation as compared to other zzso zzso which supports the conclusion that they face into the major zzso Increased shielding is observed for zzso zzso chemical shift zzso of the zzso zzso are confined to the immediate vicinity of the zzso base zzso The zzso zzso of the modified zzso exchanges with water and is observed at zzso zzso The difference in reaction zzso is consistent with an zzso zzso complex between zzso B1 zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso above the zzso of zzso in zzso would prevent the binding of a second zzso of zzso B1 zzso In contrast, two zzso sites would be available with zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
