zzso zzso zzso is a large animal living in China and other adjacent countries, which belongs to zzso of zzso The zzso zzso and behavior of zzso are between species of the zzso zzso and zzso It is now in a separated zzso or in the same zzso with zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the evolution of zzso we zzso and cloned its highly repetitive zzso fragments from the zzso zzso The sequences of three fragments were highly zzso indicative of units of a large repetitive DNA zzso Southern zzso using these fragments as zzso showed identical patterns among individuals in both the same and different subspecies, zzso zzso sequences and zzso of the zzso clusters in zzso zzso zzso comparison with zzso and zzso satellite DNA of other species in zzso supports that zzso has a closer relationship with the zzso zzso than with zzso It also suggests that these zzso fragments may represent repeat units of the zzso satellite DNA of zzso
