zzso disease is a chronic disease of the skeleton which is believed to be caused by a persistent virus of the zzso zzso There is still conflict as to the precise identity of the zzso involved in causing this zzso Our previous results using in zzso zzso have implicated distemper as a possible cause of this zzso In order to confirm these results, we have reverse transcribed zzso from zzso bone and have specifically amplified for distemper and zzso sequences using the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso We have found that zzso of the patients examined had distemper and zzso cases had zzso zzso acids zzso within their bone zzso One individual was found to have both viruses zzso in his bone zzso zzso sequencing of the distemper virus zzso products revealed zzso base pair changes in the zzso acid sequences relative to the zzso strain of canine zzso We can conclude that in zzso disease, canine distemper and possible other zzso reside in bone cells and that the persistent nature of the virus may be due to zzso in the viral zzso
