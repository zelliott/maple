In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso consisting of two discrete zzso zzso a zzso zzso alpha zzso the zzso and a zzso zzso beta zzso to the remaining zzso of this zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two copies of the zzso zzso gene complex, and we have previously provided evidence that both copies are transcribed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Young, zzso zzso and Gray, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now report the complete sequences of the two copies of the zzso zzso gene zzso These are not zzso but differ at 5 out of the zzso positions by single zzso zzso in one sequence relative to the zzso In the secondary structure model we propose here, two of these differences are located in zzso regions of the zzso zzso however, they do not interrupt the complementary interactions in these zzso The other three differences occur in zzso regions of the secondary zzso The base zzso documented here are not localized to those regions of zzso zzso that are the most highly zzso in global zzso zzso and therefore it seems unlikely that they are of fundamental functional zzso Whether they might exert more subtle effects on zzso function remains to be zzso
