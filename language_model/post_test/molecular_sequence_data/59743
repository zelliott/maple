The zzso family of zzso factors play an important role in the control of cell cycle zzso By direct regulatory interactions with the zzso family of zzso they integrate zzso growth promoting signals zzso on the zzso and zzso dependent zzso complex during the zzso phase, with cell cycle zzso This is accomplished by direct zzso zzso of genes required for zzso zzso and DNA replication in the S zzso In addition, these zzso factors also play a role in the control of genes involved in regulating zzso and S phase progression including, zzso control, as in the case of zzso zzso In this report, we describe the zzso of the zzso locus zzso zzso a member of this zzso The zzso gene has a zzso promoter and zzso zzso at multiple zzso Using transient zzso zzso we have delineated sequences in the upstream region which have promoter or zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso to mouse zzso 8 by zzso zzso zzso We describe a dynamic pattern of zzso expression using in zzso zzso on zzso sections of mouse zzso at various stages of development and a variable level of expression by Northern zzso analysis of zzso from various adult zzso
