The zzso of influenza virus has become amenable to genetic analysis as a result of newly developed methods for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This allows a dissection of the regulatory signals and promoters required for zzso and replication of the viral zzso The ability to rescue zzso viruses in zzso after zzso opens up a way to engineer viruses suitable for human zzso and carrying desirable zzso zzso
