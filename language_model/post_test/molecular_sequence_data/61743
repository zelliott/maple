Gene expression is controlled mainly by the binding of zzso factors to regulatory zzso To generate a zzso map for regulatory zzso the zzso zzso zzso was screened for putative zzso factor binding zzso Using publicly available data from the zzso database and from publications, alignment zzso for 23 zzso factors of 13 different factor families were used with the pattern search program zzso to determine the zzso positions of more than zzso zzso zzso putative binding zzso Due to the dense zzso of genes and the observation that regulatory sequences are not restricted to upstream regions, the prediction of binding sites was performed for the whole zzso The zzso positions and the underlying data were imported into the newly developed zzso zzso This data can be zzso by zzso information or the zzso Genome Initiative identification zzso zzso binding sites are displayed in the defined zzso Data on the zzso used and on the thresholds applied in these screens are given in the zzso Considering the high density of sites it will be a valuable resource for generating models on gene expression zzso The data are available at zzso
