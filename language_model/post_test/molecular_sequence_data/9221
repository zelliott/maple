A novel therapeutic zzso zzso was designed to be effective in diseases of the alternative zzso of complement such as zzso nocturnal zzso and other zzso zzso is constructed from the first four short complement regulator zzso zzso of complement zzso type 2 zzso that bind to complement zzso followed by the first five zzso zzso of complement factor H that bind to complement zzso In order to assess how zzso binds to zzso and zzso we determined the zzso solution structure by a combination of zzso zzso X-ray scattering and constrained zzso The zzso zzso and radius of zzso of zzso were unaffected by zzso or zzso saline buffers and indicate an zzso zzso structure with a zzso zzso of zzso and a radius of zzso zzso of zzso zzso modeling starting from zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that high-quality X-ray curve fits were obtained with extended zzso arrangements, showing that zzso has a limited degree of zzso flexibility in its solution zzso The zzso zzso structural models are readily merged with the crystal structure of zzso to show that the four zzso zzso extend freely into solution when the five complement factor H zzso are bound within zzso We reevaluated the solution structure of the zzso complex that confirmed its recent crystal zzso This recent zzso crystal structure showed that zzso is able to interact readily with zzso zzso in many zzso when zzso is bound to zzso
