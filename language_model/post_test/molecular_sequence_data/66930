The zzso zzso has experienced many architectural changes during the evolution of zzso green algae, with the class zzso displaying the lowest degree of ancestral zzso We have previously shown that the completely zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are highly scrambled in gene order relative to one zzso Here, we report the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso a member of a third zzso zzso This zzso which encodes 97 genes and contains 21 zzso (including four zzso zzso group II zzso inserted at novel zzso is remarkably rich in derived features and extremely rearranged relative to its zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso is the largest zzso zzso zzso thus far, and in contrast to those of zzso and zzso features no large zzso zzso Interestingly, the pattern of gene distribution between the DNA strands and the bias in base composition along each strand suggest that the zzso zzso replicates zzso from a single zzso Unlike most known zzso group II zzso those of zzso exhibit breaks in zzso I and zzso By placing our comparative zzso analyses in a zzso zzso we zzso an evolutionary scenario of the zzso events that led to changes in zzso architecture in the zzso
