zzso zzso strains with multiple zzso zzso can cause infections that are difficult to zzso The microbial zzso in zzso zzso zzso is dominated by zzso zzso and is a potential source of infections at other zzso 

zzso to a range of antibiotics were determined for 59 zzso zzso zzso zzso from Finland and zzso The DNA sequence of the gene responsible for the zzso intrinsic zzso resistance, zzso was determined from two zzso with diminished zzso Four pairs of zzso from the same root canal were typed by zzso gel zzso 

A high prevalence of resistance to zzso was found, whereas all zzso were susceptible or showed intermediate zzso to zzso and zzso and four zzso were unusually susceptible to zzso No zzso or high-level zzso resistance was zzso Nine of 59 zzso were susceptible to zzso A fully zzso isolate also susceptible to zzso produced a truncated zzso zzso and an isolate with borderline zzso had zzso zzso to the predicted zzso binding zzso zzso gel zzso showed that the same root canal could harbor two different strains of zzso zzso during the course of the same zzso 

Despite the differing zzso usage in Finland and Lithuania, zzso zzso from zzso infections in these countries showed similar zzso patterns with levels of resistance considered typical for the species, and decreased resistance to zzso and zzso as well as zzso in the zzso gene which were similar to those described in other clinical zzso
