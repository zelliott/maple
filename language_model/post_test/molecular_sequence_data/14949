The zzso repeats present in a zzso play dual zzso They can induce zzso instability and, on the other hand, regulate gene zzso In the present study, we report the distribution and sequence features of zzso long zzso repeats zzso that are capable of forming stable zzso or zzso within the human zzso A total of zzso zzso were identified, and 37% of them were located in long zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso of zzso Their distribution appears to be random in zzso and is not restrictive, even for regions near zzso zzso Almost half of them comprise zzso repeats, zzso arranged zzso repeats and zzso zzso The remaining zzso are mostly unique in their sequence zzso Comparative studies of human, zzso zzso monkey and mouse zzso genes reveal that human genes have more zzso zzso than other zzso and over zzso are zzso The human genes associated with the zzso zzso are involved in the pathways of cell communication, development and the nervous system, as based on significantly zzso Gene zzso zzso The functional pathways related to the development and functions of the nervous system are not enriched in zzso and mouse zzso The findings of the present study provide insight into the role of zzso zzso in gene regulation and zzso zzso
