The purpose of the present studies was to examine the zzso distribution and functional properties of zzso zzso type 4 zzso the latest NBC zzso to be zzso zzso distribution studies in rat kidney by Northern zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that zzso is highly abundant in the outer zzso and zzso but is low in the inner zzso zzso segment distribution studies indicated that zzso is predominantly expressed in the zzso and cortical thick ascending limb of the loop of zzso Using specific zzso on the basis of the published sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso a full-length zzso zzso was cloned from human liver and zzso The sequence of this zzso (called zzso is shorter by 86 zzso acids zzso the published zzso zzso zzso zzso injected with the full-length zzso zzso were compared with zzso zzso Although exposure of zzso zzso to zzso resulted in immediate zzso the zzso zzso did not show any zzso in membrane zzso NBC activity in zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso pH recovery from zzso indicated that zzso is a zzso zzso We propose that zzso is expressed in the thick ascending limb of the loop of zzso and mediates cellular zzso zzso in this zzso
