zzso and zzso scorpion toxins exhibit various pharmacological profiles for different zzso sodium channel zzso However, the exploration of toxin zzso relationships has progressed slowly due to the difficulty of obtaining synthetic or zzso zzso We now report that we have established an effective expression and zzso approach for the novel scorpion toxin zzso zzso was zzso as inclusion bodies in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was successfully transformed into active zzso by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was sufficient to generate zzso pure zzso The yield of zzso toxin reached zzso from zzso LB zzso The pharmacological data further showed that zzso selectively inhibited the fast zzso of zzso zzso rather than that of zzso zzso which indicates that zzso is a new zzso zzso This work enables further zzso functional, and pharmacological studies of zzso and similar zzso
