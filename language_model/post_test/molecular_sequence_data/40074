zzso is a zzso modification implicated in a variety of cellular functions, including zzso regulation, protein degradation and membrane protein zzso zzso and the zzso that act on it, although zzso and essential in zzso have not been well studied in zzso despite sequencing of several zzso zzso Several putative zzso zzso have been identified in zzso zzso based on sequence zzso alone, with no evidence of expression or zzso Here we identify the first zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso by its zzso We show that zzso also has zzso activity, as zzso by a zzso zzso zzso This activity is absent from zzso zzso of zzso Given the importance of zzso membrane protein trafficking as well as protein degradation in the zzso of this zzso this family of zzso may represent a target for pharmacological intervention with this zzso
