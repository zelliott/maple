Individual members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family serve two fundamentally distinct zzso Whereas most members transport different zzso zzso across a variety of zzso zzso zzso is special, functioning as a zzso motor protein that generates zzso induced motions zzso in auditory sensory hair cells of the zzso inner zzso The transport mechanism of zzso proteins is not well zzso and a zzso relation between zzso transport and zzso has been suggested but not firmly established so zzso To address these questions, we have cloned zzso zzso from chicken and zzso zzso zzso that presumably lack zzso in their auditory zzso Using zzso recordings, we show that these zzso zzso but not zzso zzso generate robust transport currents in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso Transport is blocked by zzso an inhibitor of zzso generated by zzso zzso The dependence of transport equilibrium zzso on zzso and zzso concentration zzso shows that the zzso zzso are zzso zzso exchanging zzso or zzso for zzso in a strictly coupled manner with a zzso zzso These data identify transport mode and zzso of zzso zzso zzso exchange and establish a reliable and simple method for the quantitative determination of the various transport modes that have been proposed for other zzso transport zzso Moreover, the sequence conservation between zzso and zzso zzso together with a common pharmacology of zzso and zzso zzso suggest that the molecular mechanism behind zzso is closely related to an zzso transport zzso
