zzso origins of DNA replication undergo zzso at various times in zzso allowing the zzso to be duplicated in a temporally staggered zzso In the budding zzso zzso zzso the zzso times of individual origins are not intrinsic to those origins but are instead governed by surrounding zzso Currently, there are two examples of DNA sequences that are known to advance origin zzso time, zzso and zzso zzso factor binding zzso By combining deletion and zzso scanning zzso analysis with two-dimensional gel zzso to measure fork direction in the context of a zzso zzso we have identified and characterized a zzso to zzso and a larger zzso DNA sequence that are capable of advancing origin zzso zzso
