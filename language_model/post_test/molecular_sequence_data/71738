Gene discovery, zzso detection of genes whose expression is affected in diseases or by different treatments of cells or animals, has become the focus of much genetic zzso The technologies that are used to detect changes in expression level include zzso chain reaction zzso zzso methods, zzso of zzso clones on chips or zzso serial analysis of gene zzso and differential zzso In this paper we show that differential display can be used to investigate global gene expression in situations where a few genes change expression levels such as exposure of zzso cells to zzso and in more complex situations such as zzso differentiation of human zzso cells which affects a large number of zzso Furthermore, we show that differential display can replace Northern zzso and zzso protection as a tool to study the expression level of a specific gene in many zzso zzso obtained by differential display can be stored in databases, where the identity of a band zzso or zzso name) can be linked with information about the primer combination displaying the band and a gel image showing the band pattern, which is all the information that is needed to compare the expression level of this gene in other zzso
