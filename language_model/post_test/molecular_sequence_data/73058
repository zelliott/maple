In this report we describe the cloning and initial characterization of zzso a gene that encodes a zzso zzso zzso factor zzso of Mr zzso approximately zzso This gene has many similarities to other zzso described thus far in that it is present at a single copy per zzso zzso it is essential for zzso and the deduced protein sequence of zzso exhibits similarity to previously described human and zzso zzso zzso studies confirm that zzso protein is a zzso of a large zzso zzso zzso complex that contains a subset of the total number of the zzso present in zzso cell zzso zzso reactions performed using zzso whole cell extracts reveal that of the three nuclear zzso zzso only zzso zzso II function is zzso when zzso and associated proteins are zzso from solution, indicating that the functionality of the zzso complex containing zzso is zzso zzso zzso By these criteria zzso appears to zzso a bona fide zzso zzso zzso zzso and thus the protein that it encodes has been termed zzso
