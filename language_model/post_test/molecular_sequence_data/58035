zzso zzso has been reported to inhibit the formation of Man zzso linkages and to prevent the zzso of membrane proteins by zzso zzso zzso In this paper, the effect of zzso on the synthesis of putative zzso anchor precursors in zzso cells was zzso Three different cell lines were zzso zzso cells and zzso negative zzso zzso B and F that accumulate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso species, zzso zzso did not alter the incorporation of zzso into the zzso in zzso B zzso However, when either zzso cells or zzso F cells were labeled with zzso in the presence of zzso zzso incorporation into zzso species was blocked and the TLC profile of zzso zzso resembled that obtained with zzso B zzso Further characterization of the zzso labeled zzso that accumulated in zzso zzso cells by zzso and zzso criteria and zzso analysis confirmed the structure as a zzso indistinguishable from the zzso that accumulates in zzso B zzso Based on previous reports that zzso zzso Man zzso linkage formation and that in zzso proteins the third Man zzso is attached by a Man zzso linkage, these results indicate that the third Man zzso that zzso the putative zzso precursor from the zzso precursor also is attached by a Man zzso zzso Furthermore, the observation that zzso rather than a new zzso species containing zzso accumulated during zzso treatment revealed that the mechanism of zzso zzso primarily involved zzso of an alpha zzso rather than incorporation of zzso into an zzso zzso zzso
