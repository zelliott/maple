A reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso system was developed using two zzso zzso located in the potato zzso virus zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso product was detected from zzso zzso zzso which had been fed on zzso zzso The zzso band was specific to zzso as determined by Southern blots and detection by a zzso zzso As little as 5 zzso exposure of zzso to zzso leaves resulted in the presence of zzso bands in zzso of zzso However, the percentage of zzso zzso increased with longer exposure to infected sources and reached zzso after zzso days of zzso zzso can be detected from a single zzso zzso or a single zzso zzso combined with up to 29 zzso zzso zzso can be detected from freshly collected zzso those stored at zzso degrees C, or those stored in zzso ethanol at room temperature for extended zzso This method is zzso to assess the zzso nature of zzso caught in zzso traps during the growing season or stored for over a zzso
