zzso binding and the subsequent reaction are the two principal phenomena that zzso the activity of zzso and many zzso zzso were generated based on the zzso The single chain variable region zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso against zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso alcohol, and zzso zzso it can therefore bind both zzso and zzso the zzso of native zzso zzso zzso It was shown previously that there is a zzso zzso that is the zzso group of zzso in the zzso regions of zzso close to the zzso of zzso Thus, we anticipated that zzso will display zzso zzso The experimental results showed that zzso indeed displayed zzso activity that is equivalent to the zzso zzso zzso and exhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso kinetic studies showed that the zzso values for the zzso are close to those of native zzso indicating that zzso has strong affinities for the zzso Compared with some other zzso its zzso value was found to be low, which could be caused by the similarity between the zzso and the reaction product of zzso and zzso These results showed that our approach to imitating zzso is correct, which is that an active site may catalyze a chemical reaction when a zzso group locates beside a zzso site of a zzso It is important to consider product zzso in zzso design in order to obtain a mimic with a high zzso zzso
