zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are members of the same family of beta barrel zzso toxins zzso Although the zzso pore is a zzso the zzso pore is formed by the zzso of four copies each of the two zzso related zzso zzso and zzso to form an zzso Here, we examine zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso missing up to zzso zzso zzso acids are capable of producing stable, functional zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso missing up to zzso zzso zzso acids perform similarly in combination with zzso zzso Further, the simultaneous zzso of both zzso and zzso is zzso Both zzso zzso are vulnerable to short deletions at the C zzso Interestingly, the N zzso of the zzso zzso becomes resistant to zzso zzso in the fully assembled zzso pore while the N zzso of zzso remains in an exposed zzso The results from this work and related experiments on zzso suggest that, although the N zzso of zzso may undergo reorganization during zzso they are zzso for the formation of functional zzso
