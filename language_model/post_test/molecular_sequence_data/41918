The zzso proteins are among the most abundant and characteristic proteins of zzso zzso They are essential for the zzso activity of these cells and they provide important markers for the differentiation stage of the zzso series and for the diagnosis of zzso zzso In acute zzso leukemia zzso there is high production of zzso and its zzso detection as well as the zzso zzso zzso are important markers in the diagnosis of this acute zzso zzso The expression of other zzso protein genes in zzso has not been systematically zzso We have used the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso method to determine the pattern of expression of zzso protein genes at the zzso level in zzso zzso We have examined the expression of the primary zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the secondary zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso a protein reportedly found in both primary and secondary zzso zzso for all of these zzso proteins were present in normal bone zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso cells from three patients contain, in addition to zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso G, and zzso One patient had faint but zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso in this zzso zzso zzso was found in one of the three zzso patients, and all the primary zzso protein zzso measured were found to be expressed in the zzso cell line zzso None of the secondary zzso protein zzso measured were zzso in zzso zzso After treatment with zzso acid zzso which zzso zzso maturation of these cells, weak induction of zzso and zzso but not zzso was zzso However, in view of the weak zzso signal observed in normal bone zzso the absence of zzso in zzso zzso cells must be interpreted with zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso G zzso disappeared after zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso remained zzso These findings indicate that zzso protein zzso are regulated separately and differently, and that only minimal expression of secondary zzso protein genes can occur in zzso zzso
