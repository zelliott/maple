The zzso fungus zzso zzso is an important pathogen of wheat that causes zzso zzso zzso Despite the serious impact of zzso zzso on wheat production worldwide, knowledge about its molecular biology is zzso The velvet zzso zzso is one of the key regulators of diverse cellular zzso including development and secondary metabolism in many zzso However, the species analyzed to date are not related to the zzso the largest class of zzso zzso and the function of zzso in this group is not zzso To test the hypothesis that the velvet gene has similar functions in the zzso a zzso zzso zzso was identified and gene deletion zzso zzso were generated in zzso zzso All of the zzso zzso exhibited consistent zzso zzso indicating the involvement of zzso in multiple signaling zzso zzso strains displayed zzso zzso with significant reductions in zzso zzso and less production of aerial zzso on zzso zzso In liquid culture, zzso strains showed abnormal zzso zzso which was suppressed completely by zzso stress or lower zzso In addition, zzso gene deletion led to hypersensitivity to shaking, reduced zzso and zzso to zzso stimulation of aerial zzso zzso However, zzso was not altered in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso associated with zzso does not appear to be important for zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso gene plays crucial roles in multiple key signaling pathways and is associated with light signaling in zzso zzso
