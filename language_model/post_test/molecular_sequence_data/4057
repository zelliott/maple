The mapping of zzso zzso zzso is now predominantly carried out using molecular diversity techniques, zzso display in zzso However, until very recently, zzso display methods have been inappropriate for the analysis of zzso that require a free zzso zzso Here we describe the use of two different techniques to analyze the known C terminal zzso specificity of zzso a zzso zzso specifically zzso truncated zzso in Alzheimer's zzso Using a zzso zzso based zzso random zzso library, and an zzso expression library based on truncated zzso we show that this zzso has an absolute requirement for a zzso at position zzso with respect to the C zzso Both methods give similar results, and identify other important zzso in the binding zzso However, affinity analysis of synthetic peptides revealed that the affinity of the zzso for identified zzso was far lower than the zzso sequence in the native target, and that this in turn was considerably below the affinity for the native target zzso This suggests that molecular diversity methods may define zzso but not necessarily complete zzso The methods described here have a general application to the analysis of zzso zzso suspected to be found at the C zzso
