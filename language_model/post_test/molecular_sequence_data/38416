Sister zzso cohesion is essential for cell zzso We have isolated a novel zzso lethal zzso named zzso that displays zzso assembly zzso zzso delay and abnormal zzso zzso At the zzso temperature, the zzso zzso shows mild sensitivity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso At the zzso temperature, the zzso is arrested in M phase with a viability loss due to a failure to establish sister zzso cohesion during S zzso The lethal zzso arrest zzso however, is suppressed by zzso of a zzso zzso The zzso gene is not essential for the onset and progression of DNA replication but has remarkable genetic interactions with those genes regulating the zzso transition and DNA zzso The zzso two-thirds of zzso is highly zzso to DNA zzso zzso of budding zzso and humans, and the zzso one-third is zzso to budding zzso zzso (also called zzso which is required for the establishment of sister zzso zzso zzso analysis and determination of the zzso site reveal that the function of the zzso domain is necessary and sufficient for sister zzso zzso On the other hand, deletion of the DNA zzso zzso domain in zzso increases sensitivity to zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso plays a dual role during DNA zzso The zzso region acts to establish sister zzso cohesion, and the zzso region presumably zzso zzso DNA synthesis when template DNA contains zzso that block regular DNA zzso
