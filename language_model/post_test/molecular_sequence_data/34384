zzso aimed at resolution of the Tree of Life are most often focused on the zzso of major zzso zzso In this study, we focus on the resolution of some of the most zzso branches in the Tree of Life through exploration of the zzso relationships of zzso a zzso zzso of North American freshwater zzso With a near-complete zzso sampling of close to 250 species, we aim to investigate strategies for efficient zzso data sampling and the zzso of divergence times using zzso methods when a zzso lacks a fossil zzso Our zzso data set comprises a single zzso DNA zzso gene and two nuclear genes sampled from 245 of the 248 zzso zzso This dense sampling allows us to determine if a modest amount of nuclear DNA sequence data can resolve relationships among closely related animal zzso zzso lack a fossil record to provide age zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso we use a near-complete zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which has a rich fossil record, to assess two distinct strategies of external zzso in zzso divergence time estimates of zzso using ages zzso from the fossil record and molecular evolutionary rate zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso and nuclear genes reveals that zzso zzso is present in approximately zzso of all zzso zzso We identify three patterns of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso transfer, which involves the transfer of zzso among extant and zzso zzso species, indeterminate zzso which involves the transfer of zzso from a lineage that cannot be confidently identified because the zzso zzso are not clearly zzso to zzso zzso in any recognized species, and deep zzso which is characterized by species diversification within a recipient zzso subsequent to the transfer of zzso zzso The results of our analyses indicate that DNA sequences sampled from zzso nuclear genes can provide appreciable zzso resolution for closely related animal zzso A zzso near-complete zzso zzso of zzso was estimated with zzso methods using a zzso zzso and nuclear gene data set with all identified zzso zzso zzso treated as missing zzso The zzso analyses resulted in very similar zzso age estimates across the three sampled genes and methods of zzso and therefore offer a viable strategy for zzso divergence times for zzso that lack a fossil zzso In addition, an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso that preserves the rich history of nomenclature in the group and provides formal zzso communication of zzso zzso was constructed using the zzso and nuclear gene zzso On the whole, the appeal of zzso for zzso zzso among closely related animal species is diminished by the observations of extensive zzso zzso and by finding appreciable zzso signal in a modest sampling of nuclear genes in our zzso analyses of zzso
