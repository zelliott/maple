zzso zzso harbor two different types of zzso in each zzso The zzso zzso is the zzso inactive zzso nucleus, while the zzso contains a highly amplified zzso active zzso of lower zzso The zzso genes zzso the two largest zzso of both zzso zzso I and II of zzso zzso were identified by a novel method of two step zzso walking, employing primer pairs derived from zzso sequences of the zzso and known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative gene dosage was zzso The genes are present in equal copy numbers for the respective matching zzso Northern zzso showed comparable amounts of zzso as well, within the matching zzso zzso of the zzso of the transcripts of the gene sized zzso showed that the upstream zzso regions are very short and contain characteristic sequence motifs which could be the zzso of equal promoter strengths for zzso of a common zzso zzso
