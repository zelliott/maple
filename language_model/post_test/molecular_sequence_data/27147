Sea zzso are zzso predators that use a variety of toxins to paralyze prey and zzso Among these zzso zzso I, II and III are short peptides that affect zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso is the only sea zzso species that produces both zzso I and III zzso Although the two toxin types are unrelated in sequence and three-dimensional structure, cloning and comparative analysis of their zzso revealed a highly similar sequence at the zzso region, which encodes a signal zzso This similarity was likely generated by gene fusion and could be advantageous in transcript stability and zzso trafficking and zzso In addition, these analyses identified the processed zzso of the two gene families in the zzso of zzso zzso probably resulting from zzso zzso As presence of processed zzso in the zzso requires zzso in zzso cells, we analyzed zzso zzso and found that indeed they contain zzso I and III zzso This result raises questions regarding the role of toxin transcripts in these zzso Overall, the zzso and gene fusion events suggest that the genes of both zzso I and III zzso evolved in a similar fashion and share a partial common zzso
