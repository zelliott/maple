The zzso protein regulates zzso DNA inversion zzso by a family of DNA zzso when bound to a zzso zzso zzso As is often found for zzso zzso previous crystal structures have failed to resolve the zzso of the zzso inversion zzso region within the zzso zzso A new crystal form of a zzso zzso protein now reveals that the zzso region contains two zzso arms that zzso over 20 A from the protein zzso zzso zzso identified the regulatory and structurally important zzso zzso The most critical zzso zzso are located near the tips of the zzso zzso zzso between the zzso demonstrated that they are highly flexible in solution and that efficient inversion zzso can occur when the zzso are zzso linked zzso The emerging picture for this regulatory motif is that contacts with the zzso at the tip of the mobile zzso activate the DNA zzso in the context of an zzso zzso
