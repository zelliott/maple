A laboratory colony was established in order to enable molecular zzso in premature stages in the brown zzso zzso zzso We found four zzso amplified zzso length zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso one of the zzso along with its zzso zzso region zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso were designed based on the zzso sequence information so that the zzso product was present in male zzso and absent in female zzso However, we could not completely distinguish males from zzso because the zzso amplification product was absent in some of the males zzso zzso therefore, established a laboratory zzso in which all males carried this zzso We can directly sex zzso stages in this colony using our zzso zzso making this strain of considerable value for studies that require sex separation in egg and zzso zzso
