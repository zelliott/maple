There is a large body of evidence that zzso metal zzso particularly copper, might play a role in several protein folding zzso like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or the prion zzso However, contribution of metal zzso on zzso and their molecular influence on the formation of zzso structures is not zzso zzso the general influence of metals on the formation of zzso is still zzso zzso We have zzso the well established system of zzso zzso to investigate the role of three different metal zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso Recently, it has been shown that the prion determining region zzso of the zzso zzso prion protein zzso which is responsible for the zzso prion zzso zzso specifically binds zzso zzso We further characterized the affinity of zzso for zzso which were found to be comparable to that of other zzso proteins like the zzso prion protein zzso The specific binding sites could be located in the zzso zzso which is known to initiate formation of zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso nucleation was significantly delayed, probably due to influences of copper on the zzso ensemble of soluble zzso since zzso altered the zzso structure of soluble zzso while no influences on zzso zzso could be zzso The secondary structure of soluble or zzso protein and the zzso of the zzso were apparently not altered when assembled in presence of zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso did not bind to zzso and did not exhibit significant effects on the formation of zzso zzso zzso
