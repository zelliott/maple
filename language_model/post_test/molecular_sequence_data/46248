The level of zzso zzso protein zzso genes involved in zzso development remains zzso zzso of the different zzso genes that are expressed in zzso is necessary in understanding the similarities and differences of functions between the members of this gene family, as well as the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso A zzso putative zzso zzso was successfully cloned on a zzso zzso length zzso zzso after it was found to be zzso in the fertile flower buds of Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso male sterile AB line zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso possessed the basic feature of zzso containing an zzso signal zzso several potential zzso sites, two zzso bridges zzso both the zzso and zzso regions, and 10 zzso repeat zzso consensus zzso zzso zzso verified the higher expression of zzso in the fertile flower buds compared to the sterile flower zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso was exclusively expressed in the zzso cells and zzso during zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a novel zzso gene that might be involved in zzso or zzso zzso
