The three-dimensional structure of the highly toxic zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso based on sequence analysis and the refined structure of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scattering experiments were performed on zzso solutions of zzso The zzso distribution function derived from these scattering experiments and the one calculated from the model structure are in good zzso zzso consists of a basic and an zzso zzso The model strongly suggests that the overall folding motif of zzso has been preserved in both zzso The basic domain has an intact active zzso The zzso that are expected to contact the zzso tails of the zzso are different from other zzso but they are all zzso The zzso domain consists of three independent chains interconnected by zzso zzso Compared to other zzso the active site for the greater part has been preserved in this domain, but it is not very well zzso from zzso Most zzso normally in contact with the zzso tails of the zzso are missing, which might explain the zzso zzso lack of zzso zzso A zzso between the third chain of the zzso domain and zzso suggests that the zzso domain may act as a zzso for the basic zzso
