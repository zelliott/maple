zzso in the zzso gene result in zzso zzso of the anterior segment of the eye and lead to an increased zzso of zzso To understand how the zzso protein may function in contributing to these zzso we identified functional regions in zzso required for nuclear zzso and zzso zzso Two regions in the zzso zzso domain, one rich in basic zzso acid zzso and a second, highly zzso among all zzso zzso were necessary for nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso However, only the basic region was sufficient for nuclear zzso Two zzso zzso zzso were identified in the extreme zzso and zzso regions of zzso A zzso zzso domain was located at the central region of the zzso This region was able to reduce the zzso potential of the zzso zzso domain, as well as the zzso zzso zzso Lastly, we demonstrate that zzso is a zzso and a number of zzso predicted to be zzso were localized to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso zzso which displayed a reduced level of zzso These results indicate that zzso is under complex regulatory control with multiple functional zzso modulating zzso zzso zzso
