zzso zzso sites zzso that were generated via zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and mapped to human zzso were used to isolate and overlap zzso artificial zzso zzso By zzso the results of primary pool zzso the order of zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso isolation of 11 key zzso from 75 positive pools confirmed the proposed zzso Although only a small subset of the available zzso fragments was used, the zzso were generated at sufficient density to isolate all the zzso required and to identify all except one overlap zzso The results confirmed physical linkage of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso continuity was determined purely by analysis of the 11 zzso colonies and required no zzso This strategy is therefore an effective approach for the construction of zzso zzso spanning discrete zzso regions contained within zzso cell hybrids, with minimal prior knowledge of the zzso
