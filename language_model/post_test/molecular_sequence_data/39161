zzso regulates gene expression by modulating the concentration or activity of zzso zzso To identify zzso factors that mediate the effects of zzso in liver we analyzed the promoter of the gene coding for zzso nuclear zzso zzso whose expression in liver is zzso by zzso In zzso interaction studies and in zzso experiments, we found that the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso gene and zzso its zzso This zzso effect involved an zzso zzso of zzso and two sites in the zzso gene zzso Using liver nuclear extracts from zzso zzso rats, we found that zzso zzso a zzso transient decrease in the amount of zzso zzso This zzso change is zzso with the transient zzso effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene by zzso therefore involves lifting of the repression exerted by zzso in addition to the known zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso on that zzso Our data provide further evidence that zzso controls a network of liver zzso factors and show that zzso zzso in this zzso
