The zzso from the zzso zzso zzso carries out efficient zzso between the zzso site in the zzso zzso and the zzso site in the host bacterial zzso In this paper, we show that the zzso also functions in human zzso A zzso zzso system was constructed that measured zzso integration of zzso into zzso This zzso was used to demonstrate that in the presence of the zzso zzso precise zzso integration occurs with an efficiency of zzso in zzso coli and zzso in human zzso This zzso system was also used to define the minimal sizes of zzso and zzso at 34 zzso and 39 zzso zzso Furthermore, precise and efficient zzso integration of an incoming zzso bearing zzso into an established zzso virus zzso bearing zzso was documented in human zzso This work is a demonstration of efficient, zzso zzso integration in zzso zzso These observations form the basis for zzso integration strategies potentially useful in a broad range of genetic engineering zzso
