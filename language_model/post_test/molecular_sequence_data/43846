zzso zzso zzso genes zzso were cloned and zzso from a zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and a moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The determined zzso sequences of these two strains were very similar, and the identity of the deduced zzso acids sequences was zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso from both strains were localized at corresponding sites by primer extension analysis, and two zzso starting points, which differed by only 1 base, were zzso In strain zzso a zzso transcript was mainly observed, whereas in strain zzso a zzso transcript was observed together with the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso protein was expressed under higher pressure conditions in zzso and under all pressure conditions tested in zzso as reflected in the primer extension zzso Our findings suggest that zzso expression controlled by pressure is one of the important mechanisms involved in the adaptation of zzso to the zzso zzso
