The visceral zzso zzso plays a critical role in normal zzso yet little is known about the specific molecules that regulate its zzso We show here that four zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso are restricted to visceral zzso In the absence of zzso visceral zzso forms but the zzso movements by which the zzso becomes enclosed within its zzso zzso are disrupted and serum protein gene zzso is greatly zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso signaling molecules known to play multiple roles in embryonic development, are also zzso expressed in the closely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that similar mechanisms may be zzso to mediate zzso interactions in both zzso and embryonic zzso
