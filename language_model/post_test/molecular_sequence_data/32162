zzso zzso strain zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso via the formation of zzso zzso a known zzso and zzso The initial two steps leading to the sequential formation of zzso and zzso are zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso is zzso identical to a zzso hypothetical zzso protein of zzso strain zzso zzso it belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fold zzso zzso modeling of complexes with the zzso zzso and zzso suggested specific zzso contributing to the zzso zzso activity, assuming a zzso reaction zzso zzso analysis supports the roles of zzso zzso and zzso which are predicted to form the binding site for a zzso metal zzso implicated in zzso zzso and a role in zzso binding for the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso is zzso identical to the zzso zzso zzso of various zzso bacteria, zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso coli produced a small amount of zzso from zzso supporting the functionality of the zzso zzso We also showed by gene knockout and zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso zzso located downstream of the zzso zzso is responsible for strain zzso being attracted to zzso zzso is the first zzso in zzso metabolism to be identified, and this study completes the gene zzso of zzso metabolism that is localized within a zzso zzso locus of strain zzso
