Water channels or zzso zzso have been identified in a large variety of zzso Nevertheless, their role in the human gastrointestinal zzso where their action is essential for the zzso and zzso of water and zzso is still zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate the structure and function of water channels expressed in the human zzso A zzso zzso of about zzso zzso with a zzso identity to human zzso was amplified from human stomach, small zzso and colon by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and a transcript of zzso zzso was expressed more abundantly in colon than in zzso zzso and stomach as indicated by Northern zzso zzso of zzso from the colon of adults and children but not from other gastrointestinal regions in zzso zzso enhanced the zzso water zzso and the zzso and zzso transport in a manner sensitive to an zzso zzso zzso indicating the presence of functional zzso zzso and zzso studies in human colon revealed that the zzso protein is restricted to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso within these cells was more intense in the zzso than in the zzso zzso The presence of zzso in zzso zzso cells suggests that zzso is implicated in water zzso across human zzso surface zzso
