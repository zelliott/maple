zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso and smooth muscle zzso and is thought to play a role in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a member of the G zzso zzso family and is found as two alternatively spliced zzso alpha zzso zzso and beta zzso zzso which share the first zzso zzso In the present report, we demonstrate by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso when expressed in zzso cells as well as several other cell zzso Various dominant negative zzso were used to demonstrate that the zzso of the zzso is zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells, suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso and zzso pits in this zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso of both the alpha and beta zzso but not of a zzso truncated after zzso zzso can be promoted by zzso of zzso identifying the zzso of both receptors as necessary in zzso zzso zzso zzso of two zzso motifs in the zzso of zzso did not affect zzso zzso Analysis of various zzso deletion zzso revealed that a region between zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso is essential for zzso zzso These data demonstrate that alternative zzso of the zzso plays a critical role in regulating zzso binding and subsequent zzso zzso
