zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso is unable to form zzso upon deprivation of combined nitrogen but forms a pattern of zzso zzso fluorescent cells after 2 days of zzso zzso analysis of zzso DNA adjacent to the ends of zzso zzso in zzso zzso showed a zzso open reading frame, designated zzso whose predicted protein product throughout its zzso two-thirds has extensive similarity to the zzso family of bacterial protein zzso Its zzso third is unique and does not resemble any known zzso zzso lies zzso zzso zzso from the previously described gene zzso Reconstruction of the zzso zzso and its zzso in trans with a zzso copy of zzso confirmed that zzso has an essential regulatory role early in zzso zzso zzso is induced zzso 4 h after nitrogen zzso hours after induction of zzso zzso of zzso depends on zzso and may depend on zzso zzso similar sequences are present zzso from the initiation zzso and in the 3' untranslated regions of zzso and of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso
