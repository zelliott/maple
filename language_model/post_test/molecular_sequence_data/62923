The only outer zzso membrane zzso zzso examined to date, from rat zzso zzso exhibits greater stability than known zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as a much higher kinetic barrier for zzso zzso and a more negative reduction zzso A zzso search of available databases using the protein sequence of zzso zzso as template revealed entries for analogous proteins from human zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso We prepared a synthetic gene coding for the zzso domain of zzso zzso and expressed the protein to high zzso The zzso protein exhibits stability, zzso and zzso properties similar to those of zzso zzso suggesting that they are characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso The divergence in properties between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso can be zzso at least in part, to the presence of two extended zzso patches in the zzso The zzso properties characteristic of the zzso proteins may be important in zzso the two functions proposed for them so far, reduction of zzso radical and stimulation of zzso zzso
