zzso zzso genes are believed to be zzso on small generally zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene complement has reached zzso with an incomplete set of zzso genes zzso compared with typical functional zzso zzso While some of the missing zzso genes have recently been found in the nucleus, it is still unknown if additional zzso not located on zzso might also contribute to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed that transcripts derived from the known zzso genes zzso and zzso contained a zzso 3' zzso tract of zzso zzso This unusual modification suggested that random sequencing of a zzso primed zzso library could be used to characterize the zzso zzso We have recovered only 12 different zzso transcripts from our library, all of which are zzso on zzso in several zzso zzso The correspondence of all zzso transcripts with previously described zzso genes thus supports the zzso zzso as zzso the smallest zzso of any functional zzso Interestingly, northern blots indicate that the majority of transcripts are zzso suggesting that zzso is unlikely to act as a degradation signal as do the zzso zzso extensions of transcripts in zzso and other zzso
