zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare, zzso dominant form of zzso zzso zzso individuals have a benign, slowly progressive, zzso zzso enlargement of the oral zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso dominant forms of zzso have been localized to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To identify the gene responsible for zzso we extended genetic linkage studies to refine the zzso zzso candidate zzso to approximately zzso zzso Development of an integrated physical and genetic map of the zzso identified 16 zzso zzso of these zzso in affected and unaffected zzso family members, identified a zzso in the Son of zzso zzso gene in affected zzso In this report, we describe the zzso structure of the zzso gene and present evidence that zzso of a zzso between zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso gene is responsible for zzso This zzso zzso which zzso in a dominant manner over four generations, introduces a zzso and creates a premature stop zzso abolishing four functionally important zzso zzso binding zzso normally present in the zzso region of the zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso contains the zzso zzso protein for the zzso zzso acids zzso fused to a novel zzso acid zzso zzso Similar zzso deletion zzso are functional in animal models, and a transgenic mouse construct with a comparable zzso zzso produces a zzso with skin zzso zzso of the functional role of this zzso zzso has implications for understanding other forms of zzso zzso and corrective zzso zzso
