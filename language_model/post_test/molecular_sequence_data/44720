zzso are zzso composed of peptides that are specifically zzso in a zzso zzso Recently, a zzso composed of an zzso zzso from the C4 domain of zzso zzso was shown to display a prominent zzso zzso that, as an zzso zzso rabbit zzso recognizing native and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For the present study, we zzso a zzso composed of the C4 zzso zzso linked to zzso aluminum oxide zzso The zzso were first reacted with zzso to provide an zzso load of zzso zzso of zzso of zzso The zzso aluminum oxide zzso then were reacted with zzso zzso at pH 10 to place a zzso zzso on the zzso A zzso C4 zzso modified at the zzso of zzso zzso then was reacted with the zzso zzso to give the zzso zzso linked to aluminum oxide via a zzso zzso The zzso load was determined to be 16 zzso of zzso of zzso a zzso theoretical zzso zzso shape and size of the zzso zzso were analyzed by electron zzso and displayed a mean maximum diameter of zzso zzso and a mean minimum diameter of 113 zzso well within the desired size range of 300 zzso believed to be optimal for zzso zzso zzso zzso determined values of mean particle zzso specific surface area, and specific zzso load provided the information necessary to calculate the mean zzso load, which was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso such as that described here, could form the basis of a new class of zzso that combines a chemically defined organic zzso with a nontoxic chemically defined zzso zzso
