zzso deposits in the pancreatic zzso of zzso are thought to be a main factor responsible for death of the zzso zzso zzso in type 2 zzso It is hypothesized that zzso death is related to interaction of the 37 zzso acid zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso the major constituent of zzso zzso with cellular zzso However, the mechanism of zzso interactions is largely zzso Here, we study the nature and the molecular details of the initial step of zzso interactions by using the zzso zzso It is shown that both freshly dissolved zzso and the zzso mouse zzso zzso have a pronounced ability to insert into zzso zzso even at zzso packing conditions that exceed the conditions that occur in biological zzso In contrast, the zzso form of zzso has lost the ability to zzso These results, combined with the observations that both the zzso zzso and the dependence of zzso on the initial surface pressure are similar for freshly dissolved zzso and zzso indicate that zzso zzso into zzso zzso most likely as a zzso In addition, our results suggest that the zzso part of zzso which is nearly identical with that of zzso is largely responsible for zzso This is supported by experiments with zzso fragments, which show that a zzso consisting of the 19 zzso zzso of zzso efficiently zzso into zzso zzso whereas an zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso of zzso zzso much less zzso The results obtained here suggest that zzso zzso might insert with high efficiency in biological zzso in zzso This process could play an important role as a first step in zzso membrane damage in type 2 zzso
