To estimate an accurate zzso rate for zzso zzso in German patients with primary zzso glaucoma zzso 

zzso case zzso 

Blood was obtained from 39 unrelated patients of German origin with clear clinical features of zzso and screened for zzso in the zzso gene using direct zzso acid zzso One hundred ethnically matched control subjects were screened for novel sequence zzso using restriction zzso length zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso 

zzso analysis identified 11 different zzso in 7 patients zzso Four patients were compound zzso 2 subjects zzso and 1 zzso for zzso zzso One deletion zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso None of the novel zzso zzso identified was found in normal zzso 

Our results indicate that only a minor proportion of German zzso patients harbor zzso in the zzso gene and are in line with similar studies from other ethnic populations in which the rate of zzso is zzso In addition, this is the first report discussing the zzso of German zzso patients with and without zzso zzso
