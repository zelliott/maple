Within the framework of an international project for the sequencing of the entire zzso zzso zzso this paper communicates the sequencing of a zzso region containing the zzso and zzso zzso (65 zzso which creates a 177 zzso zzso covering the region from zzso to zzso This 65 zzso region contains 64 zzso (62 complete and two partial zzso The 14th, 15th and 17th genes zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso for zzso transcription, zzso zzso and zzso 2, zzso The 11th, 30th, zzso zzso zzso zzso 51st and 58th genes are designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso because their products probably zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso transport zzso zzso the respective components of zzso d zzso zzso and zzso cassette zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso genes are zzso which are probably involved in zzso zzso Gene organization and gene features in the zzso region are zzso
