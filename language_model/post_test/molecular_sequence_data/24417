To obtain zzso expressed genes related to human zzso using zzso zzso and make a preliminary study of one novel full-length zzso 

Total zzso was extracted from human zzso zzso and normal brain zzso and zzso was used to make zzso After zzso and washing zzso the results of zzso were scanned using computer zzso One gene named zzso clone was subsequently analyzed by northern zzso in zzso zzso zzso and radiation zzso 

Fifteen zzso expressed novel genes related to human zzso were obtained through four times of zzso and zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso confirmed that zzso clone was lowly expressed in normal human brain tissue and zzso in human zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that the clone zzso was a novel full-length gene with the length of 2002 zzso This zzso called human zzso protein zzso zzso codes zzso zzso acids and is located on zzso 14 between zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso technology can be successfully applied to identify zzso expressed genes with small amount of zzso high quality, high speed, and high zzso The novel full-length human zzso protein zzso gene may correlate with formation of human zzso
