zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso neutral zzso was examined under various zzso At elevated temperatures, under zzso conditions, mature protein was rapidly zzso but no zzso of specific breakdown products zzso However, by zzso zzso neutral zzso on ice during extended periods of time, specific peptides zzso These peptides were zzso by zzso and Western zzso and the zzso sequences were determined for the four major zzso which had sizes of 30, 22, 20 and 15 zzso zzso data identified five zzso sites in the neutral zzso three of which were identical with zzso target sites in zzso a zzso neutral zzso zzso of the identified zzso sites of the zzso zzso neutral zzso with the known zzso of the zzso indicated that they were in agreement, showing a preference for the generation of zzso at the zzso side of large zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest a high degree of similarity in the three-dimensional structures of zzso zzso neutral zzso and zzso
