zzso zzso and its wild zzso zzso differ zzso in zzso and afford an opportunity to examine the connection between strong selection and diversity in a major crop zzso The zzso gene largely controls the increase in zzso dominance in zzso relative to zzso and a region of the zzso locus zzso to the transcript sequence was a target of selection during zzso zzso To better characterize the impact of selection at a major zzso zzso we have zzso the upstream zzso zzso region and systematically sampled zzso diversity for sites located as far as zzso zzso upstream to zzso Our analyses define a selective sweep of approximately zzso zzso zzso to the zzso transcribed zzso The selected region harbors a mixture of unique sequences and large repetitive zzso but it contains no predicted zzso Diversity at the nearest zzso gene to zzso is typical of that for neutral zzso zzso indicating that selection at zzso has had a minimal impact on the surrounding zzso zzso Our data also show low zzso linkage zzso in the region and suggest that selection has had a minor role in shaping the pattern of linkage zzso that is zzso Finally, our data raise the possibility that zzso zzso zzso are present in extant zzso zzso and our findings also suggest a model of zzso gene regulation that differs from traditional views of how plant gene expression is zzso
