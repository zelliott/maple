The zzso 1 zzso protein functions in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The complex domain structure comprises two zzso and five zzso zzso in the short zzso plus zzso zzso and putative zzso zzso in the long zzso Alternative zzso of zzso 20, affecting the zzso domain, has been shown in rat and that of zzso 25 + 26, affecting the zzso domain, has been shown in human and zzso Here we report 7 novel zzso zzso of the human and mouse zzso genes and demonstrate conservation of alternative zzso affecting zzso and zzso in zzso The novel zzso zzso transcripts with altered zzso domain spacing and zzso domain structure and possible targets of zzso zzso Eight and 16 protein zzso of the short and long zzso zzso respectively, are zzso These zzso likely serve to zzso the many complex protein interactions and functions of zzso
