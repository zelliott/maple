Five independent clones of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were obtained in zzso coli, and the gene was localized to a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso The five clones were shown to contain the same gene by Southern zzso with a zzso probe to zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was determined, and shown to contain a single zzso of zzso zzso zzso a protein of 339 zzso zzso The predicted molecular mass was 36 zzso A 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected from zzso coli zzso preparations zzso zzso which could zzso to zzso after zzso of the putative 26 zzso acid zzso signal zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli under the control of the zzso zzso promoter, and the corresponding zzso was found to be present in zzso zzso Active zzso was produced when the zzso strain was incubated at a reduced temperature in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso culture zzso zzso confirmed the production of a 33 zzso zzso zzso
