zzso zzso receptors zzso are nuclear hormone receptors that play key roles in zzso and energy zzso Olive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The full-length zzso is zzso long and encodes a zzso with zzso zzso acids containing a zzso zinc finger and a zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso was detected from zzso zzso and its expression was increased under a starved zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso response element zzso activity, and treatment with zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso olive zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the absence or presence of zzso and zzso produced a synergistic effect on zzso zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso in the presence or absence of zzso regulated the expression of zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is functionally and zzso zzso in olive zzso and zzso
