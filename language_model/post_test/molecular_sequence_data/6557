zzso zzso is a newly identified member of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Recently, the zzso zzso gene was identified as the gene defective in zzso a zzso deafness in mice zzso zzso Walsh, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Brown, zzso Antonio, zzso Beisel, zzso Steel, zzso & Brown, zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso and in human Usher syndrome type zzso an inherited disease characterized by zzso deafness, zzso dysfunction, and zzso zzso zzso zzso Blanchard, zzso zzso zzso Guilford, zzso Gibson, zzso Walsh, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kelley, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Steel, zzso Brown, zzso & zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso To understand the normal function of zzso zzso and how it could cause these disease zzso when zzso we generated zzso specific to the tail portion of this unconventional zzso We found that zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression was restricted to the inner and outer hair cells, where it was found in the zzso zzso as well as the zzso In the eye, zzso zzso was expressed by the retinal pigmented zzso cells, where it was enriched within the zzso zzso domain of this cell zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggests that the zzso and deafness associated with Usher syndrome is due to lack of proper zzso zzso function within the cochlear hair cells and the retinal pigmented zzso zzso
