The ability of zzso protein zzso zzso to activate zzso response element zzso gene zzso was compared with that of zzso protein zzso zzso Although both the type zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and the type II zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and A zzso zzso to a similar extent, zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso was at least zzso higher in zzso cells than in zzso zzso zzso of each zzso in zzso cells resulted in a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso As reported zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the nucleus following zzso by zzso zzso However, zzso did not zzso to the nucleus upon zzso by zzso zzso Replacement of an zzso zzso zzso of zzso with an zzso acid resulted in a zzso zzso with zzso zzso activity in zzso and in zzso The zzso zzso localized to the zzso and was only a weak zzso of zzso gene zzso However, an zzso deletion zzso of zzso was found in the nucleus as well as the zzso and was a strong zzso of zzso gene zzso These data suggest that the inability of zzso to zzso to the nucleus is responsible for the differential ability of zzso and zzso to activate zzso gene zzso and that nuclear zzso of zzso is not required for zzso regulation of gene zzso
