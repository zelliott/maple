zzso zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso screen, we have isolated a rat clone that interacts with zzso as well as with zzso The gene encodes a zzso protein with two extensive zzso zzso and is broadly expressed in all zzso This protein binds to zzso zzso zzso but not to other small zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso also binds specifically to the synaptic zzso protein zzso (or zzso zzso but shows no affinity for zzso or zzso in both the zzso zzso system and in zzso binding zzso This specificity zzso in part, in the zzso domain of zzso as a zzso containing this domain of zzso fused to zzso is able to bind to zzso The zzso domain of zzso is also essential as its deletion abolished binding to zzso Replacement of the deleted zzso zzso domain by a zzso zzso signal can not restore binding to zzso This interaction is therefore distinct from that required for zzso binding to either zzso or both zzso and zzso zzso analysis on zzso indicates that the critical zzso and zzso zzso reside in two zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the extreme zzso zzso This dual zzso and zzso binding characteristic suggests that zzso may serve to link these two protein families in the control of zzso zzso and zzso
