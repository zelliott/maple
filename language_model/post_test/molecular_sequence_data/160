Comprehensive expression profiles of zzso zzso zzso zzso genes and mature zzso zzso are currently not zzso We established a quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction platform that allows rapid and sensitive zzso of 177 zzso primary zzso transcripts zzso The platform was used to detect zzso zzso or nitrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso Several zzso species as well as zzso were found to be zzso during N zzso whereas during P zzso zzso zzso and zzso species were induced and zzso was zzso The corresponding responses of the biologically active, mature zzso were confirmed using specific zzso reverse zzso primer quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso and small zzso zzso Interestingly, the latter approach also revealed high abundance of some zzso star zzso zzso analysis of small zzso sequences with a modified zzso zzso led to the identification of the novel P zzso zzso which is zzso by two zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso a zzso zzso and the zzso of several zzso star strands were found to be strongly dependent on P or N status in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flagging them as candidate systemic zzso Taken together, these results reveal the existence of complex small zzso regulatory networks zzso plant adaptation to mineral zzso zzso
