zzso immunity against malaria is induced by zzso with zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of zzso zzso zzso clones from zzso zzso mice zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso recognized by these zzso can be zzso by synthetic peptides corresponding to a zzso region in the zzso proteins of both zzso malaria zzso Both peptides are recognized by the zzso in the context of the same zzso class I zzso zzso zzso In zzso adoptive transfer of the zzso clones into zzso zzso mice protected them from a lethal challenge of infectious zzso
