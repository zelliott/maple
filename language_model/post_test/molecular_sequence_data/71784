Despite its small size, the peripheral zzso domain from the zzso zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex adopts a unique, compact zzso To determine whether the full 43 zzso sequence is required for the domain to adopt a stable, zzso structure, 3 proteins of different lengths were zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the domain, zzso spans zzso zzso and zzso comprises zzso zzso zzso folds in a zzso two-state fashion with a zzso of 53 degrees C and a stability at 25 degrees C of zzso zzso zzso zzso is nearly as stable with a zzso of 48 degrees C and a stability of zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso and heat capacities suggest that zzso and zzso bury approximately the same surface zzso zzso differences in zzso and zzso chemical shifts between zzso and zzso show that the two sequences adopt the same zzso zzso On a per zzso basis, zzso degrees and zzso degrees p fall within the range typical for zzso zzso zzso zzso is significantly less zzso It is not fully folded at 25 degrees C, and at all temperatures it shows broadened zzso zzso zzso zzso provide evidence that this is due to an equilibrium between zzso and unfolded molecules rather than formation of a molten zzso The fraction of zzso molecules which are folded appear to adopt the same structure as the full-length zzso Thus, although more than the 33 zzso core is required to form a fully stable native structure, the entire sequence is not required for zzso
