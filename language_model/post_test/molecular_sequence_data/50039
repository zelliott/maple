To date, there have been no reports on the effect on disc cells of the zzso disc zzso of the zzso terminal zzso of link protein zzso zzso N) which is generated by the zzso of human link protein by zzso 1 and 2, zzso A and B, and zzso between zzso and zzso However, link N has been shown to act as a growth factor and stimulate synthesis of zzso and collagen by zzso of human zzso zzso There are also no studies on the effect of link N on type IX collagen in any zzso In the studies reported here, a zzso zzso culture system has been used to examine whether link N can play a role in maintaining the integrity of disc zzso specifically at the level of zzso assembly by cells of the zzso Using this culture system, we determined the capacity of link N to stimulate zzso of these zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso and nucleus zzso zzso Gross inspection of separate zzso and zzso zzso cultures in the absence of link N revealed a progressive increase in size and a transition from zzso to zzso zzso after zzso zzso of 10 zzso link N resulted in increased zzso sizes for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso N increased zzso type II and type IX collagen contents with an increase in DNA content over zzso This study demonstrates that link N can act directly on disc cells to stimulate zzso production, which involves increased zzso of zzso and types II and IX zzso This study also identifies the value of zzso cultures for studies of the zzso cells in a zzso chemically defined zzso in which zzso can continue growing in size in response to growth factors with minimal cell zzso zzso N may have value in stimulating the growth and zzso of the damaged zzso
