zzso in the cardiac zzso type 2 zzso zzso gene are associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that these zzso could be detected at autopsy in cases of zzso sudden zzso Fourteen sudden death patients, eight males and six zzso were studied at autopsy based on apparent sudden cardiac death, without significant anatomical zzso The coding regions of zzso genes were amplified by zzso chain reaction and directly zzso Three novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified in three unrelated patients zzso males and one zzso mean age at death, 12 zzso 2 zzso all performing zzso activity at the time of death or zzso These zzso were located in highly zzso regions where zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso in the zzso gene was detected in a female with known family history of zzso and sudden cardiac death, no other zzso were found in any of the 14 cases, and no other zzso was found in 200 zzso The absence of structural cardiac disease in physical zzso sudden death and the finding of three novel zzso zzso suggest that zzso screening in such cases should include zzso
