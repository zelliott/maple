Produced by many zzso zzso zzso are biologically important zzso zzso that have been associated with zzso formation, host cell zzso and invasion, and immune system zzso zzso is the major zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso We have characterized the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso across the outer zzso Directed zzso of zzso confirmed that its activity is dependent on zzso to the outer zzso zzso zzso electron zzso of zzso zzso suggested that this protein assembles into an zzso complex with an apparent central zzso zzso zzso complexes were confirmed using zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso demonstrated that zzso of zzso rendered zzso coli susceptible to the zzso zzso A zzso sequence at the zzso of zzso was sufficient to direct zzso proteins to the zzso zzso zzso Finally, we determined that zzso zzso in an outer membrane complex with two other zzso assembly zzso zzso and zzso
