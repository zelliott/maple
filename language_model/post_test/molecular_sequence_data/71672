In this work we examine the role of three genetic control components in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso element zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso Tax, and the three zzso elements zzso We demonstrate that the in zzso efficiency of the zzso promoter zzso expression in cell culture depends on the spacing between the three zzso zzso located at the zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso whereas the level of zzso zzso zzso by Tax is affected by the number of zzso In the presence of only one zzso the enhancement of expression by Tax is affected by the distance between the single zzso and the zzso start zzso Following zzso binding to the zzso additional zzso I hypersensitive sites are generated in the region between the two zzso zzso (I and zzso while in the presence of Tax, such sites are generated also in the region between zzso II and zzso Neither cooperative binding of zzso to the zzso nor preferential binding of zzso to a particular zzso was zzso Tax binding to the zzso complex does not change the zzso I protection zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is determined by the number and the position of the viral zzso relative to each zzso Tax protein zzso the zzso complex and suppresses the spacing limitations, probably by bridging between the zzso complexes and the zzso initiation zzso zzso
