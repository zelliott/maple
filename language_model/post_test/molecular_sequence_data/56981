We have cloned and zzso DNA from zzso coli that, when present in a zzso zzso zzso resistance to the zzso antibiotic, zzso zzso The DNA includes a zzso open reading frame zzso disruption of which results in the loss of zzso zzso This zzso contains the zzso zzso Studies using the zzso expression system reveal that a zzso of 31 zzso is produced from this cloned zzso The zzso maps at zzso zzso on the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso comparison between the translated zzso and a protein database reveal between zzso and zzso zzso sequence zzso to bacterial zzso zzso proteins including those zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resistance and an zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using the zzso program showed the zzso gene product zzso had zzso with the zzso regions of the zzso and zzso proteins and weak zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles of the zzso protein and zzso products show a striking zzso both having twelve predicted TM zzso
