zzso are an extraordinarily diverse group of animals with an estimated 200,000 species, second only to the zzso zzso We conducted a comparative analysis of complete zzso zzso large zzso sequences zzso of a zzso two zzso six zzso and a zzso In addition, we determined secondary structure models for each of zzso Comparative analyses of zzso variation revealed substantial length variation among the zzso with zzso zzso possessing the shortest zzso zzso analyses of the zzso sequence data supported the zzso of zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso and when only zzso are included, the zzso The zzso limits of the zzso zzso zzso gene within zzso appear to be up to 400 million years, although this estimate will have to be tested further with additional zzso Our most novel finding was the discovery of zzso signal in the secondary structure of zzso of zzso The absence of entire zzso structures in zzso II, III, and V can be viewed as three shared derived characters uniting the zzso zzso The absence of the aforementioned zzso structure explains much of the observed length variation of the zzso zzso zzso found within zzso The distribution of these unique secondary structure characters within zzso should be zzso
