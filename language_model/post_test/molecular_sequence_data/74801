zzso zzso a plant zzso of zzso binding zzso controls the polar zzso of leaf cells and the zzso pattern in zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso was used to isolate an zzso of zzso referred to as zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids that shows striking sequence similarity to AN proteins from other zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence has a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso motif and a plant zzso zzso motif at its zzso as well as a zzso long zzso zzso The zzso gene is a zzso gene that is expressed in all zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso rescued the leaf zzso and zzso pattern defects in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso showing that the zzso gene has effects complementary to those of zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene has the same function as the AN zzso
