The structures of the model zzso that mimic the consecutive stages in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso have been analyzed by the zzso zzso method, partial zzso with specific zzso and chemical zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso segments are found to be present in the final folded forms in which they exist in the full-length zzso However, the region corresponding to the central hairpin forms another zzso stable hairpin zzso Its correct folding requires the presence of a zzso zzso sequence and the formation of zzso zzso This confirms the zzso structure of the zzso type and points to the crucial role of zzso zzso in its overall zzso Moreover, we show that the zzso region can be specifically zzso in the presence of selected zzso metal zzso in the full-length transcript, but not in a shorter one lacking six zzso zzso which cannot form the zzso zzso Thus, a particular zzso zzso around that zzso site is required for specific zzso and the zzso region seems to be involved in the formation of a general metal zzso binding zzso Recently, it has been proposed that, in the zzso zzso a four zzso sequence within the zzso region may contribute to the folding pathway, being part of a mechanism responsible for controlling zzso zzso zzso Our study shows that in the zzso zzso the central hairpin region may contribute to a similar zzso providing a barrier to the formation of an active structure in the zzso folding zzso
