Current methods developed for predicting protein structure are zzso The most widely used zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso et al for predicting secondary structure are compared to the most recent ones including sequence similarity methods, neural network, pattern recognition or joint prediction zzso The best of these methods correctly predict zzso of the zzso in the database with zzso for 3 zzso zzso beta strand and coli with a standard zzso of zzso per zzso However, when a zzso protein is already in the database, the accuracy of prediction by the similarity zzso method of Levin and zzso reaches about zzso Some conclusions can be drawn on the mechanism of protein zzso As all the prediction methods only use the local sequence for prediction zzso 8 zzso zzso one can zzso that zzso of the zzso of a zzso is dictated on average by the local zzso the rest is brought by the zzso The best predicted proteins or zzso segments are those for which the folding has less effect on the zzso zzso prediction of zzso structure is only of practical use when the structure of a zzso protein is already zzso zzso acid alignment to define zzso of equivalent spatial position is critical for zzso of the zzso We showed for zzso zzso that secondary structure prediction can help to define a better zzso zzso segments of the zzso chain, such as zzso libraries of known zzso and/or energy zzso with various force fields, are used without yet giving satisfactory zzso An example of zzso by zzso aided by secondary structure prediction on 2 regulatory zzso zzso and zzso is zzso
