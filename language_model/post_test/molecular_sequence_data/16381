zzso zzso involving zzso heavy chain zzso switch regions and an zzso such as zzso represent initiating events in the development of many B cell zzso These zzso are widely thought to result from zzso zzso zzso To test this model, we measured zzso in mice deficient in zzso zzso zzso zzso that lack zzso zzso We found that AID made no measurable contribution to the generation of initial zzso indicating that the intrinsic fragility of the switch regions or a zzso unrelated to AID is responsible for these zzso In contrast, the outgrowth of zzso cells was dependent on zzso raising the possibility that AID is important in tumor zzso perhaps by virtue of its zzso zzso
