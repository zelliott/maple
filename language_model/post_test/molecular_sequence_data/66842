In protein structure space, protein structures cluster into four zzso regions when mapped based solely on similarity among the zzso zzso These four regions zzso to the four major classes of zzso proteins defined by the contents of secondary structure types and their zzso zzso Evolution of and restriction to these four classes suggest that, in most cases, the evolution of genes may have been constrained or selected to those genetic changes that results in structurally stable proteins occupying one of the four zzso regions of the protein structure space, zzso zzso an important component of natural selection in gene zzso Our studies on tracing the zzso structural zzso for each protein sequence family of known structure suggest that: zzso recently emerged proteins belong mostly to three zzso zzso the proteins that emerged earlier evolved to gain a new zzso and zzso the proteins that emerged earliest evolved to become the zzso proteins in the four major classes, with the zzso proteins becoming the most dominant zzso Furthermore, our studies also show that not all zzso proteins evolved from one single set of proteins in the last common ancestral zzso but new common ancestral proteins were zzso at different evolutionary times, not traceable to one or two ancestral zzso zzso multiple birth zzso for the evolution of protein sequence zzso
