The formation of zzso by the action of zzso zzso plays a crucial role in membrane zzso zzso including the plasma membrane of zzso In human, five zzso zzso zzso zzso genes have been identified with as many as 3 different transcript zzso for zzso 

zzso zzso zzso member 6 zzso is responsible for zzso of zzso fatty acids in zzso Two additional transcript zzso were also isolated from brain and zzso We report the expression in zzso of two new zzso and of the one isolated from zzso All three represented different spliced zzso of a mutually exclusive zzso zzso They zzso a slightly different short motif which contains a zzso structural domain, the fatty acid Gate zzso The motifs differ in the presence of either the aromatic zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Based on zzso two new zzso for the closely related zzso were predicted and zzso One represented a switch of the zzso to the zzso domain zzso the other resulted from the exclusion of zzso zzso of this motif also appears to be common in all zzso zzso member 1 and 6 zzso 

We propose that a zzso to zzso substitution or deletion of the Gate domain, is the structural reason for the zzso alternative zzso that affects these zzso Our findings support our hypothesis that this region is structurally important to define the activity of these zzso
