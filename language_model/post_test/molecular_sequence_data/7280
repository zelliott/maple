Most zzso zzso binding proteins zzso possess an zzso zzso zzso whose zzso group can be zzso zzso The zzso analog zzso zzso zzso zzso a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso introduced into zzso zzso zzso cells doubled the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso (10 zzso zzso or 100 zzso zzso gamma zzso insulin zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was less potent while zzso was zzso zzso action on zzso did not involve zzso of zzso zzso since zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso an inefficient inhibitor of zzso in zzso cell zzso was as potent as zzso in stimulating zzso zzso zzso a general inhibitor of zzso zzso did not alter zzso or zzso gamma zzso zzso while zzso zzso insulin zzso The binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso protein or zzso was not affected by the zzso zzso zzso or AFC had the same effect on insulin release as a synthetic zzso mimicking the zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the action on zzso of the combination of zzso and zzso was not zzso We propose that the zzso and the zzso zzso influence zzso by affecting the association of zzso with different proteins of the zzso machinery of zzso zzso
