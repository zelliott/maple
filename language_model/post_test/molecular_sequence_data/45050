zzso of the cell cycle is a common strategy employed by many DNA and zzso viruses to trap and exploit the host cell machinery toward their own zzso In many zzso the zzso protein (N zzso has been shown to inhibit cell cycle progression although the mechanism behind this is poorly zzso The N protein of severe acute respiratory zzso zzso bears signature motifs for binding to zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and has recently been reported by us to get zzso by the zzso complex zzso zzso Kumar, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Chow, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2005) zzso zzso 79, zzso In the present study, we prove that the N protein of zzso can inhibit S phase progression in zzso cell zzso N protein expression was found to directly inhibit the activity of the zzso complex, resulting in zzso of zzso protein with a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso under such conditions could restore the expression of S phase zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso N protein identified the mechanism of zzso of zzso and zzso activity to be zzso Whereas N protein could directly bind to zzso D and inhibit the activity of zzso D complex; zzso of zzso activity appeared to be achieved in two different ways: indirectly by zzso of protein levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso A and by direct binding of N protein to zzso zzso zzso of zzso targets was also observed in zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the S phase zzso activity of the N protein may have major significance during viral zzso
