The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a complex cycle of growth and development in which zzso differentiation zzso with the zzso of the orphan response regulator zzso and the zzso of a zzso zzso called zzso zzso is a zzso zzso derived from the product of the zzso gene that promotes formation of aerial zzso by breaking the zzso tension on the surface of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso is delayed in aerial zzso formation while zzso zzso of zzso zzso aerial zzso formation in the zzso strain and restores zzso zzso and aerial zzso formation in all zzso zzso zzso zzso Using DNA zzso to globally identify zzso zzso genes whose zzso was affected by zzso zzso or zzso we discovered a zzso locus of zzso zzso zzso genes that zzso both aerial zzso formation and zzso The genes of this cluster of zzso genes zzso which are zzso distant from previously known zzso zzso include: zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso two zzso of an ABC zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso mapping and zzso binding experiments indicate that zzso activates zzso zzso directly, by binding to three sequence motifs in the zzso promoter zzso A constructed zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso and erect aerial zzso however, these zzso were unusually zzso reminiscent of zzso zzso zzso stages of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The role of zzso in aerial zzso formation was shown both by zzso zzso aerial zzso formation in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso synthesis of an activity allowing aerial zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso locus activates a zzso zzso zzso that is involved in both aerial zzso formation and zzso serving to integrate sequential zzso zzso
