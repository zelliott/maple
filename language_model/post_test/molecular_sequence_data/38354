From muscle extracts of the European zzso zzso zzso an zzso factor, zzso was zzso by ammonium zzso zzso followed by zzso on zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso was achieved with an overall yield of zzso in zzso zzso The molecular weight of zzso determined by gel zzso was zzso 1000 zzso zzso of zzso under reducing conditions indicates that it consists of two types of zzso alpha and zzso with molecular weights of 37 and 35 zzso respectively, in a ratio of zzso In the presence of 6 M zzso zzso zzso into zzso and zzso zzso From these results the zzso assembling of zzso has been formulated as zzso The molecular weight of the zzso and of the zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso mass zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso activity of the major zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso Complete zzso was achieved in an zzso mixture of inhibitor and zzso suggesting an zzso zzso zzso is not zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso it was characterized to be a zzso zzso In zzso flower zzso structures characteristic for some animal zzso were zzso zzso acid sequence analysis indicated that both zzso are almost identical and are composed of common zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to proteins of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
