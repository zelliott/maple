The interactions established at the zzso site during zzso assembly are likely to be important for both precise recognition of the upstream zzso boundary and for positioning this site in the active center of the zzso Definition of the zzso and the zzso interactions at the zzso zzso site would be facilitated by the use of a small zzso amenable to modification during chemical zzso We describe a zzso reaction performed in zzso zzso extracts in which the zzso zzso site and the 3' zzso site are on separate zzso The zzso contributing the zzso zzso site is only 20 zzso long and was zzso zzso The zzso reaction is accurate and has the same zzso zzso and zzso requirements as zzso We also report how zzso zzso around the zzso site affect zzso zzso
