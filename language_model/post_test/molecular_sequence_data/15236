The liver fluke zzso zzso is classified as a class I zzso due to the association between zzso and chronic zzso zzso zzso During its feeding activity within the zzso zzso the zzso zzso several zzso F zzso zzso that may induce or contribute to the zzso associated with zzso zzso 

Here, we describe the zzso gene organization, zzso zzso zzso and functional characterization of the zzso F zzso zzso zzso here termed zzso from zzso zzso The full length zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso consisting of a predicted signal zzso (18 zzso zzso zzso zzso (95 zzso and mature zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using the zzso protein as the query revealed that the zzso shared identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso of other zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and with zzso zzso F zzso zzso zzso the zzso were detected in all zzso stages that zzso the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of approximately 3 zzso in zzso included seven zzso interrupted by six zzso the zzso ranged from 69 to 267 zzso in zzso the zzso from 43 to 1,060 zzso The six zzso boundaries of zzso were zzso with zzso boundaries in the human zzso F zzso although the gene structure of human zzso F is more zzso Unlike zzso human zzso F zzso includes a zzso domain in the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the fluke, human, and other zzso zzso zzso together in a zzso discrete from the zzso L zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso that displayed low-level activity was expressed in the zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso did not zzso process and activate to a mature zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso L zzso the zzso of zzso releasing a mature zzso F with activity against the zzso zzso zzso times that of the zzso zzso using zzso raised against the zzso zzso showed that zzso is expressed in the gut of the mature zzso fluke and also in the zzso structures, including zzso zzso egg, and zzso zzso was detected in zzso duct zzso cells surrounding the zzso several weeks after infection of zzso with zzso zzso and, in addition, had accumulated in the secondary zzso zzso ducts where zzso cannot reach due to their large zzso 

A zzso F zzso zzso of the human liver fluke zzso zzso has been characterized at the gene and protein zzso zzso of this zzso may contribute to the zzso zzso including zzso observed in individuals infected with this zzso
