The zzso resistance zzso on zzso zzso from an avian strain of zzso zzso mediates zzso resistance by a regulated active zzso zzso DNA coding for the zzso did not zzso at high stringency with DNA representing a group of common zzso resistance zzso The DNA zzso zzso revealed a structural gene and a zzso gene which had significant zzso to zzso sequence similarities with previously described classes of zzso zzso resistance genes from members of the family zzso The new zzso has been assigned to class zzso
