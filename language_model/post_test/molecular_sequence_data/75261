A zzso untranslated region is shown to be present within the coding sequence of zzso coli zzso T4 gene 60, which encodes one of the zzso for its type II DNA zzso This interruption is part of the transcribed zzso zzso and appears not to be removed before zzso Thus, the usual zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso protein sequence apparently does not exist in this zzso The interruption is bracketed by a direct repeat of five base zzso A mechanism is proposed in which folding of the untranslated region brings together zzso separated by the interruption so that the zzso zzso may skip the 50 zzso during zzso The alternative possibility, that the protein is efficiently translated from a very minor and zzso form of processed zzso zzso seems unlikely, but has not been completely ruled zzso
