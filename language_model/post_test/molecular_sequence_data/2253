The zzso zzso increasing protein zzso is a zzso zzso protein isolated from zzso of zzso zzso A full-length zzso clone zzso human zzso has been isolated and the derived zzso acid sequence reveals a structure that is consistent with previously determined biological zzso zzso may be organized into two zzso the zzso half, previously shown to contain all known zzso activity, contains a large fraction of basic and zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso half contains more zzso than basic zzso and includes several potential zzso regions which may anchor the zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso action of zzso is limited to many species of zzso zzso this specificity may be explained by a strong affinity of the very basic zzso half for the zzso charged zzso that are unique to the zzso bacterial zzso The zzso end of zzso exhibits significant similarity with the sequence of a rabbit zzso zzso suggesting that both molecules share a similar structure for binding zzso
