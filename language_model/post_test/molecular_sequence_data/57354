In addition to zzso zzso I and II, old cultures of zzso zzso zzso into the culture medium a new zzso material that exhibited zzso zzso The new zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso It turned out to be a zzso whose protein portion was identical to that of the other two zzso in terms of zzso properties, size, zzso acid composition and zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso of the structural gene zzso zzso I and II resulted in a strain unable to zzso all three zzso zzso was indistinguishable in terms of molecular weight from the single intermediate detected during the zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso Thus, the new zzso contains only one of the two slightly zzso zzso inner zzso present in zzso zzso Two zzso were, however, detected when the zzso of zzso was monitored by zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso indicated that the major zzso which zzso at about the same position as zzso zzso corresponded to protein molecules carrying the zzso attached to the zzso of the second zzso whereas the minor one carried the zzso in the first potential zzso zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that zzso is a zzso product resulting from an imbalance between the rate of protein synthesis and the zzso capabilities of the zzso zzso
