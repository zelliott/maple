We isolated and characterized a green fluorescent protein zzso from the sea cactus zzso zzso This zzso exists as a zzso and has zzso zzso at 388 and zzso zzso zzso at 388 zzso leads to blue zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH 5 and below, and green zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH 7 and above, and the zzso is remarkably stable at pH zzso zzso at zzso zzso leads to green zzso zzso zzso zzso from pH 5 to pH zzso We introduced five zzso acid zzso so that this zzso formed zzso rather than zzso and then used this zzso form to zzso zzso pH change during the zzso of living cells by use of zzso zzso The zzso pH change is zzso by use of a simple zzso zzso filter with zzso zzso which is technically easier to use than zzso fluorescent proteins that require zzso zzso
