Four strains of potato virus Y, zzso zzso zzso and zzso obtained from different Australian sources were compared on the basis of their zzso zzso and coat protein structural zzso Each of the strains could be distinguished on the basis of their reactions on selected test plant zzso Two of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced symptoms similar to those produced by the zzso strain zzso The reactions of zzso and zzso although comparable to zzso in some zzso did not completely match the description of the zzso strain zzso In contrast to the other three zzso zzso could not be transmitted by zzso zzso in repeated zzso No difference was observed in the zzso properties of the four zzso strains in different zzso systems, using zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the coat proteins of zzso zzso and zzso were obtained and compared with the coat protein sequences of pepper zzso virus zzso zzso zzso Allison zzso Parks zzso Johnston zzso zzso zzso Armstrong FB zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso between the zzso strains ranged from zzso to zzso and with the zzso zzso zzso to zzso Based on this high sequence zzso and the previous observation that coat protein sequences of zzso strains are always greater than zzso zzso zzso could be considered a strain of zzso However, zzso and zzso are reported to be only zzso zzso related and on this basis zzso is currently considered to be an independent member of the zzso zzso
