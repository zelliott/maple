zzso element zzso genes comprise a significant portion of the gene catalog of zzso although their functions are insufficiently zzso The recent availability of zzso gene zzso from the complete zzso sequence of rice zzso zzso has created an opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the zzso activities of these potentially mobile elements and their related zzso 

We conducted a zzso survey of the zzso activity of zzso genes associated with 15 zzso stages and stress zzso This zzso was obtained using a zzso encompassing zzso unique zzso rice zzso which were represented by zzso zzso that were free from zzso We found that zzso genes exhibit much lower zzso activities than do zzso zzso although representative transcripts were detected from all zzso of both type I and II zzso zzso The strongest zzso activities were detected in zzso genes from among the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses suggest that zzso zzso genes tend to form zzso with active zzso In addition, zzso regulations through zzso and DNA zzso as well as enrichment of certain zzso elements in the zzso appear to contribute to the zzso zzso of representative zzso zzso 

Our findings reveal clear, albeit low, general zzso of zzso zzso In combination with zzso analysis, zzso analysis has the potential to lead to the identification of zzso zzso with adapted host zzso
