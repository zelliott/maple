The gene for the zzso surface zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso type 6) was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of the gene zzso and its zzso regions was determined and found to include only one major open reading frame coding for a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso The N zzso of the deduced protein sequence exhibits features of a typical signal zzso and the zzso segment was found to have a high degree of zzso with the membrane anchor region of other zzso surface zzso such as zzso M zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso A zzso having the consensus sequence zzso and located immediately upstream of the zzso zzso segment showed the highest degree of conservation at both the protein and DNA levels, with nearly all reported surface proteins from zzso zzso The zzso acid composition of the zzso protein revealed zzso zzso and zzso zzso distributed nearly regularly throughout the zzso and analysis of the secondary structure predicted a zzso composed of greater than zzso zzso potential interrupted by zzso or random zzso zzso experiments in zzso coli show very little zzso protein in the zzso zzso When found here, however, this zzso protein had a molecular mass of 55 zzso similar to that extracted from the zzso by zzso zzso Most of the zzso protein was found localized in the membrane zzso where it was composed of a triple band of 60, 58, and 57 zzso The coexistence of zzso surface proteins which are either resistant zzso zzso or sensitive zzso zzso to zzso zzso may offer a new dimension to the zzso of these zzso under specific biological zzso
