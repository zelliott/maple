Two zzso containing genes zzso zzso zzso were mapped on the second and third zzso of zzso The two gene clusters located on different zzso differed in the length of the zzso zzso separating the zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso contained a variable number of zzso tandem zzso The distribution of zzso genes between these two clusters and their copy number varied widely between zzso and doubled zzso derived from a cross between two barley zzso However, this variation had no obvious effect on plant zzso
