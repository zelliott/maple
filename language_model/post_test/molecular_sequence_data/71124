zzso dynamics play an important role in protein function and regulation of zzso zzso To determine how additional interactions with surrounding structure affects local protein zzso we have used hydrogen exchange and mass zzso to investigate the zzso and zzso zzso of the protein zzso zzso zzso Exchange rates of isolated zzso zzso and zzso zzso were compared with rates for the same zzso when part of a larger zzso zzso Increased zzso incorporation was observed for the zzso domain in the joint zzso particularly near the zzso interface and the short sequence that connects zzso to zzso zzso greater flexibility of zzso when it is part of zzso Slow cooperative unfolding of the zzso domain occurred at the same rate in isolated zzso as in the zzso zzso suggesting a functional significance for this zzso The zzso domain displayed relatively smaller changes in flexibility when part of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso influence each zzso Further, our results imply a link between functional regulation and structural dynamics of zzso and zzso zzso
