Clinical isolate zzso zzso zzso showed resistance both to zzso zzso and to zzso We detected a typical zzso zzso image when zzso or zzso was placed next to a zzso acid disk on an zzso zzso This resistance zzso suggested the presence of an zzso zzso zzso focusing revealed that this strain produced three zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso named zzso had a relative molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso has a broad zzso profile, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso Its activity was totally inhibited by zzso acid at 2 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was noticeable with the partially zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein which has weak identity with all class D zzso except zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid identity, zzso zzso is likely to be zzso zzso since no zzso was found in the strain and because attempts to transfer the resistance marker zzso zzso is peculiar since it is a class D zzso which zzso high resistance to zzso zzso and seems to have unique zzso properties among zzso A zzso
