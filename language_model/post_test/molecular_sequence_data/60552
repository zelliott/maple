The effect of zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso pit zzso on the whole cell current response zzso to zzso acid zzso was examined for zzso freshly isolated from the nucleus zzso of 3- to zzso zzso zzso depressed zzso induced by zzso zzso of zzso the zzso for zzso induced by 10 zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso This concentration of zzso shifted the zzso zzso curve to the right in a parallel manner, increasing the zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was greater at negative holding zzso zzso also inhibited zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso state appeared to zzso zzso zzso sensitivity to the zzso effect of zzso since dialysis of zzso with zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso A, prevented zzso The data are discussed in terms of zzso influences on the zzso composition of zzso receptors in zzso of the nucleus zzso
