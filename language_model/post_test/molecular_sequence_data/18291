A strain of tobacco mosaic virus zzso that produces mild zzso symptoms on tobacco plants has been zzso cloned to identify the region of the zzso responsible for symptom zzso A full-length zzso clone whose transcripts produce the parental disease zzso on both systemic and hypersensitive host plants has been zzso This infectious clone was zzso and 55 base changes relative to the published sequence of common zzso zzso zzso were zzso These changes resulted in 12 zzso acid zzso in the open reading frames zzso the zzso and zzso movement zzso two of these changes were determined not to be responsible for the attenuated zzso Exchange of restriction fragments between the infectious mild strain zzso and an infectious zzso strain zzso indicated that the zzso involved in symptom zzso reside in the open reading frame zzso the zzso proteins of zzso these proteins are involved in viral zzso
