The DNA context of zzso that a protein recognizes can influence the strength of the zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso understanding the quantitative differences in binding affinities that result in part from the DNA context is often important in describing regulatory zzso Nevertheless, these issues have not been a major focus yet for the investigation of zzso interactions in zzso In this study, we explored the binding specificity and the range of affinities that the zzso zzso zzso zzso has for zzso Because zzso binding sites are positioned near several different zzso zzso such quantitative information may be important to understand zzso regulatory mechanisms in zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso were used to zzso the affinities of the zzso binding sites in the viral zzso In the process, five sites were discovered, which, on the basis of zzso had not been predicted previously to interact with the zzso zzso zzso and kinetic studies show that the range of zzso affinities of the 17 sites varied over zzso The sequence elements responsible for zzso recognition of DNA were determined by missing contact analysis of several sites and a point zzso analysis of one zzso The results presented show that the affinity of an zzso binding site is to a large extent determined by the availability of specific zzso but the data also strongly suggest that DNA structure plays an important zzso
