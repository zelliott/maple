zzso acid zzso together with zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that acts on zzso receptors to evoke multiple cellular responses, including zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso In this study, we isolated a human zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso designated zzso and characterized it as a cellular zzso for zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein is zzso and zzso identical to those of the human functional zzso receptors zzso and zzso respectively, previously zzso zzso zzso but not other zzso induced an increase in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Other zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso the zzso response by zzso when expressed in zzso zzso zzso with an zzso fatty acid but not with a saturated fatty acid induced an increase in the zzso of zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso with both saturated and zzso fatty acids zzso a zzso response in zzso cells expressing zzso In zzso or zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso levels, which was not observed in zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso Neither the zzso nor zzso zzso response or zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that zzso a new member of the zzso family of zzso zzso is a specific zzso zzso that shows distinct properties from known cloned zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso response, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
