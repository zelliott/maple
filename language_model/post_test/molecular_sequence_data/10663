zzso bacteria associated with the zzso zzso are separated into two closely related species named zzso zzso and zzso zzso To discriminate rapidly between these two bacterial species, two zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso were designed from the alignment of zzso zzso sequences to differentiate zzso zzso from zzso zzso Their zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso experiments on 25 reference strains representing 13 species of zzso and zzso and by comparison with all zzso zzso sequences available in the zzso data zzso No zzso was found with zzso which was thus considered species specific for zzso zzso By contrast, as expected according to the zzso zzso sequence zzso the labeled zzso probe zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not with the DNA of zzso zzso Since zzso zzso and zzso zzso do not zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be routinely used to characterize the two zzso species zzso zzso from pure cultures or from zzso root zzso Fifty strains isolated from eight annual zzso species were then characterized by using colony zzso zzso zzso was more frequently obtained zzso zzso zzso than was zzso zzso Both zzso species seemed to be trapped by annual zzso and no zzso specificity was zzso
