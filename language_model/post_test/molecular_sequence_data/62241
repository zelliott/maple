Plant plasma membrane intrinsic proteins zzso cluster in two evolutionary subgroups, zzso and zzso with different zzso activities when expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not increase the zzso water zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso of the zzso zzso and the functional zzso zzso or zzso resulted in an increase in zzso that was dependent on the amount of injected zzso complementary zzso zzso analysis of zzso expressing zzso fluorescent protein zzso alone or zzso plus zzso showed that the amount of zzso present in the plasma membrane was significantly greater in zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso zzso of zzso fused to a His tag zzso with zzso demonstrated physical interaction and zzso of both zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso and zzso did not result in a greater increase in zzso than did the expression of zzso alone, but zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso induced a zzso increase, indicating that zzso zzso zzso is required for both of them to act as functional water zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the important role of the zzso part of loop E in zzso interaction and water channel activity zzso This study has revealed a new mechanism of plant zzso regulation that might be important in plant water zzso
