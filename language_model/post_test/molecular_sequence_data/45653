In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso initiation network zzso is required for stabilization of the zzso ring in late zzso as well as for ring zzso and zzso zzso In a genetic screen for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we isolated a zzso zzso in the zzso factor zzso Both zzso and zzso show defects in cell zzso and both can rescue the growth defects of some zzso zzso at low restrictive temperatures, where the zzso single zzso lyse at the time of zzso By detailed analysis of the formation and zzso of the zzso ring and zzso in the zzso zzso at low restrictive temperatures, we show that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is likely due to a weak cell wall and zzso combined with zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso with the recent findings that zzso controls zzso of genes involved in cell zzso we show that disruption of some of these genes can also rescue zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso having defects in zzso formation, many zzso zzso can be rescued at the low restrictive temperature by the zzso stabilizer zzso The small zzso zzso is known to promote cell wall formation, and we find that zzso expressed from a zzso zzso can also rescue zzso at the low restrictive zzso Together these results suggest that the zzso has a role in promoting proper cell wall formation at the division zzso
