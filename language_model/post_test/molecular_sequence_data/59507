The zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso expressed selectively on high zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso directs zzso traffic by binding the zzso zzso patch zzso zzso zzso alpha 4 beta zzso zzso DNA zzso human zzso was obtained by combining sequences from an expressed sequence tag zzso identified in an early stage human brain zzso library, a zzso chain zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed an 18 zzso acid signal zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in sequence with those of the mouse zzso an 86 zzso acid zzso region rich in zzso zzso a 20 zzso acid zzso domain and a 43 zzso acid charged zzso zzso No counterpart to the third zzso domain of mouse zzso was zzso however, the zzso zzso domain was extended as two distinguishable major and minor zzso regions unrelated to the mouse zzso The major domain is formed from six tandem repeats of an eight zzso acid sequence having the zzso consensus zzso Human zzso zzso transcripts were restricted to small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso spliced zzso zzso were identified that lack parts of the second zzso domain and all or part of the major zzso domain, indicating that the function of this vascular zzso is regulated by extensive modifications to its zzso zzso
