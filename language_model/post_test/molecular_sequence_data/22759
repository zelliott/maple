The Colombian scorpion zzso zzso is toxic to humans and is capable of producing fatal zzso but nothing is known about its zzso zzso This communication reports the separation of at least 57 zzso from the zzso by high performance liquid zzso From these, at least 104 distinct molecular weight compounds were identified by mass zzso zzso The complete zzso acid sequences of three peptides were determined and the partial sequences of three others were also zzso zzso experiments conducted with zzso expressed zzso on zzso cells showed the presence of a potent Shaker B zzso zzso This zzso zzso name zzso contains 23 zzso acid zzso closely packed by three zzso bridges with a molecular mass of zzso atomic mass zzso It is the third member of the zzso 13, for which the systematic name is proposed to be zzso The mice zzso showed clearly the presence of toxic peptides to zzso One of them named zzso containing 65 zzso acid zzso with molecular mass of zzso atomic mass units, is stabilized by four zzso zzso It was shown to modify the zzso of zzso and zzso cells in culture, similar to the beta scorpion zzso These results demonstrate the presence of toxic peptides in the zzso of zzso zzso and confirm that accidents with this species of scorpion should be considered an important human hazard in zzso
