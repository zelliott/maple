The zzso genes of zzso of two families with familial isolated zzso zzso zzso were zzso Double stranded sequencing of the zzso chain reaction zzso amplification products from zzso DNA of two affected cousins in a zzso Turkish family revealed a zzso transition in the 20th zzso of the zzso signal zzso This substitution converts a zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso and generates a new zzso recognition zzso zzso amplification of the zzso zzso of family members, followed by zzso zzso revealed that the zzso transition zzso with the zzso zzso In a Saudi Arabian family, a zzso zzso was found that alters the first base of the donor zzso site of zzso zzso This substitution should zzso zzso zzso resulting in an altered protein product which should be unstable or zzso This zzso also destroys an zzso site, which was used to zzso samples from zzso zzso of zzso amplification products with zzso demonstrated zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso These results demonstrate that familial zzso is a zzso disease that zzso different steps in the expression of the zzso zzso
