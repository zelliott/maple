The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso regulates expression of the zzso zzso genes of several zzso by binding zzso zzso The binding sequence is composed of zzso zzso repeats, predominantly zzso separated by two or three zzso zzso Here we present the crystal structure of a complex of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso revealing that each zzso is zzso in a binding pocket formed by zzso In the complex, the zzso has an extended structure without any zzso and binds to the protein mostly by specific zzso zzso Eleven binding pockets on the circular zzso zzso form a belt with a diameter of about 80 zzso This simple but elegant mechanism of arresting the zzso segment by zzso it around a protein disk is zzso to both transcription, when zzso binds the nascent zzso and to translation, when zzso binds the same sequence within a zzso leader region of the zzso zzso
