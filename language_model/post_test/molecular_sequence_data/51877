In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pairing is zzso by the zzso organizers zzso which are located in the X zzso zzso and near the Y zzso zzso for zzso disrupt zzso zzso pairing and cause high zzso of zzso zzso zzso of cloned zzso genes on an zzso zzso partially restores normal zzso pairing and zzso To map the sequences within an zzso zzso zzso gene responsible for stimulating zzso zzso partial deletions were generated by P zzso zzso of the zzso Complete deletions of the zzso zzso unit did not interfere with the ability to stimulate zzso pairing as long as most of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Within groups of deletions that lacked the entire zzso unit and differed only in length of residual zzso material, pairing ability was zzso to the dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the complete zzso zzso unit or the zzso sequences alone blocked zzso formation, as determined by binding of an zzso zzso yet did not interfere with pairing ability, suggesting that zzso pairing may not be mechanistically related to zzso zzso A model for zzso pairing in zzso males based upon the combined action of zzso I and a strand zzso is zzso
