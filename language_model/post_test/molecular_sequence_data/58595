We have determined the zzso structure of the human zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso gene zzso The transcript is assembled from five zzso which are separated by zzso ranging in size from 93 zzso to zzso zzso The two zzso zzso are entirely contained in the first and second zzso respectively, while the zzso is split into zzso three and zzso This structure closely parallels the organization of other mouse and human zzso genes whose zzso structure is zzso An exception is the mouse and human zzso zzso whose zzso does not contain zzso An zzso at the same position also occurs in the zzso 1 gene as well as in other zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso suggesting that this zzso zzso represents an ancestral event, from which zzso genes of different families zzso In this context, evolution of the zzso gene family probably involved the zzso of this zzso zzso in the proximity of a zzso zzso while zzso genes were formed either by the zzso of an zzso zzso to the same zzso domain or, zzso by zzso loss during their zzso
