The heart zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein in the zzso is a component of the particulate zzso that activates the zzso zzso prior to its transformation into zzso within the zzso canal and zzso zzso tract of the zzso The role of zzso in this process has yet to be determined, in part because of the limited amount of material available for zzso To overcome this liability, a zzso zzso to zzso has been used to recognize proteins expressed by zzso zzso The isolated zzso zzso an zzso consistent with previously published zzso zzso zzso profiles of these clones by in zzso zzso revealed zzso in areas of the heart that expressed zzso by zzso Taken together, these results suggest that these zzso which represent an expressed sequence tag for zzso should provide the basis for zzso a full-length zzso of zzso a prerequisite for determining the functional role of this protein in heart zzso
