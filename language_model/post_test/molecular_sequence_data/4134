zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso the second step in the zzso of various classes of zzso zzso zzso Based on the comparison of zzso sequences of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso for zzso were designed and the zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso cell suspension zzso The active zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso to zzso Analysis of its deduced zzso sequence assigned the zzso from zzso zzso to family 1 of zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso from zzso zzso the zzso from zzso zzso is predicted to lack an zzso zzso signal zzso which is believed to direct proteins to the zzso zzso The temperature and pH zzso zzso kinetic parameters and zzso specificity of the zzso expressed zzso were studied and compared to those of the zzso zzso zzso revealing some differences between the two zzso In zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso proceeds by the same mechanism as has been shown for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The reaction gives rise to the end product zzso and involves zzso zzso as an zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso leads to several zzso One of them was identified as a new compound, zzso zzso From the data it can be concluded that the divergence of the zzso pathways leading to different classes of zzso zzso formed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell suspension cultures occurs at a later stage than zzso zzso
