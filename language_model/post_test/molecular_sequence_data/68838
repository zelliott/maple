We have investigated zzso and zzso infection in children born to zzso or indeterminate Western zzso mothers in Martinique by using the zzso chain reaction zzso Only zzso and no zzso samples were found in this zzso All the samples from zzso children and adults were zzso positive, whereas the four zzso and Western zzso zzso mothers and their eight children were all zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were in complete agreement in these zzso However, two of the six mothers who were first indeterminate by Western zzso and who later became zzso were found positive by zzso Of the 27 children zzso zzso zzso born to zzso and zzso mothers, 2 were zzso and zzso positive, 5 were zzso and zzso positive with 2 primer pairs in gag and zzso and 4 were zzso and zzso positive with only 1 of the primer zzso In contrast to an initial rate of transmission of zzso estimated by zzso we found a rate of transmission of 28 to zzso zzso or not children who were positive with only one of the primer pairs were zzso Thus, our study confirms that zzso is useful in detecting zzso infection in children before zzso and zzso the potential lack of sensitivity of zzso to detect zzso zzso blood units in endemic zzso
