zzso processing of zzso generates several zzso extended forms of zzso and zzso zzso zzso We used synthetic canine zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso to examine the effects of zzso extensions of zzso on zzso and detection in zzso zzso products were zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, zzso and mass spectral zzso zzso and zzso were noted to zzso during zzso zzso In zzso using eight different zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso extended zzso had little or no zzso zzso was assessed by measuring pancreatic responses in zzso zzso zzso canine and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso had zzso of 81 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 176 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, compared with zzso zzso and the response to zzso lasted significantly zzso These data demonstrate that 1) zzso zzso and zzso are not zzso under some zzso conditions, 2) current zzso may not detect zzso zzso extended forms of zzso in tissue extracts or blood, and 3) the zzso zzso zzso stimulation of pancreatic zzso recognizes both zzso and zzso extended zzso
