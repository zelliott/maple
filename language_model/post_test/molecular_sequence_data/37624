Cloning and sequencing of the chicken zzso zzso zzso gene segment from the zzso domain to the box 2 motif revealed the presence of the two zzso first zzso zzso and zzso zzso the unique zzso sequences of the reported and newly identified multiple zzso zzso transcripts containing only the zzso domain in the zzso zzso was located downstream of the zzso zzso the zzso domain and zzso presented downstream of the zzso zzso the box 1 zzso These findings indicate that the box zzso zzso transcripts are generated by the zzso of zzso as the first zzso with distinct zzso donor sites to the box zzso zzso and that the zzso of zzso as the first zzso and its zzso to the box zzso zzso results in the generation of the box zzso zzso Three zzso initiation sites for the box zzso zzso transcripts and two zzso initiation sites for the box zzso transcript were detected by the zzso protection zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis showed that the expression levels of all these zzso zzso transcripts are simultaneously increased during sexual zzso accompanying the decrease of the amount of the zzso full-length transcript for zzso
