Two partial zzso clones zzso zzso C alpha and zzso zzso C zzso each of which zzso a different member of zzso family, were isolated using zzso from zzso of zzso zzso The full-length zzso were isolated using zzso The zzso were expressed in zzso cells and the zzso proteins were partially zzso using an affinity zzso zzso zzso C alpha zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso activity of zzso Whereas protein zzso C iota zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso I, a zzso zzso inhibited these zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso two proteins expressed in the brain of zzso zzso zzso zzso which plays important roles in the zzso transport in the brain, and zzso which is a zzso zzso protein and regulates zzso These results suggest that these zzso zzso various zzso proteins and function in the brain of zzso zzso
