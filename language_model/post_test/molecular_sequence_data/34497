DNA stable isotope probing zzso with zzso was used to identify a zzso zzso in soil amended with 48 zzso zzso After zzso of zzso degradation rates in soil, DNA was extracted from soil incubated with zzso zzso zzso and 48 zzso zzso or zzso and 48 zzso zzso A single DNA band formed along a cesium zzso zzso after zzso zzso of extracts from zzso incubated with zzso With extracts from zzso to which only zzso was added, two distinct DNA bands formed, while three bands formed when DNA extracted from soil incubated with both zzso and zzso was zzso We suggest that this third band formed because zzso does not contain any oxygen atoms and zzso organisms had to transfer oxygen atoms from zzso into zzso zzso to form zzso acids de zzso We extracted the third DNA band and amplified a large fraction of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso product obtained from the labeled DNA, as well as cloned zzso zzso zzso identified a known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso bacterial strain was subsequently isolated from soil and shown to be zzso zzso zzso Finally, quantitative real-time zzso analysis showed that the abundance of the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso increased in soil after zzso exposure but not in zzso from which zzso was zzso This study indicates that zzso zzso can be a useful method for identifying zzso bacteria in zzso
