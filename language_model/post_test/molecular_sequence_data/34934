zzso pancreatic zzso zzso resembles the attractive drug target zzso zzso which has the ability to degrade zzso tissue in the zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso with a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was solved at zzso A zzso The inhibitor occupied the zzso zzso through zzso of zzso and induced zzso changes in the side chains of zzso and zzso which are located at the edges of the zzso zzso zzso comparison of five zzso complexes, including the zzso complex and zzso zzso reveals that the zzso forming the zzso S1, zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso are zzso but the two zzso zzso playing a part in the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso comparison of zzso with human zzso zzso zzso implies that the inhibitor binds to zzso in a similar manner to the zzso zzso This structural insight may help in the design of potent zzso zzso
