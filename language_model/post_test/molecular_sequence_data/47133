We have isolated the complete zzso of a human zzso zzso termed zzso that is abundantly expressed only in the zzso The zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a deduced protein of zzso zzso acids whose predicted sequence showed zzso identity and zzso similarity with zzso of zzso zzso zzso is thought to be a negative regulator of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are required for differentiation and maturation of cells as well as zzso interactions during development in zzso zzso The degree of zzso among these proteins suggests that the zzso gene product may be a member of the zzso family and therefore involved in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed at least 20 coding zzso in zzso We localized the gene to zzso bands zzso by radiation hybrid zzso mapping and zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso locus has been mapped in this region, and zzso may represent a candidate gene for predisposition in some families whose zzso diabetes is not linked to the zzso zzso
