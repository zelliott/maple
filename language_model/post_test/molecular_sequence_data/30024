zzso of zzso DNA zzso I by the minor groove binding zzso zzso A, was zzso Low zzso of the zzso selectively prevented zzso action at a high affinity zzso I binding zzso A restriction zzso protection zzso indicated that the zzso cycle was blocked at the binding zzso zzso binding sites on DNA were localized by zzso radical zzso A strongly preferred site mapped to a zzso zzso partially included in the essential zzso I binding zzso zzso elimination of the stable zzso zzso associated with this zzso binding site demonstrated that zzso the intrinsic bend was zzso for efficient binding of zzso I, and zzso zzso zzso did not occur by deformation of a stable zzso Alternative modes of zzso are zzso
