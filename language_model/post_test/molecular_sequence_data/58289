The zzso virus C zzso and the zzso G virus zzso have been detected in patients with acute zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the role of the new zzso viruses in the zzso of zzso zzso is little zzso We investigated the presence of zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso samples from 22 German patients with zzso zzso failure and 106 zzso blood donors zzso were studied for presence of zzso zzso by zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso sequences were derived from the published gene sequences of the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso and the published zzso zzso and zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso the control zzso and the published zzso and zzso zzso sequences were compared by multiple sequence zzso We also compared the zzso sequences of zzso patients who had zzso zzso failure with those of 19 patients with chronic zzso from our zzso In addition, we searched databases and published papers for further zzso zzso sequences in patients with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was detected in 11 zzso of the 22 patients with zzso zzso failure and in five zzso of 106 zzso blood zzso Among the patients with zzso zzso failure, six of seven with zzso zzso B and five of ten with zzso zzso zzso were positive for zzso zzso Analysis of zzso acid sequences showed six zzso at defined positions in all 11 patients with zzso zzso failure who were positive for zzso None of these zzso were found in the five zzso zzso blood zzso Of the six zzso changes, four caused no zzso acid changes, whereas two zzso at position 100 zzso to zzso and 102 zzso to zzso led to an zzso to zzso change in the predicted translation zzso However, comparison with zzso sequences of patients with zzso zzso showed that this zzso acid zzso was not specific for zzso zzso zzso The zzso containing the six zzso zzso detected in all patients with zzso zzso failure was found in only two of 19 German patients with chronic zzso from our zzso and in only one of 88 zzso sequences from zzso patients reported by zzso 

The frequency of zzso zzso is higher in zzso zzso failure than in any other group of patients with zzso particularly in patients with zzso zzso B or zzso zzso zzso A specific strain of zzso may occur in serum of German patients with zzso zzso zzso
