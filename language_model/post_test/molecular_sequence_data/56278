Recent studies have provided evidence suggesting that disruption of zzso function may play a critical role in zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso previously isolated in human zzso zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in various zzso including breast and zzso cell zzso zzso The role of zzso altered regulation in the different stages of tumor progression has not been studied in a well defined animal model zzso In the study presented here, zzso was mapped to the zzso end of mouse zzso 7 and found to be dramatically zzso in skin zzso In zzso stages of tumor development, early zzso showed zzso zzso transcript levels, whereas zzso was observed in most advanced zzso These findings suggest that altered expression of zzso D1 plays a critical role in mouse skin zzso and may be related to the acquisition of autonomous growth by zzso Further studies on the role of zzso D1 in the mouse model system should prove valuable for understanding the zzso basis of tumor zzso
