The dominant view of the zzso of living zzso based on zzso characters, is that zzso zzso and zzso are derived zzso joined with saw zzso and angel zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A New zzso of zzso zzso and Related zzso zzso University Press, zzso zzso By contrast, a recent zzso study based on zzso genes for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 26 zzso zzso supported the older view that zzso and zzso are separate zzso Here, we tested these two different views using combined, nuclear zzso and zzso zzso gene sequences ( approximately zzso from 22 zzso two zzso and two zzso zzso We used maximum likelihood, maximum zzso minimum evolution, and zzso zzso for tree zzso and found the zzso zzso gene to contain far more signal than the zzso gene for resolving this mostly zzso zzso Our findings matched those of in separating zzso from zzso and in statistically rejecting zzso The angel shark zzso was the sister group to zzso zzso zzso and our findings are consistent with the idea that zzso zzso form a zzso group zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso however, zzso grouped with zzso opposing the widely accepted zzso zzso A tree based on the zzso gene for zzso b also supported a separation of zzso and zzso in contrast to zzso Among zzso variation in the evolutionary rates of the nuclear zzso genes was higher than that of zzso b zzso mainly due to the relatively rapid evolution of zzso in some zzso In conclusion, several different molecular studies now zzso the zzso hypothesis of zzso zzso
