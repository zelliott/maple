zzso is a zzso for the rat zzso where it zzso transient zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso followed by increases in DNA synthesis and cell zzso zzso the product of the zzso zzso is a nuclear protein that can interact with zzso to zzso the activity of zzso zzso To test whether zzso is a target for zzso regulation, we measured the effects of 17 zzso on the expression of this gene in rat zzso A human zzso zzso probe detects in rat zzso two zzso species of zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of the animals with zzso results in a rapid transient increase in the zzso of these zzso a zzso to zzso increase over the zzso level was detected starting 30 zzso after zzso injection and lasting for 2 zzso with a return to the zzso level after 4 zzso In accordance with the results obtained by analysis of the zzso we found that zzso increases 3- to zzso zzso gene zzso in the zzso at the same time it zzso its zzso zzso The ability of zzso to induce zzso gene expression was not abolished by the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso suggesting that zzso zzso of this zzso is a primary response to the zzso Furthermore, we found that in the zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells, zzso stimulates zzso of a reporter gene containing four copies of a zzso response zzso These data demonstrate that zzso gene expression is regulated by zzso and suggest that zzso could play a role in the zzso of cell proliferation by zzso
