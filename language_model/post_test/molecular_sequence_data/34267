Genome mining at the turn of the millennium uncovered a new family of type II zzso zzso zzso zzso that comprises 17 members in humans and 19 in zzso zzso zzso belong to one of four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Whereas a wealth of information now has been gathered as to the zzso functions of members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso comparatively little is known about the functions of the zzso zzso of zzso Here we perform a combined expression and functional analysis of this zzso zzso We show that the five human and seven zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso suggesting a level of functional zzso We also perform a comprehensive zzso analysis of mice deficient in two of the most widely expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso and show that the two zzso are zzso for development, health, and long-term survival in the absence of external challenges or additional genetic zzso Our comprehensive expression analysis and generation of zzso and zzso zzso mouse strains provide a valuable resource for the scientific community for further exploration of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and pathological zzso
