We isolated zzso clones containing the entire coding region of the putative zzso zzso zzso analysis and in zzso translation demonstrated that zzso encodes a zzso protein with zzso to zzso zzso moreover, this protein contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be amplified and zzso in 2 of 8 zzso zzso cell lines and 2 of 15 primary zzso zzso zzso was mapped to zzso region zzso by zzso in zzso zzso In the two zzso zzso cell lines exhibiting amplification of zzso the amplified sequences were localized within zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso belongs to a distinct zzso of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso may contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso
