zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso in many zzso and aquatic zzso Although zzso is the primary function of aquarium zzso very few studies have investigated the zzso responsible for this process in zzso This study used quantitative real-time zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes of zzso and zzso in freshwater aquarium zzso in addition to assessing the diversity of zzso zzso genes by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and clone zzso zzso were zzso dominant in 23 of 27 freshwater zzso and in 12 of these zzso zzso contributed all zzso zzso zzso Eight saltwater zzso and two commercial aquarium zzso supplements were included for zzso Both zzso and bacterial zzso genes were detected in all saltwater samples, with zzso genes zzso zzso genes in five of eight zzso zzso zzso genes were abundant in both supplements, but zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes could not be zzso For freshwater zzso the proportion of zzso genes from zzso relative to zzso was zzso correlated with ammonium zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes revealed variable diversity across samples, with zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating separation of freshwater and saltwater zzso Composite clone libraries of zzso zzso genes revealed distinct freshwater and saltwater zzso as well as mixed clusters containing both freshwater and saltwater zzso gene zzso These results reveal insight into commonplace residential zzso and suggest that aquarium zzso may represent valuable zzso zzso for future studies of zzso zzso
