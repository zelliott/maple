In zzso zzso zzso signal zzso mediate the zzso of zzso membrane and zzso proteins into the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso signal sequences are composed of 3 distinct zzso a positively charged zzso domain, a central zzso domain, and a polar zzso zzso In an attempt to better understand protein trafficking in zzso we have constructed strains of zzso major that zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso under the control of a zzso signal zzso In this report we present a zzso analysis of this signal zzso zzso of the entire signal sequence or the zzso core region prevents zzso of zzso and results in zzso expression of the zzso zzso in the zzso domain indicate that a net positive charge is not required for efficient zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso domain are more complex and display two zzso either they prevent expression of zzso or they have no effect on protein zzso These results indicate that the function of the signal sequence in targeting proteins to the zzso in zzso is similar to that observed in zzso and higher zzso and suggests that the zzso protein zzso apparatus may also be zzso
