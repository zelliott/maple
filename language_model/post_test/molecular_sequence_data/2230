Human smooth muscle and zzso cells express closely related zzso zzso light chains which are different from the zzso present in zzso muscle zzso To date no information on the zzso acid sequence of these zzso zzso muscle zzso has been zzso We have isolated full-length zzso clones zzso the zzso zzso and smooth muscle zzso zzso light chains zzso from cultured human zzso and heart zzso smooth muscle cells, zzso Here we present the complete zzso sequences for both zzso zzso together with the deduced zzso acid sequences for the zzso Both zzso contain the same open reading frame for 151 zzso acids with 5 zzso acid differences located in the C zzso These differences are zzso by a block of 44 zzso which is present only in the smooth muscle zzso zzso To identify the human gene coding for the two zzso zzso we have isolated and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso together with several zzso zzso A single functional gene was found containing 7 zzso which are zzso for the coding information of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso does not contain sequences zzso by zzso 6 which zzso to the 44 zzso expressed in zzso zzso This zzso zzso suggests that both the smooth muscle and zzso zzso in man are generated from the identical primary transcript by alternative zzso pathways taking place in a zzso zzso
