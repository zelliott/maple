The zzso zzso from zzso is one of three zzso that are required for zzso transfer of this zzso zzso The zzso which probably codes for the mating bridge responsible for pair formation and DNA transfer, contains 12 zzso 11 of which are related to genes from other members of the type IV zzso system zzso The 12th zzso zzso codes for production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed in each of the 12 zzso contained on a full-length clone of the zzso region, using zzso resistance zzso or a newly constructed zzso This zzso called zzso was designed to express genes downstream of the zzso site from a promoter regulated by zzso and zzso Each zzso could trans complement downstream zzso insertions in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso When zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso abolished zzso transfer from strain zzso which lacks the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, these zzso retained residual zzso transfer activity when tested in strain zzso which contains this large zzso The zzso zzso failed to transfer at a zzso frequency from either strain, while the zzso zzso transferred at very low but zzso levels from both zzso Only the zzso zzso was unaffected in zzso transfer from either zzso Transfer of each of the zzso zzso was restored by a clone expressing only the zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso in zzso abolished the production of zzso and also zzso zzso This zzso was restored by zzso the zzso donor in the presence of zzso We conclude that all of the zzso genes except zzso and zzso are essential for zzso transfer of zzso We also conclude that zzso in any one of the zzso genes except zzso and zzso can be zzso by functions coded for by zzso
