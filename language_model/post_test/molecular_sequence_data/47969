zzso cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial hypersensitivity to zzso DNA sequence analysis of a zzso zzso zzso encompassing the whole region required for expression of the hypersensitive zzso revealed three open reading zzso The DNA sequence of these frames had zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso differs from the already known zzso zzso by the absence of the zzso zzso and zzso genes in this zzso An zzso zzso sequence upstream from the predicted zzso was observed suggesting that this defective zzso zzso could be part of a zzso zzso zzso experiments and zzso analysis of the zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso gene is zzso and regulated by the zzso product of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the hypersensitivity to zzso resulted from the expression of zzso activity zzso by the defective zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso bond of both zzso and zzso zzso
