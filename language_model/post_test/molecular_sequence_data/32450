Three groups of zzso zzso proteins have been implicated in the establishment of zzso cell zzso the zzso proteins of the Par zzso and zzso groups zzso and the zzso localized proteins of the zzso group zzso During zzso zzso these proteins participate in a complex network of zzso interactions that define the position and functional organization of zzso junctions and tight zzso However, the zzso pathways through which they control polarity are poorly zzso In this study, we identify an interaction between zzso zzso and zzso a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso targets to the lateral surface of zzso cells via its zzso domain, through an interaction with zzso Loss of either zzso or zzso from zzso zzso cells results in a significant zzso in the assembly and maintenance of functional tight zzso We conclude that the formation of a complex between zzso and zzso promotes zzso cell polarity and tight junction zzso
