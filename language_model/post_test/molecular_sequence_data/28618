zzso zzso zzso is a critical signal in establishing pregnancy in humans and some other zzso but this zzso expressed hormone has not been found in other zzso zzso The gene for one of its two zzso zzso beta zzso zzso arose by zzso from the zzso hormone beta zzso gene zzso present in all zzso zzso In this study, 14 zzso and related zzso species were examined by Southern zzso and DNA sequencing to determine where in zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso flying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not have a zzso zzso although they possess one copy of the zzso zzso The zzso gene first arose in the common zzso of the zzso primates (New World zzso Old World zzso apes, and zzso after the zzso zzso from zzso At least two subsequent zzso events occurred in the zzso zzso all of which possess multiple zzso zzso The zzso family of genes has undergone frequent gene conversion among the zzso as well as periods of strong positive selection in the New World monkeys zzso In addition, newly generated DNA sequences from the promoter of the zzso alpha zzso gene indicate that zzso monkeys use a different mechanism of alpha gene expression control than that found in zzso
