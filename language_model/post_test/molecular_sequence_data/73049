zzso zzso zzso zzso is a dynamic modification of zzso nuclear and zzso proteins analogous to protein zzso We have cloned and characterized a novel gene for an zzso zzso zzso that shares no sequence zzso or structural similarities with other zzso The zzso gene is highly zzso (up to zzso zzso in all zzso zzso Unlike previously described zzso zzso is localized to the zzso and zzso The zzso protein contains multiple tandem repeats of the zzso repeat zzso The presence of zzso repeats, which can mediate zzso zzso suggests that zzso may be regulated by protein interactions that are independent of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is also modified by zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso signal zzso zzso may play a role in modulating zzso zzso
