A sequential zzso reacting with a zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso was localized in the zzso zzso zzso As the zzso reacted with about equal affinity with different zzso of this and with zzso from another zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso was assigned to a zzso sequence zzso The zzso zzso which was linked to another zzso via a zzso bridge, was reduced and zzso As a result, not the zzso but only the two zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso had a much higher affinity for the zzso zzso than the zzso zzso This may be explained by the presence of two independent mobile interaction sites in each of the two reacting zzso
