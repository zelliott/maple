A DNA sequencing method is presented that zzso zzso array zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso labeling zzso zzso DNA sequencing fragments are separated on an array of zzso and detected zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso The four sets of DNA sequencing fragments are separated in a single zzso and then distinguished by using a zzso coding scheme where each zzso set is labeled with a characteristic ratio of two zzso zzso Since only two zzso zzso are required, it is possible to select zzso that have identical mobility zzso It is also shown that the ratio of the signal in the two detection channels provides a reliable identification of the sequencing zzso DNA sequencing results on a zzso array are zzso
