zzso a zzso zzso zzso was originally identified as an zzso in a serum zzso obtained from a patient with zzso blistering zzso To examine the binding ability of zzso with intermediate filaments zzso we performed zzso zzso using fusion proteins that included various zzso and zzso of zzso At least two of the zzso copies in the B zzso of zzso were necessary for the binding of fusion proteins to zzso The repeated structures of zzso zzso also played an important role in the binding of zzso to zzso in these zzso while also increasing the repeated structure in the zzso domain of zzso which is involved in the increased binding to zzso A similar but weaker binding to zzso and zzso was also zzso These observations indicated that the highly repeated structures of zzso in both the B and the zzso zzso which is the unique feature of this zzso in the zzso family, play an essential role in the functioning of this zzso
