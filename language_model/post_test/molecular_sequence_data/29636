zzso damage caused by zzso of zzso genes triggers a zzso mechanism which eventually results in zzso of zzso reaching zzso of the zzso dry zzso We show that zzso of zzso synthesis is accompanied by a rise, from zzso to zzso according to the gene zzso in the expression of most of the genes zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Evidence that zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso the first committed zzso of this pathway, plays a major role in this process was as zzso zzso of zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso correlated with zzso of zzso and with a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused an approximately zzso increase in zzso in the transformed cells, whereas zzso content was barely affected by the joint zzso of zzso and zzso Introduction of a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso of this zzso in a zzso medium resulted in reduction in zzso synthesis that was zzso to the decrease in zzso zzso Finally, the stimulation of zzso production was also accompanied by an increase in pools of zzso zzso a zzso of zzso In quantitative terms, we estimated the zzso control of zzso to be in the range of zzso and found that regulation of the zzso zzso zzso was mainly zzso zzso dominated by regulation of the amount of newly zzso zzso zzso In the search for the mechanism by which zzso is activated in response to zzso zzso we could only show that neither zzso nor zzso which zzso two zzso factors of the zzso box family that are required for expression of zzso and zzso zzso was involved in this zzso
