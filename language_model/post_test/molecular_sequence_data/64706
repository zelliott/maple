As the main zzso of the central nervous system, zzso is a key protein in the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso zzso expression of the protein might cause an overproduction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a tight regulation of zzso expression is expected in zzso In addition to a possible zzso control, the zzso transcript leader contains features that might constitute mechanisms of zzso regulation of protein zzso Moreover, recent work has revealed an increase of zzso protein and zzso activity in some Alzheimer's disease patients, although a corresponding increase of transcript has not been zzso Here we show that zzso translation could be modulated at multiple zzso The presence of several upstream zzso strongly reduces the translation of the main open reading zzso This zzso could be overcome with conditions that zzso skipping of upstream zzso We also report an alternative zzso of the zzso transcript leader that reduces the number of upstream zzso Finally, we show that translation driven by the zzso transcript leader is increased in activated zzso independently of the zzso event, indicating yet another mechanism of zzso zzso Our findings might explain why increases in zzso protein or activity are reported in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients even in the absence of changes in transcript zzso
