A novel zzso zzso zzso is a plant growth promoting zzso that was isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso a potentially important zzso feed stock zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies, strain zzso could be classified as a member of zzso zzso However, comparisons of characteristics with other known species of the zzso zzso suggested that strain zzso could be a novel zzso zzso In zzso studies were carried for the plant growth promoting attribute of this zzso It tested positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso production, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production, zzso and zzso zzso The isolate was then used as a zzso for the zzso study of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso supplemented with zzso zzso showed overall plant growth promotion effect resulting in enhanced root length zzso fresh root mass zzso fresh shoot mass zzso dry root mass zzso dry shoot mass zzso number of leaf zzso zzso content zzso and biomass zzso over control under the days of experimental zzso This study was designed for 120 days and was in zzso and the data was collected at every 30 zzso
