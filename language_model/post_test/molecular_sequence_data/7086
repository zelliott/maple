The first zzso step in the zzso of steroid hormones occurs in the zzso inner membrane and is dependent on the zzso of cholesterol from cellular zzso We report on the isolation of a human zzso which encodes a zzso protein called zzso acute regulatory zzso zzso implicated in transport of cholesterol into zzso zzso and predicted zzso acid sequence analyses indicate that the human and zzso zzso are highly zzso sharing zzso identity with an overall zzso of zzso Analysis of the distribution of zzso zzso transcripts in human zzso by Northern zzso reveals several zzso species, the most abundant of which is a zzso zzso zzso transcript present in zzso zzso and zzso Using in zzso translated zzso we demonstrate that the zzso gene product can be efficiently imported into zzso added zzso
