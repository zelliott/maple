The single zzso gene from the zzso fungus zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso The only other zzso reported to contain just one zzso gene is another zzso the budding zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene predicts a zzso containing the zzso sequence identifying the zzso zzso Until now this characteristic N zzso has only been reported to occur in zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso recognizes a single zzso band in zzso of total zzso zzso None of the six zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso precisely with those found in other zzso zzso One, unlike other known zzso zzso is located in the zzso region of the zzso The zzso and 3' ends of the gene have been zzso The zzso zzso gene has a zzso transcript size due to the presence of several different 3' zzso Of four characterized zzso zzso only the longest contains a typical zzso zzso signal near its 3' zzso Using an zzso zzso containing zzso zzso sequences and the zzso gene from zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene has been mapped to the first zzso
