The zzso characteristics and alpha zzso underlying zzso transient outward zzso current zzso zzso expressed in ferret left zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed using patch zzso fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two distinct Ito zzso were measured zzso degrees zzso in the majority of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The two Ito zzso displayed marked differences in peak current zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and recovery zzso zzso recovered rapidly zzso zzso zzso zzso 51 zzso 3 zzso with minimal cumulative zzso while zzso recovered slowly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with marked cumulative zzso zzso toxin 2 zzso zzso blocked zzso in a zzso manner, but had no effect on zzso Parallel FISH and IF zzso conducted on isolated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso alpha zzso expression in zzso zzso types was quite zzso zzso zzso and zzso were more predominantly expressed in zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was expressed in the majority of zzso zzso zzso but was essentially absent in zzso zzso zzso In combination with previous zzso on recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso relatively zzso and zzso toxin block zzso zzso zzso zzso our results strongly support the hypothesis that, in ferret heart, zzso and zzso alpha zzso respectively, are the molecular zzso underlying the zzso and zzso zzso FISH and IF zzso were also conducted on ferret zzso tissue zzso The three Ito alpha zzso again showed distinct patterns of zzso zzso zzso was localized primarily to the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and approximate inner zzso of the zzso free wall; zzso zzso 2 was localized primarily to the right zzso free wall, zzso layers of the zzso and base of the zzso and zzso zzso was localized primarily to zzso layers of the zzso zzso and zzso distributed in the zzso free wall and zzso zzso in intact zzso zzso a zzso distribution of candidate Ito alpha zzso not only exists from zzso zzso to zzso but also from zzso to zzso
