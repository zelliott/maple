By alignment to the zzso zzso sequence of human zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso motifs with putative function for zzso in the inner nuclear membrane zzso were identified in the zzso tails of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso and of the cellular zzso B zzso Fusion of the respective zzso to zzso as a reporter redirected transport of the zzso into the zzso suggesting their functioning as modular signal zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso motif zzso represents a consensus sequence which is sufficient for zzso of the zzso reporter in the zzso
