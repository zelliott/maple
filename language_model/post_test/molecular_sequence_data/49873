A method of fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso was applied as an zzso and quantitative tool for meat zzso Following alignments of the zzso zzso an zzso primer pair was designed to amplify the partial sequences within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso DNA from zzso zzso and bovine zzso No zzso can be amplified from dog, cat, fish, zzso zzso zzso and chicken DNA with the primer zzso Using zzso sensor zzso zzso the zzso DNA fingerprints of pork, zzso and beef were generated by restriction zzso zzso following a zzso zzso zzso Species identification was conducted on the meat zzso The reliably zzso levels were below zzso for zzso zzso of pork, zzso and zzso Cooking and zzso of meats did not influence the generation of the zzso profiles or the zzso zzso
