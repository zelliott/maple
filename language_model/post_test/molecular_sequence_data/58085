zzso zzso which are zzso smooth muscle tumors, zzso zzso We investigated the actions of several hormones known to stimulate zzso zzso by the zzso zzso or zzso on zzso zzso by zzso smooth muscle cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso were verified to be zzso by zzso for smooth muscle zzso and zzso zzso treatments were performed in zzso medium for 72 zzso zzso was harvested every 24 h and zzso for zzso 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso growth factor, and the zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso by these zzso zzso caused a significant suppression of zzso zzso by 72 zzso and this was accompanied by a zzso increase in total cell protein per well, which represented an increase in cell zzso zzso were also zzso at various zzso to determine the effects of cell number on zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso per 1000 cells decreased significantly as cell number per well zzso Northern zzso analysis identified zzso zzso in fresh zzso zzso zzso zzso in three independent cultures of zzso was then detected by reverse zzso and the zzso chain zzso zzso occurred only with the expected band of approximately 423 zzso in zzso We conclude that zzso express zzso zzso in zzso and that zzso zzso in culture continue to express the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in culture appears to be modulated primarily by changes in cell zzso
