The zzso zzso zzso from zzso which encodes a set of highly zzso zzso zzso was used to isolate the corresponding zzso zzso This zzso called zzso zzso to zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso containing a cluster of 8 zzso zzso seven of them zzso It is a zzso of the rice zzso gene zzso J, zzso NH, zzso J 7; zzso zzso zzso acid analysis of the isolated protein indicates that only the zzso zzso are zzso and a putative zzso zzso zzso sequence was identified in the zzso The pattern of expression and in zzso zzso of the zzso protein was studied during zzso zzso zzso and in zzso of both zzso or embryonic zzso zzso treatment induced the synthesis of zzso zzso and protein in zzso however, the zzso proteins were found to be highly zzso only in zzso
