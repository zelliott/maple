We previously isolated and identified numerous zzso genes zzso in rice zzso Here we characterized the structure and function of an zzso zzso zzso alkaline zzso that belongs to a novel family of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso gene composed of 13 zzso located on rice zzso zzso The expression level of zzso is not only zzso during natural leaf zzso but also induced rapidly by darkness, hormones zzso zzso acid, salicylic zzso and stresses zzso and zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso coli has displayed optimal zzso activity at pH zzso The zzso showed good zzso activities towards zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic analysis demonstrates that zzso is specifically localized in the zzso of zzso zzso These findings strongly suggest an important role for zzso in the degradation of zzso zzso during leaf zzso
