From a rat zzso library a zzso clone zzso which is supposed to zzso an zzso zzso protein has been isolated and zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso techniques have been employed to monitor the zzso zzso for the distribution of zzso zzso expressing the zzso The zzso were detected only in a subset of zzso cells zzso in two restricted areas of the zzso zzso The clusters of zzso cells appear zzso in both zzso zzso Within a zzso region only a subset of the cells expressed the zzso The segregation of zzso expressing a distinct zzso supports the notion that a spatial component may be involved in coding zzso zzso
