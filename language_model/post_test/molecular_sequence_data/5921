zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso that zzso the final step in the zzso of zzso acid was zzso zzso from a zzso extract of cauliflower zzso zzso zzso zzso to apparent zzso with an overall yield of zzso The zzso procedure consisted of zzso exchange, zzso interaction, gel zzso and fast protein liquid zzso The zzso had a molecular mass of 56 zzso estimated by gel zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso and showed a pH optimum for activity between pH zzso and zzso with an apparent zzso of zzso zzso for zzso Based on partial zzso sequence information, zzso chain reaction fragments were isolated and used to screen a cauliflower zzso library from which a zzso zzso zzso was zzso The deduced mature zzso contained zzso zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso produced a biologically active protein displaying zzso zzso Furthermore, we identified a zzso for the zzso in cauliflower zzso which zzso with zzso by zzso liquid zzso suggesting that this compound is a naturally occurring precursor of zzso acid zzso in zzso
