To determine sequences involved in zzso and zzso aspects of alcohol zzso zzso gene expression in Hawaiian zzso a zzso pair zzso region containing the zzso zzso gene and the zzso zzso region containing the zzso zzso zzso gene were zzso These genes have the zzso and zzso structure seen for many zzso zzso zzso Analysis of putative and known regulatory sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes in comparison to those of zzso zzso (the only other Hawaiian species for which the promoter organization is known) highlighted elements likely to be involved in zzso aspects of zzso gene expression as well as sequences that may account for zzso differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the context of regulatory roles previously assigned to particular gene fragments, indicated that multiple insertions and deletions in the promoter regions are responsible for differences in zzso regulation displayed by these zzso
