beta 4 and alpha 6 zzso zzso zzso to form an zzso zzso that is necessary to zzso zzso and to anchor zzso cells to their zzso zzso beta 4 is also expressed in zzso cell (which do not contain zzso in peripheral zzso where it may function in the formation or maintenance of zzso The zzso for beta 4 zzso has been cloned from zzso human and mouse zzso We cloned zzso zzso beta 4 zzso from libraries derived from rat peripheral zzso and determined the complete zzso sequence zzso the signal zzso and mature zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid zzso sequence revealed zzso and zzso identity with the mouse and human zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso signal zzso zzso in beta 4 was zzso identical among zzso zzso and zzso Our zzso clones included two of the four zzso alternatively spliced zzso previously described in zzso zzso Despite the potentially diverse functions of beta 4 zzso in zzso cells and zzso the zzso for zzso beta 4 zzso are highly similar to those cloned from zzso
