zzso sodium channels composed of zzso alpha and auxiliary beta zzso are responsible for the rising phase of the action potential in cardiac muscle, but their zzso have not yet been clearly zzso 

zzso studies show that the principal cardiac alpha zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are zzso localized in zzso zzso identified by zzso of zzso 43, the major protein of cardiac gap zzso The brain alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso localized with zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso identified by zzso of zzso a cardiac zzso zzso The zzso zzso is also present in a small fraction of zzso zzso The recently cloned zzso zzso which closely resembles zzso in zzso acid zzso is also expressed in zzso zzso and is localized in zzso disks as are zzso and zzso 

Our results suggest that the primary sodium channels present in zzso zzso are composed of zzso plus zzso and/or zzso zzso in zzso disks and zzso zzso and zzso plus zzso and/or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
