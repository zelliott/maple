We investigated zzso from various zzso sources, including humans and animals, for microbial source tracking in South zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from 43 zzso samples from farms, wild animal zzso and human wastewater zzso zzso zzso were more prevalent and abundant than zzso zzso in all of the tested zzso zzso We further characterized 311 zzso zzso zzso using zzso sensitivity zzso zzso and reverse zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso analyses were performed based on the partial zzso acid sequences of 311 zzso zzso from various zzso zzso zzso zzso were most prevalent among geese zzso and were least prevalent in cows zzso Among the zzso of zzso zzso zzso most zzso zzso isolated from animal zzso sources belonged to either group I or group IV, and most from human wastewater sources were in group II or zzso Some of the group I zzso were present in both human and animal source zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from various sources were divided into two main zzso All zzso zzso zzso isolated from human wastewater were grouped with zzso zzso while zzso isolated from most animal sources were grouped with zzso zzso zzso significance statistical analyses revealed significant differences between human and animal zzso In the principal coordinate analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from human waste were zzso separate from those isolated from other animal zzso However, zzso DNA zzso were not significantly different or separate in the zzso These results demonstrate that proper analysis of zzso zzso zzso can effectively distinguish zzso zzso
