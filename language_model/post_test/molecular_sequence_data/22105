ROCK or zzso zzso a zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso signaling and is involved in zzso assembly and cell zzso and zzso The ROCK protein consists of several zzso an zzso region, a zzso zzso domain, a zzso domain containing a zzso binding site, and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso region of ROCK binds to and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and this zzso is reversed by binding zzso a small zzso Here we present the structure of the zzso region and the zzso zzso In our structure, two zzso regions interact to form a zzso domain linking two zzso zzso zzso This spatial arrangement presents the zzso active sites and regulatory sequences on a common face zzso the possibility of both zzso simultaneously interacting with a zzso zzso domain or with a zzso zzso The zzso domain adopts a zzso competent zzso however, no zzso of active site zzso is observed in the zzso We also determined the structures of ROCK bound to four different zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Each of these compounds binds with reduced affinity to zzso zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso zzso differences exist between the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso that suggest that interactions with a single zzso acid of the active site zzso in ROCK and zzso in zzso determine the relative selectivity of these zzso zzso a zzso of zzso may be selective for ROCK over zzso through a reversed binding zzso
