In zzso functional, mature sieve elements lack zzso zzso zzso and most of the zzso zzso In this study, the complexity, number, and nature of protein zzso within the zzso sap of zzso zzso were investigated to test the hypothesis that the zzso sieve tube system zzso a simplified signal zzso zzso Supporting evidence was obtained in that only five putative protein zzso (three zzso and two zzso protein zzso were detected within the zzso sap extracted from stem zzso zzso methods were used to purify one such zzso protein zzso The gene for this zzso zzso zzso domain protein zzso 1 zzso was cloned using zzso zzso A combination of mass zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing established that, in the zzso zzso zzso exists as an zzso zzso zzso A second highly zzso zzso zzso was identified, but although transcripts could be detected in the companion cells, zzso fingerprint analysis suggested that zzso does not enter the zzso zzso Potential zzso for zzso within the zzso zzso were also detected using an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into sieve elements via zzso and the potential roles played by these zzso protein zzso are zzso
