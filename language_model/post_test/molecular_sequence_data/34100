Type III zzso zzso zzso produce an array of zzso with diverse zzso In this study, we have cloned the complete reading frame zzso type III zzso zzso from a brown zzso zzso zzso and characterized the activity of its zzso protein zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso is zzso zzso in zzso sharing a higher sequence similarity with bacterial zzso zzso zzso than with plant zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso in zzso with differences in some of the zzso lining the active and zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso displayed broad starter zzso specificity to zzso zzso zzso zzso to produce zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso caused complete loss of its activity, thus suggesting that these two zzso are the zzso zzso for zzso as in other type III zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso activity, while zzso zzso produces zzso zzso as a major zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso demonstrated a dramatic decrease of zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso and zzso play an important role for the zzso zzso reaction in zzso The zzso changes in protein structure especially the cavity of the active site may have more significant effect to the activity of zzso compared with changes in individual zzso
