Human zzso zzso is strongly associated with a number of rheumatic diseases, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso detection of the zzso group by molecular methods is hampered by the extreme zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe a simple, rapid zzso zzso method for detection of all 28 zzso zzso defined to zzso The method involves an initial screening with two zzso zzso chain reactions zzso which has to be followed by two additional zzso zzso in samples carrying a few rare zzso of zzso zzso or zzso The described protocol should be useful for laboratories involved in zzso and research of zzso zzso
