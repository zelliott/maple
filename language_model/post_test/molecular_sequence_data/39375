With increasing interest on zzso as diagnostic and therapeutic targets in zzso and other diseases, it is becoming imperative to characterize novel zzso and investigate their biological zzso Here, we present the completed coding sequence and zzso organization of the previously published partial zzso sequence of zzso Rapid amplification of zzso ends with zzso sequences from the Human Genome databases, and in zzso zzso zzso were used for these zzso The zzso gene is located within a zzso DNA zzso between zzso and zzso on zzso 7 in the region zzso The full-length coding sequence of zzso transcribes a zzso zzso encompassing 13 zzso zzso zzso generates two zzso coding for a zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso variable number of tandem repeats zzso of the central tandem repeat domain of the zzso genes is not significantly detected in the zzso zzso In addition, we show the zzso of zzso by Western zzso and zzso analyses in pancreatic tumor cell lines and tumor zzso compared with the normal zzso The expression of zzso is regulated by a zzso zzso upstream of zzso that contains zzso zzso zzso and zzso response zzso
