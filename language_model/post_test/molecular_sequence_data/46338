zzso of zzso is essential for gastric colonization by zzso zzso The increased level of zzso in gastric acidity is due, in part, to acid zzso of the zzso system zzso consisting of the membrane sensor zzso and its response regulator, zzso which regulates zzso of the seven genes of the zzso gene zzso We now find that there are two major zzso zzso a zzso full-length zzso transcript and a zzso truncated transcript lacking 3' zzso zzso pH zzso zzso results in a significant increase in zzso of zzso while neutral pH zzso zzso increases the truncated zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis with sense zzso and zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends detects an zzso small zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso strand consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the level of the truncated zzso transcript along with that of the zzso at both pH zzso and pH zzso zzso of zzso increases the zzso transcript, decreases the zzso transcript, and decreases zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso shows that zzso zzso binds specifically to the zzso zzso The ability of the zzso zzso to both increase and decrease zzso expression at low and high zzso respectively, zzso gastric habitation and colonization over the wide range of zzso zzso experienced by the zzso
