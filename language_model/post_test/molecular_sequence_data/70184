To develop improved methods for zzso protein production in zzso zzso we studied the zzso of human zzso zzso Since in zzso experiments with culture medium revealed that zzso was rapidly zzso several zzso strains of zzso zzso were isolated and tested for reduced degradation of zzso compared with the zzso zzso The zzso strain giving the least zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso was transformed with several zzso zzso Initially, zzso was expressed using various signal sequences fused to the sequence of mature zzso The resulting zzso did not produce zzso amounts of zzso despite high zzso levels in one zzso We hypothesized that zzso was not efficiently processed during passage along the zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed as a fusion protein with zzso a protein which is efficiently zzso by zzso zzso and expression of which can easily be measured zzso To obtain mature zzso a sequence zzso the zzso zzso zzso was inserted between zzso and zzso zzso zzso active zzso was found to be zzso in the zzso zzso Using this combined approach of transforming a zzso strain with a fusion construct containing the zzso site, up to 15 zzso zzso active zzso was obtained in zzso zzso A fusion construct without the zzso site resulted in substantially higher production of the fusion zzso but zzso was not active in the fused zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso contains a zzso with similar specificity as the zzso zzso from zzso
