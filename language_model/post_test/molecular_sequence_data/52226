The plasma zzso zzso transfer protein zzso primarily zzso in the liver of several species, is expressed at very low levels in a number of transformed human liver cell zzso The human zzso gene promoter contains a sequence that closely resembles the binding site for the zzso factor zzso protein zzso This site is capable of binding zzso as shown by zzso mobility shift and zzso I footprint zzso zzso expression of the bacterial zzso zzso gene under the control of the human zzso gene zzso gave low activities in the human zzso cell line, zzso However, in the presence of zzso zzso activity was markedly elevated indicating that zzso gene promoter activity was zzso In primary cultures of isolated zzso zzso zzso was lost rapidly and in parallel with the zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in the proper maintenance of zzso gene promoter activity, and its low levels in zzso or cultured cells may account for the low level of the zzso gene expression in immortalized human liver cell lines or cultured zzso
