The zzso properties of the zzso zzso protein component of zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso were examined under zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso In wild type zzso zzso zzso two zzso species zzso more slowly than zzso zzso protein were detected using zzso protein zzso The uppermost species zzso with the zzso protein produced by a zzso zzso zzso unable to zzso zzso zzso and by zzso coli harboring the plasmids zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso extracts increases the zzso mobility of the zzso protein to that of zzso zzso protein in a zzso process giving rise to a species of intermediate mobility between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso gel zzso showed that a zzso zzso is associated with the zzso protein and with the intermediate species, but not with the zzso zzso zzso sequencing identified this associated zzso as the zzso gene product, which we propose is acting as a temporary enforcer of the zzso protein structure required for zzso binding that is released upon zzso zzso This zzso mobility shift was used to characterize the zzso zzso proteins produced in zzso coli as a result of deleting the various nitrogen fixation zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso coli extracts bearing plasmids deleted in zzso zzso zzso or zzso exhibit less than zzso of the zzso protein activity of zzso zzso and contain an zzso species whose zzso mobility is increased upon addition of zzso from that of zzso protein to that of zzso protein in a single zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of zzso zzso coli extracts followed by zzso showed that these inactive zzso species do not contain iron, indicating that the zzso are zzso We therefore propose that zzso zzso zzso W, zzso and M are all involved, to varying degrees, in zzso zzso In addition, the presence of the zzso does appear to be necessary for the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein to zzso
