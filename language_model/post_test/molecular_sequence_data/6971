Previous studies using in zzso procedures have not clearly established whether the zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso or zzso in the zzso We have used the zzso zzso system as an in zzso approach to investigate the zzso of the zzso zzso in the absence and presence of zzso and zzso This system is independent of zzso binding to the zzso response zzso Two zzso expressing zzso DNA binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Control experiments showed that each fusion protein had a high affinity binding site for zzso beta and could zzso an zzso reporter gene in zzso similar to the wild type zzso The two fusion zzso zzso zzso and zzso 4 zzso were expressed in the zzso strain, zzso which carries a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured via zzso of zzso through interaction of the fusion zzso which zzso zzso through the zzso zzso When both zzso fusion proteins were zzso zzso activity was zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed that both tamoxifen and zzso zzso also induced zzso activity, albeit lower than that induced by zzso zzso These results strongly argue that zzso zzso is zzso and the zzso can be induced by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso We also treated the zzso containing the two fusion proteins with zzso beta and tamoxifen or zzso zzso simultaneously to determine the effects on zzso zzso zzso activity was lower when the zzso was treated with a higher ratio of tamoxifen or zzso zzso to zzso than zzso beta zzso Taken together, we conclude that zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and we suggest that zzso zzso zzso are zzso when zzso beta is used with tamoxifen or zzso zzso zzso
