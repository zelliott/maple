T cell zzso and clones were established from the parental zzso zzso T zzso line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to investigate their capability to recognize tumor zzso on zzso I zzso other than zzso Thirty-nine of 52 zzso zzso or 30 of 83 zzso clones produced zzso zzso by recognition of the zzso zzso tumor zzso Among these 39 zzso zzso 22, 22, and 2 zzso produced zzso by recognition of zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor cells, zzso zzso 8, and 4 of these 30 zzso clones also produced zzso by recognition of zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor cells, zzso The other 13 zzso or 53 clones failed to produce zzso by recognition of the zzso tumor cells, zzso These results suggest the presence of zzso recognizing shared tumor zzso on zzso tumor cells expressed by zzso zzso I zzso in a patient with zzso zzso
