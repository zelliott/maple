We compared the biological properties of zzso zzso zzso encephalitis zzso virus isolated in zzso Japan) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including plaque formation, virus replication and virus protein synthesis in zzso cell cultures to reveal strain zzso We also determined the complete zzso sequences of both strains and compared the deduced zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso were smaller than those of zzso zzso zzso in culture fluid of zzso zzso were zzso of those of zzso at 9 and 12 zzso after zzso Less viral protein and zzso zzso of strain zzso zzso was observed than with zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso of zzso acids to differ with zzso No difference between the two strains was detected in the motif sequence of the viral zzso zzso sites of viral protein or zzso sites of zzso
