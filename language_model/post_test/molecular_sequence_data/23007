The family of zzso zzso includes two zzso zzso and zzso which are thought to be essential for muscle and neural zzso Similar to zzso organisms, zzso has two zzso zzso rotated abdomen zzso and zzso zzso proteins with high zzso to their zzso zzso The previously reported zzso zzso of the zzso gene includes a zzso rotation of the abdomen and defects in embryonic muscle zzso No zzso have been described so far for the zzso zzso In this study, we determined that the zzso in the twisted zzso zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso The twisted zzso represent a zzso group of zzso zzso that, similar to the zzso zzso exhibit a zzso abdomen rotation zzso Several zzso zzso were isolated in the zzso however, none of them was zzso zzso We used an expression rescue approach to confirm that zzso locus represents zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso represents an zzso acid substitution within the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that the protein products of both zzso and zzso genes zzso within zzso cells where they reside in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis showed that both genes have essentially overlapping patterns of expression throughout most of zzso zzso zzso while only the zzso transcript is present at early embryonic stages (5 and zzso suggesting its maternal zzso Finally, we analyzed the genetic interactions between zzso and zzso using several zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso Our data suggest that the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have zzso functions within the same zzso cascade and that their activities are required simultaneously for possibly the same zzso zzso Our results establish the possibility of using zzso as a model system for studying molecular and genetic mechanisms of protein zzso during zzso
