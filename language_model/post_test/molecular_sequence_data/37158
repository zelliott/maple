Advances in DNA zzso technology have recently generated efficient tools for various types of functional genetic zzso We demonstrate here the power of the zzso zzso in zzso DNA zzso system for modification and functional characterization of a complete bacterial virus zzso The linear zzso DNA zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso was studied by zzso zzso with reporter zzso zzso that were integrated in zzso into isolated zzso zzso After introduction into bacterial cells by zzso zzso zzso virus clones were identified by zzso or visual zzso screening employing zzso of zzso coli zzso Additionally, a modified zzso with engineered zzso sites at both ends was used to introduce novel restriction sites into the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso integration sites in the zzso of viable zzso zzso generated a functional map, collectively indicating genes and zzso regions essential and zzso for virus zzso Moreover, zzso zzso defined the direction of zzso within several zzso zzso zzso These strategies for the analysis of viral zzso are of a general nature and therefore may be applied to functional zzso studies in all zzso and zzso cell zzso
