A new zzso system zzso designated zzso was identified in the zzso zzso of the malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso system by zzso the zzso zzso of factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso and subsequent release of zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso system on cultured human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso binding zzso show that this zzso effect is due to zzso specific binding of zzso to both zzso and high molecular weight zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso interacts with both the zzso of zzso and domain zzso of zzso which are the binding zzso for biological zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso system by interfering with the association of zzso and zzso with biological zzso surfaces, resulting in the zzso of zzso release in a host animal during insect zzso
