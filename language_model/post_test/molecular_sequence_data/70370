An intermediate of 35 zzso accumulates zzso during zzso degradation of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso it is derived by an zzso zzso in the zzso domain near the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso all of the precursor zzso is converted to this zzso which is zzso only after zzso is removed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso Here we have generated zzso of zzso that do not form the zzso fragment, either in zzso cells or during in zzso translation reactions in the presence of pancreatic zzso In zzso cells the zzso of zzso degradation of these zzso proteins are indistinguishable from that of zzso zzso indicating the existence of a second zzso of zzso degradation which does not involve formation of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso by this alternative zzso is inhibited by zzso or zzso but neither formation nor degradation of the zzso zzso is blocked by these zzso As determined by zzso sequencing of the zzso fragment, formed either in zzso cells or during in zzso translation reactions in the presence of pancreatic zzso the putative zzso sites are between small zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso to the zzso site by large zzso or charged ones decreased the amount of zzso zzso formed and in some cases changed the putative zzso zzso zzso can also be affected by zzso acid zzso zzso to zzso or zzso which change protein zzso zzso the zzso that generates the zzso zzso has specificity similar to that of signal zzso zzso and zzso are zzso that differ only by a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso of zzso is zzso in the zzso but up to zzso of zzso folds properly and matures to the cell zzso The sites of zzso to form the zzso zzso are slightly different in zzso and zzso Two zzso zzso zzso with either a zzso or zzso substitution at the position of zzso of the zzso in zzso have zzso fates similar to that of zzso These zzso are likely to change the protein zzso in this zzso Thus the zzso of the zzso domain of the zzso protein is important in determining its zzso fate within the zzso
