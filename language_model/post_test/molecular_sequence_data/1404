The insect steroid hormone zzso works through a zzso nuclear zzso the zzso zzso zzso which plays critical roles in insect development and zzso The zzso has been exploited to develop zzso to control zzso and gene switches for gene zzso Recently reported crystal structures of the zzso protein show different but partially overlapping binding cavities for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso providing an explanation for the differential activity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were recently discovered as zzso zzso zzso of the zzso (from zzso zzso zzso zzso binding domain followed by screening in a reporter zzso led to the identification of zzso zzso which responded well to zzso zzso but poorly to both zzso and zzso zzso These zzso were further improved by introducing a second zzso zzso which was previously reported to cause zzso zzso Testing of these zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso mouse model zzso interaction zzso and in insect cells showed that this zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso but not by zzso or zzso zzso The zzso and its zzso zzso were used to demonstrate simultaneous regulation of two reporter genes using zzso and zzso zzso
