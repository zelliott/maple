The region of zzso encompassing type III repeats 4-6 contains a low affinity zzso binding domain, but its zzso significance is not zzso We have studied whether this domain is able to interact with cells as already shown for other zzso binding zzso of zzso A computer search based on zzso with known active sites in zzso revealed the sequence zzso located in zzso A synthetic zzso containing this sequence induced zzso cell zzso upon treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or with zzso indicating that zzso was binding to an zzso A zzso zzso containing repeat zzso zzso also zzso zzso of zzso cells while the zzso zzso did zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell zzso to zzso as well as to a zzso zzso zzso and zzso two previously known zzso for zzso zzso zzso also zzso with the binding of soluble alkaline zzso zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso to other zzso inhibited cell zzso to zzso and zzso These results therefore establish a cell adhesive function for the zzso repeat and show that zzso is a novel zzso zzso for activated zzso zzso
