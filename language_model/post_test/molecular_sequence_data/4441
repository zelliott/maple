zzso alpha 7 beta 1 is a specific cellular zzso for the basement membrane protein zzso zzso zzso as well as for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The alpha 7 zzso is expressed mainly in skeletal and cardiac muscle and has been suggested to be involved in differentiation and migration processes during zzso Three zzso and two zzso zzso zzso that have been described are zzso regulated and expressed in different sites in the zzso In adult muscle, the alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso are concentrated in zzso junctions but can also be detected in zzso junctions and along the zzso zzso To study the potential involvement of alpha 7 zzso during zzso and its role in muscle integrity and function, we generated a zzso zzso of the alpha 7 gene zzso in the zzso of mice by zzso zzso in embryonic stem zzso zzso Surprisingly, mice zzso for the zzso are viable and zzso indicating that the alpha 7 beta 1 zzso is not essential for zzso However, zzso analysis of skeletal muscle revealed typical symptoms of a progressive muscular zzso starting soon after birth, but with a distinct zzso in different muscle zzso The observed zzso changes strongly indicate an impairment of function of the zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that alpha 7 beta 1 zzso represents an indispensable linkage between the muscle zzso and the zzso zzso that is independent of the zzso zzso interaction of the zzso with the muscle basement zzso
