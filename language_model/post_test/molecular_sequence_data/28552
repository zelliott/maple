We have cloned the zzso for two novel human zzso designated zzso and beta (for zzso zzso that are zzso to zzso a previously known zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes two protein zzso the longer protein zzso contains a complete zzso and zzso zzso zzso domain, a novel protein domain that we recently identified, whereas its shorter zzso zzso lacks the full zzso domain as a result of an alternative zzso zzso that introduces a nonsense zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso zzso are zzso expressed in various cells and zzso The expression of zzso or the complete zzso domain, but not zzso causes extensive zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso can form a zzso complex via a unique sequence motif within its zzso domain, and deletion of this interacting motif prevents its zzso zzso These results indicate the presence of two zzso zzso zzso as cellular regulators and that the zzso domain of zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso The significance of this is zzso
