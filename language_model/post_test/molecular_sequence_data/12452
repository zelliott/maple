A zzso zzso a zzso protein has been isolated from a zzso library from the zzso zones of zzso zzso zzso zzso The precise function of this group of proteins in plants has yet to be confirmed but in animals there is convincing evidence that they bind heavy zzso Several of these proteins have recently been zzso from plants and it has been demonstrated that heavy metals have no zzso effect on their zzso In this paper we describe the isolation and zzso of a zzso zzso identified as a consequence of zzso screening a zzso library for messages zzso during zzso The zzso of the zzso occurred in the zzso zone tissue within 18 h of exposure to zzso while, in contrast, no expression was zzso in adjacent zzso zzso The transcript size of the message was approximately zzso zzso Northern analysis revealed that the zzso insert zzso did not zzso to zzso from either green or zzso leaflets but a signal was zzso with zzso extracted from zzso zzso The size of this zzso transcript was approximately zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein zzso by zzso was zzso zzso and had a molecular weight of approximately zzso zzso Southern analysis of zzso zzso zzso DNA showed that the zzso was zzso by a small gene zzso The protein exhibited greatest zzso to other zzso belonging to the Type 2 family including those from zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso was greatest around the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
