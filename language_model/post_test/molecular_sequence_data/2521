zzso gag zzso core zzso acid binding proteins contain either one or two sequences of the form zzso Previously, one of us has proposed that these sequences form zzso zzso in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso first observed in zzso factor zzso We report that an zzso acid zzso derived from the core zzso acid binding protein from zzso zzso leukemia virus binds metal zzso such as zzso and zzso The zzso spectrum of the zzso complex is highly suggestive of zzso coordination involving three zzso and one zzso zzso experiments indicate that the zzso constant for the zzso complex is zzso zzso and that zzso binds more tightly than zzso A detailed three-dimensional structure for this domain based on zzso zzso in other zzso characterized zzso and on a detailed analysis of the zzso sequences from zzso and other related sources is zzso
