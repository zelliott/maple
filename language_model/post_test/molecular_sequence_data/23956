To disclose mechanisms of zzso zzso and identify novel diagnostic markers and drug targets for treatment of these tumors, we previously zzso the expression profiles of 11 zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso Among the genes commonly zzso in the zzso we identified a novel human zzso which we termed zzso zzso protein zzso It encodes a nuclear protein of 413 zzso acids containing a zzso zzso To investigate its function, we searched for zzso proteins using zzso zzso system and identified nuclear zzso zzso of zzso was gradually increased in the late S to zzso zzso of cell cycle and it returned to the zzso level in the zzso zzso zzso of this gene by short interfering zzso resulted in growth zzso in the zzso zzso These data provide better understanding of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso may conceivably serve in the future as a novel therapeutic intervention for treatment of colon zzso
