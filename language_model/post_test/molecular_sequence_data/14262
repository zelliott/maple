zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and gene expression in zzso In zzso these proteins exist as multiple zzso with distinct properties, suggesting a functional significance to the zzso zzso zzso typically have a zzso structure composed of a zzso central zzso domain flanked by a highly variable short zzso domain and a longer highly basic zzso zzso We hypothesized that the variable terminal zzso of individual zzso contribute to their functional zzso by influencing zzso binding zzso We developed a novel dual color zzso recovery after zzso zzso system in which two zzso proteins fused to zzso zzso fluorescent proteins can be zzso and their independent binding zzso simultaneously monitored in a single zzso This approach was combined with domain swap and point zzso to determine the roles of the terminal zzso in the differential binding characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso changed their overall binding affinity to that of the other zzso In contrast, switching the zzso zzso altered the zzso interaction surface of the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso bind to zzso in an zzso specific manner and that the highly variable terminal zzso contribute to differences between zzso The methods developed in this study will have broad applications in studying dynamic properties of additional zzso zzso and other mobile zzso
