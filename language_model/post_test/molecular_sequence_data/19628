zzso zzso virus has long served as a paradigm for the study of the zzso progression of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso cells, followed by an initial zzso expansion of infected cells, which is driven by the zzso of a naturally occurring truncated form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of additional zzso in zzso and the zzso of zzso result in full zzso zzso The early stages of transformation induced by zzso virus are characterized in zzso by the zzso growth of infected zzso We have shown previously that this transforming event requires the zzso activity and zzso binding site of zzso and the recruitment of a zzso complex to zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso is required for the zzso growth of zzso zzso cells and that the zzso of zzso by zzso is zzso by a novel zzso binding site in zzso These results underscore a central role for zzso in zzso transformation and describe a previously unidentified role for zzso in the recruitment and zzso of zzso in response to transforming signals generated by zzso zzso
