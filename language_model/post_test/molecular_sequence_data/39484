zzso of proteins and lipids is important in cellular communication and maintenance of zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso that is found in zzso animals ranging from zzso to insects and zzso The aim of this work was to identify and characterize the zzso gene in the mouse and to study its expression in various zzso The zzso gene codes for a protein which shares zzso zzso acid sequence identity with its human zzso and contains all the primary structural features that characterize zzso zzso The zzso and human zzso genes share an identical zzso organization, and both genes zzso multiple zzso zzso Their promoter regions show extensive zzso zzso that the two genes also share regulatory zzso This notion was reinforced by Northern zzso analysis of mouse zzso which showed the tissue distribution of zzso zzso to be similar to that previously found in human zzso with the heart, zzso and brain being major sites of expression in both zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was studied by in zzso zzso in an extensive collection of mouse zzso of which the zzso cells of the zzso bulb and the zzso of the seminal zzso displayed particularly strong zzso Together, these analyses indicate that the zzso zzso is subject to strong zzso and zzso zzso The findings reported here make possible the design of a zzso zzso zzso provide a framework for analyzing the regulation of the zzso and provide an extensive catalog of zzso in which this novel protein zzso
