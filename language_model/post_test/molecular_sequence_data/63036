The zzso constitutes a complex niche that may be exploited by a wide variety of zzso zzso interactions in this niche can be influenced by factors such as the expression of zzso genes in the zzso The objective of this work was to describe the bacterial communities associated with the zzso and zzso regions of tobacco plants, and to compare communities from transgenic tobacco lines zzso zzso and zzso with those found in zzso zzso zzso zzso were collected at two stages of plant development, the zzso and flowering stages (1 and 3 months after zzso The diversity of the zzso microbial community was assessed by isolation and further characterization of zzso by amplified zzso zzso gene restriction analysis zzso and zzso zzso zzso These analyses revealed the presence of fairly common zzso organisms with the main groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of the total bacterial communities using zzso zzso zzso gel zzso revealed that shifts in bacterial communities occurred during early plant development, but the zzso of original community structure was observed over zzso The effects were smaller in zzso than in zzso samples, where selection of specific bacterial groups by the different plant lines was zzso zzso patterns and principal components analysis zzso were used to distinguish the plant lines according to the fingerprint of their associated bacterial zzso zzso zzso detected in plant lines were found to be affiliated with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso plants, zzso The data revealed that, although zzso microbial communities can be affected by the zzso of transgenic plants, soil resilience may be able to restore the original bacterial diversity after one cycle of plant zzso
