The soybean zzso gene for resistance to soybean mosaic virus zzso zzso has previously been described as a zzso zzso gene mapping to molecular linkage group zzso zzso Various zzso zzso condition different responses to the seven zzso described strains of zzso including extreme resistance, localized and systemic zzso and mosaic zzso We describe the cloning of a cluster of zzso resistance gene candidates from zzso F of the zzso soybean line zzso and demonstrate that multiple genes within this cluster interact to condition unique responses to zzso zzso In addition to cloning zzso a strong candidate for the major zzso resistance gene from zzso we describe various unique resistant and zzso reactions zzso with the presence or absence of other members of this gene zzso zzso of zzso lines from a high-resolution mapping population of zzso zzso zzso Lee 68 zzso demonstrate that more than one gene in this region of the zzso zzso conditions resistance and/or necrosis to zzso In addition, the soybean zzso Marshall and Ogden, which carry other previously described zzso zzso are shown to possess the zzso gene in a zzso gene cluster background distinct from zzso These observations suggest that two or more related zzso gene products are likely involved in the zzso response of several zzso lines to zzso
