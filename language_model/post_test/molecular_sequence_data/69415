zzso coli zzso was zzso in zzso coli up to zzso from a synthetic zzso gene placed in a zzso under the dependence of an zzso zzso zzso to nearly zzso zzso was achieved after two zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso instead of zzso at position 34) was obtained by the same procedure except that it was zzso in a strain lacking the zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that, except for the replacement of zzso by zzso in zzso zzso the base modification levels of both zzso are the same as those in zzso zzso coli zzso zzso properties of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso compared to those in the zzso reactions in zzso and zzso coli clearly indicate that the major identity elements are the same in both zzso the zzso zzso base and the zzso zzso In connection with this, we explored by zzso zzso the functional role of the interactions which, as revealed by the zzso structure, occur between the zzso base of zzso zzso and two zzso of zzso zzso Their absence strongly affected zzso and the zzso of zzso Each contact individually restores almost completely the zzso zzso properties of the zzso thus, zzso base recognition in zzso appears to be more protected against zzso events than in zzso coli, where only one contact is thought to occur at position zzso
