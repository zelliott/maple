To understand the effects of zzso zzso in linear zzso peptides with zzso zzso on cell zzso ability and membrane zzso zzso 

A series of zzso zzso were designed and zzso by replacing zzso or zzso with zzso at different positions on the zzso face of zzso The zzso and zzso activity and secondary structure of the designed zzso peptides were zzso In addition, the role of zzso in membrane disruption for these designed peptides was zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated stronger activity than the other peptides against both zzso and zzso zzso All of the tested peptides zzso zzso with zzso charged zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso or zzso and, to a lesser extent, with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused zzso release at zzso zzso 

The position of zzso rather than the number of zzso zzso in these peptides was an important factor in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were deeply inserted into zzso charged zzso but were largely exposed in zzso buffer zzso 

These zzso peptides may represent good candidates for new zzso agents and for use in new therapeutic zzso
