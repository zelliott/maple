zzso in Aurora of zzso and related zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to cause abnormal zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso a novel human protein zzso of 402 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso which shares high zzso acid identities with the zzso protein zzso family; hence the zzso is designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso domain of zzso shares 86, 86, 72, 59, and zzso identity with those of zzso zzso and zzso mouse zzso Aurora of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, whereas zzso domain of zzso shares high zzso only with those of zzso and zzso Northern and Western zzso analyses revealed that zzso is expressed highly in zzso and various zzso cells including zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso levels of zzso zzso and protein contents are tightly regulated during cell cycle zzso Both of these levels are low in zzso accumulate during zzso and reduce rapidly after zzso Its protein zzso activity is also enhanced at zzso as zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using a specific zzso have shown that zzso is localized to the zzso pole during zzso especially from zzso through zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is a novel member of a protein zzso family possibly involved in a zzso zzso such as zzso segregation or zzso zzso
