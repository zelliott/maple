zzso zzso due to zzso of a zzso zzso to wild type has been described in several zzso zzso zzso The best known mechanism involves zzso zzso zzso or gene conversion in compound zzso patients, zzso one zzso serves to restore the zzso sequence in the zzso Here we document for the first time functional correction of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso patients resulting from zzso secondary sequence zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso was compensated by two additional single zzso deletions zzso and zzso another zzso zzso zzso zzso was compensated by zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso zzso was altered by zzso creating a zzso zzso Although in all three cases the predicted proteins were different from wild type, their zzso zzso the characteristic hypersensitivity of zzso cells to zzso agents, thus establishing a functional correction to wild zzso
