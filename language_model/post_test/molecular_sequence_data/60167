The organization of the human zzso zzso zzso gene was found to be similar to its rat counterpart, and the location of the zzso in the protein structure was identical to the rat zzso zzso The major zzso start site, identified by primer extension, was located 260 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso upstream region was highly zzso between the human and rat zzso zzso The putative promoter region contained a zzso zzso and many putative zzso elements including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso box, zzso zzso and zzso A Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso was strongly expressed in the liver and zzso and zzso in the heart, brain and zzso zzso zzso was also detected in human zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso level in zzso cells was decreased after 2 h and reached a minimum 6 zzso h after a zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment, and then gradually returned to the zzso zzso
