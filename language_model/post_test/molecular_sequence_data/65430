We have compared the efficacy of zzso of the zzso zzso complexes from zzso and bovine heart zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso three zzso that act at the zzso reduction site at center N of the zzso Although the three zzso have some structural features in common, they differ significantly in their patterns of zzso Also, while the overall folding pattern of zzso b around center N is similar in the zzso from the three species, zzso acid sequence differences create sufficient structural differences so that there are striking differences in the zzso binding to the three zzso zzso is the most tightly bound of the three zzso and binds zzso to the isolated zzso from all three species under the zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso H also binds zzso to the zzso zzso but binds approximately 2 orders of magnitude less tightly to the bovine zzso and is essentially zzso to the zzso zzso zzso on the other hand zzso the zzso and bovine zzso similarly, with zzso approximately 10 zzso while the zzso for the zzso zzso is more than zzso zzso Similar differences in inhibitor efficacy were noted in zzso complexes from zzso zzso with single zzso acid zzso at the center N site, although the binding affinity of zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso to a degree that impaired zzso function in the zzso zzso These results reveal a high degree of specificity in the zzso of zzso at center zzso accompanied by sufficient structural plasticity for zzso binding as to not compromise center N zzso The results also demonstrate that, in principle, it should be possible to design novel zzso targeted toward center N of the zzso complex with appropriate species selectivity to allow their use as drugs against zzso zzso and zzso
