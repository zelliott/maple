We have identified zzso and characterized the expression of 13 novel zzso zzso genes of potential importance in host colonization and reproduction by the California zzso zzso zzso zzso Twelve are of the zzso family and one is of the zzso zzso Following feeding on host zzso zzso zzso bark zzso transcript levels of several of the zzso genes increased or decreased in males only or in both zzso In one instance zzso transcript accumulated significantly in zzso but declined significantly in zzso The zzso gene zzso transcript levels in males were zzso 85 zzso zzso higher at 8 h and zzso 25 zzso zzso higher at 24 h after feeding compared with zzso zzso zzso levels in females were approximately 150 zzso higher at 24 h compared with zzso zzso zzso transcript was present zzso regardless of sex or feeding and served as a better zzso gene than zzso or zzso zzso for the real-time zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The expression patterns of zzso zzso and, especially, zzso in males suggest roles for these genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso The differential transcript zzso patterns of these bark zzso zzso provide insight into ecological interactions of zzso zzso with its host zzso
