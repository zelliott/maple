A clone containing zzso DNA from zzso zzso was obtained by zzso It zzso to the zzso end of one zzso and exclusively to regions in the three remaining, zzso zzso to which zzso have previously been localized on zzso zzso In the zzso positions the zzso can be assigned to thin zzso The clone contains zzso tandem repeats and short zzso regions represented in all of the zzso zzso experiments show that the four zzso together contain zzso of zzso repeat per zzso In a line of tissue culture cells the amounts are increased by a factor zzso resulting in zzso extended zzso of tandem zzso Each repeat contains two zzso surrounding a region containing only AT base pairs, a feature with some similarity to functionally essential elements in the zzso zzso zzso
