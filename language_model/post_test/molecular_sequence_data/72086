Recently, a zzso zzso was cloned from bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso and a mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso and was shown to be zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of which resulted in defective transport of zzso Here, we report the cloning from a human skeletal muscle zzso library of a human zzso II zzso zzso zzso to the presumed bovine and mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid identity, zzso Compared with the bovine and mouse counterparts, the cloned zzso II zzso exhibits a similar membrane zzso but contains 15 additional zzso acids zzso vs zzso located in the second zzso loop, near the zzso zzso However, zzso analysis performed with zzso from different human zzso and cell lines revealed that the coding sequence for these 15 zzso is sometimes present and sometimes zzso most likely as a result of a zzso alternative zzso zzso The zzso II zzso which was mapped to zzso zzso is expressed as a zzso zzso species in a large variety of zzso but was not detected in liver, zzso and zzso nor in the zzso cell line zzso
