The 54 zzso protein zzso of the signal recognition particle zzso has been shown to bind signal sequences by zzso zzso zzso structure analysis and zzso comparisons have suggested that zzso is composed of two zzso an zzso domain that contains a putative zzso site zzso and a zzso domain that contains a high abundance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed that the two proposed zzso of zzso indeed represent structurally discrete zzso Upon zzso the intact zzso was released from zzso whereas the zzso remained attached to the core of the zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the isolated zzso associates with zzso zzso in the presence of zzso In addition, we observed a specific binding of the zzso directly to zzso zzso of zzso coli, which contains a structural motif also present in zzso zzso This shows that the zzso contains an zzso binding site, and suggests that zzso may be linked to the rest of zzso through this domain by a direct interaction with zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we found that in an in zzso translation system the zzso signal sequence contacts zzso through the zzso of zzso These results imply that the zzso contains the signal sequence binding site of zzso although we cannot exclude that the zzso may also be in proximity to bound signal zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
