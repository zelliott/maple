We have investigated the effects of DNA damage by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso light on the formation of a positioned zzso in the zzso borealis zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso products indicates that zzso damage zzso the formation of a zzso onto this zzso Competitive zzso experiments show that average levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso the size of DNA associated with a zzso core zzso yield changes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in the free energy zzso zzso of zzso zzso These values yield increases of core zzso binding to zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso and zzso compared with undamaged zzso zzso zzso with zzso light decreases zzso zzso zzso at either 500 or zzso zzso of zzso light zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (on average), zzso results in respective changes of zzso and zzso zzso This translates to decreases in core zzso binding to zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso and zzso compared with undamaged zzso These results indicate that zzso stability can be markedly affected by the formation of certain DNA zzso Such changes could have major effects on the zzso of DNA processing zzso
