A zzso base pair zzso from the zzso DNA of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and shown to contain the complete genes for 12 transfer zzso and five protein genes zzso zzso 6, zzso 8, zzso zzso two partial protein genes zzso and zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and large zzso The order of these constituent genes differs from those of other zzso zzso gene zzso Only a single zzso involving a block of protein coding genes and three zzso zzso are necessary to produce identical gene orders between zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, only one gene boundary is shared between the zzso zzso gene order and that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This extends the observation that there is little conservation of zzso gene order amongst the zzso and suggests that radical zzso DNA gene zzso has occurred on the branch leading to the zzso
