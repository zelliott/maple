Five zzso zzso zzso are described that can be used to help identify the zzso components of zzso Comparisons among partial sequence from the zzso large zzso zzso gene zzso were used to select the zzso which were intended to be specific to several zzso within the zzso group of the zzso zzso zzso S1, zzso and zzso were targeted at the zzso zzso zzso and zzso probe zzso was designed to recognize the family, zzso and probe zzso was designed to recognize all of these zzso and any other members of the zzso zzso The specificity of each probe was determined zzso by testing their ability to zzso to zzso amplified fragments derived from 84 species of zzso Although none of the zzso exhibited their intended zzso all specifically zzso to useful zzso of zzso and collectively they can be used to identify many zzso zzso to the generic level or zzso The zzso were also tested for their ability to identify field collected zzso and were found to perform zzso
