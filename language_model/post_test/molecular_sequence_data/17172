The zzso zzso the rate of zzso bond formation by at least zzso but the zzso mechanism remains zzso Here we report evidence that a functional group on one of the zzso zzso plays an essential zzso role in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 2' OH with 2' H or 2' F results in at least a zzso reduction in the rate of zzso bond formation, but does not affect binding of the modified zzso Such zzso zzso is relatively uncommon among modern protein zzso but it is a property predicted to be essential for the evolution of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso assistance has been retained as a zzso strategy during the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso center into the modern zzso
