zzso is often the second or third most common cause of zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso infections are difficult to treat, often resistant to many zzso zzso agents and are associated with a high mortality rate in compromised zzso We determined the zzso structure of the zzso zzso from three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of the zzso products of these zzso showed a significant difference in the amount of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso strain contained up to the zzso side chains and the zzso terminal of the zzso was predominantly the zzso zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso of the two former strains possessed up to the zzso side chains and the amount of the zzso zzso zzso was very zzso zzso zzso than zzso in the zzso products of these zzso were identified as incomplete zzso fragments by analyzing zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso degradation zzso Resistance to the zzso drugs zzso and zzso was significantly different in these zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso strain, which involved a large amount of the zzso zzso zzso exhibited significant sensitivity to these zzso zzso
