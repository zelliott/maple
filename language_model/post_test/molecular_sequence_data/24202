More than zzso zzso zzso have been zzso from 20 different zzso libraries by the Swedish Centre for Tree zzso zzso We screened this zzso collection for zzso zzso factors involved in secondary vascular tissue formation, and genes assigned as zzso zzso and zzso were selected for further zzso Three zzso genes showed different expression patterns in various zzso zzso and stem zzso representing different zzso stages of vascular tissue zzso Furthermore, the analysis showed that zzso expression was much higher in secondary cell wall formation zone of zzso and zzso fibers than in other zzso zzso zzso hybrid zzso plants, expressing the zzso of the zzso gene in zzso orientation were generated to assess the function of zzso gene in vascular tissue formation and zzso All transgenic lines showed reduced growth and had fewer zzso compared to the zzso The analysis of selected lines showed that acid soluble zzso present in the bark was higher in transgenic lines as compared to zzso zzso zzso a higher transcript level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso of the transgenic plants, suggesting that zzso might function as a zzso zzso
