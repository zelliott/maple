We examined the full-length zzso B virus zzso envelope zzso zzso or zzso small surface zzso zzso sequences of 12 different liver samples from 10 different zzso chronic zzso Surprisingly, novel and frequent zzso occurred predominantly at zzso acids 40 and 47 of zzso in addition to within a known protective zzso zzso zzso group a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of chronic carriers contain zzso at the group a zzso The zzso frequency at the hotspot zzso 40 and 47 is approximately zzso 1 order of magnitude higher than at the known zzso sites of zzso zzso at zzso 122 and zzso which is approximately zzso This new zzso domain is found to coincide with a major zzso complex class zzso zzso zzso The potential biological significance of this novel zzso in the zzso of zzso chronic carriers is zzso
