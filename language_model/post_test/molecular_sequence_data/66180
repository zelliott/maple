Two types of zzso clones zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso salmon zzso zzso The two genes each consists of multiple zzso derived from different zzso or by an alternative zzso zzso revealed a broad zzso of the zzso and zzso transcripts that both expressed in brain, zzso liver, muscle, zzso zzso skin and zzso During the early stages of the zzso period, the zzso level of the zzso transcripts showed a large individual zzso at the maximum of zzso In contrast, as the plasma zzso hormone level elevated at the middle of the period, the variation in the expression level became much smaller at zzso After the completion of the zzso the zzso zzso level of the zzso genes rapidly zzso These findings suggest that the dynamics of the zzso zzso should be taken account in addition to the availability of the hormone zzso zzso and zzso to understand the underlying mechanisms of the zzso causing numerous zzso and zzso changes in zzso
