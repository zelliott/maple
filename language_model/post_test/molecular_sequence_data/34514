zzso is an intermediate in the degradation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso for zzso degradation zzso on the zzso zzso in the strain was cloned and zzso The zzso clone contained two zzso zzso and zzso of which the deduced zzso acid sequence shared significant zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Parts of the consensus sequences of the zzso gene and zzso gene have been identified in zzso and zzso from strain zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli, and partially zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also zzso in zzso coli, and the zzso zzso showed an zzso ring zzso activity toward zzso but a very low activity was observed toward zzso
