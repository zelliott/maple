A binding protein for zzso DNA zzso was zzso from calf zzso to near zzso by zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The most zzso fraction consisted of four zzso with molecular masses of 70, 55, 30, and 11 zzso The zzso with the molecular mass of 55 zzso is most likely a zzso form of the largest zzso The complex migrated as a whole on both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso radius approximately zzso zzso Combining these data indicates a native molecular mass of about 110 zzso which is in zzso with a zzso zzso for the 70 + zzso zzso The zzso binding protein zzso covered approximately zzso zzso on zzso zzso as revealed from both band shift experiments and zzso I zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex was zzso by the zzso binding protein zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso primed zzso zzso zzso was mainly due to facilitated DNA synthesis through stable secondary structures, as demonstrated by the vanishing of many, but not all, pausing zzso zzso of zzso was not affected on zzso with zzso an approximately twofold increase in product lengths was observed when zzso was zzso The increase was attributed to a facilitated zzso of zzso alpha to an already finished DNA zzso rather than to an enhancement of the intrinsic zzso of the zzso Similarly, products zzso zzso long were formed on zzso primed zzso DNA in the presence of zzso in contrast to zzso zzso when zzso was zzso zzso DNA replication on zzso DNA was inhibited by zzso in a zzso zzso However, with less sites available to begin with zzso zzso more homogeneous products were zzso
