zzso T cell zzso specific for zzso peptides of retinal zzso require a novel zzso zzso activity for zzso zzso that is distinct from zzso presentation by zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was much more efficient with zzso zzso than with zzso zzso although both provided similar levels of zzso zzso occupancy as measured by zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso did stimulate zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso To test the hypothesis that this activity was provided by a distinct cell population, zzso zzso were tested for their ability to present zzso to these zzso The most potent zzso presentation for zzso zzso was found to segregate with zzso B zzso zzso while adherent cells, or zzso T cells were unable to support zzso zzso Together with previous results, the data show that zzso presentation leading to zzso zzso by these zzso T cell zzso requires activated B cells, whereas zzso occupancy can be provided by several zzso zzso
