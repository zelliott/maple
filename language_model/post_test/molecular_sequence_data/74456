Four groups of zzso genes that zzso proteins with diverse structures were identified from zzso The majority of these genes were zzso by zzso zzso fly, zzso zzso zzso zzso larvae during incompatible zzso and were zzso by virulent larvae during compatible zzso The zzso during incompatible interactions and zzso during compatible interactions resulted in zzso to zzso differences between the expression levels in resistant plants and those in susceptible zzso The increased expression of zzso genes during incompatible interactions suggested that these genes are part of defense mechanisms in wheat against zzso fly attacks, whereas the zzso during compatible interactions suggested that virulent larvae can suppress plant zzso Both the zzso of the zzso genes during incompatible interactions by zzso larvae and the zzso during compatible interactions by virulent larvae were through mechanisms that were independent of the wound response zzso
