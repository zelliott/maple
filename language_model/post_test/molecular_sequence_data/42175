To evaluate zzso or zzso interactions and a relationship between such interactions and membrane properties such as bulk zzso percentage and surface oxygen percent, medical zzso zzso with extremely different zzso percentage and surface oxygen percentage were evaluated with normal human zzso or zzso Six types of zzso zzso zzso & surface oxygen zzso were studied including cellulose zzso zzso 0 & zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso vinyl alcohol zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 0 and zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso 0 and zzso zzso values of zzso zzso and complement components for zzso and both zzso zzso were smaller than those for sham, CA, zzso and zzso membrane module zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed no significant differences among all zzso except zzso zzso cell transformation functions to all zzso for zzso in contact with CA and zzso zzso were suppressed versus sham and zzso and both zzso zzso zzso concentration changes for plasma in contact with zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly smaller than sham, and a significant zzso of zzso was found for only zzso versus sham, CA, and zzso Higher surface oxygen percentages zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso but not zzso content were associated with lower protein zzso and higher zzso transformation function zzso These results suggest that surface oxygen percentage may be an important indicator of zzso
