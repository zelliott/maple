zzso plant zzso molecules include zzso having zzso zzso In animal, zzso proteins participate in cell zzso and zzso However, the molecular basis of interactions in plants is still unknown and none of these zzso have been characterized in zzso This work reports the characterization of 34 wheat zzso zzso and 24 rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses show that cereal zzso share structural characteristics with known zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso At least zzso of the wheat and rice zzso are predicted to be zzso to the plasma zzso zzso analyses determined from the relative abundance of zzso in the publicly available wheat zzso databases and from zzso gel blots indicate that most of these genes are zzso expressed and found mainly in seeds and zzso Furthermore, most wheat genes were down regulated by zzso stresses except for zzso and 12 where cold treatment zzso their expression in zzso Plant zzso zzso were predicted to have 3-D zzso with zzso domain of the zzso I insect neural cell zzso zzso with an estimated precision above zzso The structural analysis shows that zzso charged zzso acids are concentrated along the zzso edges, while the positively charged zzso acids are concentrated on the back side of the zzso This highly charged surface distribution could provide a way of zzso zzso interactions via zzso forces similar to many other zzso zzso The identification of wheat zzso will facilitate studying their function in plant growth and development and their role in stress zzso
