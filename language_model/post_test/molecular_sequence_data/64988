A full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso has been obtained from the channel zzso zzso zzso A single open reading frame predicts a 209 zzso acid protein that has 57% identity and zzso similarity with the AID proteins of mouse and zzso All zzso that have previously been found to be critical for zzso as well as for zzso zzso are zzso in the zzso zzso These zzso are also zzso in AID proteins predicted, from zzso database zzso to be expressed in zzso and zzso The zzso AID is expressed at low levels in zzso zzso zzso and fin margins, but not in muscle, liver or zzso zzso heavy chain zzso is also expressed in the zzso where AID is zzso The zzso expression of AID in zzso tissue was unexpected and not readily zzso However, the identification of a fish AID gene will allow us to determine the tissue architecture and locations for affinity maturation in zzso
