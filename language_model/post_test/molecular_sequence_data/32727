The zzso zzso of zzso C zzso is thought to be associated with various cellular functions and disease zzso However, little is known about how its function is controlled in cells, particularly in terms of the regulation of its zzso To understand the regulation mechanisms of the zzso gene transcription, the zzso region zzso approximately zzso (the zzso sequence data reported in this paper have been submitted to the zzso data bank under zzso numbers zzso of the human zzso gene was isolated from human zzso zzso It was a zzso promoter with very zzso sequences near the zzso start zzso The activity of the zzso promoter was shown in various human and mouse cell lines by zzso reporter zzso zzso deletion analysis identified the core promoter region as being between zzso and zzso in which an zzso and an zzso binding site played important roles in the promoter zzso In addition, we also showed that zzso zzso a zzso zzso and tumor promoter, induced the activity of the zzso promoter via the zzso binding zzso In zzso this study identified a core promoter region of the zzso gene and the factor binding sites responsible for the promoter zzso These results will provide important new information to further understand the regulatory mechanism of the zzso zzso
