The zzso zzso gene zzso contains a composite zzso response element zzso comprised of a zzso and an adjacent element with features of both a zzso element zzso and a zzso zzso zzso response element zzso The zzso element of the zzso contributed to two modes of zzso zzso 1) enhancement of the response to cortisol and 2) a synergistic response to cortisol and increased zzso zzso cells zzso with a zzso construct show minimal expression under zzso conditions or zzso zzso After cortisol treatment, zzso activity from the zzso is enhanced zzso to zzso greater than the zzso portion of the zzso or a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Treatment with both zzso and cortisol produced a zzso to zzso synergistic response over cortisol zzso zzso is also seen with zzso is specific for the zzso and occurs in a number of established cell zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso reduces the zzso by zzso zzso the zzso to zzso spacing changed both enhancement and zzso Moving the elements 3 zzso closer or extending 15 zzso reduced zzso zzso was markedly reduced when elements were one half of a zzso turn out of zzso Western blots verified that zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso A specific dominant negative inhibitor of the zzso family, zzso reduced zzso by zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso can potentially integrate signaling from both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways and that zzso may play an important role in this zzso
