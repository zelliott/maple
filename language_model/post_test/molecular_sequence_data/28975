zzso of zzso zzso in zzso coli involves a number of membrane proteins zzso which are required for the transfer of zzso to the zzso located zzso zzso The zzso includes zzso zzso transient binding of zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the subsequent release of zzso and zzso transfer and zzso attachment of zzso to zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso is a key player in the late steps of zzso c zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso signature motif of the zzso protein family are functionally zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso interacts directly with the zzso donor zzso and with zzso but not with zzso zzso We propose that zzso forms a bacterial zzso zzso complex for the transfer of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso
