zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the final step of de zzso zzso zzso Two major types of this zzso have been discovered to date: zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso The structure of the zzso gene product from zzso zzso was previously solved without functional zzso but shows high zzso acid sequence similarity to other zzso We determined the crystal structure of the zzso gene product in complex with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso A resolution, zzso On the basis of the sequence analysis, zzso structures, and zzso data, zzso is confirmed as an zzso zzso zzso thus designated as zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso core structure, showing an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The active site is located at the deep pocket between two central zzso and contains zzso strictly zzso within zzso Comparisons of the two types of zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that there are no similarities in zzso structure, or the active site architecture, suggesting that they are zzso not related to each zzso The zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso showed zzso decreased activity and the zzso zzso completely abolished zzso activity, suggesting that these highly zzso zzso play critical roles in zzso Interestingly, green fluorescent protein zzso which has no structural zzso to either zzso or zzso but zzso a similar zzso zzso reaction required for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a mechanism analogous to that of zzso
