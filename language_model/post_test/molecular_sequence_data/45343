The zzso zzso comprises 17 species, some of which are important animal and human zzso To gain more insight into the genetic zzso of this zzso and to improve the molecular tools available for diagnosis, a universal sequencing approach was established for the gene zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso A total of 59 zzso including the type strains of currently recognized species as well as field zzso were investigated in the zzso A primer set specific for zzso species enabled straightforward amplification and sequencing of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequences of all of the strains were determined in zzso A good zzso was obtained between zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso trees within the zzso zzso The branching of the zzso tree was similar to that of the zzso zzso gene tree, even though a few discrepancies were observed for certain zzso The resolution of the zzso gene within the zzso zzso was generally much higher than that of the zzso zzso gene zzso resulting in a clear separation of most species and even some zzso The universally zzso amplification and sequencing approach for partial zzso gene sequence determination provides a powerful tool for DNA zzso discrimination of zzso zzso
