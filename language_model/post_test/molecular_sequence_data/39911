The initiation of zzso reverse zzso zzso a cellular zzso as a zzso The 3' terminal zzso of the cellular zzso are complementary to a region on the viral zzso designated as the primer binding site zzso Previous studies have shown that forcing zzso to zzso alternative zzso zzso through zzso of the PBS results in viruses that zzso to zzso zzso following in zzso zzso In some instances though, zzso has been shown to select alternative zzso for initiation of reverse zzso if additional zzso upstream in the zzso region zzso were made to be complementary to these alternative zzso Recently, an zzso has been described in which the zzso region distinct from the zzso designated as the primer zzso site zzso was zzso in conjunction with the PBS to force the virus to use zzso as a zzso An additional zzso in reverse zzso zzso zzso was found to facilitate the forced use of zzso as the zzso In the current study, we have investigated the impact of the zzso zzso in zzso on the selection and use of alternative zzso by zzso zzso were first constructed in which the PBS and zzso region were made complementary to zzso Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that these viruses are unstable and mutate to select zzso or zzso Analysis of the replication of viruses with the zzso and PBS complementary to zzso with or without the zzso zzso revealed no significant differences with respect to zzso and viral growth in zzso or peripheral blood zzso cells zzso In addition, the presence of the zzso zzso did not influence the capacity of this virus to zzso to zzso zzso as the primer for initiation of reverse zzso In a previous study, we have described an zzso that has been forced to zzso zzso through zzso in the zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso in this virus did not impact on the virus zzso or growth in zzso or zzso We did not find a significant fitness advantage to viruses in which the zzso and PBS were made complementary to zzso that also contained the zzso zzso in zzso The results of these studies then establish that zzso can be forced to use alternative zzso through zzso in the zzso zzso or zzso for certain zzso Furthermore, for zzso in the zzso and zzso the zzso does not play an important role in dictating the selection of the alternative zzso to be used for initiation of reverse zzso
