To detect zzso deletions of survival motor zzso zzso gene with zzso DNA sequencing, and to assess the value of genetic testing for the diagnosis of spinal muscular zzso zzso 

zzso chain reaction zzso was used for amplifying zzso gene in 100 zzso patients and 110 zzso Four different bases zzso zzso zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso within the amplified segments were identified with zzso DNA zzso zzso deletion of zzso or zzso was determined by the presence or absence of base zzso at such four zzso zzso zzso probe amplification zzso was carried out to confirm the results of zzso DNA zzso 

In the 100 zzso samples, only zzso specific base zzso were detected at the four sites, for which the copy numbers of zzso and zzso was zzso or zzso suggesting zzso deletion of zzso zzso By contrast, only zzso specific base zzso were detected in 5 samples, for which the ratio of zzso was zzso indicating zzso deletion of zzso At four different sites, zzso zzso zzso were detected in the remaining 105 samples, for which zzso zzso suggesting zzso of zzso or zzso The results of sequencing were consistent with those of zzso 

zzso DNA sequencing is a zzso accurate and economic method for the diagnosis of zzso deletion of zzso
