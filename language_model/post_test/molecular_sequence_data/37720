zzso between soybean and zzso was studied by using conceptual translations of DNA sequences from zzso that map to soybean linkage groups zzso J, and zzso zzso was found between these linkage groups and all four of the zzso zzso where zzso contained enough sequence for zzso to be identified zzso zzso linkage group zzso zzso and zzso zzso I showed significant zzso over almost their entire zzso with only 2-3 zzso zzso required to bring the maps into substantial zzso Smaller blocks of zzso were identified between zzso and zzso zzso IV and V (near the zzso and zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso I and V (near the zzso and zzso zzso These zzso zzso regions were themselves zzso suggesting that zzso has undergone a number of zzso zzso or possibly a complete zzso zzso during its zzso zzso between the zzso soybean linkage groups J and L and zzso zzso II and IV also revealed evidence of zzso zzso in zzso Further support for this hypothesis was provided by the observation of very close linkage in zzso of zzso of soybean zzso and zzso (three zzso and purple acid zzso sequences and zzso of soybean zzso (five zzso zzso show that the zzso and zzso we report are unlikely to have arisen by chance during our analysis of the zzso zzso
