zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso that are markedly active against zzso The corresponding structural genes were amplified by the zzso chain zzso zzso sequences were determined by direct sequencing of the amplified zzso Analysis of the zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequences showed that zzso zzso and zzso are derived from zzso by three, four, and two zzso acid zzso zzso All these zzso are located at positions 102, zzso zzso zzso and 237 zzso zzso which are known to extend the zzso range of zzso These zzso are zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso These results indicate that the zzso sequence of zzso is identical to that of zzso The zzso sequence of zzso possesses the two zzso described in zzso by the zzso zzso In contrast, the combination of zzso encountered in zzso has not yet been zzso and this zzso was designated zzso
