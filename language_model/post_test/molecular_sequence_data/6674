zzso of zzso B zzso in transgenic zzso results in enhanced zzso in red zzso To define zzso of zzso functionally important for its regulatory activity, we performed chemical zzso of a zzso line and screened for zzso zzso in red zzso Four zzso zzso that retain parental levels of zzso zzso and zzso normal zzso zzso were identified among 101 zzso zzso All carry single zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso that reduce activity by zzso to zzso compared to the zzso zzso The data indicate that the zzso molecules are fully active in zzso perception but defective in the regulatory activity responsible for signal transfer to downstream zzso All four zzso fall within a zzso region in the zzso domain of zzso with two independent zzso occurring in a single zzso acid, zzso zzso evidence indicates that the identified region is a critical zzso in the regulatory function of both zzso and zzso
