zzso low zzso strength zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing methods were used to analyze the zzso within the coding region of bovine zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso was identified at the zzso position zzso of the zzso zzso but it was silent with respect to the zzso acid sequence of the zzso The zzso zzso pattern could be divided into three kinds of zzso named zzso CA, and zzso Also, the association of the novel zzso of zzso gene with heat tolerance traits was zzso we found that the individuals with zzso zzso showed significantly higher heat resistance than those of zzso CA zzso Further, the zzso levels of zzso gene in zzso of peripheral blood in dairy cows among various temperature groups and zzso were analyzed by using real-time zzso zzso showed that the expression of zzso zzso was highest in zzso cows with zzso zzso among the three zzso zzso and the zzso zzso level at temperature zzso was higher than that at optimal temperature zzso in dairy cows zzso zzso the plasma zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso declined when the temperature dropped zzso Our findings implied that the novel zzso here could be a potential genetic marker for zzso stress trait in dairy cow zzso
