The zzso gene is one of the key genes in regulating sexual development of zzso zzso During the study on the zzso zzso it was observed that the zzso expression level is slightly higher in a zzso zzso than in a wild type at 37 degrees C, suggesting that the wild type zzso gene is necessary for the negative regulation of the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso expression was higher than in a wild type grown at 42 degrees C but equal at 30 degrees zzso Furthermore, in a zzso deletion zzso having its own promoter and the zzso of the zzso ORF, expression of the zzso by the zzso promoter was highly zzso supporting the possibility that the zzso gene is important for the negative regulation of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso transcript and the zzso activity from the reporter strains in the zzso background, which were constructed by transformation of the zzso reporter plasmids containing the zzso gene under the control of the intact or the truncated zzso promoters from the zzso to zzso zzso region, showed that the truncated promoters produced more zzso transcript and higher zzso activity than the intact one at 30 degrees C, but equal at 42 degrees zzso In addition, the zzso analysis of the zzso promoter identified a crucial region in the promoter from zzso to zzso zzso for this zzso of the zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicated that the zzso gene is necessary for the negative regulation of the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso expression was zzso in the zzso condition, where the zzso protein is hardly transported into the zzso
