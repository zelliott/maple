zzso with affinity for the surface of zzso zzso zzso were selected from a zzso zzso display library consisting of approximately zzso different zzso Seven selections were performed and five individual zzso clones zzso Compared to the primary library, the five zzso zzso clones all zzso more strongly with zzso and DNA sequencing of the zzso clones revealed five different zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two of the peptides exhibited zzso identity zzso a difference of just one zzso zzso The chemically zzso peptides competitively reduced the binding of the corresponding zzso zzso clone to zzso zzso of some of the selected zzso zzso clones to zzso was also reduced by several of the other zzso zzso zzso suggesting that these peptides have common recognition areas on the zzso Three of the zzso peptides were poor zzso of zzso and they did not inhibit zzso zzso Our results suggest that it is possible to select peptides from zzso zzso display libraries with affinity for different surface structures on the zzso not involved in the biologically active zzso
