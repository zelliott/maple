Over 40 years of zzso experiments using the mouse zzso test have produced a large number of induced zzso zzso at seven zzso among them the short ear zzso We have previously shown that the short ear locus encodes bone zzso protein 5 zzso a member of a large family of zzso signaling molecules that play key roles in axis formation, tissue zzso zzso zzso and skeletal zzso Here we examine 24 zzso and zzso zzso at the short ear zzso zzso changes in the zzso open reading frame confirm the importance of zzso zzso in the function of zzso beta zzso zzso The spectrum of zzso zzso also provides new information about the zzso sequence context, and strand specificity of zzso zzso in zzso
