The zzso resistance gene zzso was cloned from a zzso R zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the sequence of the gene was zzso zzso and deletion analysis localized the resistance zzso zzso to within a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso as a probe zzso with the type I zzso zzso zzso gene and did not zzso to zzso types II, III, and zzso The zzso zzso to zzso R plasmids zzso with resistance to zzso which were detected from zzso zzso isolated in different zzso zzso sequences of the coding and zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso identified an open reading frame coding type I zzso of a molecular mass of about 25,000 zzso zzso analysis of the sequences outside the cat open reading frame showed also that zzso has zzso in part, with the gene that coding for the zzso zzso and those that flank the cat gene derived from the zzso zzso zzso
