A zzso in zzso sensing of the pancreatic zzso has been observed in several animal models of type II diabetes and has been correlated with a reduced gene expression of the zzso zzso type 2 zzso In a transgenic mouse model, expression of zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso has recently been shown to be associated with an impaired zzso insulin zzso and the development of zzso To identify factors that may be involved in the specific decrease of zzso in the zzso of the diabetic animal, an attempt was made to zzso the zzso and zzso factors involved in the control of zzso expression in the zzso zzso It was demonstrated by transient zzso studies that only 338 base pairs zzso of the zzso zzso zzso promoter are needed for reporter gene expression in pancreatic zzso cell lines, whereas no activity was detected in zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified by zzso I zzso and gel zzso experiments within these 338 zzso zzso and zzso bind distinct but zzso expressed zzso zzso On the other hand, nuclear proteins specifically expressed in pancreatic cell lines interact with zzso and their relative abundance zzso with zzso zzso zzso These zzso factors zzso to nuclear proteins of 180 and 90 zzso as defined by zzso zzso The zzso factor is present in pancreatic zzso lines but not in an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso decreases zzso activity directed by the zzso promoter, whereas zzso of zzso increases gene zzso Thus negative and positive regulatory sequences are identified within the zzso 338 zzso of the zzso promoter and may participate in the zzso expression of the gene by binding zzso specific zzso zzso
