The T cell zzso zzso is a zzso zzso complex present on the surface of all mature and many developing T zzso It consists of zzso zzso zzso linked to five zzso chains that are zzso by four genes and referred to as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso chains have been zzso zzso In this report the molecular cloning of a complementary DNA zzso the zzso chain of the zzso T cell zzso zzso is zzso The predicted protein sequence of the zzso chain suggests a structure distinct from those of any of the previously described zzso zzso
