The introduction of random silent zzso into the zzso region of a human zzso as the basis for successful expression in zzso coli is demonstrated in four zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso promoters of zzso zzso was found not to serve as an expression zzso for a unchanged human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When this zzso was expressed in a zzso context using zzso zzso zzso protein was detected in low yield zzso of the total cell zzso zzso Silent zzso were introduced into the triplets coding for the zzso zzso zzso When screening zzso coli colonies transformed with expression plasmids containing zzso zzso we identified adapted clones that produced zzso in up to zzso higher yield than the clone containing the unchanged zzso zzso analyses of adapted zzso species revealed lower G + C contents in the modified regions, suggesting altered zzso zzso zzso When the adapted zzso sequences were zzso in the zzso which had failed to express unchanged zzso zzso in step 1, synthesis of zzso protein was as high as in step zzso This means that the yield of expression for adapted zzso was at least zzso higher than for unchanged zzso In conclusion, random silent zzso introduced into the translation initiation region of zzso might be a useful technique for designing sequence features which zzso gene zzso
