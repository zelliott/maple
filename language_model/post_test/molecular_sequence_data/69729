The three-dimensional structure of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 zzso from zzso zzso has been determined and refined to an R value of zzso for data between 8- and zzso zzso Overall, the structure of zzso is similar to that of another zzso zzso zzso B zzso The key differences between these molecules are in the zzso zzso and in the degree to which a long central zzso is covered by surface zzso The region around the zzso end of this central zzso is proposed to govern the zzso properties of zzso An adjacent region along this zzso is proposed to be critical in the ability of zzso to induce toxic shock zzso
