A zzso zzso corresponding to a mouse zzso basic protein zzso zzso with a longer zzso region than predicted from earlier studies of zzso gene structure has been isolated and zzso The additional zzso region is zzso by two previously unidentified zzso upstream of the major zzso start site of the zzso Using a DNA probe specific for zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that expression of this transcript follows a zzso course in mouse brain similar to that of the majority of zzso zzso but that the level of expression varies between brain and spinal zzso zzso of zzso zzso similar to the mouse zzso also was identified in rat zzso The results suggest that the structure of the zzso gene is more complex than originally thought, containing at least two more zzso There appears to be at least one more zzso gene promoter that directs the synthesis of a subset of zzso zzso with a unique zzso zzso
