Plant zzso typically contain several sequences zzso to protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was first identified as an abundant zzso in the zzso zzso where it zzso the formation, reduction, and zzso of zzso bonds during protein zzso zzso proteins have also been implicated in a variety of other functions, such as the regulation of cell zzso and may act as zzso of the zzso response in zzso A zzso protein zzso was recently shown to be imported into zzso in the zzso green zzso zzso zzso and a higher plant, zzso zzso where it associates with zzso zzso This suggests that the different zzso proteins in plant and animals may have diverse biological zzso To begin to zzso the roles of zzso zzso we have zzso zzso and generated zzso zzso for three zzso genes that have high, zzso and low levels of zzso respectively, in the moss zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the three zzso proteins cluster with zzso and four proteins from zzso zzso They are typified by an zzso domain rich in zzso charged zzso The zzso zzso which are the first zzso available for zzso proteins in a zzso zzso were found to be viable, indicating that the function of each single gene is zzso and suggesting that they may be functionally zzso
