zzso peptides that can form zzso alpha zzso were tested for their ability to lyse various human tumor cell lines in zzso These peptides include zzso whose sequence is a zzso of the zzso zzso of human zzso factor IV, and zzso an idealized zzso alpha zzso Both peptides exhibited potent zzso activity against all cell lines tested, unlike zzso 2, a naturally occurring zzso zzso of similar structure, which was relatively inactive under the same zzso Also, the zzso activity of zzso is specific for tumor cells versus human red blood zzso The effects of serum can be important when evaluating the potency of zzso zzso since other zzso peptides have been shown to be completely zzso by low serum zzso zzso with zzso and 399 revealed that their activity was indeed reduced in the presence of human serum, but that significant zzso activity remained even at relatively high serum zzso Various serum components were tested for their zzso zzso Whereas zzso and zzso zzso had only slight zzso properties, zzso zzso was found to be a potent inhibitor of zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso which is more sensitive to serum zzso than zzso also binds more extensively to all serum components zzso
