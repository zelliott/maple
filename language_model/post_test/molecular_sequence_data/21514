zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso forms the key foundation of reef zzso zzso and collapse of zzso lead to zzso zzso zzso which is responsible for the severe worldwide decline of coral zzso zzso signals are central to the stability of this partnership and are therefore closely related to coral zzso To decipher zzso zzso we developed zzso resources zzso library and zzso from the symbiotic sea zzso zzso zzso Here we describe differential expression between symbiotic (also called zzso zzso or zzso (also called zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso We zzso for the first time, transcript abundance separately in the zzso cell layer and the zzso cells that host zzso zzso zzso profiles showed large zzso zzso indicating that zzso could be induced by different zzso We defined a restricted subset of 39 common genes that are characteristic of the symbiotic or zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso of many genes belonging to this set is specifically enhanced in the symbiotic cells zzso A model is proposed where the zzso and therefore zzso state triggers zzso trafficking, whereas the symbiotic and therefore zzso state favors zzso exchanges between host and zzso Several genetic pathways were investigated in more detail: zzso a key vitamin zzso process involved in the zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in the carbon transfer from the environment to the zzso zzso zzso host collagen zzso mostly supported by the symbiotic zzso Further, we identified specific gene zzso and showed that the zzso zzso was also zzso both in the symbiotic state and in the zzso Our results thus offer new insight into the zzso signaling required for the zzso mechanisms of the zzso that is crucial for coral zzso
