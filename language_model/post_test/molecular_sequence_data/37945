It has been proposed that proteins which are involved in host zzso and zzso undergo accelerated zzso zzso receptors have roles as zzso agents acting in response to infection, and in addition are receptors for entry of viruses and other pathogens into zzso zzso with this, their rate of evolution is higher than that for other members of the zzso domain zzso zzso The pattern of evolution of the zzso receptors was examined in zzso Both zzso clusters of zzso receptors zzso and zzso showed evidence of a number of gene zzso These are likely to have resulted in protein sequence changes, which could possibly alter zzso zzso of a control group of clustered genes also showed evidence of zzso Thus, the fixation of a gene conversion is not in itself sufficiently unusual in zzso repeated genes and cannot be taken as strong evidence of a selection for a novel zzso However, the degree of zzso acid difference between the zzso receptors zzso and zzso was greater than that for any of the control zzso Such changes could have functional implications for zzso differences in zzso zzso interactions with zzso
