The zzso zzso have been shown to interact with the zzso via zzso binding between zzso zzso zzso of zzso beta chains and various zzso binding proteins within the focal zzso zzso zzso or indirect zzso alpha chain CD binding to the zzso zzso has not been zzso We show here that zzso as an abundant constituent of focal zzso complex proteins isolated from zzso binds strongly and specifically to alpha 2 CD, but not to alpha 1 CD zzso Similar specific binding to alpha 2 CD zzso was seen for highly zzso F zzso free of putative zzso zzso The bound complex of zzso and zzso was zzso directly by zzso and zzso binding was zzso by removal of a five zzso acid sequence from the alpha 2 CD zzso Our findings may explain the earlier observation that, while zzso alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 1 beta 1 both bind to zzso only alpha 2 beta 1 can mediate contraction of zzso collagen zzso
