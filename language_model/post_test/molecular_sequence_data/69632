The zzso proteins of the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso contain zzso repeated segments and form resilient cellular zzso by zzso zzso zzso The structure of one of the repetitive segments of zzso was determined at a zzso zzso zzso A segment consists of a zzso zzso A model of the interface between two tandem segments suggests that zzso interactions between segments may zzso zzso zzso The zzso side chain interactions explain how zzso that are known to produce zzso zzso disrupt zzso associations that sustain the integrity of the zzso zzso
