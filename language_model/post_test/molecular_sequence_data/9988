The zzso membrane zzso zzso complex is the zzso for von zzso factor and is composed of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A qualitative or quantitative zzso in the zzso complex on the zzso membrane is the cause of the zzso zzso disorder zzso syndrome zzso We describe the molecular basis of a novel zzso zzso in a patient in which zzso alpha was absent from the zzso surface but present in a soluble form in the zzso DNA sequence analysis showed a zzso zzso deletion in the zzso for zzso 508 zzso in zzso zzso This zzso zzso alpha zzso causes a frame shift that alters the zzso acid sequence of zzso alpha within its zzso zzso The zzso nature of the predicted zzso region and the zzso tail at the zzso terminal are altered before reaching a new premature stop zzso 38 zzso acids short of the zzso zzso Although zzso alpha zzso was not zzso on the zzso surface, zzso of plasma with specific zzso zzso zzso identified circulating zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso alpha zzso in zzso cells also generated a soluble form of the zzso Moreover, when a zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso was zzso zzso into Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso zzso complex, it failed to be expressed on the cell zzso Thus, a zzso deletion in the zzso for zzso 508 causes a zzso that alters the zzso acid sequence of zzso alpha starting within its zzso region, changes the zzso of the normal zzso region, and zzso the zzso domain affecting binding to the zzso and zzso zzso This zzso affects zzso of the zzso alpha zzso in zzso and causes the observed zzso zzso with circulating soluble zzso zzso
