The gene zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso larvae was studied using zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso larvae was zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA and packaged in zzso The zzso were zzso on zzso coli and a zzso zzso expression library was zzso A zzso clone zzso a 46 zzso zzso zzso was selected by zzso of the library and identified by the zzso selection zzso A clone containing nearly full-length zzso for a 46 zzso protein was zzso The gene zzso this 46 zzso zzso zzso was characterized by DNA and zzso zzso analysis using the zzso as a zzso The gene was transcribed to zzso with approximately zzso zzso and translated to 46 zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso as a 46 zzso native zzso The zzso zzso fusion protein zzso by bacteria had no zzso with other zzso zzso
