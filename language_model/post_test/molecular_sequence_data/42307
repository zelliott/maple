While the bacterial expression system has proved to work well for the expression of functional forms both of zzso and of zzso zzso we understand the requirements for expression in bacteria far less clearly than those for expression in zzso zzso Nevertheless, the ability to generate large quantities of zzso zzso 1) in an inexpensive culture system, the ease of zzso zzso in bacteria and the ability to purify easily relatively large quantities of zzso including human zzso that are not normally available, make this a particularly useful expression system for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the background of zzso level in zzso coli is extremely zzso It appears that the minor sequence zzso that have been made at the zzso to achieve high expression do not alter the zzso properties of the zzso zzso and it will not be surprising if zzso systems are developed where such changes are not zzso One concern with bacterial expression of zzso is whether this system will prove of general zzso zzso data suggests that certain zzso forms of human zzso that are known to be functional in zzso cells are not functional in bacteria, suggesting further that the folding pathways are not the same in bacterial and in zzso zzso This zzso of the bacterial system is unsettling and, only as more laboratories adopt this system because of its value for high-level zzso zzso will we learn more details of the requirements and limitations of this zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
