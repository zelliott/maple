The zzso zzso in zzso zzso is the zzso region contained within the gypsy zzso In the zzso zzso zzso protein partially zzso yellow zzso by blocking the function of zzso enhancers located zzso from the yellow promoter with respect to zzso Previously we have shown that yellow enhancers can overcome zzso by a downstream zzso in the zzso zzso when a second gypsy element is located upstream of the zzso To understand how two zzso neutralize each other, we isolated various deletions that terminate in the regulatory region of the zzso zzso To generate these zzso we used DNA zzso by gene conversion of the truncated zzso at the end of the yellow regulatory zzso We found that gypsy zzso can function at the end of the truncated zzso zzso of the gypsy zzso upstream of the yellow enhancers overcomes the zzso activity of the gypsy zzso inserted between the yellow enhancers and zzso These results suggest that the gypsy zzso do not form separate zzso zzso that zzso the interactions between enhancers and zzso
