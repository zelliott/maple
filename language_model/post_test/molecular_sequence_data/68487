We have expressed the rat brain zzso zzso protein zzso type IV in insect zzso The zzso zzso is produced as a single zzso that zzso on zzso gel zzso at 61 zzso zzso zzso zzso IV zzso slow zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso IV occurs on zzso zzso but is not accompanied by the generation of a zzso activity, as previously reported for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso IV and the zzso zzso showed differences in their zzso zzso The deduced primary sequence of zzso zzso IV contained a domain, zzso also found in the regulatory domain of zzso zzso II alpha zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso IV at zzso (at a position analogous to zzso in zzso zzso II zzso generated a fully active, zzso zzso This truncated zzso no longer bound zzso These data confirm that zzso zzso IV demonstrates zzso regulation by an zzso domain and provides insight into a potentially common mechanism for the regulation of the zzso zzso protein zzso A number of synthetic peptides were examined for their zzso by both zzso zzso II and zzso These studies showed that several peptides derived from zzso were preferential zzso for zzso zzso II whereas a zzso derived from zzso zzso protein was selectively zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of several zzso zzso suggests that while both zzso zzso II and IV recognize the sequence motif represented by zzso other structural features are also involved in defining the unique zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso
