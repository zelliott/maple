The biological effects and expected fate of the vast amount of oil in the Gulf of Mexico from the zzso Horizon blowout are unknown zzso to the depth and magnitude of this zzso Here, we report that the dispersed hydrocarbon plume zzso zzso indigenous zzso that are closely related to known petroleum zzso zzso genes coincided with the concentration of various oil zzso Changes in hydrocarbon composition with distance from the source and incubation experiments with environmental zzso demonstrated zzso hydrocarbon zzso rates at zzso Based on these results, the potential exists for intrinsic zzso of the oil plume in the deep-water column without substantial oxygen zzso
