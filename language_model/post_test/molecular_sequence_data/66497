zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso elicits zzso on zzso and a hypersensitive response on zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on both beet and zzso The zzso of both zzso is dependent on the presence of a zzso zzso type III zzso system zzso components and zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso determine the host specificity of both zzso on zzso Here we describe a novel zzso zzso zzso which determines the host specificity of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso requires two direct zzso acid repeats for zzso on zzso whereas one repeat in zzso is sufficient for zzso on zzso zzso repeats between zzso and zzso resulted in a switch of host zzso zzso expression of zzso or zzso zzso in zzso beet or melon leaves showed that zzso and zzso were localized to the zzso of host and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso revealed that a single repeat of zzso or zzso was sufficient to activate zzso By employing random zzso selection and zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to be a zzso zzso protein with an zzso consensus binding zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso and bear the potential to affect the host zzso zzso
