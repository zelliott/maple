A new class of zzso type sequential zzso carriers zzso for zzso zzso zzso has been modeled from the repetitive zzso zzso and zzso zzso units aiming to the development of scaffolds with predetermined zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso carriers adopt zzso structures, while the zzso retain their original active zzso and they interact neither to the carriers nor to each zzso It is concluded that the zzso structure of zzso helps the zzso and/or mimicking of the native forms of the zzso so that potent zzso are generated for developing specific, sensitive and zzso zzso
