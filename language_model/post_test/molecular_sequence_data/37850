A decreased level of zzso on certain spore coat proteins of zzso zzso alters the zzso of the spore zzso Here the zzso modifications of a major spore coat zzso zzso are studied in a wild type strain zzso and a zzso zzso zzso A novel zzso structure on zzso of the wild type strain, consisting of zzso was identified by zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso It was shown using zzso and gas zzso mass zzso analysis that zzso in the zzso zzso contained approximately zzso of wild type levels of zzso as a result of a missing terminal zzso on the novel zzso zzso The results support previous predictions, based on zzso studies on different zzso zzso about the nature of zzso zzso zzso identified by zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are known to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gonzalez, zzso zzso zzso zzso West, zzso zzso and Williams, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies on wild type zzso indicated that there were approximately 60 sites with zzso zzso zzso units and a further approximately 20 sites with zzso directly linked to the zzso Over zzso of the zzso sites are zzso with less than zzso of these sites as zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not found to be zzso
