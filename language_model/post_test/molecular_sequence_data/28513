By screening public databases, we identified human and mouse zzso DNA clones that zzso the zzso zzso of 39 zzso zzso The zzso precursor is zzso by at least three zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the leader zzso and zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso human zzso is identical to the previously isolated bovine zzso whereas mouse zzso differs by four zzso zzso zzso analyses suggested that zzso zzso and zzso may have evolved from a common zzso zzso human and mouse zzso showed indistinguishable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the human zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso was an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso In the zzso an approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified by Northern zzso analysis in zzso and, less zzso in liver and zzso whereas other zzso revealed additional smaller zzso In zzso zzso revealed zzso expression in zzso zzso and several brain regions, including nucleus zzso nucleus zzso zzso and nucleus zzso zzso Because zzso zzso expression was previously shown to be highest in brain, zzso and zzso our findings are consistent with the notion that zzso is a zzso which may also have a role in zzso
