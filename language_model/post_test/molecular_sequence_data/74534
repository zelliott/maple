The zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso serves as a model zzso to investigate the metabolism of storage zzso zzso in zzso The key zzso zzso the last step of zzso zzso in bacteria is a zzso zzso zzso exhibiting zzso zzso activity to both zzso zzso zzso and fatty alcohols zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An 800 zzso zzso product was obtained from zzso DNA of strain zzso by using zzso zzso designed from zzso stretches of zzso proteins of zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was used as a probe on a strain zzso gene library, resulting in the identification of a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso containing the complete zzso zzso An zzso disruption zzso of strain zzso exhibited a zzso zzso and accumulated up to 50 % less fatty acids than the zzso with significantly reduced zzso acid content when cultivated in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso Whereas zzso activity was drastically reduced in comparison to the zzso zzso activity remained almost unchanged in the zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells of strain zzso showed that there is expression of zzso under conditions of zzso zzso To identify additional zzso in strain zzso zzso employing zzso zzso deduced from zzso zzso zzso sequence data was zzso This yielded nine additional zzso genes exhibiting zzso % sequence identity to the corresponding strain zzso zzso Besides zzso only zzso exhibited high zzso and/or zzso activity when zzso expressed in zzso zzso
