zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso relies on the presence of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso A zzso DNA zzso of zzso including the zzso gene and about 10 zzso of downstream DNA was cloned in zzso zzso resulting in the production of an zzso zzso precursor zzso This zzso reacted with zzso against either zzso A or the synthetic leader zzso suggesting that it consisted of a fully modified zzso with the zzso leader sequence still attached to zzso This structure was confirmed by zzso sequencing and zzso magnetic resonance analysis of the zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso gene is essential for the production of this zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene product indicated that the protein belongs to the family of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso the putative product of the gene upstream of zzso showed an zzso signal zzso a zzso domain with a high degree of similarity to those of zzso zzso zzso and a putative zzso membrane zzso Cell extracts of zzso coli zzso zzso were able to cleave the zzso precursor zzso producing active, mature zzso A similar zzso was obtained with whole cells but not with zzso extracts of zzso zzso strains carrying zzso in which the zzso gene had been zzso The results indicate that the penultimate step in zzso zzso is zzso of precursor zzso without zzso of the leader zzso whereas the last step is the zzso of the leader zzso sequence from the fully zzso zzso zzso
