Several zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the most zzso region of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso and zzso properties of the peptides were investigated with a view to gain a insight into the structural and charge requirements for these activities of zzso zzso in which E was replaced by K exhibited considerably improved zzso activity with no zzso increase in zzso zzso A zzso in which the aromatic zzso acids were replaced by zzso exhibited zzso activity like those of the peptides which had aromatic zzso zzso zzso in the positions of E and K and total replacement of K by E resulted in complete loss of zzso The peptides having zzso activity like those of the peptides which had aromatic zzso zzso zzso in the positions of E and K and total replacement of K by E resulted in complete loss zzso The peptides having zzso activities showed appreciable zzso content in a zzso environment, whereas inactive peptides did zzso Thus, by suitable zzso the biological activity of a short zzso zzso can be altered by yield peptides specifically having only zzso activity with increased zzso
