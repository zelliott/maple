zzso is a major zzso attribute of therapeutic proteins and detailed analyses including the structures and sites of such modifications are often required for product quality control and zzso Using liquid zzso and tandem mass zzso techniques, we analyzed the zzso zzso of zzso human zzso zzso factor zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso with regard to its nature, structure, occupancy, and zzso zzso zzso using zzso and chemical zzso were performed to determine the specific zzso zzso site used by zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso the equivalent zzso zzso site found on zzso human zzso is the only site modified with a single zzso allowing zzso zzso zzso to be used as a viable production platform for therapeutic zzso
