zzso zzso possess many potential zzso factors, including the capacity for tissue invasion and persistence despite a vigorous host immune zzso In an attempt to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from individuals with advanced zzso disease were used as a zzso to isolate zzso zzso zzso clones expressing zzso of the oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of a clone expressing three zzso products has revealed seven zzso zzso genes which appear to zzso zzso of zzso zzso body constituents, zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso switch zzso zzso and the putative zzso export zzso zzso and zzso initially characterized in zzso zzso Also identified was a gene resembling zzso zzso extension analysis identified a zzso start site zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso spaced with respect to this start site was a zzso binding zzso The absence of additional identifiable zzso factor binding motifs within the zzso sequence and the proximity of adjacent genes suggested zzso arrangement, and reverse zzso zzso provided evidence of zzso Supporting the identification of these genes as zzso zzso zzso expression in enteric bacteria of the putative switch zzso body genes from zzso zzso zzso with zzso Specifically, the presence of a zzso expressing zzso zzso reduced swarming zzso in zzso zzso while in zzso coli, this zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a reduction in zzso zzso Thus, while zzso zzso are subject to unique synthetic and functional constraints, the organization of zzso genes and the presence of zzso elements are reminiscent of the zzso systems of other bacteria, and there appears to be sufficient conservation of constituent proteins to allow interaction between zzso zzso zzso body proteins and the zzso machinery of zzso zzso
