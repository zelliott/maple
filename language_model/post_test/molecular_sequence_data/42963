zzso zzso zzso recognizes a nuclear protein of 104 zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso at different stages of growth shows an zzso of zzso protein throughout zzso During development zzso protein is located inside embryonic cell zzso from the onset of zzso zzso It gradually decreases from zzso and disappears at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso clone was isolated from an zzso expression library of the zzso zzso zzso and then zzso the open reading frame is capable of zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso experiments have shown that the zzso clone recognizes a single transcript of about 3 zzso in the zzso In zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso zzso zzso starts from zzso zzso and is followed by the appearance and gradual zzso of zzso protein in zzso zzso of medium and large size zzso Keeping in mind the sequence similarity shown by the zzso protein to the mouse zzso protein as well as to the budding zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein can be speculated to play a role in the events of DNA replication during early zzso zzso As zzso zzso is located in the sphere zzso both inserted on the zzso zzso and free in the zzso zzso an additional possible role of zzso protein could be related to assembling and/or storing zzso during zzso
