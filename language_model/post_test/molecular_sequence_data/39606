zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso requires both the organizer protein zzso and the zzso protein zzso Here we describe an alternative zzso form of zzso zzso which is expressed in the zzso and fetal zzso The zzso protein contains an additional five zzso acids in the zzso zzso domain, a zzso zzso the domain plays an essential role in supporting zzso production by zzso zzso zzso family zzso including zzso zzso and zzso as shown in this zzso The zzso domain isolated from zzso shows a lower affinity for zzso than that from the classical zzso form zzso zzso with this, in resting cells, zzso is poorly localized to the zzso and thus less effective in zzso zzso than zzso which is zzso present at the zzso On the other hand, cell stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso membrane zzso of zzso as a result, zzso is equivalent to zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso The effect of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain appears to depend on the type of zzso in zzso of zzso zzso is less active than zzso even in the presence of zzso whereas zzso and zzso support the zzso activity of zzso to the same extent in a manner independent of cell zzso
