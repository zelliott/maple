This study examines evidence for a particular zzso zzso interaction in zzso a high-altitude zzso zzso important in zzso regulation but poorly known in terms of its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso often forms dense thickets in Central American zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso it has been suggested that zzso zzso forms zzso zzso with diverse zzso and zzso however, this assumption has not previously been zzso Based on field data, we hypothesized an zzso zzso association between zzso zzso and the recently described zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso in this study, we applied a rigorous approach using anatomical and molecular data to examine evidence for such an zzso We examined root samples collected beneath zzso zzso zzso for zzso structures, and we also compared zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso sequences between zzso root tips and leaf or zzso material of the suspected zzso Root cross sections showed a thin zzso sheath and zzso zzso coils typical of zzso zzso DNA sequence comparisons confirmed the identity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the zzso zzso In addition, this paper provides additional evidence for the widespread presence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso species (including a characterization of the insert in zzso zzso and reports the use of an zzso ITS primer pair useful for amplifying plant DNA from zzso roots without zzso zzso zzso
