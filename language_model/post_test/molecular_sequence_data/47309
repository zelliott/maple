In the frame of a broad study on the structural differences between the two zzso forms of zzso to be related to the electron transfer process, the zzso solution structure of horse heart zzso c in the reduced form has been zzso The structural data obtained in the present work are compared to those already available in the literature on the same protein and the presence of zzso differences is discussed in the light of the experimental method employed for the structure zzso zzso dependent changes are analyzed and in particular they are related to the role of zzso of the zzso Also some hydrogen bonds are changed upon reduction of the zzso zzso A substantial similarity is observed for the backbone fold, independently of the zzso zzso At zzso some meaningful differences are observed in the orientation of a few side zzso These changes are related to those found in the case of the highly zzso zzso c from zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso has been investigated and found to be smaller than in the case of the oxidized zzso We think that this is a characteristic of reduced zzso and that mobility is a medium for molecular recognition in zzso
