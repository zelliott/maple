The zzso virus zzso zzso protein is a zzso regulator of cellular and viral gene expression that binds and zzso target zzso and zzso from nucleus to zzso zzso enhances expression of several zzso genes required for zzso replication and is essential for zzso zzso zzso increases zzso of specific zzso but also zzso expression of several zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso gene expression is poorly zzso The experiments described here had several zzso to determine whether specific zzso of zzso were responsible for zzso or zzso zzso whether these functions could be zzso and whether one or more of these functions were essential for zzso zzso A zzso analysis of zzso was performed, focusing on zzso acids in zzso that are zzso zzso among zzso zzso in other zzso zzso of the zzso region of zzso revealed a region that is likely to be structurally important for zzso protein zzso In addition, several zzso acids were identified that are critical for zzso and zzso zzso A specific zzso of a highly zzso zzso zzso revealed that it was essential for gene zzso but not for zzso indicating that these two functions operate through independent zzso Furthermore, the ability of zzso zzso and the inability of the zzso to inhibit gene expression were shown to correlate with the ability to inhibit zzso of a human target gene and thereby prevent zzso of its processed zzso Surprisingly, some zzso which preserved both zzso and zzso functions in zzso nevertheless abolished zzso production, suggesting that other zzso functions or zzso interactions are also required for zzso zzso
