To investigate the evolutionary transition that has shaped the zzso systems of zzso the organization of zzso zzso and the nature of the catecholamines were examined in the central nervous system of adult zzso zzso zzso a zzso We isolated a gene transcript zzso zzso zzso zzso the limiting zzso of zzso zzso and studied its distribution together with that of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are found in the same zzso of which they are three separate zzso Two are located in the anterior brain, the first being zzso and lying in a row and the second being more zzso and zzso A third population zzso a few zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso The anterior zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso and the spinal zzso A zzso cell group is located in the same plane as the second zzso cell population but is more zzso marking the probable transition between anterior brain and zzso as deduced from gene expression zzso The overall distribution of zzso and zzso systems is similar in zzso and zzso central nervous system and could be an ancestral character of zzso As zzso by zzso liquid zzso and zzso zzso significant amounts of zzso and zzso but not of zzso are present in zzso zzso This finding is consistent with data obtained from most zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso system is probably an innovation of zzso that appeared along with the neural crest and specific zzso zzso
