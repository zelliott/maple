zzso liver is known to contain a regulatory protein zzso that zzso zzso competitively with respect to zzso By an zzso technique and by cell zzso in zzso we investigated the distribution of zzso in rat liver and its changes in response to high zzso zzso was detected almost exclusively in the zzso of the zzso cells of both fed and zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the liver with 20 zzso zzso for 10 zzso caused a marked decrease in nuclear zzso and an increase in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is present predominantly in the zzso of zzso and is zzso from the nucleus to the zzso in response to high zzso
