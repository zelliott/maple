Several human and animal Ebola outbreaks have occurred over the past 4 years in zzso and the Republic of zzso The human outbreaks consisted of multiple simultaneous zzso caused by different viral zzso and each epidemic resulted from the handling of a distinct gorilla, zzso or zzso zzso These animal populations declined markedly during human Ebola outbreaks, apparently as a result of Ebola zzso zzso carcasses were infected by a variety of Ebola zzso suggesting that Ebola outbreaks in great apes result from multiple virus introductions from the natural zzso Surveillance of animal mortality may help to predict and prevent human Ebola zzso
