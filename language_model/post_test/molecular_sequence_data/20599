The zzso zzso zzso contains four genes zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso which are shown to be located in the zzso share a remarkably high degree of identity zzso However, they display different expression patterns and show distinct kinetic properties, especially with regard to their regulation by zzso in both the forward zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso reductive zzso zzso In order to identify the zzso in the primary structure that could be responsible for the regulatory differences, four zzso between these zzso were constructed and zzso All zzso versions exhibited the same native structures as the parental zzso Analysis of the zzso constructed indicated that the region from zzso acid zzso zzso to the zzso end of zzso is critical for zzso zzso However, the region flanked by zzso acid zzso zzso and 500 of zzso is involved in the zzso zzso by high zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso region of zzso is necessary for the zzso by zzso of the reverse zzso Overall, the results show that zzso and zzso are able to distinguish and interact differently with similar zzso acids as a result of minimal structural zzso zzso although the active sites of zzso and zzso are highly zzso both zzso acquire different zzso sites, leading to the creation of proteins with unique regulatory mechanisms, probably best suited to the specific organ and zzso pattern of expression of each zzso
