zzso zzso factors that bind to DNA are often grouped into families on the basis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cloning studies have established that members of the same family have structurally related zzso and zzso zzso but diverge in other regions that are important for zzso zzso These features lead to the straightforward suggestion that although all members of a family bind to similar DNA zzso individual members exhibit distinct zzso zzso zzso This simple view is now supported by experimental evidence from those systems that have proved amenable to zzso There are however some largely unaddressed questions that concern the mechanisms that allow family members to go about their business without interference from their highly related zzso Here I will discuss some insights from studies of the zzso class of zzso zzso
