The zzso zzso 2A zzso zzso a member of the G zzso zzso zzso mediates many of the neuroendocrine and zzso actions of zzso and it represents the primary target for zzso zzso used in cancer therapy and tumor zzso zzso stimulation leads to the rapid zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso however, little is known about the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs on zzso and zzso zzso in the third zzso loop and zzso zzso zzso we generated zzso receptors in which zzso zzso zzso zzso or both zzso zzso in these regions were zzso to zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso treatment did not stimulate the zzso of the zzso zzso and it did not produce zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso zzso occurred 5 times more slowly than with the zzso zzso zzso only the zzso zzso did not inhibit either zzso or zzso In contrast, mutating only the zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso to the same extent as in the full zzso but it did not affect zzso zzso In both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding produced a stable zzso complex that was maintained during zzso trafficking, whereas zzso was not recruited to either the zzso or the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is necessary for both zzso and rapid zzso of the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso and zzso can occur zzso involve different zzso zzso sites, and exhibit different requirements for stable zzso zzso
