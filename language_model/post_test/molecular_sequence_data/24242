The zzso zzso zzso of zzso and rat serum zzso protein have similar zzso zzso protein zzso created by transfer of key sequences from zzso into zzso protein have previously been shown to bind the zzso zzso zzso through a zzso zzso common to many zzso zzso and an accessory site containing positively charged zzso acid zzso Further characterization of these zzso as well as analysis of novel zzso containing additional regions of zzso demonstrate that zzso interaction with zzso can be faithfully reproduced even though structural evidence indicates that the mechanisms of binding to zzso and the zzso are zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso can also be reproduced with zzso protein zzso that contain the two zzso involved in zzso zzso These results indicate that binding of structurally distinct zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by the zzso zzso in combination with a positively charged region that forms an zzso zzso zzso
