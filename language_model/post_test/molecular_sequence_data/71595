Experimental zzso offers a well characterized model of T helper type 1 cell zzso control of infection by an zzso zzso zzso zzso mice zzso develop zzso cells in response to infection and are unable to control zzso zzso The early zzso T cell response in these mice is zzso and reflects the expansion of zzso zzso T cells in response to a single zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso generated by these cells is believed to direct the subsequent zzso zzso We used T cells from T cell zzso mice expressing such a zzso zzso to characterize altered zzso zzso with similar affinity for zzso Such altered zzso failed to activate zzso production from transgenic zzso T cells or following injection into zzso zzso zzso of susceptible mice with altered zzso zzso substantially altered the course of subsequent zzso The ability to zzso a zzso zzso on otherwise susceptible mice using altered peptides that differed by a single zzso acid suggests limited diversity in the zzso T cell repertoire recognizing this zzso
