zzso is a zzso zinc finger protein which is induced by a variety of inflammatory stimuli and which has been characterized as an inhibitor of cell death by a yet unknown zzso In order to clarify its molecular mechanism of action, we used the zzso zzso system to screen for proteins that interact with zzso A zzso zzso was isolated which zzso a portion of a novel protein zzso which was recently found to be a human zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of 86 zzso Like zzso zzso of zzso could inhibit zzso induced by zzso necrosis factor zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso partially abolished the zzso effect of zzso Furthermore, zzso induced by zzso or zzso zzso was associated with zzso of zzso This degradation could be inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or by expression of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that zzso is a novel zzso for zzso family zzso zzso was indeed found to be specifically zzso in zzso by members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus zzso appears to be a novel zzso protein which might mediate the zzso activity of zzso and which can be processed by specific zzso
