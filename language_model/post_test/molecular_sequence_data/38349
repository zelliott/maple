zzso specificity was studied for zzso and their zzso We zzso and cloned the zzso of two different zzso zzso from the common bean zzso zzso and have recently cloned the zzso of an zzso of the Mexican bean zzso zzso zzso which is inhibited by zzso inhibitor 2 but not by zzso inhibitor zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso with pancreatic zzso zzso allowed us to model the structure of zzso The structure of zzso zzso zzso was modeled based on the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso complexes were zzso For these complexes we first identified the interface forming zzso In addition, we identified the hydrogen bonds, zzso interactions and loss of zzso surface area resulting from complex zzso The parameters we studied provide insight into the general scheme of zzso but fall short of explaining the specificity of the zzso We also introduce three new zzso packages zzso zzso and zzso efficiently determine the interface forming zzso and the zzso interaction data, the hydrogen bond net as well as aid in interpretation of multiple sequence zzso zzso
