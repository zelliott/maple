Using the zzso chain reaction zzso we have amplified and cloned zzso DNA zzso the zzso group I zzso proteins from the house dust zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso to the zzso zzso p I was used to purify the group I protein from zzso zzso We present the deduced zzso acid sequence of a new member of the group I house dust zzso zzso family zzso m zzso The three proteins show a high level of primary structure zzso zzso m I and zzso p I show zzso zzso acid identity, and the three zzso zzso acid sequences taken together show zzso zzso A potential zzso site and zzso of the zzso zzso active site are also zzso between the three zzso
