The amplification of useful genes from zzso offers great zzso zzso We employed this approach to isolate alcohol zzso zzso genes from zzso to aid in the synthesis of zzso pure alcohols from various zzso A zzso primer combination zzso by reference to the zzso sequences of known zzso genes was used to amplify full-length zzso genes directly from 17 samples of DNA extracted from zzso Three such zzso preparations were used to construct zzso coli zzso zzso Of the approximately zzso colonies zzso 240 putative zzso clones were identified by zzso Next, 23 functional zzso genes named using the zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso genes obtained via this zzso approach varied in their DNA and zzso acid zzso zzso of the gene products in zzso coli indicated varying zzso zzso Two representative zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso coli and zzso zzso respectively, were zzso and characterized in zzso The zzso products of these genes were confirmed to be useful for producing zzso zzso zzso
