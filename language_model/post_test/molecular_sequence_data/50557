The zzso receptors mediate zzso zzso in the brain and are important in memory zzso learning, and some neurodegenerative zzso This zzso family is classified in three groups: the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recent molecular studies have shown that many zzso zzso exist in all three groups of the receptors and exhibit zzso in function and expression zzso This article reviews the molecular and functional diversity of the zzso receptors and discusses their implications for zzso brain zzso
