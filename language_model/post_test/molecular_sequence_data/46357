The rapid spread of influenza virus zzso zzso poses a great threat to million lives zzso To search for new zzso compounds, we performed molecular zzso and molecular dynamics simulation to identify potential traditional Chinese medicine zzso constituents that could block influenza zzso channel zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso zzso all have extremely well zzso results as compared to control zzso Further de zzso drug design suggests that derivatives of zzso and zzso zzso could have enhanced binding affinity towards zzso zzso zzso molecular dynamics simulations of zzso complexes show stable hydrogen bond interactions between the derivatives and zzso zzso zzso and zzso To our best knowledge, this is the first study on the zzso activity of the above listed zzso zzso
