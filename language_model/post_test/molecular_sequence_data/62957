We describe a new family of discrete zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso assembled upon zzso zzso zzso fused to a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso equilibrium experiments clearly demonstrate that each zzso zzso zzso or zzso can zzso display four zzso zzso on their surface that can be zzso for the zzso display of protein zzso Furthermore, we show that matched zzso zzso zzso can zzso into fibers at neutral zzso providing a new scaffold for zzso
