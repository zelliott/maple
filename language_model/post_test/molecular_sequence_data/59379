Eight strains of zzso species were examined for their partial base sequences of zzso and zzso zzso The base sequences on the fingerprint segment showed three kinds of zzso zzso and zzso In the partial base sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso all the strains of zzso species examined had 1-0 base difference except for the strains of zzso zzso zzso differences, zzso In the partial base sequences on the positions zzso region zzso zzso of zzso zzso however, zzso zzso had zzso base zzso The other species had 7-2 base zzso In the partial base sequences on the positions zzso region zzso zzso of zzso zzso the calculated percent similarities were zzso zzso was made zzso and zzso especially on the separation of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso from the zzso zzso
