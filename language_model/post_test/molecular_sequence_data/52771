zzso protein zzso is a zzso protein zzso C zzso that binds zzso zzso with zzso zzso To obtain structural information on this zzso we have engineered 10 zzso zzso between positions 89 and 104 in the zzso domain, a zzso zzso segment that mediates binding of zzso to zzso We show that the zzso domain is in a polar environment in free zzso suggesting exposure to water, in agreement with a zzso structure of the zzso The zzso domain zzso in the binding of zzso to zzso as judged by the dramatic changes observed in the fluorescent properties of the zzso on complex zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso by zzso zzso engineered in zzso reveals that the zzso side of the zzso domain contacts the zzso domain of zzso whereas the zzso side of the zzso domain contacts the zzso domain of zzso Finally, a comparison of the fluorescent properties of the zzso and zzso forms of a construct in which a zzso zzso was introduced at position 4 close to the zzso N zzso of zzso suggests that the zzso zzso is also involved in the interaction of zzso with zzso
