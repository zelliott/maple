We report here on the cloning and characterization of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso Its sequence is distinct from previously characterized zzso zzso zzso and Southern zzso shows no other closely related genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the gene to zzso 2 zzso near zzso zzso and clearly separate from the zzso cluster at zzso The gene is zzso and appears to possess conventional zzso zzso Cap and 3' zzso zzso A single transcript, approximately zzso in size, appears to be expressed at high levels in all zzso stages zzso When this gene is zzso using various upstream zzso driver systems, no striking zzso are zzso however, we detect bristle zzso defects in some zzso The zzso gene does not appear to be essential, based upon our observation that zzso flies zzso for an zzso element zzso zzso to the zzso box produce little or no zzso zzso zzso these flies are viable and fertile at 25 and 29 degrees zzso Nevertheless, the zzso gene appears to be zzso zzso in other zzso species, suggesting that it may be functionally zzso
