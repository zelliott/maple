This article described zzso useful for the zzso zzso and zzso acid sequencing of zzso proteins contained in minute specimens obtained from patients with systemic forms of zzso We zzso that these procedures can also be applied to the zzso characterization of cerebral zzso zzso The selection of the techniques is dependent on the type of sample to be extracted zzso or zzso zzso as well as the amount of zzso material zzso Although zzso proteins are isolated and zzso more easily from fresh zzso it must be noted that zzso specimens are available more readily for analysis due to the common diagnostic use of fine needle tissue zzso and are therefore, important for both current and retrospective zzso zzso despite the expected difficulties associated with zzso treatment we were able to extract and sequence zzso proteins from fixed zzso presumably due to the resistance of zzso to zzso zzso Through the continued development of techniques for small-scale protein separation and application of highly sensitive zzso and mass spectral methods, exact identification of the protein contained in zzso zzso deposits can be zzso Such information has therapeutic and zzso relevance and can increase our understanding of the zzso of zzso
