zzso zzso zzso virus is a type of virus containing two zzso linear DNA molecules zzso zzso In the present work, the structural proteins of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

The zzso were zzso by cesium zzso density zzso zzso from the feces of zzso zzso larvae infected with zzso and analyzed by zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso 

There were seven zzso of the zzso named zzso to zzso which reacted with the zzso zzso In addition, two zzso zzso and zzso were recognized by the zzso against a viral protein zzso by zzso 

The results showed that the viral zzso were mainly composed of 7 proteins named zzso to zzso Western zzso with zzso serum indicated that structural proteins zzso zzso and zzso had molecular weights of around 50, 55 and 130 zzso zzso They were the major zzso of the zzso Among them, zzso and zzso were coded by zzso and zzso was zzso by zzso Taken together, three viral structural proteins zzso by zzso and zzso were identified in zzso for the first zzso
