A bacterial strain designated zzso was isolated from root zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of this strain showed similarities lower than zzso with respect to species of the zzso zzso The strain was a zzso zzso rod, zzso by means of zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was positive for zzso zzso and zzso production but negative for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso grew in the presence of zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso and zzso acid was present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the major fatty zzso Major polar lipids of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso three unknown zzso two unknown zzso and one unknown zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso presented zzso differences from all recognized species of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso data indicated that strain zzso belongs to a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
