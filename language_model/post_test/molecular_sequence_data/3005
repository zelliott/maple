The zzso are zzso proteins that function as cell zzso molecules during zzso and in zzso zzso Although zzso zzso contain only three zzso zzso thousands of zzso zzso may be expressed through the use of two alternative promoters and alternative zzso at up to five different positions in the zzso To begin understanding how the expression of the zzso genes is zzso we have determined the complete zzso sequence of all three human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso two of these, zzso ( approximately zzso zzso and zzso ( approximately zzso zzso are among the largest known human zzso In addition, we have identified several zzso zzso sequence elements that may participate in the regulation of alternative zzso The sequences of these genes provide insight into the mechanisms used to generate the diversity of zzso protein zzso and raise several interesting questions regarding the expression mechanism of large zzso
