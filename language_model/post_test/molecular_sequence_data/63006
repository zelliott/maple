The selective and potent zzso of zzso translation in zzso zzso by zzso suggests a novel zzso action for this zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso radical zzso and zzso zzso zzso collectively demonstrated that zzso zzso binds to two distinct classes of sites on zzso The binding was driven by favorable zzso changes indicative of a large zzso interaction, suggesting that the aromatic rings of zzso are inserted into the stacked base pairs of zzso zzso zzso binding zzso the zzso secondary structure and masks the zzso loop in the zzso zzso zzso we showed that zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso inhibited protein translation in zzso with an zzso equivalent to that binds to zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso but drastically higher than that zzso translation in zzso supporting the established notion that the zzso activity of zzso is largely due to its selective zzso by the pathogen rather than by the host zzso zzso interrupting zzso zzso by the zzso zzso binding is an important mechanism of zzso in zzso protein translation, providing new insights into the development of zzso zzso
