We designed a rapid method for determining zzso content of cholesterol zzso zzso and LDL zzso zzso using a zzso protection zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments for genes of human zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were prepared by in zzso zzso Total zzso prepared from zzso cells was zzso with the zzso probe and the zzso zzso was determined under protection from zzso zzso zzso content used in this zzso was excess in determining the desired zzso in total zzso and surplus zzso were completely zzso using zzso under standard zzso When cells were cultured in zzso supplemented with zzso fetal calf serum zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso were about zzso to zzso higher than those of zzso zzso and zzso On incubation with zzso supplemented with zzso zzso serum zzso for 8 zzso all zzso zzso levels increased zzso to zzso In addition, when the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was added to zzso zzso these levels increased even further and the change in zzso level seemed to differ between the zzso and zzso From these results, we conclude that zzso is a useful method for determining the very small amount of zzso level of cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso
