In zzso organisms, zzso synthesis and activity are tightly zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso are implicated as playing a major role in this zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and its activity is inhibited by zzso in response to availability of excess fixed nitrogen and high zzso zzso It was zzso that zzso binds to zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis combined with zzso zzso studies clearly is in agreement with the proposal that zzso interacts with zzso However, several attempts to identify zzso interactions by using methods such as zzso and chemical zzso experiments failed to detect direct interactions between these zzso Here we have taken a genetic approach, the use of a zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso system, to investigate zzso interaction with zzso A DNA zzso corresponding to the zzso domain of zzso was zzso amplified and was used to generate translation zzso with the DNA binding domain and the DNA zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Similarly, a DNA zzso corresponding to the zzso domain of zzso was zzso amplified and used to generate translation zzso with the zzso domain and the zzso domain of zzso in zzso zzso zzso After introducing appropriate zzso combinations in zzso cells, the zzso of direct interaction between zzso and zzso was analyzed with the zzso zzso zzso system by testing for the expression of zzso and zzso zzso These analyses showed that the zzso domain of zzso directly interacts with the zzso domain of zzso
