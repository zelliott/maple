The zzso domain of zzso zzso mediates the zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso and zzso during cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein during zzso and zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso to zzso A resolution is a beta sandwich with 13 zzso beta strands and 1 irregular zzso zzso zzso structural features of the zzso and zzso regions, and the zzso bond location, distinguish zzso from the zzso G domain and other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of the complex of zzso with zzso indicates that zzso zzso zzso and zzso in an extensive positively charged patch at the bottom of the domain specifically associate with the zzso groups of zzso The zzso structure and identified adjacent zzso region provide a structural framework for the analysis of the zzso domain of various zzso including zzso zzso many zzso zzso and zzso
