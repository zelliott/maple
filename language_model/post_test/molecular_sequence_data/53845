From a zzso zzso zzso strain zzso we have isolated a zzso zzso which retained the ability to zzso zzso acid into zzso acid but lost the ability to further degrade the latter zzso The zzso zzso was very stable, and therefore it was suitable to be used as a zzso for the zzso synthesis of zzso acid from zzso zzso By use of resting cells we determined the effect on the zzso rate of several zzso such as the addition of nutritional factors, the concentration of the zzso and the carbon source on which the biomass was zzso The optimal yield of zzso acid was obtained with cells zzso on zzso medium containing zzso acid zzso zzso as a sole carbon source and zzso extract zzso zzso as a source of nutritional zzso Under these conditions, 1 zzso zzso zzso of biomass produced zzso zzso of zzso acid per zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso the zzso site of zzso was cloned and zzso revealing two open reading frames of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The van genes are organized in a cluster and zzso the zzso of the zzso which zzso the first step of the zzso zzso zzso acid sequences deduced from zzso and zzso genes were shown to have high identity with known zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso regions known to exist in class zzso zzso were also found in the zzso components from zzso zzso zzso The terminal zzso zzso is characterized by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso which are located in its zzso and zzso halves, zzso Transfer of zzso zzso genes to zzso zzso this zzso which recovered its ability to grow on either zzso or zzso zzso
