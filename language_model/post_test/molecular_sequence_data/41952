zzso are believed to participate in the induction of cell growth, zzso and zzso but their role in zzso has remained zzso Two transgenic mouse lines zzso and zzso that zzso the human zzso zzso zzso gene coding for a zzso zzso in zzso zzso and, zzso contain high levels of tissue zzso have been used to study the zzso role of zzso in zzso In zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation at stages zzso of the cycle of the zzso zzso was significantly above the control zzso This may reflect a specific stimulation of DNA synthesis in type zzso zzso and type B zzso The zzso mice that have about zzso zzso zzso showed an zzso of DNA synthesis only at stage V of the cycle, suggesting a specific dependence of type B zzso on zzso In zzso mice, zzso incorporation of stage VIII zzso segments was zzso suggesting that excess amounts of zzso selectively inhibit zzso DNA zzso We propose that zzso has strictly selective local zzso and zzso actions during zzso DNA zzso and that its excess amounts ultimately may lead to decreased zzso
