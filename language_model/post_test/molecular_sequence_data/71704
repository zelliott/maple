Some linear truncated zzso of zzso display potent zzso activity at the zzso zzso especially when the side chain of zzso is zzso Then, the three-dimensional arrangements of six structurally reduced linear zzso three zzso and three zzso have been investigated by high resolution zzso zzso and molecular zzso in order to pinpoint the zzso features related to the biological zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso total correlation zzso zzso and nuclear zzso enhancement zzso zzso were recorded and analyzed for each zzso zzso distance constraints were derived from the intensity of the zzso zzso The formation of hydrogen bonding was monitored from the temperature dependence of the zzso chemical zzso zzso models calculated by means of distance zzso simulated zzso and energy zzso using the zzso constraints, strongly suggested a global zzso structure for the zzso zzso exhibiting biological activity, and a folded arrangement for the zzso zzso zzso comparisons allowed the identification of a zzso folding of the zzso segment zzso as a probable zzso for zzso
