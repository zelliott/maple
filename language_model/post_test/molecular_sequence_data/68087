Using a zzso strategy based on an initial set of 15 couples of zzso designed from the known zzso zzso we identified 18 zzso in the human zzso zzso and zzso the corresponding zzso and 3' zzso zzso This approach was successful in locating all the zzso contained in fragments short enough to be amplified by zzso Thus 19 zzso were identified which, together with the previously reported zzso subjected to alternative zzso brings the total number of zzso zzso to zzso This information is relevant for the screening of recently reported zzso zzso of zzso which cause Multiple zzso zzso 2A zzso and for the search of additional point zzso of the same gene which might cause two other neural crest disorders, zzso and zzso disease, mapping in the same region as zzso
