zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso has been used to study the complex between zzso A and zzso A binding zzso The zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso have been almost completely assigned and so has most of the zzso spectrum of the zzso A part of the zzso zzso The zzso part of the zzso has been zzso zzso with zzso and the nuclear magnetic resonance signals of the carbon atoms and their zzso have been assigned at the two ends of the hydrocarbon zzso A total of zzso distance restraints from nuclear zzso effects and 131 zzso angle restraints from zzso zzso zzso provided the basis for the structure zzso A comparison of 20 structures calculated from these data to the average structure showed that they could be aligned with an atomic zzso zzso of zzso zzso A for all C, zzso O, P and S atoms in protein and zzso The zzso is a zzso protein and this structure is maintained in the zzso The four zzso are zzso of zzso 3 to 15, zzso from zzso 20 to 36, zzso from 51 to 62, and zzso from 65 to zzso For the four zzso of the zzso backbone of the zzso the zzso zzso for the C, C alpha and N atoms was zzso zzso zzso The binding site for the zzso stretches between the zzso end of zzso where the zzso part zzso to the zzso of zzso where the zzso of the zzso part zzso The zzso is bound near zzso of each of the four zzso in an arrangement where it can form salt bridges and/or hydrogen bonds to either backbone or zzso atoms of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The polar parts of the zzso and the zzso are structured in the bound zzso to form an interface with the zzso Also the zzso forms a set of zzso zzso interactions where the zzso the zzso and the zzso are zzso so overall the structure of the bound zzso seems to be organized to protect the zzso zzso part from the polar zzso
