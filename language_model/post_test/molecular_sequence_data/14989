Antarctic hair grass zzso zzso zzso zzso the only grass indigenous to zzso has well-developed freezing zzso strongly induced by cold zzso Here, we show that in response to low temperatures, zzso zzso expresses potent zzso zzso zzso activity that, zzso the growth of small ice zzso into potentially damaging large ones, is zzso and localized to the zzso A gene family from zzso zzso zzso putative zzso of an ice zzso zzso protein zzso has been isolated and zzso zzso are zzso targeted proteins with two potential zzso zzso zzso zzso repeats zzso and zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso genes appear to be confined to the grass zzso zzso and their products, exhibit sequence similarity to zzso receptors and are predicted to adopt zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript levels are greatly enhanced in leaf tissue following cold zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing a zzso has novel zzso activity, and zzso zzso when added back to extracts of leaves from zzso zzso zzso can zzso the activity found in zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso activity may contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso and thus to its unique ability to have zzso zzso
