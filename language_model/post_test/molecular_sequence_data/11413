Recent investigation have indicated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are designed on the basis of a zzso zzso antibiotic, zzso S zzso inhibit the growth of zzso and zzso bacteria with high potency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we designed and zzso two zzso zzso and zzso in which four zzso zzso in zzso and zzso were replaced by zzso zzso respectively, and investigated their interactions with model zzso in terms of CD and zzso experiments, zzso activity and zzso activity for human zzso Both peptides newly designed showed no zzso activity and no zzso activity of zzso The present CD study showed that the presence of neutral zzso and of zzso zzso of natural or synthetic zzso results in no remarkable zzso difference between zzso The leakage experiment showed a clear relation between the zzso activity and the leakage ability in zzso synthetic zzso zzso but no correlation in zzso natural zzso The difference in zzso and zzso balance between zzso and zzso zzso from the increasing zzso due to an increase of four zzso units by the substitution of zzso for zzso may be one of the important factors in the drastic decrease in zzso
