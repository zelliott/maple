We have recently zzso zzso and characterized a rat kidney zzso zzso that stimulates zzso as well as zzso and neutral zzso acid zzso In order to evaluate the role of this protein in human inherited diseases such as zzso we have isolated a human zzso clone zzso by low stringency screening of a human kidney zzso library using the zzso zzso insert as a zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and encodes a zzso zzso acid protein that is zzso identical to the rat zzso zzso acid sequence and zzso to that of the rabbit zzso zzso zzso of in zzso transcribed zzso zzso into zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso as well as zzso and neutral zzso acids in a pattern similar to that of rat zzso and rabbit zzso Both neutral and zzso zzso acids inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso like zzso and zzso is expressed strongly in the kidney and zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA from a panel of zzso zzso cell hybrids showed that the human gene for zzso resides on zzso zzso
