zzso a potent zzso zzso was originally isolated from human zzso zzso zzso and gene expression are found not only in peripheral zzso but also in the central nervous zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso in the zzso including in the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in the zzso tract and the internal zone of the median zzso in zzso and zzso rats, whereas in control rats few zzso zzso were zzso We examined the effects of zzso administration of zzso on zzso cells in the zzso and zzso zzso of rats, using zzso for zzso protein and in zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso caused a marked induction of zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus and the zzso part of the zzso zzso In the zzso and zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso was predominantly in zzso cells rather than zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso was increased in a zzso manner 30 zzso after zzso administration of zzso This induction was reduced by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso administration of zzso also caused a marked increase in the plasma concentration of zzso zzso recordings from zzso zzso cells in the zzso nucleus revealed that putative zzso cells were activated by zzso administration of zzso These results suggest that central zzso zzso stimulates the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso cells and may have an important role in salt appetite and body fluid zzso in zzso
