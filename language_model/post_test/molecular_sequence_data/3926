zzso is a key regulator of the cell cycle in zzso and is a member of the zzso zzso associated with a variety of cellular zzso family of zzso In this family of zzso the sensor 1 and sensor 2 regions are important for their function and zzso zzso Here, zzso zzso has been used to examine the role of these regions of zzso zzso zzso in controlling the cell cycle progression and initiation of DNA zzso Two important zzso acid zzso zzso in sensor 1 and zzso in sensor 2) were identified as key zzso for zzso function in zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso or zzso grew slowly and accumulated in the S zzso In cells expressing zzso zzso loading of the zzso maintenance zzso complex of proteins was zzso suggesting that the slow progression of S phase in these cells was due to inefficient zzso loading on zzso zzso wild type zzso but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused the structural modification of origin recognition complex zzso These results are consistent with the idea that zzso uses its zzso activity to change the zzso of origin recognition complex, and then together they recruit the zzso zzso
