zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been shown to activate a zzso zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso cells that mediates zzso and zzso zzso by zzso C and D, zzso This is followed by an increased activity of the zzso protein zzso cascade and cell zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso zzso stimulate the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso Both zzso zzso a rapid zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso as measured by the zzso of zzso in a solid phase zzso zzso zzso When added at 100 zzso the rank order of potency of a series of zzso zzso for stimulation of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma S zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso UMP zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso activity by zzso and zzso was zzso attenuated by zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by 24 h treatment of the cells with zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, the specific protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso suggesting that protein zzso C is not involved in zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cells with zzso toxin or the zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly attenuated zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso completely blocked the zzso of zzso protein zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso these results suggest that zzso and zzso trigger the zzso of the zzso protein zzso module in zzso cells by a zzso independent of protein zzso C but requiring a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
