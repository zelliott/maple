The zzso zzso zzso zzso an important functional gene of zzso zzso pathway, was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The full-length zzso of zzso is 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a 1 176 zzso zzso zzso a 391 zzso acids zzso and its zzso region has an obvious zzso zzso The zzso zzso containing zzso completed zzso was transformed into zzso coli zzso zzso The target fusion zzso with molecular weight of 66 zzso was expressed under the condition of 16 degrees C and induced by zzso at final concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso acid sequence of zzso showed great zzso to other zzso with the zzso zzso domain in the zzso zzso quantitative zzso was used to detect the expression levels of zzso gene during different development zzso The determination of zzso contents in appropriate zzso showed that the relationship between zzso gene expression and the zzso of zzso displayed different trends during zzso growth and zzso growth zzso suggesting that the zzso gene may be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
