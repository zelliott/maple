zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was chemically modified with zzso zzso zzso followed by reduction with zzso The modified protein zzso the labeling of its own largest zzso when incubated with zzso in the presence of zzso On zzso of the labeled protein using zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso for a very brief period, the pattern and size of the radioactive fragments formed are best explained by attachment of the label between zzso and zzso of the largest zzso In this region there exists a highly zzso sequence which is also found in other zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the binding site for the initiating zzso of zzso zzso has been zzso during zzso
