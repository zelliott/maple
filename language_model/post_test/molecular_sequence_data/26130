We studied the efficiency of the zzso zzso transport system using zzso fusion proteins and different zzso which provide zzso in zzso The optimal zzso zzso signal consists of the last 60 zzso zzso zzso stretches of zzso do not improve the transport efficiency of zzso fusion zzso The introduction of deletions and/or replacements in the 60 zzso acid zzso signal domain revealed at least three functional regions with different degrees of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso from the zzso part of the 60 zzso acid zzso zzso termed region I, could be replaced by a zzso zzso The other two regions II and III zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso seem to interact directly with the zzso zzso since a zzso fusion protein which contains either of the two regions was still zzso in a zzso mode, albeit at low zzso An efficient zzso zzso system was only obtained from the zzso zzso zzso when the regulatory zzso element was provided in zzso zzso of the zzso fusion protein did not interfere with the zzso of zzso even when the fusion protein was induced to a high zzso This suggests that the capacity of the zzso zzso system is high and not normally saturated by its natural zzso zzso
