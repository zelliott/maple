The chicken zzso zzso A and B proteins differ by an additional 128 zzso acids located at the N zzso of the B zzso Using zzso zzso we demonstrate that these two proteins arise by alternate initiation of translation from two zzso zzso zzso located on a single zzso zzso Both proteins are zzso active in terms of their ability to activate a zzso target zzso These results suggest a functional significance for evolutionary conservation of two forms of this steroid zzso
