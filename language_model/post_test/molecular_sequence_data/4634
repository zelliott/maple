zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso which is a zzso for the synthesis of zzso This zzso sugar is then used in the synthesis of zzso which is essential for zzso zzso and thus the zzso of several zzso as well as for the synthesis of zzso zzso anchored zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso a gene required for zzso encodes zzso Given the importance of zzso in zzso zzso it is surprising that very little is known about the zzso in higher zzso Recently, an zzso zzso human disease, zzso zzso syndrome type I zzso has been correlated with severely reduced zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of a zzso zzso human zzso a protein of 29 zzso that is zzso identical and zzso similar to zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis shows a single zzso zzso transcript that is zzso zzso although levels vary markedly among zzso zzso of the human zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso growth at the restrictive temperature, strongly suggesting that this gene encodes a functional zzso Finally, when expressed in zzso cells, zzso is localized exclusively to the zzso corresponding to its zzso in zzso
