zzso interactions represent a new class of exciting but challenging drug targets, because their large, flat binding sites lack zzso pockets for small molecules to zzso We report here a methodology for chemical synthesis and screening of large zzso libraries of zzso peptides displayed on rigid zzso zzso With zzso zzso acid as the scaffold, the resulting zzso peptides are effective for binding to protein surfaces such as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso library against tumor necrosis zzso zzso identified a potent zzso that zzso the zzso zzso interaction and protects cells from zzso cell zzso zzso peptides of this type may provide a general solution for zzso of zzso zzso
