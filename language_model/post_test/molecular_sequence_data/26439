The length distribution of the zzso strands in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli has been analyzed after zzso of the zzso by complete zzso with human serum zzso The zzso strands released were separated according to length by zzso zzso on zzso zzso 300 zzso material at 50 degrees C, employing a convex zzso from 5 to zzso zzso The length of the zzso zzso zzso which carry a zzso zzso acid as a natural end group, was calculated from the ratio of total to zzso terminal zzso acid zzso This was possible after complete zzso of the isolated zzso strands by zzso followed by separation of the released zzso and reducing zzso and zzso by zzso zzso on zzso zzso The method established allows the separation of the zzso strands of zzso a zzso zzso up to a degree of zzso of approximately zzso The zzso lengths of the zzso strands were 5 to 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso
