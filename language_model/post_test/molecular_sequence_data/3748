The zzso zzso has significantly shaped the structure of the human zzso At least zzso of human zzso sequence can be attributed to zzso reverse zzso zzso There are zzso copies of the human zzso zzso zzso most of which are zzso although approximately zzso zzso zzso are full zzso zzso elements transpose through an zzso intermediate and zzso is thought to be the rate limiting step in zzso Because zzso of zzso in a variety of organisms has been shown to respond to environmental zzso we investigated the influence of various agents on zzso from two different zzso zzso The activity of the zzso promoters was analyzed by zzso zzso cell lines with plasmids containing the zzso promoters fused to the zzso reporter gene and monitoring expression with a zzso zzso Small increases in zzso activity were observed with both zzso promoters after treatment with serum, testosterone, zzso and zzso zzso indicating that these agents can influence zzso zzso
