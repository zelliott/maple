We investigated properties of the zzso zzso segment 11 zzso A zzso zzso zzso segment 11 zzso which contains the entire coding region was zzso and inserted into the zzso transfer zzso zzso zzso containing gene 11 zzso were selected, and the gene 11 product expressed in zzso zzso cells infected with these zzso was zzso into guinea pigs to produce zzso zzso zzso of the zzso showed that it recognized a primary translation product with a molecular weight of 26,000 zzso zzso in zzso insect cells, in zzso monkey kidney cells, and in zzso translation reactions programmed with zzso zzso A modified zzso product was also detected but only in zzso monkey kidney zzso The zzso zzso proteins were shown to be zzso in infected monkey kidney cells, and the zzso protein was zzso in insect zzso We were unable to identify what type of modification caused the molecular weight shift to 28,000 in infected monkey kidney zzso Large amounts of the gene 11 product were detected by zzso in discrete zzso in the zzso of infected monkey kidney zzso zzso of all known zzso were also detected by zzso by using zzso zzso to the zzso gene 11 zzso The zzso reacted with zzso zzso zzso but did not react with zzso virus particles by zzso or zzso it also did not neutralize virus zzso in plaque reduction zzso zzso zzso we conclude that the primary gene 11 product is a zzso zzso which we designated zzso
