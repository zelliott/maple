zzso have important functions in photosynthesis, nutrition, and protection against zzso zzso Some natural zzso are zzso molecules that are difficult to produce zzso Biological production of zzso using specific zzso is a potential alternative to extraction from natural zzso Here we report the isolation of lycopene zzso that selectively zzso only one end of lycopene or zzso The zzso genes zzso the zzso acting lycopene zzso were isolated from zzso bacteria that produced zzso zzso zzso of these zzso genes with the zzso genes from zzso zzso (responsible for lycopene zzso resulted in the production of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity of zzso could be inhibited by the lycopene zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that bacterial zzso lycopene zzso might represent an evolutionary link between the common bacterial zzso of lycopene zzso and plant lycopene zzso and zzso These lycopene zzso may be used for efficient production of high-value zzso zzso zzso
