The feasibility of using linkage zzso zzso to zzso zzso underlying natural variation in zzso zzso was investigated by looking for associations between flowering time and marker zzso in the zzso regions containing two candidate zzso zzso and zzso both of which are known to contribute to natural variation in zzso A sample of 196 zzso was used, and zzso was assessed by sequencing a total of 17 roughly zzso zzso Using a novel zzso zzso based on zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso could have been used to zzso the zzso gene to a roughly zzso region and to identify two common zzso zzso Interestingly, because of genetic zzso simple zzso associations would not have been able to map zzso with nearly the same zzso No clear evidence for previously unknown zzso at either locus was found, but the effect of population structure in causing false zzso was zzso
