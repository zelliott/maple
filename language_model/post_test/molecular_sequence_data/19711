The formation of the complex between the zzso of the complement component zzso zzso and the modular complement zzso zzso is important for zzso foreign zzso with zzso zzso and zzso on the surface of B zzso The first two zzso of zzso complement control protein zzso zzso participate in zzso interactions with zzso We have used zzso methods to analyze the dynamic and zzso properties of the zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso is known to depend on pH and zzso zzso Also, the zzso mobility of the zzso zzso has been questioned zzso We performed a 10 zzso molecular dynamics simulation to generate a relaxed structure from crystal packing effects for the zzso complex and to study the zzso of the zzso zzso The MD simulation suggests a tendency for zzso twisting in zzso We propose a zzso model for recognition and binding of zzso with zzso driven by long and zzso zzso zzso We have calculated the zzso of specific zzso zzso zzso free energies of interaction involved in binding and in zzso zzso zzso interactions may mediate zzso effects important for zzso zzso We present calculations for the pH and zzso zzso of zzso zzso free zzso which are in overall agreement with experimental binding zzso We show how comparison of the calculated and experimental data allows for the decomposition of the contributions of zzso from other effects in zzso We critically compare predicted zzso for several zzso of the zzso complex with the available experimental data for binding zzso Finally, we propose that zzso is capable of assuming a large array of zzso zzso ranging from closed zzso to open linear states, with similar recognition properties for zzso but we cannot exclude an additional contact site with zzso
