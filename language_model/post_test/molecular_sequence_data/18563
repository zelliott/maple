This study aimed to identify zzso signatures in the promoter region of human T cell zzso virus type 2 zzso isolated from infected individuals from Salvador, Brazil and in sequences from the zzso zzso DNA samples from zzso individuals were submitted to zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and sequencing, and molecular analyses were performed using zzso zzso The zzso of zzso strains isolated from patients from Salvador reveals that all sequences were zzso zzso One hundred and zzso sequences from zzso were selected, among which 30 belong to zzso zzso 88 to zzso zzso 32 to zzso zzso and one to zzso zzso zzso signatures were identified as well as zzso resulting in loss or gain of motifs important to zzso zzso The zzso a and b have two E box zzso while zzso c and d have only zzso These zzso may impact viral fitness and infection outcome and should be more closely zzso
