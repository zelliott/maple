zzso zzso zzso is rare in children, and little is known about the molecular basis of zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and zzso characteristics and to detect zzso on cardiac zzso protein genes in three idiopathic pediatric zzso 

zzso clinical characteristics and familiar history were obtained in three idiopathic pediatric zzso One hundred healthy pediatric individuals were recruited as zzso zzso evaluation was performed with heart tissue retrieved at zzso in zzso and zzso The entire coding sequences of four cardiac zzso protein zzso including cardiac zzso T zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso heavy chain zzso and zzso zzso screened for zzso zzso zzso were then tested in the family as well as in 100 healthy control zzso 

All three index cases were diagnosed as primary zzso without family history, and their clinical conditions deteriorated zzso zzso was in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso was in combination with zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso displayed extensive an zzso and disarray of zzso electron zzso showed large stacks of severely zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso In zzso zzso biopsy revealed moderate zzso zzso with mild zzso zzso transmission electron zzso showed zzso of zzso and unequal zzso band zzso zzso analysis identified two zzso zzso zzso in zzso with zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso A de zzso zzso deletion in zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso analysis shows that all three zzso are located in a position highly zzso across many zzso The three zzso were negative for their parents and zzso 

The clinical conditions in all three index cases are deteriorated rapidly after diagnosed as primary zzso Three zzso zzso including two in zzso and one in zzso gene are identified in the three zzso respectively, which are considered as zzso zzso These findings provide new insights into the molecular zzso responsible for pediatric zzso
