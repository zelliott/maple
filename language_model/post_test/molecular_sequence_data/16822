In animal zzso bacteria, horizontal gene transfer events zzso have been frequently observed in zzso regions that zzso functions involved in zzso of the outer membrane located zzso zzso As a result, different strains of the same pathogen can have substantially different zzso zzso gene zzso Since zzso is highly zzso the variation at zzso zzso is attributed to be of advantage in evading the host immune zzso Although zzso has been suggested as a zzso of plant defense responses, zzso variation at zzso zzso gene clusters has not been reported for any plant zzso zzso 

We report here the complete sequence of a zzso zzso zzso locus of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso six genes whose products are zzso to functions involved in zzso zzso and zzso All six open reading frames zzso have zzso zzso content and altered zzso zzso which are the hallmarks of zzso islands that are acquired by horizontal gene zzso The zzso locus is flanked by highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso gamma zzso and electron transport zzso Interestingly, two different sets of zzso genes are present at this locus in the plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso island is present in a number of zzso strains from India and other Asian countries but is not present in two zzso one from India zzso and another from Nepal zzso as well as the closely related rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that sequences related to zzso are present at the zzso locus in both zzso and zzso The zzso strain has a hybrid zzso gene zzso with sequences at the zzso and zzso ends, being most closely related to sequences from zzso and the tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso 

This is the first report of zzso at an zzso locus between different strains of a plant zzso zzso Our results indicate that multiple zzso events have occurred at this locus in the zzso group of plant zzso
