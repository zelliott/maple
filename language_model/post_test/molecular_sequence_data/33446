Recent studies highlight the diversity and significance of marine zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso To assess if freshwater zzso also harbor similar zzso diversity, genes involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso were targeted to explore zzso and zzso zzso zzso composition in a wide range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes in bacteria of seven lakes with contrasting zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso Out of 61 sequences zzso the L zzso of zzso zzso 22 clustered with zzso zzso zzso bacteria, whereas 39 zzso sequences related to zzso zzso like zzso were zzso zzso analysis revealed clear separation of these freshwater zzso genes as well as 11 zzso gene sequences from their marine zzso Terminal restriction zzso length analysis of zzso genes was used to characterize zzso zzso and zzso zzso populations in 20 lakes differing in physical and chemical zzso zzso differences in zzso community composition were observed between zzso lakes and all other systems, where a higher proportion of genes affiliated with zzso zzso zzso bacteria was observed than in other zzso Our results reveal a significant diversity of zzso zzso in lakes and suggest niche zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in these systems in response to zzso status and coupled differences in light zzso
