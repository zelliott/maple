zzso of cauliflower mosaic virus zzso strain zzso have been characterized with regard to zzso zzso that resulted from specific changes in the viral DNA zzso Both the zzso and the zzso viruses zzso a zzso host, zzso zzso zzso giving indistinguishable zzso However, in the zzso host zzso zzso which was zzso zzso by the zzso virus, zzso induced zzso local zzso at 21 degrees C and above, and a zzso necrosis at lower zzso The zzso differed from the parental zzso strain by having single base changes in gene zzso The zzso zzso could be selected during serial passage of zzso in zzso zzso or created by zzso zzso within the gene VI coding zzso zzso zzso gene VI gene products were detected in extracts of plants infected with the zzso zzso as were two smaller proteins derived from the same coding zzso The relationship of the zzso zzso of the zzso to the detected gene zzso proteins is discussed in the context of the natural variation found in this zzso
