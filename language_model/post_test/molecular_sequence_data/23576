zzso zzso is a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso modified by members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We previously defined the zzso and zzso zzso sites in zzso and found increased adhesive and migratory activity of a pool of zzso fragments compared to full-length zzso In the present study, we performed zzso analysis of zzso full-length zzso and generated zzso zzso fragments corresponding to the zzso fragments, which have apparent molecular weights of 40, 32, and 25 zzso by zzso Single zzso zzso in zzso and zzso do not abrogate zzso zzso although processing of the putative zzso zzso appears to be affected by a zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was a stronger adhesive zzso compared to full-length zzso despite the observation that full-length zzso displayed greater binding in soluble phase to zzso cell zzso While the zzso zzso showed significant binding to zzso cell surfaces, the zzso zzso zzso did not interact with cell zzso Our data indicate that the increased adhesive activity of zzso zzso was accountable by the zzso zzso zzso We further analyzed zzso zzso using competition with peptides representing the zzso and zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso cells, we found that a zzso corresponding to zzso had no effect on cell zzso whereas the zzso zzso competitively inhibited cell zzso These results suggest that a shorter motif that is found in zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to mediate cell zzso of zzso cells to zzso including the zzso zzso which have been previously characterized to bind the zzso zzso
