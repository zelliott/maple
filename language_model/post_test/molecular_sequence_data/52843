A novel zzso clone zzso a protein structurally related to the zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso which regulate zzso genes and others, was isolated from mouse and rat zzso The coding protein contained the zzso domain and zzso repeats, both of which are characteristic of the zzso zzso and showed significant similarity in zzso acid sequence to the zzso Sex comb on zzso zzso zzso Since this novel protein contains the zzso repeats in four tandem copies, we designated this zzso gene as zzso for zzso gene containing four zzso zzso Cloning and characterization of the mouse zzso gene revealed that the coding sequence comprised 20 zzso dispersed along approximately zzso and mapped to the zzso part of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso were expressed most abundantly in the adult zzso and less zzso in all other zzso zzso
