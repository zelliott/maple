We described previously an African zzso fever virus zzso open reading frame, zzso in the African isolate Malawi zzso zzso whose product shared significant similarity in a zzso domain with those of a mouse zzso differentiation primary response zzso zzso and the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Roberts, and zzso zzso Rock, zzso zzso zzso zzso The similarity of zzso to these genes suggested that this gene may function in some aspect of zzso zzso and/or host zzso zzso analysis of additional zzso viral zzso demonstrates that this gene is highly zzso among diverse zzso zzso and that the gene product exists in either a long zzso zzso acids as in zzso or a short form zzso to 72 zzso acids in other examined zzso zzso The short form of the zzso zzso encodes the complete highly zzso zzso zzso domain of 56 zzso acids common to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene deletion zzso and their zzso were constructed from the zzso zzso isolate zzso and an zzso monkey cell zzso virus, zzso to study gene zzso Although deletion of zzso did not affect viral growth in primary zzso zzso or zzso cell cultures in zzso the zzso zzso zzso exhibited a marked reduction in pig zzso In contrast to zzso or parental zzso where mortality was zzso all zzso animals survived zzso With the exception of a transient fever response, zzso animals remained clinically normal and exhibited a zzso reduction in both mean and maximum zzso zzso All zzso zzso animals survived infection when challenged with parental zzso at 30 days zzso These data indicate that the highly zzso zzso gene of zzso while zzso for growth in zzso zzso in zzso is a significant viral zzso factor and may function as a host range zzso
