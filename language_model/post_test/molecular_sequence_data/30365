An zzso zzso by a gene of zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso The homogeneous zzso with a molecular weight of zzso revealed maximum zzso activity at pH zzso to zzso and a temperature of 65 to 70 degrees zzso The zzso was stable at a temperature lower than 45 degrees C (the growth temperature of the zzso in the range of pH zzso to zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso at the N zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso to zzso and then transferred zzso to the residual zzso The resulting zzso was zzso to zzso
