zzso zzso is one of the principal goals of mass zzso zzso zzso and many strategies exist to achieve zzso Several approaches involve the incorporation of a zzso label using either chemical zzso zzso zzso incorporation of zzso or zzso labeling in a cell or tissue zzso These techniques can be cost or time prohibitive or not amenable to the biological system of zzso zzso techniques including those utilizing integrated zzso abundance and spectral counting offer an alternative to zzso zzso zzso we present the comparison of zzso labeling of zzso acids in cell culture zzso with spectral counting for the zzso of human embryonic stem cells as they differentiate toward the zzso at three time zzso Our spectral counting experimental strategy resulted in the identification of zzso protein groups across three time points with an average sequence coverage of zzso of which zzso could be zzso with more than five spectral zzso zzso zzso was able to identify zzso protein groups with an average coverage of zzso of which zzso could be zzso across all time zzso Within this context we further explore the capacity of each strategy for zzso coverage, variation in zzso and the relative sensitivity of each technique to the detection of change in relative protein zzso
