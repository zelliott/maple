To zzso zzso identify and assess the potential for the zzso of synthetic zzso zzso in sheep zzso 

zzso bacteria were isolated from a mixed soil sample consisting of garden soil and zzso from farms where zzso had been zzso The two largest in size were then identified using zzso zzso and genetic techniques to be members of the zzso zzso and zzso By comparing the zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso discovered was shown to group within the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso isolated was closely related to zzso zzso Cell growth and degradation was greatest in the zzso zzso culture where there was breakdown of 60 zzso zzso to 6 zzso zzso technical zzso in 20 zzso zzso to the zzso was greater in the zzso zzso but was found to depend on the availability of other carbon sources and zzso 

The bacteria characterized show the potential to be used in a zzso application for the treatment of SP zzso 

The zzso bacteria may have use in the disposal of used SP zzso and with further research could lead to an alternative route of disposal for use in agriculture or zzso
