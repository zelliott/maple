The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso base pairs of the zzso zzso which includes the attachment site zzso and the integration region, was zzso This sequence contained an open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso which is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso proteins as judged by sequence zzso The open reading frame was located immediately adjacent to the zzso site and was oriented so that initiation of translation would begin zzso to the zzso site and end in its immediate zzso zzso of this DNA segment in zzso coli provided extracts which promoted zzso zzso between plasmids containing cloned zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was zzso since no reaction was observed between plasmids containing zzso and zzso zzso The reaction was zzso by the accessory protein integration host factor of zzso zzso Evidence was also obtained that the integration host factor influenced the levels of zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso has remarkable similarity to that deduced for the zzso of zzso zzso
