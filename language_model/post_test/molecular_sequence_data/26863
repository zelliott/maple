zzso exhibits a high zzso rate of zzso zzso that is enhanced by zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso is required for this zzso though its mechanism of action is poorly zzso Recent structural work has suggested that zzso may physically dock with the zzso domain to exert its zzso zzso To examine how these interactions activate zzso we engineered a minimal zzso fusion protein zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso it to define the structural framework that mediates zzso association with the zzso zzso Chemical zzso of zzso and zzso of full-length zzso establishes that the zzso interface is comprised of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso domain and the zzso of zzso We further show that this interface is essential for structural stability in full-length zzso Finally, we identify zzso in this interface that disrupt zzso zzso zzso and zzso membrane zzso in zzso and impair the late stages of zzso zzso in zzso These data suggest that the components of the zzso interface act as an zzso signaling zzso which we term the bundle signaling element, that can zzso zzso function in zzso and in zzso
