zzso zzso zzso produce zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, which is inhibited by zzso and a highly zzso zzso domain of zzso Of all the other five zzso zzso and zzso share the highest degree of zzso with this domain of zzso therefore, we investigated whether these two zzso inhibit zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibit the degradation of zzso by zzso media, and their zzso effects are zzso reversed by zzso zzso peptides containing highly zzso zzso regions of zzso and zzso inhibit zzso degradation, as does an zzso zzso zzso yet each zzso displays a different zzso with the zzso zzso being the most potent and the zzso zzso being the least zzso In contrast, a zzso yet neutral, zzso zzso does not inhibit zzso zzso confirming the role of basic zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso each of which contains the zzso consensus sequence zzso bind zzso yet the zzso and -5 peptides bind zzso with the highest zzso whereas the zzso zzso binds zzso with approximately zzso less zzso zzso with these regions being involved in zzso zzso zzso completely reverses their zzso effects on zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso can function as zzso zzso of zzso zzso likely through zzso highly zzso zzso zzso contained within the zzso zzso zzso motif present in the zzso of these zzso
