The number and exact locations of the major zzso complex zzso zzso genes zzso are unknown because of strong linkage zzso within the zzso By using a zzso zzso mouse strain that possesses a zzso zzso from a zzso sister strain, we have now shown that zzso consists of at least two zzso one in and one outside the class II A and E zzso A new zzso gene zzso was mapped to the zzso zzso segment of zzso 17 adjacent to, but distinct from, previously known zzso candidates, class II A, zzso and Tap zzso The coding sequences and zzso donor and zzso sequences of the zzso zzso a candidate gene for zzso were identical in the zzso CTS, and zzso zzso ruling out zzso acid changes in the zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso diabetes zzso zzso Our results not only map a new zzso zzso zzso but also suggest a new way to fine map disease zzso genes within a region where strong linkage zzso zzso
