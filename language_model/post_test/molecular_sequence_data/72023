The zzso protein of bovine zzso is a zzso acid, zzso type II zzso protein that efficiently zzso immortalized mouse zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso is not only critical for biological activity, it also regulates interactions with cellular targets including the zzso derived growth factor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to define the specific TM zzso acids essential for zzso biological and zzso activity, we performed scanning zzso zzso on 25 of the 30 potential TM zzso and genetically mapped discrete zzso zzso which separately regulated the ability of zzso to bind zzso activate zzso and to form zzso zzso zzso at positions 17, 21, and 24 (which lie on the same zzso zzso greatly inhibited zzso association with the zzso suggesting that this region comprises the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso also mapped to a specific but broader domain in zzso zzso proteins with zzso on one zzso face zzso 8, 9, 11, 16, 19, 22, and zzso continued to induce zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso proteins with zzso on the opposite zzso face zzso 7, 10, 13, 17, 18, 21, 24, and 25) did not, indicating that the latter zzso face was critical for zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, these zzso zzso zzso into two zzso 1) those that were unable to form zzso but that could still form higher order zzso and transform cells, and 2) those that were defective for zzso binding and were zzso These findings suggest that the ability of zzso to zzso and to bind zzso is important for zzso zzso However, since several zzso zzso zzso were defective for binding and/or zzso zzso it is apparent that zzso must have additional activities to mediate cell zzso Finally, zzso zzso also defined two separate zzso faces critical for zzso interactions zzso zzso Thus, our data identify distinct zzso zzso faces that regulate zzso and zzso zzso interactions and define two new classes of biologically active TM zzso
