zzso evolution normally occurs in zzso Until now, there has been a lack of direct experimental evidence for zzso evolution following zzso In the present study, zzso hybrids and newly zzso zzso were derived from zzso zzso Chinese Spring zzso zzso zzso zzso One hundred and zzso wheat simple sequence repeat zzso markers were used to investigate the variation of wheat zzso after zzso and variation of the zzso products of 29 of the zzso markers was zzso Of these 29 zzso zzso 15 were unable to produce products from zzso The other 14 zzso markers did produce products from parental zzso zzso hybrids and zzso However, the length of the products amplified from zzso was different from the length of the products amplified from parental wheat and zzso zzso zzso indicated that the length variation of the 14 zzso stemmed mainly from variation in the number of repeat zzso The zzso of repeat units occurred in both perfect and compound zzso In some compound zzso zzso one motif was observed to expand whereas another to zzso Almost all the zzso evolution observed in this study could be explained by the zzso zzso zzso The results of this study seem to indicate that stress caused by zzso might be one of the factors that induce zzso zzso In addition, the findings of present study provided an instance of how simple sequence repeats evolved after zzso
