The zzso T cell clone recognizes an zzso presented by zzso zzso on the melanoma cell line zzso A zzso zzso this zzso zzso was isolated using a library zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso sequence identified it is a processed zzso derived from a zzso of zzso coding for zzso zzso The zzso gene exhibits several premature stop zzso zzso and insertions relative to the zzso zzso In zzso zzso a short open reading frame codes for the zzso zzso from which zzso peptides are zzso a stop zzso follows the zzso zzso Val zzso Part of the zzso zzso 3' untranslated region codes for a zzso of similar sequence zzso If produced, this zzso can be recognized by zzso T zzso However, in zzso zzso the zzso zzso Val zzso is followed by a zzso zzso As a result, expression of zzso zzso does not lead to zzso zzso A model is proposed for events that participated in creation of a gene coding for a melanoma zzso from a zzso
