We report here the complete coding sequence of a zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso 200 gene zzso By combining zzso zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso techniques we have obtained a zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso zzso When used as a probe in northern analysis, its 3' segment zzso to a zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso additionally zzso to a less abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the two zzso share the zzso region and the same open reading frame, which encodes a zzso protein composed of zzso zzso zzso The difference between them is due to a zzso region extended by alternative zzso site zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was found to be zzso by zzso in various zzso cell zzso Using zzso zzso raised against a segment specific for the zzso zzso we established that zzso protein levels increase on treatment with zzso in zzso zzso and that zzso is located in the zzso
