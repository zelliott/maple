zzso zzso potential zzso channels mediate zzso zzso entry and the electrical response in zzso zzso The role of zzso channels in other zzso zzso is unknown, particularly those, exemplified by zzso zzso eye zzso in which calcium release from zzso stores is zzso We have amplified zzso zzso three zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso differing by a 27 zzso acid insert within the zzso zzso encodes an alternative 63 zzso acid sequence in the pore domain compared with zzso zzso and zzso are present in zzso eye zzso while zzso is only present in brain zzso In zzso zzso indicates the presence of zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Some zzso zzso channels can be activated by zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso can activate an inward current with electrical characteristics similar to the zzso zzso However, simultaneous zzso of zzso calcium concentration appears to be zzso zzso zzso the response to zzso injections and vice zzso These results provide molecular and pharmacological evidence for a zzso channel in zzso zzso eye that may contribute to the zzso zzso
