zzso zzso was used as a zzso label of the zzso binding site of zzso chicken gizzard zzso zzso zzso of the active site of 6 S zzso was assured by forming a stable zzso complex zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso was used in place of zzso to prevent the known zzso of zzso with zzso which zzso the trapped zzso zzso zzso was also zzso trapped on gizzard zzso by forming the 10 S folded zzso of the protein in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso of 6 S zzso containing zzso trapped zzso zzso or 10 S trapped zzso gave 32 and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and precursor zzso zzso peptides of the zzso heavy chain derived from both forms of zzso were found to contain essentially all of the zzso attached zzso Parallel experiments with zzso zzso showed extensive zzso labeling of all of the major zzso peptides and the light zzso Eight labeled zzso isolated from 6 and 10 S zzso myosin, contained the sequence zzso where X zzso to labeled zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to label zzso 324 in skeletal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso which zzso to zzso 325 in the gizzard zzso Thus, this region of the zzso zzso fragment, near the zzso binding site, in both skeletal and smooth muscle zzso must fold in essentially the same zzso
