The zzso DNA zzso 1 gene zzso is indispensable for cell zzso zzso expresses one major and two minor zzso transcripts differing only in the length of the zzso untranslated leader sequences preceding a common zzso Control of zzso zzso production and zzso targeting depends upon mechanisms controlling the choice of translation initiation site within the zzso zzso zzso laser scanning zzso of green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso revealed that translation of zzso zzso transcripts from the first zzso start zzso produces an zzso zzso that is targeted exclusively to the zzso zzso initiation from the second zzso start zzso produces an zzso zzso targeted only to the zzso There is no evidence for zzso being targeted to zzso The zzso zzso zzso possesses both an zzso zzso signal and an internal zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso yet is targeted only to zzso demonstrating a zzso dominance of the zzso zzso over the zzso The length of the zzso and more significantly the zzso context around alternative start zzso in the zzso transcripts affect translation initiation to ensure a balanced synthesis of both nuclear and zzso zzso zzso probably via a zzso leaky zzso scanning zzso
