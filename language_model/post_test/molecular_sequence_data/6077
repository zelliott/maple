Nuclear zzso zzso zzso have been found to mediate the import of proteins into the zzso zzso interacting directly with zzso control the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso protein is zzso regulated throughout the cell cycle and this regulation has been shown to be dependent on the presence of its zzso zzso We identified three novel zzso clones that were isolated from an expression library because they zzso zzso that bind a synthetic zzso containing the major zzso of zzso zzso zzso These clones were found to share a common domain zzso by zzso zzso a simple sequence length zzso zzso zzso is the first report where zzso repeats were found to zzso zzso One zzso clone encodes a full zzso 16 zzso zzso designated zzso that is represented in cells predominantly as zzso zzso interacts with the zzso I of zzso through its zzso zzso Cell zzso and zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso is a nuclear protein which, in zzso zzso with zzso
