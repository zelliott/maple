The zzso zzso zzso is a negative regulator of multiple signal zzso zzso We observed that zzso effectively antagonized zzso zzso in zzso zzso This occurred by zzso of zzso zzso because zzso activity was unaffected in the presence of zzso One reason for efficient zzso was zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso had elevated activity subsequent to zzso by zzso in zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso sites in the C zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were less active toward zzso zzso in intact zzso A second reason for efficient zzso is the zzso selectivity of zzso zzso experiments with different zzso fusion proteins revealed efficient interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso domain rather than with the zzso zzso zzso that zzso to good zzso zzso were efficiently zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (where zzso is zzso and a zzso corresponding to a recently identified zzso zzso site in zzso zzso zzso were excellent zzso zzso zzso of these zzso into the zzso domain of zzso by molecular modeling was consistent with the zzso data and explains the efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso seem to be of major importance for efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso probably contribute to the zzso selectivity of zzso We propose that zzso of zzso by zzso and complementary zzso zzso of zzso and zzso may lead to very transient zzso signals in the presence of zzso
