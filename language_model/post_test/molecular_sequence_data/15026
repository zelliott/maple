The zzso G zzso receptors zzso must reach their correct zzso location to exert their zzso zzso zzso relevant for zzso trafficking include signal sequences zzso zzso integration into the membrane of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso or retrograde transport signals promoting zzso sorting into the zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, receptors must be correctly folded to pass the quality control system of the early zzso zzso Taking the zzso B zzso as a model, we describe a new type of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of this domain zzso zzso to zzso leads to a fully functional zzso protein that is expressed at a lower level than the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments and zzso state analyses demonstrate that the zzso zzso is neither zzso retained zzso nor zzso Fluorescence recovery after zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso zzso is also not zzso By using an in zzso prion protein targeting zzso we show that this domain is necessary for efficient zzso gating at the zzso membrane during early zzso zzso Taken together, we identified a novel zzso domain in the zzso protein zzso Our data may also be relevant for other zzso and unrelated integral membrane zzso
