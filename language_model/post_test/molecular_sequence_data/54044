In zzso zzso zzso a central component in mismatch repair, forms a zzso with zzso to repair small zzso zzso and with zzso to repair base pair zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso a zzso zzso is zzso lethal with zzso a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Six conditional zzso of zzso were identified as those that zzso viability in zzso strains at 26 degrees but not at 35 zzso DNA sequencing revealed that zzso in several of the zzso zzso are located in regions with previously unidentified zzso The conditional zzso of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso suppression was also observed for the zzso zzso zzso exhibited by zzso and zzso strains in the zzso zzso zzso zzso plasmids bearing zzso in the zzso zzso zzso domain were unable to suppress zzso zzso conditional zzso These results, in combination with a genetic analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggest that the activity of the zzso zzso is important for viability in the presence of the zzso zzso and that zzso plays a zzso role in zzso mismatch zzso
