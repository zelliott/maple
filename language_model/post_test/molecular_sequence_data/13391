The alignment of zzso zzso zzso by computer requires assumptions about the evolutionary costs for gaps in the alignment that are zzso when zzso applied across the entire zzso The conservation of zzso secondary structures exceeds that of its zzso and therefore it is recommended that secondary structures guide decisions about the assignment of zzso positions for zzso zzso Suggestions for zzso data zzso and character description are made in the context of an example from zzso large zzso nuclear zzso zzso improved zzso with previously published zzso conclusions and the format used in data presentation facilitated the description of zzso conclusions at each zzso in the zzso The data presented allow a discrimination between the fully resolved shortest tree and conclusions that the data actually support with any reasonable zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso without further resolution within the zzso
