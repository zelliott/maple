In most zzso the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso play a major role in the function of zzso zzso Although the zzso domain is required for the formation of a fully functional zzso zzso within other regions of the gene such as the zzso also have a strong impact on its in zzso zzso To analyze the contribution of the zzso on the zzso activity, we have expressed the full-length zzso zzso zzso together with various zzso deletions in zzso coli and analyzed the structural and zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso 9 within zzso zzso on zzso on intact zzso and, to a lesser extent, on zzso A detailed analysis of the reaction products shows that zzso adds two zzso groups to an zzso zzso tail zzso in a zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso with an apparent molecular weight of 160 zzso from a gel zzso column, which indicates the formation of a zzso This property is dependent on an intact zzso In contrast to the full-length zzso proteins lacking the zzso fail to zzso and show a zzso lower specific activity and a linear dependence of zzso activity on zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing zzso acids zzso of zzso is sufficient to mediate this interaction in zzso The zzso of zzso and the subsequent increase of its zzso activity provide a starting point to understand the molecular details of the formation of zzso structures in zzso
