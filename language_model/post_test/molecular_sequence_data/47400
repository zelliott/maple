We present a new concept that combines data storage and data analysis in zzso research, based on an zzso network zzso As an zzso 115 zzso zzso regions from over 73 zzso published sequences zzso from the entire zzso part of the zzso sequence zzso were identified and clustered by a zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as degree of distance between the zzso protein zzso are zzso as neighborhood relationship on a two-dimensional topographical zzso 

Such a display overcomes the restrictions of linear list processing and allows local and global sequence relationships to be studied zzso Families are memorized as zzso zzso of zzso zzso On a massive parallel machine, zzso and updating of the database take only a few zzso a rapid analysis of incoming data such as protein sequences or zzso is carried out on zzso zzso 

Access to the database is available at zzso +
