We have isolated a full-length zzso clone zzso a zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso also called zzso protein or zzso The zzso zzso sequence includes an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a 655 zzso acid protein with an zzso zzso leader sequence and a zzso zzso zzso which has been found in other zzso proteins of the zzso zzso The 3' untranslated region contains a zzso and an zzso control element zzso as well as a putative zzso instability zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid sequence displayed high identity with zzso from other zzso including chicken zzso rat zzso and human zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso was present zzso in the zzso A6 kidney zzso cell line and that zzso zzso levels could be enhanced by treatment of the cells with zzso media, zzso zzso zzso zzso heat zzso zzso and the calcium zzso zzso Finally, while zzso zzso was detected in all of the adult zzso zzso the relative level of zzso zzso differed dramatically between zzso For example, relatively high levels of zzso zzso were detected in liver with moderate levels in zzso zzso and heart and reduced levels in eye and muscle zzso
