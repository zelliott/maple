zzso zzso in the plasma zzso are responsible for zzso of the environmental zzso used in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of an zzso zzso zzso zzso a new member of the zzso zzso gene family in higher zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso clones of zzso revealed that the zzso gene is composed of 10 zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is able to functionally complement a zzso zzso zzso lacking a zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso and restriction zzso length zzso mapping confirmed that zzso is a zzso gene that maps to the top arm of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso plants indicated that the zzso zzso abundance of zzso increased specifically in roots up to zzso by zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso transcripts were accumulated in the central cylinder of zzso roots, but not in the zzso zzso cortex, and zzso Among all the structural genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibited the most intensive and specific response in roots, indicating that zzso plays a central role in the regulation of zzso zzso in zzso
