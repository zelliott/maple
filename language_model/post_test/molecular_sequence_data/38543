The zzso zzso II zzso gene zzso which physically maps to human zzso 16 zzso has previously been mapped to bovine zzso 5 zzso Based on these results, a new segment of zzso between the human and bovine zzso was zzso In this paper we demonstrate linkage between zzso and several markers on zzso Our result is supported by the extensive conservation of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso 18 markers used in this study included several zzso as well as the zzso gene previously mapped to zzso zzso of the zzso mapped to zzso reveals that a zzso zzso was responsible for the conflicting zzso The present results further extend the observed conservation of zzso between zzso and zzso
