We investigate how the molecular and cellular maps of the zzso zzso system are zzso A correspondence is established between individual odor zzso zzso and zzso We describe the expression of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso show zzso to zzso zzso and find sexual zzso zzso maps to the zzso zzso which responds to zzso zzso Analysis of a deletion zzso lacking zzso along with transgenic rescue experiments, confirms the mapping and demonstrates that an Or gene is required for zzso function in zzso zzso expression of zzso in a zzso cell identifies the zzso from which it derives and its odor zzso zzso expression in a zzso cell shows that two receptors can function in a single zzso The zzso zzso does not depend on normal odor zzso gene expression to navigate to its target in the zzso
