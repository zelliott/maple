Williams syndrome zzso is a zzso disorder with a characteristic personality and cognitive profile that is zzso in most cases, with a 2 zzso deletion of part of zzso band zzso By applying zzso island cloning methods to zzso from the deletion region, we have identified a new zzso called zzso zzso zzso of DNA from 11 zzso zzso confirmed that it is located within the commonly deleted zzso zzso comparisons revealed that zzso zzso a 591 zzso acid zzso is a novel member of a seven zzso domain zzso family that are zzso zzso of the zzso tissue polarity gene zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in brain, zzso eye, skeletal muscle and zzso Recently, zzso has been identified as the zzso for the wingless zzso protein in zzso We show that zzso as well as human cells, when zzso with zzso expression zzso bind zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene is involved in early development of a large domain of the central nervous system encompassing much of the zzso and zzso zzso The potential function of zzso in zzso a zzso protein signal in the human brain and other zzso suggests that zzso deletion of the zzso gene could contribute to the zzso zzso
