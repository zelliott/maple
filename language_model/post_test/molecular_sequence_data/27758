As a first step in determining the importance of the zzso function of zzso zzso zzso in zzso acid zzso the zzso gene coding for zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been cloned by zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso by the cloned gene is not affected by zzso under conditions where the zzso coli zzso is strongly zzso whereas zzso is able to relieve zzso by zzso used zzso or in combination with zzso zzso of the zzso gene in a zzso zzso zzso strain resulted in increased zzso activity and zzso zzso The zzso sequence of a DNA zzso of zzso zzso encompassing the zzso gene has been zzso At the zzso acid level, zzso from zzso zzso presents overall a high degree of similarity with corresponding zzso from three different zzso The location of some strictly zzso regions may have important implications for zzso activity and zzso
