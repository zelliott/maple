zzso clones presumably containing a transforming gene were isolated from transformed zzso cells, which were obtained by the zzso of DNA from peripheral blood zzso of a familial zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso clones showed that the gene contained an activated zzso the zzso half of which was replaced by the human small nuclear zzso E protein gene and an unknown zzso A partial zzso physical map of the transforming gene was made on the basis of the physical map of the zzso zzso indicating that zzso had occurred during the zzso The human zzso gene was shown to be located on zzso 7 by Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso cell hybrid DNA using the zzso zzso as a zzso
