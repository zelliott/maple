From the general views of the zzso zzso systems, zzso (or zzso zzso that zzso some proteins are zzso zzso unlike other zzso zzso is transcribed through an internal zzso And the zzso internal promoter, unlike other internal zzso is thought to be zzso zzso II zzso zzso dependent, because the zzso transcript has a large size zzso 6 zzso protein coding capacity and a 3' terminal zzso signal followed by a zzso tail, and also because zzso from the promoter of zzso zzso element jockey was highly sensitive to zzso However, our in zzso zzso study reveals that zzso from the human zzso promoter is highly sensitive to zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso III zzso zzso but insensitive to 1 zzso of zzso indicating that the human zzso promoter is pol zzso The pol III dependence is further supported by our observation that zzso and pol zzso zzso gene promoters share a common nuclear factor zzso There is evidence that zzso is also a pol II zzso zzso We thus propose that zzso is a possible member of the pol III zzso zzso
