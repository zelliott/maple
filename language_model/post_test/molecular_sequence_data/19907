zzso zzso is a fundamental requirement for all cellular growth processes and is activated by the zzso of the upstream binding factor zzso in response to growth zzso Even though it is well known that zzso of zzso is required for its zzso and is a key step in zzso of zzso transcription, as yet, there has been no direct mapping of the zzso zzso zzso The results of the present studies employed sophisticated zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso coupled with immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso and computer database searching zzso to identify 10 zzso sites on zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We then carried out functional analysis of two of these sites, zzso zzso and zzso zzso substitution zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso in zzso but not in zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso zzso restored zzso zzso Moreover, zzso abolished zzso interaction in zzso while zzso partially restored zzso zzso Taken together, the results of these studies suggest that growth factor stimulation zzso an increase in zzso zzso activity via zzso of zzso at zzso zzso in part by zzso a zzso step in the recruitment of zzso zzso I: zzso recruitment of zzso Moreover, studies provide critical new data regarding multiple additional zzso zzso sites that will require further characterization by the zzso
