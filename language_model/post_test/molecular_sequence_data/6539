zzso zzso function is regulated by the zzso axis via the zzso of zzso according to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso both the zzso of zzso hormone and zzso zzso through interaction with a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which elicits the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso After zzso zzso the levels of zzso zzso are known to decrease dramatically within a few zzso This phenomenon ultimately leads to zzso long-term zzso of the zzso Here we show that zzso drives the induction of the zzso zzso early zzso zzso zzso of the zzso response element zzso zzso gene both in rat zzso zzso and in the differentiated zzso cell line zzso The zzso of zzso protein induction mirrors the zzso of zzso zzso zzso binds to a zzso sequence in the zzso promoter and zzso its zzso Thus, zzso induction by zzso in the zzso zzso represents a paradigm of the molecular mechanism by which zzso hormones elicit zzso long-term zzso
