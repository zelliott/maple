The zzso protein and zzso operator DNA of any temperate zzso zzso zzso have not been investigated in depth, despite having the potential to enrich the molecular biology of the zzso zzso In the present study, using the extremely pure zzso of temperate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso is composed of zzso and zzso to a substantial extent at room temperature, possesses two zzso unfolds at temperatures above 39 degrees C and binds to two sites in the zzso zzso zzso region with variable zzso The above zzso binding sites harbor two zzso 15 zzso zzso repeats zzso and zzso which are spaced 18 zzso zzso Several zzso bases located in and around zzso and zzso demonstrate interaction with zzso indicating that these 15 zzso sites are used as operators for zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso in a cooperative manner and was found to bind to operator DNA as a zzso Interestingly, zzso did not show appreciable binding to another zzso 15 zzso site zzso that was located in the same primary immunity region as zzso and zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso and the zzso zzso complex resemble significantly those of the zzso zzso at the structural zzso The mode of action of zzso zzso however, may be distinct from that of the zzso proteins of zzso and related zzso
