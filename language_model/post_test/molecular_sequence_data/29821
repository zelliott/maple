The aim of this study was to use pharmacological zzso of protein zzso A and zzso of potential protein zzso A zzso sites to determine the role of protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso To facilitate zzso and imaging of the zzso zzso we attached a zzso tag to the zzso zzso and enhanced green fluorescent protein to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was similar to the zzso zzso zzso in terms of affinity for zzso and zzso zzso zzso to G zzso and stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso in which either zzso or zzso was replaced with Ala were zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso with the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso zzso or substitution of Ala for zzso reduced zzso zzso of the zzso and resulted in diminished trafficking of the zzso to the zzso region of the zzso zzso of Ala for zzso had no effect, however, on zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of Ala for zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or trafficking to the zzso zzso We conclude that protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso on zzso regulates a late step in the sorting of the zzso to the zzso region of the cell, but that zzso of zzso is not required for zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
