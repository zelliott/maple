zzso zzso zzso zzso produces the zzso zzso zzso consisting of several zzso A solid phase extraction procedure was developed which allowed a rapid isolation of both zzso and its zzso zzso from culture zzso zzso high performance liquid zzso followed by high performance liquid zzso zzso provided structural data on the different zzso zzso In order to obtain initial information on the zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso were zzso They were shown to release zzso with shorter zzso chains suggesting that the zzso chain synthesis probably takes place at a later stage of the zzso zzso Based on the biological activity and the zzso data, we assume that a modification and in particular a shorter zzso portion drastically influences the zzso activity of this zzso
