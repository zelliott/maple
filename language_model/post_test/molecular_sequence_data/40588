zzso zzso zzso zzso genes governing the pattern of zzso zzso in higher plants have been studied in zzso zzso and zzso and engineered zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes of soybean zzso and zzso previously cloned and characterized zzso et zzso zzso were shown to complement the zzso deficient zzso zzso zzso plants, consistent with their role in regulation of zzso zzso plant zzso Further analysis of these genes showed that environmental cues, including dehydration, cold, and zzso acid induced differential changes in transcript levels of the zzso during soybean zzso zzso zzso analyses of transgenic zzso seeds originating in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso engineered in seeds showed relevant modifications in the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso in the direction of zzso zzso To provide insight into the structural features of the zzso gene that affects transcript regulation, the upstream promoter sequences of soybean zzso genes were cloned and zzso zzso analysis revealed several important zzso and zzso factor binding zzso The analysis of zzso zzso in transgenic zzso plants revealed shared and distinct expression features in different zzso stages and zzso The data are interpreted to imply that zzso is an important contributor to normal plant growth and zzso
