Most lung cancer patients are zzso zzso and die because of widespread zzso thus indicating the importance of identification of molecules with a crucial role in this zzso Our previous expression profiling analysis of a highly zzso lung cancer cell line, zzso and its parental low zzso line, zzso revealed significant zzso of both known and unknown genes in zzso In this study, we describe the isolation and detailed zzso of a novel zzso named zzso which zzso to one of such expression sequence tags with zzso expression in zzso The zzso gene was found to zzso a protein with zzso zzso acids with structural similarities to, but distinct from zzso cell surface receptors for zzso and zzso zzso zzso was shown to be zzso not only in zzso in association with its acquisition of zzso zzso during in zzso selection, but also in a significant fraction of lung zzso in zzso with high frequency in zzso zzso zzso future studies for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of lung cancer zzso
