zzso repeat proteins regulate zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the seed and the development of zzso and root zzso We have cloned and characterized a zzso repeat protein gene from zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression blocks zzso of zzso and a range of zzso compounds, including zzso zzso other zzso and zzso zzso in the seed, reduces zzso levels without corresponding effects on other zzso in flowers, reduces zzso levels in roots, but does not impair zzso or root hair zzso zzso is expressed zzso with highest expression in the seed coat, where its transcript profile temporally parallels those of PA zzso zzso zzso profile analysis revealed that many genes of zzso zzso were zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso lines harboring zzso insertions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso transparent zzso zzso zzso We discuss the function of zzso in natural product formation in zzso zzso and the potential use of the gene for engineering zzso in the forage zzso alfalfa zzso zzso
