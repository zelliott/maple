Besides abundant zzso three minor zzso zzso 1, 2, and 3, are present in zzso zzso zzso oil zzso The gene zzso zzso named zzso for its zzso capacity, has recently been zzso In this study, zzso gene was obtained by zzso and it was subsequently confirmed by zzso acid partial sequencing and zzso recognition of its zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso cross recognition implies that zzso exists in seed oil bodies of diverse zzso Along with zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene was transcribed in maturing seeds where oil bodies are actively zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso tentatively named zzso possesses a zzso zzso segment preceding a soluble domain zzso to zzso zzso involved in signal zzso in diverse zzso zzso structure of the soluble domain was predicted via zzso zzso The structure forms a zzso parallel zzso with the active site, zzso between an zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was demonstrated in the zzso soluble domain of zzso as well as in zzso oil zzso Southern zzso suggests that one zzso gene and certain zzso genes may be present in the zzso zzso zzso eight hypothetical zzso proteins are present in the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso but a divergent zzso zzso It is indicated that zzso proteins may represent a class of zzso that are involved in plant signal zzso regulated by various zzso
