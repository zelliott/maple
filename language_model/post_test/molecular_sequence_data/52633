A zzso zzso a novel inwardly zzso zzso zzso channel, zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso library of tomato zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was shown to be most strongly expressed in root hairs by Northern zzso zzso The zzso channel is a member of the zzso family of zzso channels previously identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso and potato zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is closely related zzso identical zzso zzso to potato zzso An zzso comparison of the two channels should therefore assist the identification of possible molecular bases for functional zzso zzso this comparison, both channels were functionally expressed and zzso zzso within the same expression system, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified zzso as a zzso inward zzso which activates with slow zzso upon zzso zzso zzso to zzso more negative than zzso zzso The zzso potential of zzso is shifted towards positive zzso with respect to zzso which might be due to single zzso acid exchanges in the rim of the channel's pore region or in the zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso activated upon shifting the external pH from zzso to zzso which indicates a zzso role for zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso The pharmacological inhibitor zzso applied zzso inhibited zzso currents zzso by zzso and zzso zzso with a concentration zzso of 21 zzso and 17 zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso may serve as a zzso influx zzso for zzso into root hair zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from different plant species expressed in the same zzso system allows conclusions to be drawn in respect to zzso zzso
