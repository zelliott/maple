During the molecular cloning of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that couples to the zzso zzso systems, we discovered novel zzso clones that were highly zzso Some of these clones contained an insert of zzso zzso which consisted of a divergent 3' region spliced with a zzso region that was identical to zzso zzso forming part of the 9th and 10th zzso of the coding region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The prominence of alternately spliced zzso which suggested important functional zzso prompted this detailed zzso zzso of the library by zzso chain reaction and Northern analysis of zzso zzso zzso with a specific zzso directed to the divergent 3' region of this transcript suggested existence of a full-length transcript of roughly zzso zzso zzso The zzso was assembled and characterized for its zzso The predicted full-length sequence consisting of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the novel 3' region zzso zzso zzso a protein of 670 zzso acids containing the entire zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, a zzso in the coding sequence at the point of divergence resulted in a shorter (40 zzso zzso 65 for zzso zzso zzso zzso with three zzso zzso and a reduced number of potential zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso were adjacent and are apparently potential double zzso sites compared to the single site present in the zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of this novel transcript in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells revealed the complete absence of zzso zzso zzso functions, but presence of specific hormone binding activity on plasma zzso and prominent cell surface zzso by zzso zzso There was no zzso in hormone binding specificity because the structurally analogous zzso hormone zzso did not bind to the zzso The loss of zzso zzso stimulation in the zzso cells was completely opposite to the properties of the cells expressing the active zzso zzso When cells expressing active receptors were zzso with the altered zzso zzso zzso hormone action was zzso suggesting that it could be functioning as a dominant negative zzso The existence of this zzso zzso zzso with an altered zzso zzso predicts the zzso of an alternative zzso mechanism for regulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our study reveals that the modular structure of the zzso zzso gene generates motifs that allows zzso to different zzso This could become a common feature for all zzso hormone zzso
