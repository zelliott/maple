The energetic contributions of the protein to the zzso potential in an zzso protein are studied via energy zzso comparing zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The reduction reaction was divided into 1) the change in the zzso site charge without allowing the protein to respond and 2) the relaxation of the protein in response to the new charge state, focusing on the zzso The energy zzso predict structural relaxation near the zzso site that agrees well with that in crystal structures of oxidized and reduced zzso zzso zzso but zzso it far from the zzso zzso However, the relaxation energies from the zzso structures agree well with those from the crystal structures, because the polar groups near the zzso site are the main zzso and the charged groups are all located at the surface and thus are screened zzso zzso energies are necessary for good agreement with zzso observed differences in reduction energies between zzso zzso and the other three zzso Overall, the relaxation energy is large (over 500 zzso from both the zzso and the crystal zzso In addition, the range in the relaxation energy for the different zzso is large zzso zzso because even though the structural zzso of the polar groups are small, they are very near the zzso zzso Thus the relaxation energy is an important factor to consider in reduction zzso
