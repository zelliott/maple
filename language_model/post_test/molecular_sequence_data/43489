zzso zzso were tested in a rat model of acute zzso zzso injection of Factor zzso zzso zzso produced a zzso and zzso zzso in the rat zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso Factor zzso was zzso This inflammatory response was zzso by the Factor zzso sequence zzso which mediates zzso binding to zzso cell zzso zzso zzso while a control scrambled zzso did not induce zzso in zzso zzso injection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso binding site for Factor zzso inhibited zzso rat paw zzso while the adjacent zzso sequence zzso was without zzso zzso zzso inflammation was characterized by fast onset and prominent zzso zzso of activated and zzso mast cells, was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but was unaffected by the zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that through its interaction with zzso Factor zzso may function as a zzso of acute inflammation in zzso This zzso may amplify both zzso and inflammatory zzso thus contributing to the zzso of tissue injury in zzso
