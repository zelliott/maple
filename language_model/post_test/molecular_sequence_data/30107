The zzso zzso of bovine zzso corresponding to zzso acid positions zzso is highly zzso and is known to induce experimental zzso zzso The solution zzso of this zzso zzso known as zzso M, was studied by zzso infrared zzso and by circular zzso In the pH range between approximately 4 and zzso zzso M has a strong tendency to form zzso zzso in which it adopts an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso are stabilized by zzso interactions zzso zzso between the zzso groups and basic zzso of the neighboring zzso zzso These interactions can be disrupted by zzso of either zzso zzso range below 4) or basic zzso zzso range above zzso or by elevated zzso zzso The secondary structure of the zzso under conditions favoring the zzso state appears to be a mixture of zzso structure and zzso The present data are consistent with a recently proposed model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Smith, zzso zzso Miles, zzso & Grey, zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso which assumes that certain zzso peptides adopt an extended zzso zzso in which they are zzso between the major zzso complex and the zzso zzso
