During recent years it has become increasingly evident that zzso cells in zzso zzso predominance zzso Hodgkin's disease zzso and zzso and zzso zzso cells in approximately half the cases of classical HD originate from zzso and that zzso cells in most of the remaining cases of classical HD express a zzso zzso The zzso of HD is zzso An association with zzso virus zzso has been suggested and there are also indications that genes involved in programmed cell death zzso may be zzso In this study, the expression of four zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 53 cases of HD was examined and the data were correlated with the zzso the zzso status and the zzso zzso T or zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso cells expressed a zzso zzso in zzso cases of zzso LP and in zzso 50 zzso cases of classical zzso The remaining cases showed a zzso zzso in zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was more often positive in B zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso type zzso The zzso cells were zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso No relationship was found between zzso expression and zzso status, or between zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso was seen in 2 of 34 zzso zzso point zzso were not zzso Our findings indicate that zzso LP and classical HD originate from zzso in a high proportion of zzso They also suggest a role for zzso zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso is not known at this zzso
