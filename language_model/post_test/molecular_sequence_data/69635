zzso zzso disease zzso is a form of zzso zzso with zzso Recently, this disorder was mapped to zzso zzso The gene for the gap junction protein zzso is located in the same zzso segment, which led to its consideration as a candidate gene for zzso With the use of Northern zzso zzso and zzso technique, it was found that zzso is normally expressed in zzso peripheral zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso gene showed seven different zzso in affected persons from eight zzso zzso These findings, a demonstration of inherited defects in a gap junction zzso suggest that zzso plays an important role in peripheral zzso
