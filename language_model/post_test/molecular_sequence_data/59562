By screening with labeled zzso DNA, a clone was isolated from zzso expression library, which appeared identical in sequence to the well-known zzso protein zzso zzso To evidence the zzso activity of zzso zzso II and its presence in the cell nucleus, we have expressed full-length mouse zzso II zzso in bacteria with zzso zzso The expressed protein was studied with zzso mobility shift zzso and for its reaction with zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso which is one of the major zzso components of the zzso The obtained results confirm the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso with zzso zzso to rat zzso So, zzso II is a major nuclear zzso protein in zzso zzso
