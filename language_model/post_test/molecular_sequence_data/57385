For the first time an zzso zzso of zzso origin has been zzso to zzso The zzso from the extreme zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been found to consist of a zzso to zzso zzso likely to form a zzso under in zzso zzso Its temperature optimum is about 90 degrees zzso the pH optimum is zzso depending on the observed direction of the zzso The zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso are almost equal zzso zzso The zzso is absolutely specific for zzso as zzso zzso but has a broad specificity for zzso zzso as zzso It requires zzso metals for activity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the order of decreasing zzso zzso from zzso zzso the sensitivity toward the typical inhibitor zzso is extremely zzso zzso 300 zzso is required for 50% zzso suggesting an altered distance between the zzso zzso The zzso of the protein decreases sharply at room temperatures above 90 degrees zzso It exhibits unusual stability, however, toward zzso zzso A zzso zzso sequence has been determined which allowed us to construct zzso for the genetic zzso From zzso zzso the protein contains the typical zzso rich zzso as well as another zzso sequence stretch 21 zzso zzso Isolation of the gene is in zzso
