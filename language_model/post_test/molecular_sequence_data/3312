zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso gene located on zzso zzso within the putative zzso tumor zzso gene zzso Given the clinical importance of assessing zzso and zzso loss in human zzso the development of convenient and practical zzso for detecting zzso loss is of considerable priority in zzso We report a zzso zzso in the untranslated region of zzso 1, with zzso zzso that have one, two or three zzso zzso The zzso is zzso in zzso of a reference population, and accurately detects zzso loss of zzso in human zzso This novel marker offers distinct advantages for assessing zzso status in zzso zzso The relatively large size of the repeats allows detection of zzso zzso with standard zzso zzso zzso gels and the zzso marker is the closest zzso to the smallest common deletion area in the putative zzso tumor zzso gene zzso These characteristics suggest that the zzso zzso will be a convenient and practical zzso for clinical and research evaluation of zzso status in human zzso
