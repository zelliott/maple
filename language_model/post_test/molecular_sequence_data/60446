The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso to promote zzso zzso Here, we present the high resolution crystal structure of the zzso domain of zzso and probe the functional importance of a zzso zzso zzso The structure reveals a central protein core associated with zzso binding that appears to be structurally zzso among a zzso of zzso including zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso A pronounced zzso lying above this core, and flanked by zzso and zzso regions that show no sequence conservation within zzso zzso is implicated by zzso conservation and zzso studies to be a site for zzso zzso binding and zzso Located at the bottom of this zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is in position to play an important zzso role in zzso zzso zzso analysis of an zzso zzso zzso protein implicates zzso 173 to function as a general base for zzso Together, a correlation of the zzso structure with functionally debilitating zzso zzso provides a paradigm for understanding the zzso relationships of the growing number of zzso regulators that function as zzso zzso zzso
