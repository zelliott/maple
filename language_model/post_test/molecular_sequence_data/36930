We have cloned a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso library whose zzso zzso is localized in the animal pole region of full grown zzso The zzso can be translated in zzso to produce a predicted size protein of 35 zzso and, is also expressed in zzso coli as a fusion zzso The conceptual protein zzso by the zzso zzso is zzso zzso rich and possesses several zzso sequences found in proteins with short zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso and during early development its zzso decreases until the zzso stage after which it begins to zzso Northern blots on dissected zzso and in zzso zzso revealed that the zzso expression is limited to the zzso zzso structures consisting primarily of the zzso zzso zzso of the vegetal pole region immediately following zzso that produces zzso zzso results in a loss of zzso zzso zzso In the adult, zzso zzso is limited primarily to the zzso The presence of this zzso in animal pole region which contributes to the future neural cell lineages suggests that this gene product may function either in the zzso of neural cell types or in a neural specific zzso
