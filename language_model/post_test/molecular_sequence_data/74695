zzso system is a powerful tool to manipulate the zzso zzso animals expressing zzso zzso in specific zzso or cells have been widely used for conditional gene zzso lineage zzso and other genetic zzso In zzso the transgenic line with stable expression of zzso in specific zzso and cell zzso has not been generated and its functional activity remains to be zzso Here we report the establishment of a stable transgenic fish zzso which specifically expresses zzso in the primitive zzso zzso and vascular zzso cells, under the control of zzso zzso Our result shows that the zzso expression pattern zzso the zzso zzso expression pattern during zzso Crossing of the zzso line with another established transgenic reporter line zzso zzso a robust zzso activity in zzso zzso and vascular zzso zzso Thus, the zzso transgenic line provides an invaluable tool to dissect genetic pathways in zzso development and zzso
