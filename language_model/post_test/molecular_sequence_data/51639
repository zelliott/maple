zzso elements are a new family of zzso elements in zzso that are found exclusively in zzso regions and in the zzso zzso zzso of these elements onto broken zzso ends has been implicated in zzso zzso To monitor the fate of zzso elements that had attached to broken ends of the X zzso we examined individual X zzso from a defined population over a period of 17 zzso The ends of the X zzso with new zzso additions receded at the same rate as the broken ends before the zzso elements zzso In addition, some zzso approximately zzso per generation, had acquired new zzso sequences of an average of 6 zzso at their ends with zzso tails at the zzso Thus, the rate of addition of new material per generation matches the observed rate of terminal loss zzso zzso caused by incomplete replication at the end of the DNA zzso One such recently zzso zzso element which is at least 12 zzso in length has been examined in zzso It contains a single open reading frame of zzso zzso which codes for a zzso zzso
