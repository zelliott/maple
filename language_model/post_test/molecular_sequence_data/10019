Previous studies have indicated that zzso zzso spliced with zzso zzso are zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Because such alternative zzso may regulate divergent biological effects of the specific zzso we zzso the consequences of this process on the composition and structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were engineered with and without zzso zzso or zzso and expressed as zzso fusion proteins in zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso were contrasted with those of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso at a putative zzso zzso zzso site within zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained both zzso and zzso zzso zzso although there was a high content of zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso of zzso zzso which contain no zzso consensus zzso resulted in increased zzso with zzso zzso as well as increased zzso levels of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso content declined by more than zzso in the zzso indicating that assembly of zzso chains occurs there, and a general decrease in the zzso level of the remaining chains was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was shown by parallel analyses with native human zzso zzso molecules and is most probably an artifact of transient expression in zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso zzso exerts complex and zzso effects on zzso patterns and structure, which presumably zzso those functions that may be zzso though the zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso
