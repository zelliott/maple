The immature zzso particle contains two envelope zzso zzso and zzso that are associated as a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso occurs in association with zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that there should be zzso of the zzso components in this zzso This also implies that zzso zzso signals must be present in the zzso envelope zzso In this work, we looked for potential zzso zzso signals in the yellow fever virus envelope zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of the E protein in yellow fever zzso cells indicated that this protein accumulates in the zzso Similar results were obtained with cells expressing only zzso and zzso zzso proteins containing the zzso of zzso or zzso fused to the zzso zzso of zzso or E were constructed, and their zzso zzso was studied by zzso zzso and by analyzing the maturation of their associated zzso Although a small fraction was detected in the zzso intermediate and zzso zzso these zzso proteins were located mainly in the zzso The C zzso of zzso and E form two zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the first zzso passage contains enough information for zzso zzso Taken altogether, these data indicate that, besides their role as membrane zzso the zzso zzso of yellow fever virus envelope proteins are zzso retention zzso In addition, our data show that the mechanisms of zzso retention of the zzso and zzso envelope proteins are zzso
