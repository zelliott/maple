zzso from zzso zzso zzso is a common cause of respiratory zzso in Iran with a high positive rate zzso among Iranian allergic zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Using zzso from twelve patients allergic to zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins from the zzso zzso zzso extract was identified by zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso then cloned into the zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, and finally zzso by metal affinity zzso The zzso capacity of the zzso protein was then analyzed by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as by the skin prick test zzso 

zzso results indicated a zzso protein with zzso to zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso revealed an open reading frame of 399 zzso zzso for 133 zzso acid zzso which was belonged to the zzso family and designated as zzso r zzso A zzso zzso r 2 zzso r 2) was then produced in zzso coli as a soluble protein which showed a strong zzso via zzso confirmed by the zzso zzso experiments revealed high zzso zzso with the zzso from other zzso 

The zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso r 2, was zzso identified as an zzso Moreover, zzso r 2 was produced in zzso coli as a soluble zzso protein with an zzso similar to that of its natural zzso
