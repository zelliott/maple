This work aimed to assess novel protective roles and regulation of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The structural gene zzso zzso was cloned into the shuttle zzso zzso to generate the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso level was notably increased in zzso zzso cells harboring the zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells harboring zzso exhibited higher survival than the zzso control cells on the minimal media plates with zzso oxide zzso sodium zzso zzso or without nitrogen zzso In the liquid minimal media, they also showed higher viability under zzso stress or zzso zzso The zzso zzso oxygen species zzso level appeared to be lower in the zzso zzso cells harboring zzso than in the control zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene showed scavenging effect on NO generated from zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso fusion gene was significantly enhanced by zzso and nitrogen zzso in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso level in zzso zzso was also elevated by zzso and nitrogen zzso in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso plays protective roles against zzso and nutritional stress in the zzso zzso and is zzso zzso by zzso and nutritional stresses in a zzso zzso
