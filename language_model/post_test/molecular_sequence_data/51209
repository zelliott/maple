zzso zzso CD zzso has been observed for the zzso zzso zzso in solution in zzso The observed zzso zzso do not resemble the zzso features of any of the previously reported zzso secondary structures, such as zzso zzso zzso or sheet structures, and might be due to the zzso contained in this zzso To shed light onto the origin of the observed zzso zzso intensity calculations, based on the solution and solid-state structures of zzso have been carried zzso In addition, calculated zzso data for pure zzso are zzso
