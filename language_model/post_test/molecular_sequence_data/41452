zzso hair cells are essential for hearing and zzso Their development from zzso precursors has been extensively characterized with respect to zzso regulation, but not in terms of zzso zzso Here we report on the identification and functional characterization of an zzso regulator whose zzso is responsible for defective zzso development, deafness, and impaired balance in the spontaneous zzso Bronx zzso zzso zzso We used zzso cloning and transgenic rescue to locate the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso gene zzso repetitive zzso 4 zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso in the sensory patches of embryonic inner ears revealed that specific alternative zzso were skipped at zzso high rates in the zzso zzso zzso experiments in a zzso expression system confirmed that these skipped zzso require zzso for inclusion into the mature zzso zzso analysis and zzso experiments showed that the affected transcripts share a novel motif that is necessary for the zzso alternative zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction data indicated that the zzso proteins cluster in the zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso of a few zzso regulators was found to be zzso dependent, and several of the genes known to be targeted by these regulators were expressed at reduced levels in the zzso zzso Although zzso expression was detected in neural zzso as well as hair cells, analyses of the zzso mouse zzso and zzso failed to detect zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso function is critical in the hearing and balance zzso but not in all neural zzso zzso is the first zzso regulator to be associated with hearing, and the analysis of zzso mice provides zzso insights into zzso zzso
