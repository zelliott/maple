zzso zzso is a major pathogen of zzso and zzso zzso Prior studies have demonstrated that, beyond the zzso period, zzso zzso rarely causes invasive infections in zzso However, during zzso zzso zzso was the zzso agent of 60 meningitis episodes in children aged 3 months to 12 years from zzso To identify and study the specific zzso genetic lineages of zzso zzso childhood meningitis, which lack characterization to date, we conducted an extensive molecular analysis of the recovered zzso zzso This constitutes what we believe to be the first molecular study of the population structure of invasive zzso zzso zzso from zzso A low genetic diversity was observed among the zzso where the majority belonged to zzso complex zzso 17 presenting the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and marked by the zzso group II zzso which has previously been observed to be associated with zzso zzso The predominance of zzso zzso of sequence type zzso 17 suggested the local diversification of this zzso zzso which displayed novel zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The absence of the zzso region in two zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso is more typical of cattle than human zzso Globally, these data provide novel information about the enhanced zzso of the zzso genetic lineage in older children and suggest the local diversification of this zzso which may be related to the future emergence of a novel epidemic clone in zzso
