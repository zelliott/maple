A new method for quantitative zzso of surrounding zzso for zzso in proteins is zzso It is based on the zzso of three-dimensional molecular zzso potential zzso zzso and includes calculation of zzso zzso created by all atoms in a system zzso zzso We calculated zzso zzso in the geometrical centers of zzso for 23 proteins (from zzso Data zzso surrounded by water layers zzso A zzso These data, plotted along the protein sequence zzso zzso zzso contain comprehensive information on zzso water, prosthetic groups and zzso zzso contributions to zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles generated by water molecules strongly correlate with standard accessibility profiles based on calculations of exposed surface zzso The results confirm recently observed zzso between the resonance zzso cross sections of zzso zzso and polarity of their zzso zzso zzso contributions (and related zzso zzso zzso to zzso environment from protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso as well as zzso zzso in zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso data for zzso in native and totally extended zzso reveal striking zzso reflecting the influence of long-range interactions between zzso far removed in the zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso data yields a new zzso scale zzso that zzso with several commonly used scales obtained by a variety of complementary zzso
