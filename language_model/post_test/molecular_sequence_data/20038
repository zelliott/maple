The mechanism of cargo concentration into zzso zzso involves interactions between the zzso zzso coat complex and cargo transport zzso sequences of zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso contains a signal that binds the zzso zzso zzso and specifies its zzso zzso zzso exit as an zzso zzso The 200 zzso crystal structure of zzso bound to zzso reveals that the transport signal is a folded zzso rather than a conventional short zzso zzso The zzso segment of the zzso motif folds against the zzso zzso domain, and this closed form of zzso binds at the zzso zzso Thus, zzso recognizes zzso zzso via a folded zzso whereas zzso assembly into zzso complexes would mask the zzso zzso The concept of a zzso zzso as a transport signal suggests packaging mechanisms in which a coat is sensitive to the folded state of a cargo protein or the assembled state of a zzso zzso
