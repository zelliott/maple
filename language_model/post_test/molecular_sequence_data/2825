We have zzso a gene in human zzso and a zzso gene in human zzso 6 which could specify a product related to protein zzso This gene appears to be generic in the zzso family as zzso were found in three other human zzso The five sequences were aligned and found to be quite zzso Some of the differences occur at zzso acid positions which are functionally important and highly zzso in known protein zzso Hence these genes may represent a significant departure from known protein zzso in terms of structure and/or zzso
