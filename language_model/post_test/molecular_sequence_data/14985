zzso zzso play a critical role in zzso biology from the assembly of zzso to the regulation of viral gene zzso A zzso model for zzso structure and stability is essential for understanding and designing zzso structure and zzso A previous statistical mechanical theory allows us to treat zzso zzso zzso zzso that contain no intervening loop between the zzso (see zzso zzso and zzso Chen zzso in zzso zzso Research, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significant zzso zzso often contain zzso zzso zzso the structure and stability for such zzso zzso remains an zzso zzso In the present study, we develop a zzso model for zzso with zzso zzso The model gives zzso zzso stability, and the zzso landscape from zzso zzso The main features of this new model are the zzso of the zzso zzso and folding zzso base on the complete zzso ensemble and rigorous treatment for the excluded volume zzso zzso tests for the structural predictions show overall good accuracy with average sensitivity and specificity equal to zzso and zzso zzso The theory developed here may be a solid starting point for zzso modeling of more complex, larger zzso
