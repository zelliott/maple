zzso consist of nearly zzso zzso and assemble into parallel and zzso zzso zzso In zzso it has been established that zzso as well as native muscle zzso can form zzso However, a mixture of muscle alpha and beta zzso zzso results in the formation of the zzso more stable zzso zzso Although the assembly preference of the muscle zzso zzso can be understood zzso the presence of multiple zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells points toward a more complex principle for determining zzso zzso We have investigated the zzso of rat zzso in living cells by the use of zzso tagging with a zzso sequence of the influenza zzso zzso zzso and zzso techniques, we have analyzed the zzso formed by muscle and zzso zzso in rat zzso We demonstrate that the information for zzso versus zzso is contained within the zzso zzso itself and that the information for the selectivity is zzso by the alternatively spliced zzso These results have important implications for models of the regulation of zzso zzso
