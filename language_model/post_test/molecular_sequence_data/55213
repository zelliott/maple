zzso is a compound that is administered as a rescue agent in zzso chemotherapy and in zzso chemotherapy for synergistic zzso It has also recently been suggested to play a role in bacterial resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso known to catalyze the conversion of this compound to zzso along with the zzso of zzso to zzso To better understand the roles of specific zzso acids in the zzso binding pocket of this zzso we used zzso zzso to create 10 modified forms of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso constant zzso for each zzso and the turnover number zzso was determined for each zzso to help zzso the role of individual zzso zzso Data were compared to crystal structures of human and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were largely consistent with a simple zzso and proximity zzso the larger the predicted charges of an interaction and the closer those interactions were to the zzso transferred between the zzso the greater the reduction in zzso binding and zzso activity of the zzso
