We describe the structural organization of a zzso termed zzso zzso that is zzso activated during early zzso zzso zzso zzso is first transcribed at the zzso transition zzso and during early zzso zzso A roughly 200 zzso zzso immediately zzso to the zzso start site is sufficient for zzso early zzso zzso of gene zzso The primary transcript is subject to alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso two structurally related but completely distinct zzso zinc finger proteins of unknown biological zzso
