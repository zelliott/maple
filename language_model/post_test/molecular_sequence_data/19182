zzso natural zzso effect on genetic variation is a major goal in biology, but the zzso consequences of contemporary selection are not well zzso In a release and recapture field experiment we transplanted stick insects to native and novel host plants and directly measured zzso frequency changes within a generation at zzso genetic zzso We observed substantial, zzso zzso frequency changes during the experiment, most of which could be attributed to random mortality zzso zzso However, we also documented that selection affected multiple genetic zzso distributed across the zzso particularly in transplants to the novel zzso zzso selection affecting the zzso acted on both a known zzso trait as well as other zzso zzso We also found evidence that selection associated with zzso affected zzso variation, although our experiment was not designed to test zzso Our results illustrate how zzso data can identify previously underappreciated ecological sources and zzso targets of zzso
