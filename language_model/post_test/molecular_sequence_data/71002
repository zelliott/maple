zzso zzso I zzso is an essential element in zzso of zzso by zzso binding to cardiac zzso C zzso Yet, its role in zzso of the zzso binding signal to cardiac zzso T zzso and zzso remain poorly zzso We have recently discovered that regions of zzso zzso to a previously defined zzso zzso are essential for full zzso activity and zzso of cardiac zzso zzso et zzso zzso However, apart from its role in structural binding to zzso there is little knowledge concerning the role of the zzso of zzso in the zzso and regulation of cardiac zzso To address this question, we generated zzso mouse cardiac zzso zzso 211 zzso and two zzso deletion zzso of mouse zzso zzso zzso 53 zzso and zzso zzso 79 zzso The zzso zzso retained the ability to bind to zzso but lost the ability to bind to zzso whereas the zzso zzso lost the ability to bind to zzso but bound zzso to zzso Both zzso bound to zzso In the absence of zzso zzso was able to inhibit the zzso zzso activity of zzso lacking zzso zzso to the same extent as zzso whereas zzso had some impairment of its zzso zzso zzso with zzso complex did not restore zzso of zzso zzso activity at all, however, the zzso complex restored zzso to nearly 50% of that obtained with zzso These data provide the first evidence of a significant function of a zzso domain on zzso They also indicate that the structural zzso binding site on zzso is required for zzso zzso of cardiac zzso and that zzso binding to the zzso of zzso is a negative regulator of zzso
