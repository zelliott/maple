We present, to our knowledge, the first complete zzso sequence of a waterfowl zzso goose zzso zzso strain zzso and an analysis of its genetic content in comparison with five published zzso zzso zzso Of the 35 genes predicted to zzso functional zzso the central region of the zzso contains 19 zzso to zzso that were inherited from the zzso of all known zzso Of the remaining zzso nine have zzso only in zzso and seven lack zzso in any zzso We also obtained limited sequence data for a zzso zzso strain zzso zzso analyses placed the two zzso strains zzso in the zzso zzso We propose designating strains zzso and zzso as zzso and zzso zzso
