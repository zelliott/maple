zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso pathogen that is present in the air, soil, animals, and zzso Although zzso zzso is strictly zzso zzso and stationary cells can survive in a zzso stage in the presence of oxygen and/or low zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Indeed, it possesses an zzso response to zzso stress, which can be activated in both zzso and zzso zzso To identify the genes involved in this zzso stress response, zzso zzso strain 13 zzso were generated by zzso zzso zzso and screened for resistance or sensitivity to various zzso zzso Three of the 12 sensitive zzso examined zzso an independently inserted single copy of the zzso in the same zzso as two genes zzso to the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso which zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso experiments and knockout experiments demonstrated that these genes are both required for efficient resistance to zzso stress in zzso zzso and are probably responsible for the production of zzso which is required for maintenance of the zzso zzso balance in zzso zzso Other zzso disrupted genes were also shown to play important roles in the zzso stress zzso This is the first time that some of these genes zzso a gene zzso an zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the gene zzso the zzso iron sulfur zzso zzso have been shown to be involved in the zzso zzso
