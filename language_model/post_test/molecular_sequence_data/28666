Evaluating the potential genetic components of complex disease will likely be aided through the use of dense zzso zzso Previously, we reported evidence for linkage with diabetic zzso on zzso zzso in a region encompassing the type 1 zzso II zzso zzso zzso To further investigate any role for this gene in disease zzso we set out to design a dense zzso map spanning the zzso locus for the purpose of association zzso Toward this goal, we have developed a technique for rapid identification of zzso in long stretches of zzso zzso This approach uses long-range zzso DNA zzso and zzso DNA zzso Using this technique, we efficiently validated and zzso 18 zzso spanning the zzso zzso zzso Our panel of zzso has an average spacing of zzso zzso and an average minor zzso frequency of zzso
