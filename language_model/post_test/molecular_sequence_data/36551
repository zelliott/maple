This paper develops mathematical methods for describing and analyzing zzso secondary zzso It was motivated by the need to develop rigorous yet efficient methods to treat transitions from one secondary structure to another, which we propose here may occur as motions of zzso within zzso having appropriate zzso In this approach a molecular sequence is described as a zzso of the appropriate zzso The concept of zzso between zzso acid sequences is developed, and the 48 possible different types of zzso are zzso Each secondary structure possible for a particular zzso sequence determines a zzso signed zzso zzso The collection of all possible secondary structures is comprised of all zzso of this type whose left zzso with the sequence zzso leaves that zzso zzso A transition between two secondary structures is given by the product of the two corresponding structure zzso This zzso provides an efficient method for describing zzso acid sequences that allows questions relating to secondary structures and transitions to be addressed using the powerful methods of abstract zzso In particular, it zzso the determination of possible secondary structures, including those containing zzso Although this paper concentrates on zzso structure, this zzso also can be applied to zzso
