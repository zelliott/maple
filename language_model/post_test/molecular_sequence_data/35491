The internal transcribed zzso zzso region of nuclear zzso DNA is a common marker not only for the molecular identification of different zzso and zzso but also for the analysis of population structure of wild zzso zzso zzso the zzso nature of this region allows the amplification of zzso samples of the target DNA, a common problem in studies on zzso zzso zzso We zzso ITS sequences from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infecting zzso zzso zzso across several host population zzso We showed that zzso representative zzso zzso identified by statistical zzso network analysis zzso is a suitable method to address relevant zzso The spatial patterns were consistent regardless of whether zzso DNA was extracted from individual hosts or pooled host zzso zzso the efficiency in detecting different sequence types was even higher after sample zzso As shown by simulations, zzso manageable number of sequences from pooled DNA samples are sufficient to resolve the spatial population structure in this zzso In zzso the ITS region zzso from pooled DNA samples can provide valuable insights into the spatial and zzso dynamics of zzso Moreover, the application of zzso analysis is a good alternative to the well-established zzso method zzso for the identification of representative zzso zzso can even outperform NJ by joining most of the singleton sequences to representative sequence zzso
