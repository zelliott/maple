The recent characterization of diverse zzso zzso has revealed the importance of gene zzso in zzso zzso Evidence suggests that a zzso zzso event occurred on the lineage leading to zzso zzso that are often used to understand human zzso The existence of a zzso zzso event zzso the use of fish as a model for human diseases as there are often two fish zzso for a single copy human zzso Often the second zzso has not been zzso Our searches of the near complete zzso and zzso fish zzso indicate that both species have two insulin zzso zzso analysis indicates that the two genes are likely the product of the zzso zzso zzso The maintenance of two insulin genes within the fish suggests that the two genes have different zzso Thus the zzso insulin genes in some fish species may not be complete zzso of the human insulin zzso
