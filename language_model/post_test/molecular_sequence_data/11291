zzso have remarkable sequence diversity, and yet maintain a common zzso In spite of the diversity, there are zzso zzso at several zzso The zzso zzso were examined in terms of the structural stability, by employing the zzso functions of the zzso zzso zzso The fitness of each zzso type to the structural environment was evaluated at seven zzso sites: the zzso (at the B10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found to fit their respective sites due to zzso zzso Pro zzso zzso the zzso edge of an zzso zzso and zzso zzso is stabilized by backbone zzso to zzso zzso On the other hand, the other two zzso His zzso and His zzso are poorly suited to the sites from a structural viewpoint, suggesting that their conservation clearly results from a zzso functional zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to be important for supporting the zzso The present analysis revealed that this zzso is also well suited to the site in terms of zzso
