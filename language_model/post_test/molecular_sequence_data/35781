A family of zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso interacts with DNA sequences in the T cell specific zzso of zzso zzso leukemia virus and in the enhancers of several other zzso A putative zzso binding site was also identified in the T cell specific zzso of the gene zzso the human T cell zzso zzso zzso associated zzso zzso In this study we show that the identified sequence is a strong zzso binding site, and that zzso zzso proteins bind specifically to the zzso We report also that the zzso binding site is important for T cell specific zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso We show that zzso binding sites are present also in the T cell specific enhancers of other zzso of the zzso complex, and that zzso proteins appear to play a central role in the T cell specific expression of this set of zzso
