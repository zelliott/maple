We have previously shown that zzso T4 DNA zzso promotes illegitimate zzso between two zzso DNA zzso or between zzso and zzso DNA in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 83, zzso Since the zzso DNA contains a zzso or zzso it is zzso that the zzso take place between zzso sequences of zzso zzso In this paper, we have examined the sequences of the zzso junctions produced by the zzso between two zzso DNA molecules zzso by T4 DNA zzso We have shown that there is either no zzso or there are zzso pair zzso between the parental zzso in seven combinations of zzso zzso sites, indicating that zzso is not essential for the zzso Next, we have shown an association of the zzso sites with the zzso zzso sites, indicating that a capacity of the zzso to make a transient zzso break in DNA plays a role in the illegitimate zzso A consensus sequence for T4 zzso zzso sites, zzso decreases zzso was zzso The zzso experiment showed that T4 zzso zzso takes place in a zzso pair staggered fashion and produces zzso zzso
