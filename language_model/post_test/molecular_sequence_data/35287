The zzso zzso zzso is the hormonal zzso of zzso which regulates insect growth and zzso In this study, we cloned and characterized two zzso of zzso in zzso zzso named zzso A and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso A and zzso B have open repeating frames of 1,695 and zzso zzso zzso The deduced proteins have the same zzso sequence and varied in zzso and are consistent with reports on other insect species, particularly with the zzso of another zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression profile of zzso in the zzso and the zzso were analyzed with quantitative real-time zzso zzso chain reaction in the zzso zzso zzso interference zzso with common or zzso regions induced zzso zzso When treated in the later zzso stage, zzso with either the common sequence or an zzso A specific sequence caused more severe effects and most larvae died prior to zzso The zzso B specific sequence caused less severe effects and about half of the treated larvae became adults, but some showed zzso zzso zzso with both zzso at early zzso stage attenuated the expression of zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso The study demonstrates the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso response in zzso zzso
