We report here the isolation and characterization of a zzso from mouse zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the protein product of the Syrian zzso zzso zzso The single open reading frame identified in the zzso sequence zzso a protein predicted to have zzso zzso zzso which shared zzso zzso acid identity with the Syrian zzso zzso within the first 412 zzso but had a zzso highly dissimilar zzso Northern and western analyses revealed that zzso zzso and protein were widely distributed in mouse zzso and adult zzso with the highest expression in adults detected in kidney and zzso The mouse zzso zzso was mapped by linkage analysis to within zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso These data should prove valuable in designing studies to define the cellular function of the zzso zzso
