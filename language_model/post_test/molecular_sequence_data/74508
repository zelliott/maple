The metabolism of zzso by gut bacteria plays a key role in the availability and zzso of these compounds in the zzso zzso and zzso are the most common dietary soy zzso While zzso conversion yielding zzso has been known for some time, the corresponding formation of zzso from zzso has not been reported zzso We isolated a strictly zzso zzso zzso from the mouse zzso which converted zzso via zzso to zzso as well as zzso via zzso to zzso zzso zzso was a zzso zzso zzso identified as a member of the zzso zzso zzso also transformed zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso The conversion of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the stationary growth phase depended on zzso with the corresponding zzso indicating zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was transformed even more rapidly in the stationary phase when strain zzso was grown on either zzso or zzso Growing the cells on zzso also enabled conversion of zzso This suggests that the same zzso are involved in the conversion of the two zzso
