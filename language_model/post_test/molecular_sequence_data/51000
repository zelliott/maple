zzso and biological properties of 30 zzso zzso toxins isolated from 18 species of sea zzso zzso are presented and classified into three groups according to their molecular mass, zzso points and the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso zzso toxins (30 zzso from zzso zzso are dissimilar to zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso senile and the group of about 27 predominantly basic zzso having a molecular mass of zzso or 10 zzso inhibited by zzso They are lethal for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities, zzso and zzso properties are zzso at least in part, by forming pores in zzso zzso zzso 1-2 zzso in diameter, formed in zzso zzso zzso are zzso selective and zzso The mechanisms and some characteristics of zzso channel formation by the toxins in the cells as well as in artificial zzso zzso are summarized and discussed in view of the zzso studies of the zzso zzso biological roles of zzso based on their zzso activity, in the capture and killing of zzso zzso zzso of predators and zzso spatial competition are zzso
