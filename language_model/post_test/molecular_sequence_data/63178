Dynamic zzso zzso during the zzso had profound effects on the zzso of species across North zzso Although the role of historical climate change on zzso remains controversial, the impact on genetic variation within species has been well zzso We examined zzso sequences from the zzso b gene zzso zzso and a portion of the zzso gene zzso zzso for zzso individuals of zzso zzso to zzso zzso patterns and population structure and to examine historical demographic patterns in both zzso and zzso regions of North zzso We zzso 14 lineages that replace each other geographically across the United zzso Several of these lineages appear to be confined to specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and traverse previously identified genetic barriers for zzso zzso including the Mississippi and zzso Rivers, the Appalachian zzso and the western zzso zzso We also observed overlapping ranges between some zzso groups and several instances of secondary contact associated with ecological transition zones in eastern South Carolina, southern Oklahoma and central zzso Within the zzso diversification began during the late zzso and continued into the zzso suggesting these lineages zzso the last glacial zzso zzso and zzso demographic analyses indicate that independent lineages currently occupying previously zzso or zzso areas in zzso central and western US underwent zzso population expansion likely from southern zzso during the late zzso zzso zzso southern lineages display patterns consistent with long-term population zzso Such long-term persistence of genetic structure may be due to the competitive effects between lineages or zzso stability in more southern zzso
