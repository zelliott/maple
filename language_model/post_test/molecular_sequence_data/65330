zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides may represent an alternative to zzso for large-scale production of synthetic zzso zzso zzso as a therapeutic zzso In this study, the zzso activity of zzso made with either zzso zzso or its zzso zzso was compared to zzso made with zzso The peptides were zzso with zzso which yielded zzso particles comparable to zzso zzso in diameter, molecular weight, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with either zzso zzso reduced tumor necrosis factor zzso vascular cell zzso zzso expression to the same extent as zzso zzso In an isolated rat heart model of zzso zzso injury, zzso and zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso cardiac zzso dysfunction compared to the saline control, as indicated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso increase of left zzso pressure zzso after zzso and by a zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso decrease of zzso zzso zzso zzso These effects were similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increase of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso release induced by zzso zzso zzso with their zzso effects, all three types of zzso particles zzso an approximate zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction of cardiac tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso content and zzso an approximate zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso release of zzso In zzso zzso and zzso peptides can form zzso particles that retain a similar level of protective activity as zzso zzso on the zzso and the zzso thus, zzso zzso peptides may be useful therapeutic agents for the prevention of cardiac zzso zzso
