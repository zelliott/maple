Human T cell zzso virus type I zzso infection in India has been found to be associated with adult T cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso among zzso residents of southern zzso To examine the zzso of zzso strains from southern India and to determine their relationship with the sequence zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso spanning selected regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were amplified and directly zzso from DNA extracted from whole blood zzso onto filter paper and from peripheral blood zzso cells, obtained from one patient with zzso two with zzso and eight zzso carriers from zzso Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil zzso zzso alignments and comparisons indicated that the 11 zzso strains from southern India were zzso to zzso identical among themselves and zzso to zzso identical to the Japanese zzso zzso zzso The majority of base zzso were transitions and zzso No zzso zzso deletions or possibly zzso base changes were found in the regions zzso The observed zzso of the Indian zzso strains with those from Japan, as determined by the maximum zzso method, suggested a common source of zzso infection with subsequent parallel zzso zzso of DNA from blood specimens collected on filter paper may be useful for the study of other zzso zzso
