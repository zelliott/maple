A major challenge in tissue engineering is to reproduce the native zzso zzso architecture fundamental for zzso zzso Current approaches still lack a network of zzso vessels with native zzso structural zzso Here we present a new method combining zzso zzso zzso cell transfer and gelatin zzso zzso zzso techniques for zzso vascular zzso Human zzso vein cell zzso transfer from zzso zzso surfaces to the zzso revealed two SAM zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The former, occurs zzso to zzso zzso and resulted in efficient zzso zzso zzso The latter, prompted by additional potential application, preserved cell zzso and maintained high transfer efficiency of zzso positive zzso over longer culture zzso This approach was also applied to transfer zzso to zzso zzso defined zzso structures in zzso which were then maintained in zzso culture for 15 zzso As a step toward more complex zzso a zzso zzso layer was zzso around the zzso channel to mimic the vascular smooth muscle structure of zzso zzso This study shows that the zzso of the zzso cell transfer and zzso zzso could potentially open up new avenues in engineering more complex, zzso tissue zzso for zzso medicine and tissue engineering zzso
