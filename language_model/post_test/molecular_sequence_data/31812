zzso transport zzso depends on two zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and B zzso to drive zzso assembly and zzso All six zzso components and their motor zzso zzso have been linked to human skeletal zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso syndrome, and zzso syndrome zzso zzso the 14 zzso in the zzso zzso with the exception of zzso have unknown roles in human zzso To identify additional zzso components defective in zzso we independently performed different zzso zzso zzso sequencing of all zzso genes in zzso individuals with a zzso zzso or zzso zzso in 63 individuals with zzso We thereby detected zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso in 12 zzso All affected individuals displayed abnormalities of the zzso and/or long bones, as well as zzso zzso or retinal involvement, consistent with the diagnosis of zzso or zzso Additionally, zzso zzso or zzso characteristic of zzso syndrome was present in 2 out of 12 zzso zzso from affected individuals showed disturbed zzso zzso suggesting zzso of zzso transport and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso the human zzso and demonstrated a genetic interaction between zzso and zzso In zzso we have identified defects in zzso as a cause of complex zzso and zzso Our findings link the group of skeletal zzso to an additional zzso zzso zzso similar to what has been shown for zzso
