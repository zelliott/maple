In most organisms, efficient zzso zzso requires the highly zzso zzso zzso that converts zzso to zzso zzso However, in some bacterial and zzso species alternative routes of zzso zzso have been zzso In the so-called De zzso pathway, zzso is zzso into zzso and zzso zzso in five consecutive reactions carried out by specific zzso The penultimate step in this zzso involves the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso with zzso serving as a zzso zzso Here, a crystal structure of zzso zzso from zzso zzso determined at zzso resolution is reported, the first structure of an zzso from the De zzso zzso zzso comparison indicates that the zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and sugar zzso family of zzso The protein is composed of two zzso zzso each of which contains a core common to all family zzso Additional elements introduced between zzso structural motifs define the unique features of zzso zzso and possibly determine the biological function of the zzso
