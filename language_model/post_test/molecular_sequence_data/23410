We show that the zzso expression of transcripts zzso soluble zzso chains is determined by zzso sequence zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with low inclusion of the zzso zzso in mature transcripts showed impaired binding to zzso factor 1 zzso indicating that alternative zzso of zzso is controlled by differential zzso recognition early during zzso zzso We also demonstrate that naturally occurring human zzso point zzso that alter zzso and lead to recognizable zzso cluster in zzso and in position zzso relative to zzso implicating impaired zzso interactions in zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso produced smaller fluctuations of zzso inclusion levels than random zzso zzso consistent with a selection against coding zzso that alter their own zzso Finally, zzso zzso in this zzso reporter system was promoted by at least seven zzso proteins and zzso by zzso zzso H and I, supporting an extensive antagonism of factors balancing the zzso site zzso These results provide the molecular basis for the zzso expression of soluble zzso improve prediction of zzso point zzso and indicate how extraordinary, zzso DNA zzso in zzso affects zzso zzso
