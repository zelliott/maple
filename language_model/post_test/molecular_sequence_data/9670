Rice zzso zzso virus zzso replicates only in zzso cells in infected rice plants and its promoter drives strong zzso reporter gene expression in transgenic rice zzso We isolated a zzso zzso a basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which binds to the Box II zzso element that is important for expression from the zzso zzso which stimulates Box zzso zzso in a zzso in zzso zzso system, accumulates in zzso of zzso and certain other cell types in zzso but is found at only very low levels in zzso zzso zzso plants in which zzso zzso was suppressed had normal roots but zzso twisted leaves with small, zzso vascular zzso an enlarged zzso and large air zzso We propose that the zzso promoter exploits a host zzso factor that is critical for leaf tissue differentiation and vascular development for its zzso
