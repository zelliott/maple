The zzso zzso gene family encodes zzso playing crucial roles in zzso zzso Important changes in zzso expression are observed during development, zzso and zzso The most characterized zzso in this gene family are the human zzso zzso and zzso which have core 2 zzso and I branching zzso activities, zzso Recently, zzso was shown to be unique in forming core 2, core 4 zzso and I zzso To date, the zzso gene family has been characterized only in zzso Here, we describe that bovine zzso type 4 zzso encodes a zzso expressed during viral replication and exhibiting all of the core 2, core 4, and I branching zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed an ORF, zzso called zzso zzso a protein zzso exhibiting zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is expressed during zzso zzso zzso of zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells directed the expression of core 2 zzso zzso and I zzso structures on the cell zzso Moreover, a soluble form of zzso had core 4 branching activity in addition to core 2 and I branching zzso Finally, infection of a zzso cell line with zzso induced expression of core 2 zzso zzso This study extends the zzso gene family to a viral gene and provides a model to study the biological functions of a zzso in the context of viral zzso
