zzso zzso zzso is a candidate vaccine zzso for zzso zzso malaria, but knowledge of the evolution of naturally acquired immune responses to zzso in African children is zzso We therefore assessed cellular immune responses to two defined T cell zzso of zzso during and after uncomplicated zzso zzso malaria in a group of zzso zzso In terms of their zzso zzso zzso responses of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso to an zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher when measured during the acute phase compared with zzso zzso responses to the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a similar profile, but at a lower zzso zzso experiments confirmed that zzso T cells are a major source of zzso zzso but both zzso and the production of zzso in response to either of the peptides was low in all children at all zzso zzso from zzso of the children failed to produce zzso in response to either zzso at any zzso The results suggest that zzso producing zzso in response to at least one T cell zzso of zzso are most frequent in the peripheral circulation during the acute phase of zzso zzso zzso Thus, in this case, the zzso suppression of zzso responses which zzso acute malaria does not affect zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings imply that zzso of the frequency of zzso zzso cellular immune responses in clinically healthy individuals may represent significant zzso which has important implications for the design of zzso vaccine zzso zzso
