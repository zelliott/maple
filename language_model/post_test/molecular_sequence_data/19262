zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso production of zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso The rice zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We report a functional characterization of rice zzso which is expressed throughout the plant, with highest expression in zzso especially in zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso interference or zzso results in male zzso zzso a zzso zzso interference construct in zzso plants resulted in complete suppression of both zzso and zzso together with various zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso plays critical roles in plant growth and zzso More importantly, zzso plants contained zzso zzso primary transcripts derived from zzso of the zzso zzso These zzso transcripts undergo zzso zzso in zzso leading to a novel zzso zzso male zzso zzso mother cells zzso of zzso plants appeared normal before zzso but during zzso normal zzso deposition was zzso zzso the zzso began to zzso at the early zzso stage, eventually resulting in complete zzso zzso In addition, the zzso of the zzso and middle layer was zzso These results demonstrate that rice zzso is required for zzso deposition during zzso zzso and bridges the zzso unloading zzso and zzso zzso
