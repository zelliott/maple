zzso are important compounds that contribute to the adaptation of plants to zzso or zzso zzso Among zzso zzso occupies a pivotal position in the plant zzso zzso Previous studies indicated that zzso is derived from the zzso of zzso acid by an unknown zzso step to yield zzso acid, which then zzso spontaneous zzso Based on a recent report of a gene zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso that exhibited zzso zzso zzso activity zzso et zzso zzso we combined a zzso approach and a zzso library screen to identify an zzso zzso zzso zzso number zzso from zzso zzso zzso This zzso shares 59% zzso acid identity with zzso zzso zzso was functionally expressed in zzso coli, and converted zzso zzso into zzso and zzso zzso into zzso with equal zzso Its zzso was further confirmed in zzso transient expression of zzso in zzso zzso yielded plants with leaves containing high levels of zzso and zzso when compared to control plants, which contained barely zzso traces of these zzso The expression of zzso was also tightly correlated to the amount of zzso that was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso in zzso which represents a previously zzso step in the synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso which is an important zzso in zzso was found to be a competitive inhibitor of the zzso and it may exert this effect through negative feedback on the zzso at an upstream position in the zzso
