A critical regulatory element in many promoters transcribed by zzso zzso II is the zzso box, which is located zzso zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso zzso is a zzso defined zzso cell nuclear fraction containing a zzso factor activity that binds specifically to the zzso box and is critical in determining both zzso and regulated promoter zzso Recently, the gene for a zzso protein was cloned and found to bind to various zzso elements and to substitute for zzso in stimulating zzso gene expression in in zzso zzso zzso However, it is possible that additional cellular factors can bind to the zzso element and influence the level of gene zzso By using zzso zzso expression cloning with zzso corresponding to the human zzso virus 1 zzso element, we report the identification of a cellular protein with a calculated molecular mass of 123 zzso that we designate zzso element zzso factor zzso zzso binds to the human zzso virus 1 zzso element in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the viral long terminal repeat by the zzso protein in in zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso acid motifs and exhibits zzso in its DNA binding domain with the zzso DNA binding protein zzso zzso mapping zzso the zzso gene to human zzso zzso which is a site of frequent zzso in lung and zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso factor that likely regulates the expression of both viral and cellular zzso
