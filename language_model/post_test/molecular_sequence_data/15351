Three heat shock protein 70 zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso They were tentatively named as zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses showed that all of the three zzso zzso held the full open reading frame zzso zzso protein sequences and a zzso tree suggested that zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso of deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso showed zzso identity, zzso and zzso showed zzso identity, zzso and zzso showed zzso zzso zzso comparative quantitative zzso revealed that the relative expression of zzso was lower than zzso and zzso at each temperature zzso zzso and zzso shared a similar expression pattern after cold and heat shock compared with their expression at normal temperature zzso degrees zzso but the zzso expression of zzso was significantly higher and lower than that of zzso at cold and heat shock temperatures (except for 34 degrees zzso zzso This result possibly indicated the expression patterns of zzso were affected by their location in different cellular zzso The results also indicated that three zzso especially zzso and zzso may play an important role in zzso tolerance to cold, zzso stress for zzso zzso
