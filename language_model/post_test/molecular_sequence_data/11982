We have investigated the status of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in 32 zzso zzso zzso identified 7 tumors in which the amplified material was zzso of controls and 7 in which was zzso suggesting the occurrence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Single strand zzso zzso analysis identified one zzso but no zzso We also expressed zzso and zzso zzso the zzso and highly zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso human zzso zzso Both zzso either separately or in zzso inhibit significantly the proliferation rate of zzso cells but such zzso is progressively zzso As a whole, the data assign a tumor zzso role to zzso and confirm zzso deletions as the favorite mechanism for the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso
