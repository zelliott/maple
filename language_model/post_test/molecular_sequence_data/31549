zzso zzso requires zzso assembly factors in zzso zzso zzso assembly factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso have sequence similarity to zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that these zzso factors could be zzso that prevent premature assembly of the corresponding zzso proteins to nascent zzso However, we found zzso to be a highly specific component of zzso complexes, revealing that the two proteins can bind simultaneously to zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis experiments showed that zzso binds to the zzso region of zzso zzso at two sites, in zzso III and in a region adjacent to the zzso processing sites C1 and zzso However, zzso binds to mature zzso and zzso zzso and zzso predominantly to zzso zzso within zzso zzso Thus, despite their predicted structural zzso our data show that zzso and zzso clearly bind at different positions on the same zzso zzso Our results also suggest that zzso zzso the formation of the hairpin structure of zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso
