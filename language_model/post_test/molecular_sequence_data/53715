zzso membrane protein 1 zzso of zzso virus zzso is considered to be an zzso because it is crucial for zzso zzso Since a 30 base pair zzso deletion in the zzso portion of the zzso gene was found in a zzso cell line derived from zzso zzso containing zzso an association between zzso viral genetic zzso and zzso has been zzso In this study we have analyzed zzso DNA isolated from 10 Japanese patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso In all zzso patients, we found the 30 zzso deletion and zzso repeats of the sequence zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, detailed zzso acid zzso sequence analysis revealed that 7 zzso zzso identical to those found in zzso but not in zzso cell zzso were found in all the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso activated zzso significantly more than that of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso from all of our zzso cases shared common genetic characteristics with zzso obtained from the zzso cell line, which is distinct from the zzso zzso isolated from the zzso cell zzso These data suggest that the zzso changes of the zzso gene may play an important role in the zzso of these fatal zzso zzso
