Major group zzso bind zzso zzso zzso 1 and minor group zzso bind members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family for cell zzso Whereas the former share common sequence motives in their viral zzso proteins zzso in the latter only a zzso zzso within the binding zzso in zzso is zzso this zzso is also present in zzso major group zzso that fail to use zzso for zzso By using the available sequences three-dimensional models of zzso of all zzso were built and binding zzso with respect to module 3 of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso Based on the predicted affinities zzso zzso and minor group zzso were correctly zzso
