zzso a 100 zzso zzso is necessary for the normal development and function of zzso neural zzso In zzso it is necessary for the zzso of synaptic zzso and in other cell types zzso has a general and important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso Different zzso function as molecular scissors either during the formation of coated zzso from plasma membrane coated pits, or during the release of zzso zzso from donor zzso The mechanism zzso the formation of a zzso zzso zzso at the neck of the budding zzso followed by neck zzso through a zzso zzso dependent zzso The primary sequence of zzso contains several zzso zzso binding zzso zzso a central zzso zzso zzso domain, and an zzso zzso zzso Each of these zzso appears to play a distinct role in zzso zzso zzso is activated by stimulus coupled zzso zzso in brain, possibly zzso through zzso interactions with the zzso zzso Further, zzso domain interactions with the zzso sequences and zzso beta gamma interactions with the zzso domain also increase zzso zzso zzso Each of these various regulatory mechanisms is important in zzso function during zzso zzso although the means by which these mechanisms integrate in the overall function of zzso remains to be zzso
