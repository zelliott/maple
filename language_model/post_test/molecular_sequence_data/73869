Upon infection of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso are formed on roots and zzso Stem zzso develop from abundantly distributed dormant root zzso To acquire more insight into the zzso organization during stem zzso development, the expression patterns of a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso gene zzso and a zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso were followed by in zzso zzso zzso transcripts were found in all cells of zzso and infected root zzso In zzso root zzso zzso transcripts were detected in a few cells of the zzso root zzso whereas zzso transcripts were abundant in this zzso Interestingly, after zzso with zzso zzso zzso transcripts disappeared in the root zzso and a zzso pattern of zzso and zzso expression appeared in the zzso of the root zzso reflecting the formation of zzso zzso zzso When bacterial invasion started, a zzso zzso zzso was zzso wherein zzso and zzso expression was zzso zzso 1 week after zzso zzso activity zzso indicated by the loss of zzso and zzso zzso
