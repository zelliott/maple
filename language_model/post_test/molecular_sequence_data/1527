zzso is the primary factor zzso the expression of the class II zzso genes necessary for the zzso zzso of zzso processing and zzso zzso control of zzso is necessary to regulate zzso class II gene expression and induction of an immune zzso We show in this study that the nuclear localized form of zzso is a predominantly zzso form of the zzso whereas zzso zzso is predominantly zzso Novel zzso sites were determined to be located within a region that contains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Double zzso of these zzso increased nuclear zzso indicating that these sites are not required for nuclear zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso class II zzso but did not significantly enhance zzso from a zzso class II promoter, indicating that these zzso sites may be important for gene zzso from intact zzso rather than artificial zzso zzso These data suggest a model for zzso function in which zzso of these specific sites in zzso in the nucleus serves to zzso zzso zzso
