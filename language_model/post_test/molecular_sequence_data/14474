The zzso position of a zzso zzso isolated from a hay meadow soil was determined using a zzso zzso The zzso had chemical and zzso characteristics consistent with its zzso in the zzso zzso and formed a distinct branch between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso values between the isolate and its nearest zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The isolate was also readily distinguished from the type strains of these species using a combination of zzso and other zzso zzso On the basis of these results, it is proposed that isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso be classified as the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso
