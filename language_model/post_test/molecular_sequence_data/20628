The seven zzso zzso of G zzso receptors zzso are the hallmark of this zzso zzso interactions are critical to zzso assembly and, for the zzso zzso that binds small zzso zzso zzso Most research has focused on identifying the zzso binding pocket within the zzso zzso whereas the role of the zzso zzso remains zzso zzso modeling of the zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso loop 2 zzso however, suggests that zzso is poised for key zzso To test this possibility, we employed zzso scanning zzso of zzso zzso and identified two distinct regions critical for zzso zzso G protein zzso activity, and zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the N zzso of zzso zzso zzso were retained in the zzso zzso and did not bind the zzso zzso zzso or the inverse zzso zzso In contrast, the C zzso of zzso zzso zzso and inverse zzso the zzso zzso and zzso receptors exhibited diminished binding for several zzso but bound inverse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso involving substitution in the zzso zzso displayed both impaired zzso and zzso zzso Other zzso acid zzso at position 268 revealed that highly zzso zzso are required to accomplish both zzso It is noteworthy that a zzso zzso was zzso to the cell surface yet displayed differential binding preference for inverse zzso comparable with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The findings are consistent with a dual role for zzso in stabilizing zzso assembly and in zzso zzso
