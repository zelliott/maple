The distinctive zzso shape of zzso allows assembly into zzso zzso during the process of zzso zzso zzso We have used random and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso heavy chain gene zzso to characterize regions which determine zzso zzso and binding to the zzso light chain zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso indicates that zzso in the zzso domain at the zzso zzso as well as zzso in the adjacent leg domain, frequently influence zzso zzso zzso one zzso in the zzso domain enhances the association of zzso with zzso Additional zzso in the zzso domain, in combination with zzso in the adjacent leg domain, exhibit severe defects in zzso binding while maintaining near normal zzso zzso The position of these zzso domain zzso on one face of a putative zzso defines a region on the zzso surface that interacts directly with zzso These results suggest that zzso extends into the zzso zzso domain from the adjacent leg, thereby bridging the two zzso On the basis of this conclusion, we propose a new model for the organization of the zzso zzso which provides a structural basis for regulatory effects of zzso on zzso zzso
