zzso was the first zzso example of the zzso and toxin zzso zzso protein family to be zzso Human zzso zzso is predominantly expressed and localized to the zzso zzso of the urinary zzso and zzso zzso and mediates zzso zzso zzso of toxic organic zzso zzso into urine and zzso zzso M, zzso zzso Morimoto zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso zzso zzso a mouse zzso zzso is also predominantly expressed in kidney and liver, although its transport properties are not yet zzso In the present study, we investigated the transport properties and zzso of zzso Upon expression of this protein in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange and showed a zzso specificity similar to that of zzso zzso techniques with specific zzso against zzso combined with zzso revealed that zzso is also expressed in various cells, including brain zzso cells and zzso pancreatic duct cells, urinary zzso zzso adrenal zzso cortex, alpha cells of the zzso of zzso zzso cells, and vitamin zzso Ito zzso These results indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso The unexpectedly wide distribution of zzso suggests involvement of this zzso protein in diverse biological functions other than zzso of zzso from the zzso
