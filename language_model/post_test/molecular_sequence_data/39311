In both humans and mice, zzso zzso zzso zzso was described as possessing dual zzso zzso The zzso was first shown to be able to convert zzso to zzso in zzso Later involvement of this zzso in zzso cholesterol zzso was zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and could be proven in zzso In this work, we performed a detailed analysis of the zzso regulation of both the human and zzso zzso Despite relatively low sequence zzso both promoters contain similar contexts of zzso zzso zzso The participation of these sites in zzso regulation of zzso was proven by zzso shift zzso and zzso zzso of the corresponding binding zzso We describe novel involvement of vitamin D zzso X zzso and provide new information on the regulation of zzso expression by zzso regulatory zzso protein and zzso nuclear factor 4, the latter known from other genes of zzso zzso The results of our study provide unequivocal evidence for a role of zzso in cholesterol zzso
