zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein and a member of a large family that plays a critical role in the cellular zzso of all zzso In this report, we describe a novel zzso protein identified and cloned from zzso This zzso zzso acid protein possesses a zinc finger domain with a tandem array of four zzso zinc finger motifs at its zzso and a zzso domain that shares a zzso zzso with zzso The gene maps to zzso 3 at position zzso Further characterization of this protein shows that it zzso to the zzso of fly cells and is expressed through all stages of fly embryonic zzso It binds to zzso zzso beads in zzso These results indicate that this new protein belongs to the zzso family, thus named a zzso zzso zzso zinc finger protein zzso
