To zzso the zzso role of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a local mediator, we examined the production of zzso in the rat zzso The content of zzso in the kidney was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso wet weight and the major molecular form of zzso was zzso An established cell line from the rat zzso zzso cell, zzso zzso at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was detected in the rat kidney and zzso cell utilizing reverse zzso chain reaction zzso On the other hand, zzso in the rat kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso wet zzso had the molecular form of zzso but zzso zzso was not detected by zzso No zzso zzso was found in the rat zzso although zzso zzso was detected by zzso These results indicate that only zzso among the zzso peptides is produced in significant amounts in the rat kidney under normal zzso conditions and that zzso zzso cells may produce zzso
