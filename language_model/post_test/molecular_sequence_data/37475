zzso is a cause gene for zzso dominant zzso zzso and possesses eight alternative zzso zzso Here, we identified two zzso of zzso proteins in zzso cells and examined their zzso zzso and complex zzso zzso shows that zzso cells mainly express zzso 7 and 1 of zzso Since the third zzso site is mainly zzso in zzso cells, the predicted molecular masses of their processed proteins are consistent with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso examinations indicate that both of the zzso zzso are present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso protein predominantly associates with the zzso outer zzso on the contrary, the zzso protein associates with the inner zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that they compose the different molecular mass complexes in zzso These differences between two zzso of zzso would suggest their crucial role involved in the zzso membrane zzso
