A human zzso clone designated zzso isolated from an X zzso library was found to have a zzso zzso zzso zzso symbolized as zzso within a zzso human DNA zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso has an identity of zzso with about 300 zzso at the zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso is flanked by a pair of perfect direct repeats of 16 zzso the hallmark characteristic of a processed zzso having been integrated into the zzso The structural element has a long zzso tract at its zzso apparently the result of an zzso zzso event of a zzso zzso I transcript, prior to its subsequent reverse zzso and zzso into the zzso An zzso repeat sequence truncated by 80 zzso at the zzso occurs about 800 base pairs downstream and is of opposite orientation to zzso The zzso element is bounded by zzso direct repeats and is a member of the zzso Y zzso
