zzso are enigmatic zzso organisms sharing zzso features with zzso zzso and zzso This, coupled with their highly divergent gene zzso has greatly obscured their zzso zzso Here we report the sequencing and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso domain zzso architecture and zzso organization similar to group 1 zzso zzso zzso predicted similar three-dimensional structures to zzso zzso despite zzso from the zzso pattern of group 1 zzso The discovery of this zzso gene strongly supports zzso as zzso that have radiated as zzso of zzso marine and zzso zzso It also reveals novel protein sequence variation of relevance to understanding the evolution of zzso complexity, and indicates a zzso link between zzso polar capsules and zzso zzso Our study is the first to illustrate the power of using genes related to a zzso novelty for zzso zzso within the zzso and it exemplifies how the evolutionary relationships of other zzso characterized by extreme sequence divergence could be similarly zzso
