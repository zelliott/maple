zzso of zzso D1 expression is a critical feature of growth zzso cell proliferation in zzso To clarify the mechanisms regulating zzso D1 gene zzso we isolated the rat zzso D1 gene and analyzed the zzso regulatory elements in rat zzso cells and primary cultured rat zzso Two zzso regulatory regions were zzso One was mapped to a zzso element zzso at position zzso and was occupied by a zzso protein zzso resulting in zzso D1 zzso Another zzso located at zzso revealed high zzso with binding sites for the zzso family, the zzso nuclear zzso or the nuclear factor of activated T zzso However, zzso did not interact with these nuclear factors and specific interaction with a protein extracted from growth zzso rat zzso in primary zzso These results indicate that zzso binds to the zzso and mediates zzso of the zzso D1 promoter, and suggest that zzso may be possibly occupied by a protein induced by growth factors in zzso
