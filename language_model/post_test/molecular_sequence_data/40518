zzso zzso proteins are zzso inserted into either the zzso zzso zzso the zzso outer zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins enable their many essential cellular functions by specifying the membrane target, but how cells process these targeting signals is poorly zzso Here, we reveal the composition zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition complex zzso and show that distinct zzso zzso recognize the two types of zzso zzso By engineering zzso in a zzso zzso we switch over its zzso zzso recognition, thus leading to its zzso into the zzso zzso zzso with zzso components demonstrates that zzso zzso and zzso activates zzso to selectively hand off zzso zzso proteins to zzso Thus, zzso zzso proteins are sorted at the top of a zzso zzso cascade that culminates with the formation of zzso protein complexes, which are recruited to the zzso membrane for zzso
