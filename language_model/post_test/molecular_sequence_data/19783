zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso has an apparent melting temperature zzso of zzso degrees zzso To identify the structural features involved in zzso stabilization of zzso the structure was solved to zzso A zzso zzso was zzso similar to zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso and displayed almost the same number of zzso pairs and zzso zzso However, two unique zzso networks were present in zzso one zzso zzso network between the large and the small domain and one zzso zzso network between the zzso and the small zzso The latter zzso network was presumably reduced in size when the zzso domain of zzso was swapped with that of zzso and the T zzso decreased by 18 degrees zzso zzso zzso was only stabilized by 4 degrees C by the zzso domain of zzso a result probably due to the introduction of a unique zzso aromatic cluster in zzso that may strengthen the zzso interface in this zzso A unique aromatic cluster was identified close to the zzso of zzso that could provide additional stabilization of this zzso Common and unique heat zzso traits of zzso with those recently observed for zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are discussed zzso
