The zzso sequence corresponding to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in early region C was determined zzso zzso zzso One of the five major zzso interruptions zzso of zzso zzso DNA was identified at zzso The zzso region was zzso and the putative functions of some open reading frames were proposed by comparison with zzso The zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was identified using a previously defined zzso zzso acid zzso The gene was cloned and expressed in zzso coli, the zzso was zzso to zzso with high yield using two alternative methods, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to have the same activity and specificity as the native zzso
