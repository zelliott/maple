zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso regulated during the development of zzso zzso zzso To better define regulatory elements involved in this process, zzso zzso were made in the zzso 86 zzso muscle specific zzso zzso expression zzso in skeletal muscle zzso cells indicated that all three zzso plus a novel sequence outside the zzso are necessary for full activity of the zzso gene in zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that zzso in the zzso sequence disrupted the formation of two zzso complexes while not affecting zzso zzso zzso interference zzso confirmed that the complexes form at zzso within the zzso region, and also include part of the central zzso zzso zzso of nuclear proteins to a DNA probe identified five proteins of zzso 81, 55, 42, and 35 zzso that bind to this zzso with the 125 zzso protein being zzso bound in zzso zzso zzso during the transition from zzso to zzso These data suggest that interactions between this DNA element and the five proteins contribute to the zzso control of the zzso zzso gene expression during the differentiation of skeletal zzso
