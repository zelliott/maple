The zzso function of a zzso sequence zzso to zzso of the promoter of the wheat gene for zzso zzso zzso was analyzed in cultured rice and tobacco cells in a transient expression system with the gene for zzso as a reporter zzso The zzso sequence was necessary for full activity of the zzso promoter in rice cells but did not enhance the activity of the zzso promoter in tobacco zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sequence revealed the existence of several positive and negative zzso sequences in this region, some of which functioned differently in rice and tobacco zzso In zzso experiments with rice cells, the sequence from zzso to zzso containing the zzso and zzso zzso zzso functioned in an zzso manner, whereas the sequence from zzso to zzso functioned in an zzso zzso By contrast, both sequences exhibited an zzso zzso in tobacco zzso These findings suggest that some zzso sequences in the zzso region of the zzso promoter function differently in rice and tobacco zzso
