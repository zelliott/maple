The complete primary structure of a zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso album zzso has been determined by combining classical zzso degradation methodology with advanced mass zzso zzso The same integrated approach allowed correction of the sequence of zzso zzso and definition of the pattern of the zzso zzso The arrangement of the zzso pairing was determined as zzso zzso and zzso The primary structure of zzso A1 shares a high degree of similarity with the known zzso and more generally with the plant zzso and zzso The pattern of zzso bridges determined for zzso zzso and A1 is similar to that zzso by X-ray and zzso analysis in zzso and related to that present in zzso and zzso thus indicating a highly zzso organization of the zzso pairings within the entire zzso This arrangement of zzso bridges describes a peculiar structural zzso indicated as zzso zzso which is suggested to stabilize a common structure occurring in various small proteins able to interact with cell zzso The distribution of the new zzso toxin in different zzso subspecies was zzso zzso A1 is abundant in the seeds of the three European subspecies of zzso album whereas it represents a minor component in the zzso
