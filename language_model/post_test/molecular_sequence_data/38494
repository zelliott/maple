We have assessed the potential of using the spliced leader zzso or zzso gene as a marker for molecular zzso analysis of zzso zzso A total of 27 zzso sequences were zzso 18 of these being newly zzso In contrast to zzso zzso we found the zzso zzso region of the zzso locus in zzso to be far too variable for zzso comparison of all but the most closely related zzso At the other extreme, the short zzso zzso zzso zzso was usually completely zzso and hence zzso The zzso zzso showed variation in both length zzso zzso and sequence among different zzso species, with most variation occurring in zzso zzso zzso this region could not be aligned with confidence in multiple sequence zzso severely reducing the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso In computer zzso most of the zzso zzso readily folded into the 3 zzso secondary structure predicted zzso but again zzso II was highly zzso No obvious correlation could be seen between the length of this zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso repeat is not an zzso zzso marker for long range evolutionary studies of zzso zzso
