Treatment of bovine zzso zzso zzso with zzso results in zzso between zzso zzso and between zzso indicating that this region is exposed in the native zzso of zzso Two main fragments are generated, one large including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one small, zzso zzso The small zzso is not stable, but is further zzso by the zzso zzso zzso has full zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso while the activity against zzso of zzso zzso and against zzso is reduced and the activity against milk fat zzso and zzso is zzso Several properties of zzso were zzso It was found that zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso as efficiently as intact zzso The truncated zzso bound to zzso and to zzso of zzso zzso as well as the intact zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not bind to milk fat zzso or to zzso The activity of zzso was more sensitive to zzso by other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than was the intact zzso The affinity for zzso was as high with zzso as with intact zzso Like intact zzso zzso is zzso in its active form, as evidenced by zzso density zzso zzso It is concluded that the reduced zzso and zzso properties of zzso compared with intact zzso are related to the properties of the zzso zzso It is speculated that the zzso part of zzso contains a secondary zzso site, which is important for activity against zzso and related zzso
