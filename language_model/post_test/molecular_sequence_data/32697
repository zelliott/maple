zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso contributes to zzso transformation and zzso We studied molecular zzso of benefit from zzso therapies in patients with cancer of unknown primary zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso of 50 patients with zzso were stained for zzso protein by zzso zzso chain reaction amplification, zzso zzso zzso and direct sequencing were used to study zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso repeat length as well as zzso 18, 19, 21 zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso protein but only six zzso zzso Regarding zzso 1 CA repeat zzso we detected five zzso with CA repeat numbers zzso zzso 16 being the most common zzso All samples were zzso the zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso Five samples had three zzso 1 zzso and were associated with zzso zzso in zzso of zzso There was no evidence of zzso zzso 18, 19, 21 zzso Two zzso were zzso zzso 21 zzso C zzso zzso a silent zzso zzso zzso and a G zzso A substitution in sequences zzso zzso 19 zzso + zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso protein expression nor CA repeat length were zzso factors for zzso 

Our data depict absence of molecular zzso of benefit from zzso zzso in patients with zzso Study of its molecular zzso and targeting other molecular pathways may be warranted zzso
