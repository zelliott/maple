zzso zzso are presented to zzso T zzso zzso by zzso major zzso complex zzso zzso zzso of the zzso processed viral peptides zzso to their specific zzso molecules is an early zzso event in the recognition process and is necessary for subsequent killing of zzso cells by zzso zzso It is now well established that interaction between a viral zzso zzso and zzso is dependent on the primary structure zzso and zzso acid zzso of that zzso Here we show, using the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus as a model, that the secondary structure zzso of the viral sequence also plays a crucial role in the binding of a viral zzso to zzso zzso and in its subsequent presentation to zzso zzso
