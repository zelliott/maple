A zzso zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated using zzso zzso zzso The gene structure was determined and compared to that of several zzso zzso cloned from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene consists of 16 coding zzso with zzso promoter zzso and zzso elements in the zzso The corresponding zzso zzso zzso was cloned and contains an zzso of zzso base pairs zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular weight of 72 zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated and expressed zzso in zzso coli yielding 15 U zzso activity per zzso of induced zzso zzso alignment and zzso analysis were performed and are zzso
