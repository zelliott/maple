The zzso zzso zzso specific expression of the zzso gene was determined in 7 human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Two zzso zzso complementary to bases zzso of human zzso zzso with a single zzso difference in the third position of zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso using terminal zzso zzso The zzso zzso was visually detected in zzso using zzso zzso (AP) zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was steady in zzso and zzso cells zzso from African zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso from Japanese zzso expressed only the zzso zzso zzso zzso The transcripts of the zzso gene were zzso in zzso cells zzso from an American zzso zzso of the zzso zzso specific zzso were specific to the zzso zzso since the cells that expressed zzso gene zzso were stained in the zzso only by differential zzso with a zzso zzso specific zzso moreover, zzso with a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso showed nuclear zzso Thus, detection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by differential in zzso zzso is a specific method for studying the zzso expression of the zzso gene in liver zzso at the cellular level, while simultaneously visualizing the cell zzso The results also support the notion that the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso may have zzso implications involving zzso from various geographic zzso
