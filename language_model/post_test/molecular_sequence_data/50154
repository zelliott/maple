Pepper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso clones were isolated from pepper leaves zzso with zzso strain zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso disappeared 18 to 30 h after the bacterial infection when the hypersensitive response zzso was zzso In contrast, zzso activity reached a peak at 18 h after infection and then declined at 24 and 30 h when zzso zzso level was zzso These results suggest that the striking zzso of zzso and strong decrease in zzso activity during the programmed cell death may be due to the strong suppression of zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso also induced the expression of the three putative zzso genes in pepper zzso zzso zzso were in zzso localized in zzso areas of vascular zzso in pepper zzso infected by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso strongly induced the zzso and zzso zzso 1 h after treatment, while the zzso transcripts accumulated 12 h after zzso zzso We suggest that pepper zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes may function as regulators of zzso level and total zzso activity in the zzso burst during the zzso to incompatible pathogen interaction in pepper zzso
