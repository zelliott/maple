A rat zzso A zzso clone was isolated from a zzso zzso library representing newborn rat skin zzso by screening with a synthetic zzso designed from zzso acid sequence zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The obtained clone contained a partial coding region of the zzso lacking the zzso region and coding sequence for the zzso 13 zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the base zzso zzso coincided with that determined at the zzso acid zzso To obtain the zzso zzso A zzso the DNA was fused with a synthetic zzso zzso its missing zzso 17 zzso and introduced into an expression zzso zzso In zzso coli, however, the expression level of the zzso gene was low, zzso 5 zzso of the zzso zzso protein per 1 liter culture being zzso zzso of the zzso usage of the zzso region in a zzso expression system led to an increase in the yield depending on the instability of the putative secondary structure around an initiation zzso of the zzso The expressed zzso A showed identical characteristics with the authentic form except for the absence of the zzso zzso blocking zzso Using the expression system, two kinds of point zzso the conservative zzso in the first loop zzso region being changed to zzso and zzso were introduced, but there was almost no effect on the zzso activity toward zzso This suggests that the zzso Val in the zzso site is not restricted and that the zzso of the position is not essential for the activity of rat zzso zzso
