The zzso A crystal structure of the zzso alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2 zzso zzso protein of methane zzso from zzso zzso zzso reveals the geometry of the zzso zzso zzso The two iron atoms are bridged by zzso hydroxide and zzso zzso and further coordinated by four zzso zzso two zzso zzso and a water zzso The zzso iron zzso lies in a zzso zzso cavity for binding zzso An extended canyon runs between alpha beta pairs, which have many long zzso for possible zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins required for zzso
