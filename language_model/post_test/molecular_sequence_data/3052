We have cloned a zzso zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso strain isolated from the brain of a zzso zzso encephalitis zzso A DNA probe for an zzso zzso zzso library screening was amplified by zzso using zzso zzso zzso designed on the basis of zzso zzso acids zzso the active sites of zzso and zzso zzso that are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso was composed of 330 zzso acids with signal zzso a proposed zzso and a predicted active site made up of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis indicates that zzso belong to zzso zzso of C1 zzso By Northern zzso analysis, no direct correlation was observed between zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso but the gene was expressed at higher level in zzso isolated from soil than zzso from clinical zzso These findings raise the possibility that zzso protein may play a role in protein metabolism and zzso of zzso bacteria or host tissue debris rather than in invasion of zzso into host zzso
