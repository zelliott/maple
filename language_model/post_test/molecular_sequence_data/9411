Type 2 diabetes results from zzso regulation of the zzso cascade in zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso has not been examined zzso except with regard to zzso zzso using zzso Thus, zzso comprehensive zzso strategies are needed to characterize the many zzso proteins that exist, because of their low zzso the low zzso of zzso and the dynamic regulation of zzso In this study, we attempted to generate data on a large-scale zzso from the zzso rat pancreatic zzso line using linear zzso trap zzso To profile the zzso zzso we used comprehensive zzso strategies, including zzso protein extraction zzso and zzso differential sample preparation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enrichment, and zzso replicate analyses zzso and zzso zzso All zzso were processed and validated by stringent multiple filtering using target and decoy zzso We identified zzso distinct zzso sites on zzso zzso using 4 zzso of zzso cell zzso in 24 zzso runs, of which zzso zzso were considered novel zzso sites that have not been characterized in human, zzso or rat zzso Our zzso data constitute a rich zzso resource for investigating the function of zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso In particular, novel zzso sites on proteins that mediate the pathology of type 2 diabetes, such as zzso zzso and zzso will be valuable targets in ongoing zzso zzso
