We have recently reported novel short zzso (six and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso promoter and their association with higher zzso and protein zzso The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that these insertions directly affect zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso human cell lines were zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso promoter fragments positioned upstream of the zzso zzso reporter zzso The cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor zzso Compared to zzso both zzso insertions zzso and zzso were associated with increased promoter zzso Although zzso zzso zzso showed that there are zzso binding sites in the zzso promoter, zzso mobility shift zzso showed that it is unlikely that these sites are in the region harboring these zzso These results provide further evidence for the biological effect of zzso promoter zzso on gene zzso
