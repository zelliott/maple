To investigate the distribution of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

DNA was extracted from zzso unrelated healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were typed using zzso technique followed by high zzso zzso PAGE with silver zzso at the same time the zzso products were cloned and zzso 

Thirteen zzso and zzso kinds of zzso were detected at the zzso zzso two zzso and three kinds of zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso information contents zzso were zzso and zzso respectively no zzso from zzso equilibrium was zzso zzso analysis showed that the distribution of zzso zzso zzso in Chinese Han population was significantly different from that in European Caucasian or in Japanese zzso The result of sequencing revealed that the copy number of zzso repeats within the same zzso zzso was not consistent with that in the reports from western zzso 

There exists ethnic difference in the distribution of zzso zzso Further investigations will be necessary to define more accurately and clearly the zzso zzso
