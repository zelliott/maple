Point zzso in the zzso of the zzso alcohol zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to affect either the import of the precursor protein into zzso zzso in zzso or its processing within the zzso In the present work, the behavior of these zzso during in zzso import into isolated zzso was zzso All point zzso tested were imported with a slower initial rate than that of the zzso zzso This zzso was corrected when the precursors were treated with zzso prior to zzso Once zzso the extent of processing to the mature form of zzso precursors varied greatly and correlated well with the defects observed in zzso This result was not affected by prior zzso zzso When zzso extracts enriched for the processing zzso were used, this zzso was shown to be due to failure of the zzso to efficiently recognize or cleave the zzso rather than to a lack of access to the zzso The rate of import of two zzso III precursors bearing internal deletions in the leader sequence was similar to those of the point zzso whereas a deletion leading to the removal of the 15 zzso zzso acids was poorly zzso The mature zzso zzso of zzso zzso III was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso which reduced the efficiency of zzso in zzso by zzso was zzso at the correct zzso
