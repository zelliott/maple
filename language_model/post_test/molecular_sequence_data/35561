We have generated zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso that are not neutralized by zzso zzso zzso in zzso These zzso are attractive for the advancement of vaccine products because of their potential for inducing robust zzso immune responses in people with prior exposure to zzso However, zzso zzso zzso displayed an approximate zzso growth zzso in zzso cells, making potential vaccine costs unacceptably zzso zzso zzso regions zzso 1, 2, 4, and 5 with the equivalent zzso from zzso was sufficient to avoid zzso zzso immunity and retain full vaccine zzso However, the resulting zzso displayed the same growth zzso as the zzso zzso carrying all 9 zzso from zzso The growth zzso is likely due to a zzso in zzso zzso since DNA replication and late protein zzso were normal in these zzso We determined that the zzso zzso have a zzso zzso zzso and selected zzso that restored zzso zzso Genome sequencing identified a single base change resulting in a zzso zzso acid substitution at the position equivalent to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso has a zzso zzso zzso since cloning it into our zzso zzso containing all nine zzso regions from zzso zzso increased yields over the version without the SP zzso This growth improvement was also shown for an zzso zzso zzso that carried the zzso zzso regions of zzso indicating that the SP zzso may have broad zzso for improving the productivity of different zzso zzso
