Organic zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins essential to zzso zzso zzso are zzso by a group of related zzso As yet there have been no studies of the zzso regulation of this important gene zzso While such studies have traditionally been zzso comparative zzso approaches are now available that have proven reliable guides to critical regulatory zzso We report here the zzso sequencing of zzso zzso (the zzso of which was originally cloned by us as zzso and zzso zzso and derivation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by comparison to the human zzso We find binding sites within these zzso for several zzso factors implicated in kidney development, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, we note that zzso and zzso occur in the human and mouse zzso as tightly linked pairs zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 2, zzso and 2, zzso and 4) that are also close zzso relations, with zzso and 2, and zzso the only zzso family zzso Finally, we find that zzso have similar tissue zzso suggesting that the pairing might exist to facilitate the zzso of the genes within each zzso
