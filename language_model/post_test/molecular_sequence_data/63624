A zzso approach was taken to investigate the genetic basis for the ability of an zzso consortium to grow on either zzso or zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed for the family of zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso to screen a zzso library and two overlapping clones were identified which yield a zzso zzso The complete sequence of one zzso clone was determined and genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Analysis of the zzso present in the zzso sequence suggests that the zzso clone originated from an zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso Interestingly, unlike similar gene clusters reported in zzso a gene zzso zzso zzso was not present in the gene zzso This suggests that zzso is further zzso via the zzso reduction zzso in the corresponding zzso instead of through zzso zzso to yield zzso
