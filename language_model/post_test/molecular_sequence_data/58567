zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein of the zzso zzso The gene zzso this protein zzso protein A, zzso was recently cloned and it was shown to be unique in zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso with other zzso zzso and a zzso domain zzso zzso corresponding to 27 additional zzso resembling a zzso zzso Various zzso proteins consisting of the entire zzso zzso the A domain, or the B domain were produced independently as proteins fused to zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso binding properties of the various zzso and zzso proteins allowed us to conclude that zzso binds zzso zzso by means of its zzso zzso zzso exhibited a high and specific affinity for zzso zzso in comparison with its affinity for other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dialysis experiments revealed that zzso binds zzso zzso with an apparent zzso constant zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso per zzso The analysis of the deduced zzso zzso acid sequences zzso by 35 independent clinical zzso demonstrated the existence of two molecular zzso of zzso zzso a major and a minor zzso present in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The two zzso differed from each other by the simultaneous substitution of seven zzso acids within the B domain, whilst the A domain was highly zzso amongst all the zzso proteins zzso zzso On the basis of zzso studies, the highly zzso A domain of zzso was found to be the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed to test the properties of the two zzso zzso When zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster in zzso coli cells, the two zzso zzso genes led to a fourfold increase in zzso activity, demonstrating that zzso in zzso zzso has a specialized function with regard to the zzso zzso zzso
