For the sea cucumber zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was identified using rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso is composed of zzso with a zzso open reading frame zzso that encodes a zzso of 205 zzso acids with a zzso signal zzso and a zzso zzso zzso domain zzso The calculated molecular mass of the whole protein is zzso and its predicted zzso point is zzso zzso belongs to the group zzso of regulatory proteins and it might function as a zzso zzso binding zzso specifically and recognizing zzso zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated that the expression of zzso was located in the body wall, zzso muscles, zzso and respiratory zzso This became apparent especially in the zzso of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso data suggested that zzso was mostly zzso in the zzso muscles and zzso and less pronounced in the respiratory tree and body wall of zzso After zzso stimulation by zzso zzso at increasing bacterial concentration zzso the expression of zzso in sea cucumber increased as zzso This indicated that zzso is related to an innate immune zzso
