The production of soluble forms of zzso zzso gamma R by cells expressing zzso or natural membrane zzso gamma zzso and the structural relationships between these soluble receptors and membrane zzso gamma zzso are zzso We show that zzso zzso soluble zzso gamma zzso corresponding to the two zzso zzso of zzso gamma zzso and binding to zzso are spontaneously produced in zzso by zzso of membrane zzso gamma zzso Moreover, we describe methods to produce and purify to zzso large quantities of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso from the culture medium of a cell line zzso with a zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso These methods include the use of zzso for zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso By using such procedures, about zzso zzso of zzso were zzso from 1 liter of culture medium of zzso zzso Like natural zzso the zzso pure zzso zzso in a zzso manner, secondary in zzso zzso zzso responses to sheep red blood zzso
