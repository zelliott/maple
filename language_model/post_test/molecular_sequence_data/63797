The zzso zzso zzso zzso causes zzso disease on zzso crops and the model plant zzso zzso zzso pierce the host zzso and cell wall to form specialized zzso zzso inside living zzso zzso To identify proteins zzso by zzso that may function as zzso zzso a zzso library was prepared from mature zzso formed in zzso zzso sequencing of zzso clones generated zzso high-quality expressed sequence tags zzso zzso 518 unique zzso zzso analysis showed that 353 zzso zzso of these had significant similarity to entries in the zzso zzso protein database, of which 49 were also zzso to zzso verified zzso zzso zzso zzso were predicted zzso zzso from the unique sequences and screened for potential signal peptides using zzso zzso unique sequences (10 zzso were predicted to zzso proteins entering the zzso pathway, of which 26 were likely to be soluble zzso zzso For a selected subset of these, zzso showed that seven genes that zzso zzso proteins of unknown function, including two zzso zzso are zzso in zzso and expressed early during plant infection, and therefore represent candidate zzso
