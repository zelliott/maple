Although seed plants have zzso a ubiquitous component of zzso associated with zzso nucleation in zzso and animal cells, they do not have discrete zzso organizing centers zzso comparable to animal zzso and the organization of zzso zzso in plants has remained zzso zzso development in zzso land plants has revealed a surprising variety of zzso that may represent milestones in the evolution of the typical diffuse zzso plant zzso We have isolated and characterized the zzso gene from a zzso one of the extant zzso land zzso zzso similarity to the zzso gene of higher plants suggests that the zzso gene is highly zzso in land zzso The zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso recognized a single band of 55 zzso in zzso from zzso zzso with the zzso zzso clearly documented the association of zzso with various zzso sites in zzso land plants zzso discrete zzso with and without zzso and the zzso surface in zzso zzso of zzso Changes in the distribution of zzso occur in a cell zzso manner during zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso changes its zzso from the zzso surface in zzso I to the zzso from the zzso to zzso and the nuclear envelope in zzso I, and back to the zzso surfaces in zzso zzso In zzso experiments show that zzso is zzso on the surface of isolated zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso can be zzso from the isolated zzso zzso zzso patterns on zzso and nuclear surfaces are not affected by the destruction of zzso by zzso We conclude that zzso is a highly zzso protein associated with zzso nucleation in zzso land plants and that it has a cell zzso distribution essential for the orderly succession of zzso zzso
