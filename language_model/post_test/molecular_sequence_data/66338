Six zzso of small zzso zzso zzso were found attached to naturally sunken wood collected in the zzso Sea zzso These specimens are related to the large zzso zzso that are found worldwide at cold zzso and zzso zzso In these zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in their zzso and depend on the energy and carbon provided by the zzso In this study, bacteria associated with the zzso of zzso zzso are characterized using molecular and microscopic zzso The existence of bacteria in the lateral zone of zzso filaments in all specimens is zzso Comparative analyses of zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences indicate that the bacteria are closely related to zzso zzso of zzso zzso using specific zzso confirm that zzso zzso are by far the most abundant, if not the only bacteria zzso zzso zzso displayed mostly zzso bacteria located between zzso at the zzso surface of host zzso zzso cells all along the lateral zone of each zzso zzso In some zzso occasional occurrence of zzso bacteria with similar zzso was zzso This study provides the first molecular evidence for the presence of possible zzso zzso in sunken wood zzso With their zzso bacteria, zzso zzso display a less integrated type of interaction than described in their zzso zzso and whale fall zzso
