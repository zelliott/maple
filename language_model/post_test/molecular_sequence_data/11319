The complete primary structure of the mouse zzso zzso chain was derived from zzso zzso The translation product contains a zzso signal zzso preceding the mature zzso chain of zzso zzso Northern analysis on whole mouse zzso revealed that the expression was weak at day 7, but it later increased and peaked at day zzso In adult zzso the strongest expression was observed in lung and cardiac and skeletal zzso zzso expression was also seen in other adult zzso such as brain, zzso liver, zzso and zzso By in zzso zzso of fetal and newborn zzso expression of the zzso zzso chain was mainly localized to zzso zzso Strong expression was seen in the zzso and zzso of the developing zzso the zzso zzso surrounding the branching lung zzso and the external root sheath of zzso zzso as well as in cardiac and skeletal muscle zzso In the developing zzso intense but transient expression was associated with the differentiation of zzso kidney zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso localized the zzso zzso chain primarily to lung zzso heart, and skeletal muscle, zzso and zzso
