zzso acid sequence comparisons between zzso of zzso zzso have been used to identify regions of the sequence which are responsible for the recognition and binding of the individual zzso zzso Using a limited set of selection rules it was possible to identify three zzso acid positions in the zzso sequences which are responsible for zzso acid zzso zzso with the zzso zzso protein shows that these three key zzso are close to each other and line the surface of a putative specific zzso binding pocket located on the zzso zzso zzso These results allow us to predict a large number of zzso zzso zzso which could be used to zzso alternative zzso zzso
