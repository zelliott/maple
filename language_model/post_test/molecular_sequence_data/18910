zzso fetus are important animal and human pathogens and the two major subspecies differ zzso in zzso zzso fetus zzso zzso is highly zzso mainly infecting the zzso tract of zzso zzso fetus zzso fetus has a wider zzso colonizing the zzso and zzso of animals and zzso We report the complete zzso sequence of zzso fetus zzso zzso zzso and comparisons to the zzso of zzso fetus zzso fetus zzso zzso analysis of genes predicted to be involved in zzso fetus zzso was zzso The two subspecies are highly zzso with zzso sequence identity but zzso fetus zzso zzso has a larger zzso and an zzso zzso Aside from apparent gene transfer agents and hypothetical zzso the unique genes in both subspecies comprise two known functional groups: zzso production, and type IV zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes in zzso fetus zzso showed linkage to particular zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated their roles in regulating zzso and host zzso The comparative analysis presented here zzso knowledge of the zzso basis of zzso fetus zzso and host zzso It further highlights the importance of zzso structures to zzso fetus zzso and demonstrates how evolutionary forces zzso the fitness and zzso of these zzso
