Most zzso in zzso zzso occurs in zzso sequences high in zzso zzso hallmarks of zzso point zzso To investigate how such sequences induce zzso we developed a sensitive in zzso zzso Tests of various zzso to zzso synthetic DNA sequences revealed that both T and A zzso were required on a given strand to induce appreciable zzso zzso composed of zzso or zzso were the most potent zzso zzso induced robust zzso at the special test site, and a zzso induced zzso zzso zzso base pairs inhibited zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso were particularly zzso zzso signals could be strengthened by extending their zzso zzso tracts as short as two were found to cooperate to induce zzso zzso which, like the zzso DNA binding motif found in proteins such as zzso zzso binds to the minor groove of zzso zzso suppressed DNA zzso and gene zzso We also found a correlation between the strength of zzso signals and their binding to an zzso protein zzso and to activities in a zzso zzso We propose that de zzso DNA zzso in zzso cells is triggered by cooperative recognition of the minor groove of multiple short zzso zzso zzso between sequences subjected to zzso point zzso in zzso zzso and zzso repeated sequences in zzso in other organisms suggest that related mechanisms control silent zzso in zzso plants, and zzso
