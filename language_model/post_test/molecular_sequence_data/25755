A series of experiments has been carried out to characterize zzso human zzso zzso zzso and compare it with human zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso and spontaneously activated zzso shows that it is a distinct zzso that is zzso to zzso and other members of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso occurs zzso by zzso of an zzso bond at a locus zzso to the zzso zzso zzso site of zzso This releases a zzso zzso believed to contain the zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso with zzso but with none of the other major human zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso F or zzso F indicates that it is zzso at multiple zzso The zzso zzso and spontaneously activated zzso have molecular weights of approximately zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso processing of zzso and zzso may determine why zzso is a zzso protein while zzso is stored in zzso zzso The kinetic parameters zzso and zzso for the zzso of the zzso collagen types I, II, and III in solution by both zzso have been zzso The strong preferences of zzso for type I collagen and of zzso for type III collagen found in earlier studies have been zzso The preference of zzso for type I over type III collagen is almost abolished when zzso zzso are used as zzso but the preference for zzso for type III over type I collagen is only partially zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
