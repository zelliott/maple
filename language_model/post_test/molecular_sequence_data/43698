The zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively transcribed in human activated T and zzso cells, encodes a zzso for major zzso complex zzso class II zzso Like zzso zzso zzso is composed of four zzso zzso zzso Nothing is known about the zzso regions or zzso required to form a stable zzso class II binding zzso In contrast to zzso soluble zzso molecules zzso interact with zzso class II molecules expressed on the cell zzso In addition, the first two zzso zzso of soluble zzso zzso and zzso zzso alone, are capable of binding zzso class zzso From a zzso model structure, we designed zzso and tested their ability to bind zzso class II molecules in an zzso zzso zzso We found zzso on the zzso zzso top face of D1 that are essential for either binding or zzso zzso class II zzso Most of these zzso are clustered at the base of a large zzso structure that is a hallmark of the zzso D1 zzso zzso In addition, as for zzso zzso of zzso on the cell surface may be required to form a stable zzso binding site because zzso of three zzso in the zzso zzso containing side of D1 results in a dominant negative effect zzso binding zzso of zzso zzso zzso
