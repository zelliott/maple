zzso have been identified in a variety of organisms ranging from zzso to zzso known to specifically degrade zzso an abundant zzso of zzso Recently a human zzso zzso called zzso was zzso zzso is expressed by activated zzso and zzso artificial zzso zzso but its specific function in humans is unknown, since it is generally believed that man completely lacks zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso An intriguing question is whether the zzso activity is just an evolutionary remnant or it has a zzso function in zzso To test these hypotheses we zzso a zzso approach performing accurate sequence analyses of this zzso coding for zzso in zzso and zzso zzso the sequences available in public databases, we determined that this gene is zzso in zzso zzso and zzso and primates zzso gorilla, orangutan, zzso zzso a common zzso and black zzso zzso we found that a zzso pair zzso that determines an zzso inactive human protein is not present in zzso suggesting that this zzso was created during human zzso These results indicate that zzso is zzso across the evolutionary zzso Such conservation of the zzso gene argues in zzso of an important biological zzso
