Identification of the zzso zzso zzso gene from the completed zzso zzso zzso revealed that this insect species contains three zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso These peptides are similar to those identified in two other zzso species, Aedes aegypti and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso I displays sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso and molecular approaches, a full-length zzso for a candidate zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso a close relative of zzso zzso zzso of the known zzso zzso G zzso receptors zzso this zzso identified some key zzso regions within the zzso notably zzso zzso zzso I, II, III, VI and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be a functional zzso zzso All three zzso zzso caused a zzso rise in zzso calcium zzso when applied to zzso cells zzso the zzso and an zzso zzso with a potency order of zzso zzso zzso was also found to activate the zzso zzso with a similar zzso value to zzso zzso zzso However, when the zzso peptides were applied to the zzso zzso only zzso zzso I and II zzso a rise in zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso has a broader specificity for zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso identified a zzso of zzso 65 and 72 zzso on western zzso consistent with the presence of four zzso sites within the zzso zzso and the known zzso of the zzso in zzso In zzso zzso as in zzso the zzso was zzso to the zzso zzso Thus we provide the first identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso their interaction and show that zzso zzso zzso is closely zzso between zzso and zzso
