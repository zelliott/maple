We report here the identification of a novel zzso zzso zzso found in a bone zzso zzso The new zzso was detected during routine zzso zzso typing by an ambiguous pattern of probe zzso obtained by zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning and sequencing confirmed that the new zzso is identical to zzso at zzso 2 except for 3 zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso and zzso also found in other zzso These zzso changes may explain its anomalous zzso
