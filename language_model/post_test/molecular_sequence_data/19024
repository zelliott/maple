zzso stresses are major environmental factors that affect agricultural productivity zzso zzso zzso factors play pivotal roles in zzso stress signaling in zzso As a staple crop, wheat production is severely constrained by zzso stresses whereas only a few zzso zzso factors have been characterized zzso To promote the application of zzso genes in wheat improvement by zzso a novel zzso gene designated zzso was characterized in common zzso To determine its role, transgenic zzso zzso zzso controlled by the zzso promoter was generated and subjected to various zzso stresses for zzso and zzso zzso Gene expression showed that zzso was involved in response to drought, salt, cold and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso localized in the zzso zzso analysis indicated the zzso had enhanced zzso to drought, salt and freezing zzso simultaneously supported by enhanced expression of multiple zzso stress responsive genes and improved zzso traits, including strengthened cell membrane stability, retention of higher zzso contents and zzso zzso rates, improved zzso potential, and enhanced water retention zzso zzso of zzso resulted in pronounced enhanced zzso to drought, salt and freezing zzso therefore it has potential for zzso in transgenic breeding to improve zzso stress tolerance in zzso
