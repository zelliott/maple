The zzso zzso acid zzso 1 zzso zzso mediates the zzso of small neutral zzso acids at the zzso membrane of zzso zzso cells after protein zzso The zzso is currently under intense investigation, because it is a possible vehicle for oral drug zzso zzso features of the protein such as the number of zzso zzso the zzso binding site, or essential zzso acids are still zzso In the present study we use zzso experiments and zzso approaches to determine the role of the three putative zzso zzso zzso on transport function and their possible involvement in the formation of a zzso zzso As treatment with the reducing zzso zzso impaired transport function of zzso wild type zzso substitution of putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso or zzso was zzso Replacement of the two highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso abolished the transport function of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Studies of wild type and zzso zzso expressed in human retinal zzso zzso zzso cells suggested that the binding of the zzso was inhibited in these zzso zzso of the third putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect transport zzso All zzso were expressed at the plasma zzso zzso of free zzso groups using zzso and zzso analysis under reducing and zzso conditions provided direct evidence for the existence of an essential zzso bond between zzso and zzso This zzso bridge is very likely involved in forming or stabilizing the zzso binding zzso
