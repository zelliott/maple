The fact that membrane proteins are notoriously difficult to zzso using standard protocols for zzso structure determination methods have motivated adaptation of these techniques to membrane protein studies as well as development of new zzso With this zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso has recently been used with success for studies of peptides and membrane proteins in zzso zzso and solid-state zzso has undergone a tremendous evolution towards characterization of membrane proteins in native membrane and oriented zzso zzso In this zzso we describe some of the technological challenges behind these efforts and provide examples on their use in membrane zzso
