The neurotransmitter zzso mediates a wide variety of peripheral and central zzso effects through the binding to multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1991) in zzso zzso zzso Basic and Clinical Aspects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso zzso New zzso Among them, zzso zzso receptors are known to activate the zzso zzso second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Trends zzso 18, zzso We identified and localized in rat skeletal muscle zzso a functional zzso zzso zzso This zzso was detected on the plasma zzso in zzso and at the level of zzso in contracting zzso zzso of zzso to its zzso increases the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is able to activate another signaling zzso it triggers a rapid and transient zzso zzso of zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso is followed by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and its zzso into the zzso We also find that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso indicating that they are physically zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso identified in skeletal muscle zzso is able to activate the zzso zzso zzso used by zzso The presence of zzso receptors in zzso suggests a role for zzso in zzso zzso and zzso an effect in skeletal muscle fiber zzso
