The zzso gene has been shown to zzso to zzso and influence cell invasion in zzso zzso To identify proteins that interact with zzso and gain a better understanding of its function, we have used zzso zzso of a zzso green fluorescent zzso zzso protein combined with mass zzso to identify interacting partners from zzso prepared from human zzso white zzso zzso were recovered from zzso gels and analyzed using liquid zzso coupled to tandem mass zzso This analysis identified a range of zzso but in particular zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each of these proteins is found associated with synaptic zzso These interactions were confirmed independently by zzso and Western zzso and zzso zzso in zzso biology in zzso Other zzso proteins that were recovered by zzso include zzso heavy chain 1, zzso binding protein 1, and a zzso and zzso zzso These observations support a role for zzso in zzso zzso function in zzso
