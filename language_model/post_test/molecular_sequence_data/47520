zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein and is expressed in the zzso zzso basement zzso Its role in zzso development was zzso zzso zzso isolated from the newborn mouse library, had an zzso of zzso zzso a putative signal zzso and an zzso zzso The translated sequence had approximately zzso identity with rabbit zzso Among various zzso zzso zzso was primarily expressed in the newborn zzso In the embryonic zzso zzso expression was confined to the zzso zzso or pole of the zzso body, the segment of the nascent zzso that is the zzso of zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of the embryonic zzso zzso of the zzso body, and a decrease in the zzso population, whereas the zzso were zzso Treatment also led to a decrease of zzso zzso de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso protein 1 (a marker for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and wheat germ zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were zzso The zzso zzso treatment also caused deformation of the zzso body and a reduction in the zzso population, whereas the zzso were zzso The data suggest that the zzso unlike other basement membrane zzso selectively regulates zzso whereas zzso is largely zzso
