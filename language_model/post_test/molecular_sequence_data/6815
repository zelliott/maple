The smallest defective interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to identify the zzso sequences necessary for its replication by making a series of deletions throughout the zzso zzso long zzso and testing the biological activity of zzso zzso or substitution of the zzso sequence blocks zzso B and zzso always yielded inactive zzso The deletion of only a few zzso could be tolerated beyond the natural deletion sites in blocks A and zzso However, either half of block C1 zzso zzso and the first 25 zzso of C2 zzso zzso could be deleted without loss of zzso It was also demonstrated that either one of the two halves of block C1 was specifically required for zzso We suggest that the last 77 zzso of the viral zzso and either half of block C1 represent the complementary strand promoter sequence recognized by the viral zzso
