An early transcribed gene zzso of a South Africa strain of zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso It has an open reading frame of zzso zzso that encodes a protein of 382 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced protein sequence alignment of 13 zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso shares the highest zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zinc zzso motifs at the zzso of zzso are highly zzso with similar patterns of zzso zzso Upon introduction of the gene and a green fluorescent protein reporter gene into the zzso expression zzso system, the zzso analysis of zzso in two cell lines infected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that an early zzso zzso transcript can be detected by 1 h zzso zzso until 12 zzso and a late one from 18 zzso up to 48 zzso while early and late transcripts of the zzso zzso of the zzso can be detected at 3 and 24 zzso zzso This suggested that the early and late promoters of both zzso and zzso zzso were recognized in zzso zzso zzso The regulatory elements of the zzso zzso promoter were also zzso
