We report the isolation and characterization of a novel class of zzso peptides with possible zzso activities which we call zzso They are zzso with molecular weights of approximately 6 zzso except for zzso D, which appears to be a zzso We present the sequence of one member of this family, a 56 zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso sequences for three other zzso from human peripheral zzso A fifth related zzso was isolated and partially zzso from rat bone zzso suggesting that at least some of the zzso in peripheral zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and human zzso A, are closely zzso showing that the zzso structures are highly zzso between zzso
