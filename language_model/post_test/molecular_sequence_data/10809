The zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso is a zzso type C zzso isolated from a mouse infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have zzso zzso acid identity in their envelope proteins yet display different host zzso For example, zzso cells are resistant to zzso but susceptible to infection by zzso We have now determined that zzso zzso bearing altered zzso envelope proteins containing zzso zzso at positions 71 zzso 74 zzso and 139 zzso zzso zzso cells at efficiencies similar to those achieved with zzso enveloped zzso zzso enveloped zzso zzso with these three zzso zzso were also able to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This observation is consistent with the ability of zzso bearing this altered zzso envelope protein to recognize the zzso zzso present on zzso zzso cells and supports the possibility that zzso at positions 71, 74, and 139 of the zzso envelope zzso protein account for the expanded host range of zzso
