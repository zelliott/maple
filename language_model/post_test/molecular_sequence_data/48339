zzso zzso peptides offer a valuable tool to probe zzso interactions in a zzso controlled zzso We zzso a series of 32 zzso peptides zzso zzso with the core structure zzso and introduced the zzso based zzso zzso via reaction with zzso zzso spaced at zzso i + 7 intervals in different positions along the zzso zzso zzso show that the composition of the zzso state as well as zzso relaxation rates do not change considerably with changes in zzso zzso CD analysis shows that zzso of zzso zzso is most effective when the zzso is targeted to the middle of the zzso so long as this segment has a high intrinsic zzso zzso The largest degree of zzso zzso change occurred when a zzso central region of high intrinsic zzso was followed on the zzso side by a region of lower intrinsic zzso This indicates the zzso zzso can act as a nucleation site for zzso propagation of a zzso These data help to guide the choice of zzso site in larger peptides and proteins where zzso of zzso is zzso
