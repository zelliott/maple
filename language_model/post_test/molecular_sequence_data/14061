With zzso based on the zzso and internal zzso sequences of a zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated and zzso from zzso zzso wild and zzso zzso Each gene isolated from both strains was essentially the same as far as zzso sequences were zzso The mature zzso and zzso zzso comprise 189 and 211 zzso zzso respectively, and share zzso zzso The zzso was found to be the major zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of these zzso sequences with zzso sequences from other origins showed that they have a high degree of identity to the family G zzso The zzso and zzso genes were introduced into zzso zzso and found to be expressed with their own zzso
