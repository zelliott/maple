The zzso zzso zzso is a neural recognition zzso involved in zzso interactions between zzso cells and zzso To characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso modifications which may be instrumental in signal zzso following the recognition event, we have studied the stimuli leading to modification of zzso incorporation into zzso in cultures of zzso or transformed differentiated zzso zzso Here we show that in zzso both the 67 and 72 zzso zzso of zzso were zzso exclusively on zzso while in the transformed zzso cells only the 67 zzso zzso was found to be present and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso of the protein zzso but enhanced incorporation of zzso by a factor of zzso indicating the involvement of protein zzso zzso Exclusive zzso of zzso zzso was also observed, when zzso zzso was incubated with protein zzso C in the presence of zzso In searching for the zzso stimuli which may trigger zzso of zzso cultures of zzso were exposed to zzso signals, such as zzso with zzso root zzso and spinal zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso to membrane zzso of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to the recognition site of zzso or zzso growth zzso None of these zzso modified the zzso of zzso These observations point to the possibility that zzso of zzso is controlled by yet unknown zzso cues rather than by zzso signals interacting with cell surface receptors of zzso
