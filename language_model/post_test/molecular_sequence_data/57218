The gamma zzso of the zzso is a small membrane protein that zzso with the alpha and beta zzso of the zzso Strong evidence that the gamma zzso is a component of the zzso comes from studies indicating that the zzso is involved in forming the site for cardiac zzso zzso We have isolated and characterized the zzso coding the gamma zzso from several zzso The gamma zzso is a highly zzso protein consisting of 58 zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso zzso analysis reveals the presence of a single zzso domain that is sufficient to cross the zzso There are no sites for zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the gamma zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso fashion and is present in all zzso zzso zzso zzso have been used to verify that the zzso protein is the same protein labeled by zzso zzso and that this zzso the gamma zzso of the zzso has a distribution pattern along zzso segments that is identical with the alpha zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso beta and gamma zzso demonstrate specific association of the zzso These results are consistent with the notion that the gamma zzso is specifically associated with and may be an important component of the zzso
