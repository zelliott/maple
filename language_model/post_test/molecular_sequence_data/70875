A small grid of conditions has been developed for zzso of the plant zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso have been obtained of complexes of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso The zzso zzso to resolutions of zzso zzso A using a copper zzso zzso The zzso are grown in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso at around pH zzso zzso for each particular zzso requires small adjustments in the zzso however, all complexes give some zzso zzso in this limited zzso The zzso zzso complex zzso zzso to zzso A with space group zzso and cell dimensions a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso One zzso is present in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso complex zzso in space group zzso cell dimensions a zzso zzso 7, b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A and zzso to zzso zzso One zzso is present in the zzso zzso Two crystal forms of the zzso complex have been zzso The first has space group zzso cell dimensions a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A with a zzso in the zzso unit and zzso to zzso zzso The second zzso in space group zzso cell dimensions a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A with two zzso in the zzso unit and zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso complexes have already been zzso In all complexes, the protein is found as a zzso although varying combinations of zzso and zzso symmetry are involved in generating the zzso The precise packing of the zzso varies from crystal to crystal and it is likely that this zzso zzso zzso
