The class of zzso inwardly zzso zzso channels is composed of at least four members, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we describe the zzso organization of human zzso zzso designated zzso zzso previously named zzso and the characterization of its major promoter used in zzso The zzso gene contains three zzso separated by two zzso and its total length exceeds 45 zzso The two zzso zzso pore region, and part of the putative zzso zzso are zzso by zzso 1, whereas the remainder of the tail is zzso by zzso 2 and zzso The zzso zzso initiation site was established, and the first zzso zzso upstream were zzso this region lacked a traditional zzso or zzso box, but contained a zzso region as well as various putative zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso upstream and 84 zzso downstream of the zzso initiation site were tested for promoter activity in zzso zzso This sequence of zzso zzso contains a number of fragments that either stimulate or repress transcription, as tested by transient expression of various zzso zzso fusion gene zzso in zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first promoter that has been isolated and characterized for an inwardly zzso zzso zzso Additional data suggest the existence of another promoter that can drive zzso of zzso zzso from a distinct initiation zzso
