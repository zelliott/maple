We established five zzso zzso that reacted with human zzso and recognized different zzso on zzso These are mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which react with the peptides corresponding to human zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also successfully used two of these zzso to develop an zzso which uses a solid phase zzso zzso zzso that zzso with the zzso of zzso and a detection zzso zzso zzso that zzso with an zzso located in the center of the zzso primary zzso We observed a significant positive correlation between the values of zzso protein determined with zzso and zzso activity determined with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or the zzso zzso method zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and we obtained zzso and zzso zzso of variation less than zzso minimum detection limit of zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso will be useful in the study of the molecular pathology of zzso zzso this precise and sensitive zzso zzso will help clarify the role of this zzso in the metabolism of zzso and can be used for diagnostic purposes in investigating liver zzso We obtained five zzso zzso that recognized different zzso on zzso and developed a zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso provide a sensitive and specific zzso system for zzso of zzso zzso
