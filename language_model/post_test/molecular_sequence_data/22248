The zzso zzso zzso system serves to export fully folded proteins across the zzso zzso In many bacteria, three major zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the functionally essential constituents of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso could zzso and form zzso but was unable to form zzso bodies under nutritionally limiting zzso When zzso zzso zzso cells were cultured with zzso M zzso the cell zzso changed to zzso zzso cells, but the spores were not resistant to heat and zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso strain, the zzso zzso also showed a decreased cell growth rate and a lower maximum cell zzso These results suggest possibility that the zzso system may contribute to export of various important proteins for development and growth for zzso zzso
