The zzso coli zzso zzso E zzso and zzso G zzso have sequence similarity and broadly similar sequence zzso Whereas the absence of zzso normally is zzso we show here that zzso coli bacteria that lack the zzso gene can be made viable by zzso of zzso zzso cells accumulated precursors of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso component of zzso P zzso zzso zzso indicating that normal processing of these zzso zzso was not restored by zzso zzso zzso neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso was generated from precursors by zzso G zzso in zzso Using DNA zzso containing zzso zzso coli open reading frames zzso we identified zzso whose zzso level was affected by zzso zzso or the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso Most transcript species affected by zzso E zzso were also elevated in an zzso deletion zzso zzso by zzso However, approximately 100 zzso that accumulated in zzso cells were decreased by zzso thus identifying targets whose processing or degradation may be the basis for zzso E zzso Remarkably prominent in this group were zzso implicated in zzso pathways or in the synthesis or degradation of zzso
