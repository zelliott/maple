While zzso zzso through zzso pores of zzso is well zzso little is known about the possible zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to function as an zzso channel upon zzso zzso although this idea has been zzso Taking a theoretical and experimental approach, we demonstrate that the current might arise through the zzso pore and propose a plausible mechanism for zzso and zzso In response to simulated zzso zzso immediate zzso of the putative central pore was facilitated by moderate zzso changes of zzso zzso zzso is found to interact with an unusually zzso zzso loop zzso zzso zzso its outward motion, which is hypothesized to trigger the opening of a zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso and a designed zzso in which two zzso of the gating loop are replaced by zzso provide experimental support for identifying a key component of the proposed zzso
