We have determined the zzso acid sequence of a 35 zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso of turkey gizzard zzso This zzso zzso contains binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso comprise zzso an zzso zzso which we previously showed to resemble the zzso segment of zzso zzso The remainder of the zzso sequence shows no significant similarity to other zzso zzso zzso may form a zzso zzso zzso which interacts with zzso
