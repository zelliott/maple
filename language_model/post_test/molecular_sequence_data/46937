zzso zzso in zzso zzso occurs at specific zzso and is zzso by a zzso complex that includes zzso and the Sir zzso We studied the function of a recently identified zzso zzso that zzso zzso when zzso zzso encodes an zzso processing zzso zzso that is primarily located in the zzso By zzso analysis, the zzso third of zzso interacts with the zzso protein zzso zzso lacking zzso exhibited reduced zzso and a corresponding decrease in the level of zzso Together, these findings suggest that zzso regulates zzso by acting on zzso In strains with several zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso zzso activity also results in a zzso zzso The zzso can be partially suppressed by zzso in a zzso of the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso has the ability to prevent zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for full manifestation of the growth zzso in a zzso strain, indicating that the growth zzso is caused in part by a zzso zzso We propose that zzso helps to restrict the location of zzso proteins to a limited set of zzso zzso
