The design and rapid construction of libraries of genes coding zzso forming repetitive and zzso zzso bearing various zzso and zzso sequences are zzso The design was based on the assembly of DNA zzso coding for the zzso zzso acid sequence where the zzso sequences would constitute the zzso units of a larger zzso zzso The edges of this zzso would be zzso by the zzso zzso acids zzso The zzso were expressed in zzso coli using conventional zzso and were zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso The correlation of zzso structure with molecular weight was investigated by gel zzso and mass zzso The zzso sequences and zzso chemical modifications were found to influence the mobility of the zzso over the full range of zzso molecular weights while the zzso mobility of lower molecular weight zzso was more susceptible to zzso and zzso zzso zzso
