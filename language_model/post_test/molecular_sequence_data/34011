Here we discuss the hypothesis that the zzso components of the zzso zzso zzso the Y zzso can be processed into zzso zzso Although zzso zzso whose main protein components zzso and La are targeted by the immune system in several zzso diseases, were discovered many years ago, their function is still poorly zzso Indeed, recent data show that zzso small zzso can be generated from Y zzso This hypothesis leads also to a model in which zzso acts as a zzso in the Y zzso zzso zzso zzso The implications of these Y zzso zzso which may be specifically produced under pathological circumstances such as in zzso or during viral infections, for the enigmatic function of zzso zzso are zzso
