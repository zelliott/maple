A lung zzso cell line was isolated from lung biopsy of a patient with lung zzso Gene expression of ten growth factors in the zzso were investigated by a reverse zzso zzso chain zzso The results indicated that the zzso expressed zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso Further experiments revealed that zzso zzso could be zzso by the zzso and zzso the proliferation of the zzso These data suggest that zzso may activate lung zzso in a way of zzso and, therefore, may be involved in the development of lung zzso
