zzso zzso zzso in response to a zzso of zzso zzso zzso were previously found by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso analysis in zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso In this study, zzso sequencing revealed three of them to be identical to known acid zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso Two zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso of genes zzso and zzso which zzso two of the three acid zzso were zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso showed high similarity to other zzso acid zzso and contained a putative zzso active site of acid zzso zzso and zzso are comprised of five and seven zzso interrupted by four and six zzso zzso Their promoter regions include two zzso elements found in zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso together with several known functional elements such as a zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso are expressed in response to a zzso of zzso
