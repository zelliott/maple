One of the critical challenges in predicting protein zzso zzso is how to deal with the case of multiple location zzso Unfortunately, so far, no efforts have been made in this regard except for the one focused on the proteins in budding zzso zzso For most existing zzso the zzso proteins are either excluded from consideration or assumed even not zzso Actually, proteins may simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different zzso zzso For instance, according to the zzso database zzso zzso released zzso among the zzso zzso protein entries that have zzso observed zzso location zzso zzso have multiple location sites, meaning about zzso bearing the multiplex zzso zzso with multiple locations or dynamic feature of this kind are particularly interesting because they may have some very special biological functions intriguing to investigators in both basic research and drug zzso Meanwhile, according to the same zzso database, the number of total zzso protein entries (except those zzso with zzso or those with less than 50 zzso zzso is zzso meaning a gap of zzso zzso zzso entries for which no knowledge is available about their zzso zzso Although one can use the zzso approach to predict the desired information for the zzso so far, all the existing methods for predicting zzso protein zzso zzso are limited in the case of single location site zzso To overcome such a barrier, a new ensemble zzso named zzso was developed that can be used to deal with the case of multiple location sites as zzso zzso is freely accessible to the public as a Web server at zzso Meanwhile, to support the people working in the relevant areas, zzso has been used to identify all zzso protein entries in the zzso database that do not have zzso location zzso or are zzso as being zzso The large-scale results thus obtained have been deposited at the same Web site via a downloadable file prepared with Microsoft Excel and named zzso Furthermore, to include new entries of zzso proteins and reflect the continuous development of zzso in both the coverage scope and prediction zzso we will timely update the downloadable file as well as the zzso and keep users informed by publishing a short note in the Journal and making an announcement in the Web zzso
