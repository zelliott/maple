zzso is a member of the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso which play critical roles in the regulation of cell zzso To study the zzso regulation that controls the expression of zzso we have isolated the zzso promoter, defined its zzso initiation site, and performed various analyses for sequences upstream to 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso using fusion reporters containing progressively truncated zzso promoter fragments showed that a region of 170 zzso upstream of the start site is sufficient for zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of this 170 zzso region identified several zzso zzso putative sites of the zzso factor zzso zzso experiments revealed two zzso boxes, named zzso and zzso which are located at positions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the two boxes was further demonstrated by gel mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso Schneider line 2 cells showed that zzso indeed activates the zzso promoter zzso that harbor one or both of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso sequences could zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso minimal zzso zzso in the zzso sequences abolished both binding and zzso by zzso Taken together, our data strongly show that the zzso promoter is activated by the zzso expressed zzso factor zzso which may provide a molecular mechanism for the zzso nature of zzso zzso
