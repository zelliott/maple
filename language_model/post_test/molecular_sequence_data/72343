The severe combined immune zzso zzso mouse was reported as an animal model for human immune zzso Through the course of several studies, the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso gene came to be considered a candidate for the zzso zzso We isolated an zzso of the zzso zzso gene from zzso mice and their parent strain zzso mice and determined the DNA zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso gene contained zzso zzso and had zzso zzso with the human zzso zzso A particularly important finding is that a T to A zzso results in the substitution of termination zzso in zzso mice for the zzso in zzso zzso No other zzso was detected in the zzso of the zzso The zzso of this zzso was confirmed using four individual zzso and zzso zzso The substitution took place in the zzso zzso domain, and the zzso gene encodes the truncated products missing 83 zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the quantity of zzso transcript in zzso and zzso cells was almost zzso These observations indicate that the zzso gene is the zzso gene itself and that the detected zzso leads to the zzso zzso
