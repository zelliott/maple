The zzso functions of zzso zzso are still poorly zzso To understand these better, we have expressed and characterized a heat stable, zzso zzso zzso zzso that specifically zzso these zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso always produces an zzso product, with zzso preference depending on pH and zzso zzso zzso or zzso For example, zzso zzso is zzso to zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and zzso values zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso is efficiently zzso to zzso only at pH zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso whereas it is ineffective in the presence of zzso supporting the view that zzso involves a specific, zzso transition state analogue zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso show zzso zzso levels to be highest in zzso and adult zzso zzso zzso with zzso fusion zzso reveals zzso to be predominantly zzso having an apparent preferential association with zzso and zzso zzso This supports a nuclear function for zzso zzso Our results show zzso to be a fairly typical member of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with features that distinguish it from a previously reported zzso zzso zzso activity from zzso zzso
