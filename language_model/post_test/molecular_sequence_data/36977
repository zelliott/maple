In the zzso zzso acid zzso is known to regulate the gene expression of zzso the intermediate filament proteins of zzso zzso We have cloned the upstream regulatory regions of three human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and engineered DNA zzso in which these regions drive expression of the zzso reporter zzso By zzso the zzso into various zzso cell types along with the zzso expressing the nuclear receptors for zzso and zzso hormone zzso we have shown that zzso and zzso directly regulate expression of these three zzso genes through the action of their nuclear zzso In this paper, we review our previous results to stress that zzso has a dual effect on zzso expression in zzso both direct and zzso We also analyze the DNA sequences upstream from those three zzso zzso genes and identify the clusters of zzso consensus zzso zzso which may comprise the putative zzso acid recognition elements zzso Furthermore, our recent results concerning the regulation of zzso and zzso expression by the zzso zzso are also zzso these confirm our predictions regarding the location of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso
