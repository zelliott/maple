zzso zzso made against synthetic peptides corresponding to expected zzso fragments of gamma zzso have been used to screen zzso zzso of total proteins from zzso versus normal human zzso One of these zzso recognizes two peptides that were found in greater amounts from zzso of zzso zzso These two peptides shared a common sequence that contained an zzso zzso in place of an expected zzso suggesting that increased zzso of this zzso had occurred in the human zzso lens in zzso
