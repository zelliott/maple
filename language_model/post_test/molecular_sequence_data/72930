The zzso minor zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in both graft rejection and zzso disease following transplantation of male tissue into females that are completely matched at the major zzso zzso The recent identification of two peptides that, in association with the mouse zzso or human zzso B7 major zzso class I zzso are zzso by zzso T cells, has provided evidence for the molecular basis for such zzso zzso These peptides are zzso by the mouse and human zzso of a zzso expressed Y zzso zzso zzso whilst the equivalent peptides zzso by the X zzso zzso of this gene fail to be zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that, as is the case for other minor zzso zzso zzso zzso from several closely linked genes may be required to interact in order to elicit a response against zzso Definition of the peptides and the genes that zzso these zzso will allow the development of zzso protocols that could specifically zzso the response to zzso and perhaps even other minor zzso zzso
