In our previous study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1987) in which the zzso zzso zzso on zzso of human zzso were zzso one strain, zzso was found to bear unique zzso zzso zzso This strain, which belongs to zzso II and zzso 1, was not neutralized by any of six zzso zzso zzso zzso which reacted with human zzso strains of zzso 1, 3, and 4 or zzso 1 through zzso We determined the complete zzso sequence of the gene zzso zzso of strain zzso by primer zzso The zzso gene is zzso base pairs in zzso with zzso and 3' zzso regions of 9 and 25 zzso zzso The gene contains a long open reading frame of zzso bases capable of coding for a protein of zzso zzso zzso When compared with those of other human zzso zzso of strain zzso had an zzso of one zzso acid after zzso zzso as found in zzso zzso zzso and in addition, it had a deletion of one zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso of zzso of strain zzso and those of other virulent human zzso was only 60 to zzso This was unusual, since over zzso zzso zzso has been found among the other virulent human zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso strain was quite similar (over zzso zzso to those of other zzso 1 human zzso Thus, the zzso strain appears to have a unique zzso gene previously not zzso
