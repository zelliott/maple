The development of compound zzso markers was conducted in zzso zzso to investigate genetic diversity and population genetic structure of this threatened medicinal zzso 

Using the compound zzso marker technique, 14 zzso markers that were successfully amplified showed zzso when tested on 38 individuals from three populations in eastern zzso Overall, the number of zzso per locus ranged from 2 to 14, with an average of zzso zzso per zzso 

These results indicate that these zzso markers are adequate for detecting and characterizing population genetic structure and genetic diversity in zzso zzso
