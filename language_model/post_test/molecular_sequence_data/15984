The zzso region of the zzso B virus zzso envelope protein has the following zzso zzso exposure on the surface of the zzso zzso high zzso zzso involvement in the reaction of the virus with cell receptors and zzso zzso of zzso protective against zzso Attempts to mimic zzso and zzso zzso on the native protein by synthetic peptides were highly zzso This success depended on identification of those regions within the zzso sequences which are the most important for biological function of the virus and for zzso and on the synthesis of long peptides zzso zzso containing both zzso and zzso zzso zzso presented here highlight those zzso of the zzso sequence which are the most essential for the zzso and zzso of zzso
