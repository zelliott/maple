zzso plays a crucial role as a basic building block of zzso but also as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to be required for zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (2001) zzso zzso 20, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (2001) zzso zzso Cell 12, zzso zzso and zzso (2005) zzso zzso 24, zzso In the present study, the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The zzso and zzso of the proteins are in the zzso and eight putative zzso zzso were identified in zzso and zzso by zzso of zzso and factor zzso zzso sites at various zzso The zzso zzso zzso potentially containing the active site, is most likely embedded in the zzso We also present evidence that zzso and zzso acid zzso in the zzso motif are essential for the function of zzso in zzso
