We have mapped a T cell zzso in the zzso zzso protein of the zzso malaria zzso zzso zzso A zzso synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso acid positions zzso zzso to as zzso induced specific proliferation in zzso and zzso mice, and provided help for the production of zzso to peptides from the repetitive region, zzso of the same zzso zzso when mice were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso to the repetitive zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso T cell lines and clones were derived from both strains of zzso These lines and zzso that proliferated in an zzso fashion, did not recognize peptides from the zzso region of another zzso malaria zzso zzso zzso About 50% of these clones produced zzso amounts of zzso and zzso whereas the remaining produced zzso zzso and zzso In preliminary experiments, some of these clones specifically inhibited zzso zzso zzso development in zzso and zzso protection in zzso in passive transfer zzso These findings show that zzso T cell populations are activated in mice upon zzso with a short zzso from the zzso zzso zzso protein and that some of these cells could be active in the zzso arm of the immune response against malaria zzso
