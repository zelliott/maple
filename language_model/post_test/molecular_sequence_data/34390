We report here a unique zzso of the zzso nerve which could not be zzso by available techniques, including zzso and standard clinical and laboratory zzso In order to identify the zzso zzso we developed a novel zzso procedure designed to zzso conditions for liquid zzso tandem mass zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analysis clearly identified zzso light chain as the zzso with no evidence of zzso light zzso Manual interpretation of the matched zzso revealed no evidence of zzso This study also enabled detailed zzso of twelve likely zzso zzso zzso Finally, our analysis revealed extensive zzso of collagen type I but, unexpectedly, an almost complete lack of zzso zzso in the normally zzso collagen type VI zzso pointing to zzso zzso of collagen VI in this zzso that could have contributed to the zzso of this very unusual zzso Given the high quality of the data here acquired using a standard zzso of flight tandem mass zzso of modest performance, the robust and straightforward zzso method described constitutes a competitive alternative to more involved approaches using state-of-the-art zzso
