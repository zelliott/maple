The potential regulatory role of delta protein zzso C zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell differentiation was studied by using zzso zzso targeting the translation initiation region of mouse delta zzso zzso Cell treatment with zzso zzso at a concentration of 20 zzso followed by zzso zzso produced a specific zzso increase in the differentiation rate of both slowly and rapidly zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Cell zzso by a zzso zzso resulted in a decrease of one order of magnitude in the amounts of zzso zzso necessary to elicit the zzso response, and accelerated the zzso of the zzso zzso These changes in zzso zzso cell differentiation rates, observed in both cell zzso were associated with zzso and 50% zzso respectively, in delta zzso zzso protein in slowly and rapidly zzso zzso The present results indicate strongly that zzso levels of delta zzso in zzso zzso cells are essential in regulating the initial differentiation rate of these cells in response to chemical zzso and provide further evidence that this zzso zzso plays a fundamental role in maintaining the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
