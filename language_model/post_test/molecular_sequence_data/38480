The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso that are crucial in the zzso zzso zzso They catalyze the zzso of zzso into zzso zzso which activate a zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso to block viral replication at the level of zzso zzso A molecular evolutionary analysis of available zzso sequences suggests that the zzso genes are members of a zzso family with its roots in the early history of zzso The modern zzso zzso genes underwent successive gene zzso events resulting in three size classes of zzso containing one, two, or three zzso zzso Expansion of the zzso gene family occurred by zzso zzso to increase gene content and by domain zzso to produce the zzso zzso zzso analyses show that the zzso genes in zzso underwent gene zzso as recently as 11 zzso and predict the existence of additional undiscovered zzso genes in zzso
