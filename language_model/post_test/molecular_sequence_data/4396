zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso discovered by a molecular approach over 10 years zzso More recently, zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso were isolated from human zzso and zzso respectively, and revealed between 25 and 50% sequence zzso with zzso This review discusses findings on the anatomical zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and receptors in the central nervous system, as well as the potential zzso roles for zzso The anatomical distribution and biological activities of zzso and zzso are also zzso Based upon the differential biological activity of various zzso zzso the zzso receptors have been classified in two major classes, namely the zzso and zzso zzso A third zzso has also been proposed zzso in the nucleus zzso as it does not share the pharmacological properties of the other two zzso The anatomical distribution and the pharmacological characteristics of zzso binding sites in the rat brain are different from those reported for zzso but share several similarities with the salmon zzso zzso The receptors identified thus far for zzso and related peptides belong to the G zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso zzso activity following zzso zzso has been reported for zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the binding affinity of zzso and related peptides is modulated by zzso such as zzso The cloning of various zzso and most recently of zzso and zzso receptors was reported and revealed structural similarities but also significant differences to other members of the G zzso zzso They may thus form a new zzso The cloning of the zzso zzso as well as of the other putative zzso zzso zzso are still zzso Finally, a broad variety of biological activities has been described for zzso zzso These include zzso zzso zzso zzso and the stimulation of zzso in skeletal zzso These effects may thus suggest their potential role and therapeutic applications in zzso zzso zzso diabetes and zzso mechanisms, among other zzso
