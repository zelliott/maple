The influence of zzso zzso on DNA zzso and zzso is an open zzso This zzso study of DNA with either zzso or zzso at zzso zzso shows that the nature of the zzso affects the zzso chemical shifts zzso and the sequential distances zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and distance variations ascertain that the nature of the zzso affects the DNA overall structure, zzso both the zzso zzso between the backbone zzso zzso zzso degrees ) and zzso zzso zzso degrees ) states and the zzso zzso via their strong mechanical zzso These results reveal that zzso and zzso interactions with DNA are different and zzso These zzso zzso the overall intrinsic properties of DNA, and possibly its packaging and zzso
