We have previously shown that a cell zzso zzso complex assembles in zzso on a 74 zzso sequence within the human DNA replication origin associated to the zzso B2 zzso Here, we report the zzso using a zzso screen in zzso of three proteins interacting with the 74 zzso zzso All of them, namely zzso zzso and zzso are zzso of the zzso gene of zzso zzso and are members of the zzso family of zzso zzso We describe the complete open reading frame sequence of zzso and zzso along with the structure of the zzso zzso The specificity of binding of these two proteins to the zzso B2 origin is confirmed by both zzso and in zzso zzso zzso In addition, the ability of zzso and zzso to increase the activity of a promoter containing the 74 zzso zzso as zzso by zzso experiments, demonstrates a direct interaction of these zzso with the origin sequence in zzso zzso We also show that zzso expression is zzso and positively zzso with cell zzso
