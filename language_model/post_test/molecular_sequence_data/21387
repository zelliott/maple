The structural conversion of the prion protein zzso from the normal cellular zzso zzso to the zzso modified form zzso is thought to relate to zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso Traditionally, the binding of metals to zzso has been investigated by monitoring the zzso conversion using circular zzso zzso In this study, the zzso ability of 21 synthetic peptides representing regions of human zzso was investigated by column switch zzso liquid zzso zzso The zzso system is composed of a metal zzso affinity column and an zzso zzso zzso column that together enable the identification of zzso regardless of zzso zzso zzso peptides were designed with respect to the position of H zzso as well as the secondary structure of human zzso zzso The ability of the zzso zzso region zzso to bind metals was analyzed by zzso and supported by CD analysis, and indicated that zzso is a reliable and useful method for measuring zzso zzso zzso from the middle region of zzso showed a high affinity for zzso but binding to zzso zzso and zzso was dependent on zzso zzso zzso peptides had a lower affinity for zzso zzso zzso and zzso than zzso region zzso Interestingly, zzso which contained no H zzso also bound to zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating that this region is a novel zzso site in the zzso region of zzso The zzso method described in this study is useful and convenient for assessing zzso affinity and characterizing zzso peptides or zzso
