Organic zzso zzso 1 zzso is localized in the zzso membrane of the zzso zzso in the kidney and plays an essential role in eliminating a wide range of organic zzso preventing their toxic effects on the zzso zzso and functional studies of the zzso would be greatly assisted by inexpensive and rapid expression in the zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso rat zzso zzso contains many zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and so was modified by fusion of the favored zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso preceding the start zzso The modified gene was cloned into several zzso expression zzso both zzso and zzso with either zzso promoter or zzso promoter in order to find a suitable expression zzso Compared with the wild type zzso a substantial increase in zzso expression was achieved by modification in the zzso initiation region, suggesting that the zzso chosen at the zzso influenced its zzso The highest zzso expression of zzso was obtained under zzso promoter in 2 zzso zzso A large fraction of zzso was zzso in zzso unaffected by growth zzso The zzso zzso expressing zzso showed an increase in the zzso of zzso zzso and this showed a positive correlation with zzso expression zzso zzso of zzso predominantly in the zzso plasma membrane confirmed correct zzso The importance of zzso for zzso targeting was also zzso To our knowledge, this is the first successful functional expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
