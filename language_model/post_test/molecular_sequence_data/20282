zzso is an zzso zzso zzso of 44 zzso initially isolated from zzso zzso zzso The systemic expression of zzso is regulated by the Toll zzso present in fat body, whereas zzso local expression in the respiratory tract is controlled by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and is composed of an zzso and a zzso zzso stabilized by four zzso zzso zzso exhibits a narrow zzso spectrum and is only active against some zzso zzso However, recent work using zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli revealed its zzso and zzso zzso Two evolutionary zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso have been proposed as putative functional regions of zzso for interaction with zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso structure and biological activity suggests that zzso and some zzso molecules from plants and zzso could originate from a common zzso
