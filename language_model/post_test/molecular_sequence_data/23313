This study was conducted to determine the feasibility and relevant technique itinerary for the production of zzso with zzso zzso zzso System zzso 

The full zzso zzso was amplified from zzso by using zzso with a pair of zzso zzso and zzso and was inserted into the zzso of transfer zzso zzso zzso DNA and zzso were zzso into zzso zzso zzso would take place within the zzso cells between the zzso regions in the transfer zzso and zzso zzso After 5 days of zzso both zzso of the experimental cells and positive control cells were zzso zzso cells were infected with virus zzso and then determined by zzso dilution zzso The expression of zzso in both cell zzso and zzso was analyzed by western zzso with specific 6 zzso zzso 

Both zzso cutting result and sequence analysis showed that zzso zzso with C terminal of zzso of zzso and zzso had been inserted into the transfer zzso of zzso system correctly, and zzso transfer zzso zzso had been constructed zzso zzso dilution zzso proved that zzso virus zzso had been zzso Western zzso revealed that zzso of zzso cells zzso by zzso showed a band of relative zzso mass about zzso zzso zzso which implied that a fuse zzso of zzso with zzso of zzso tag, zzso protein zzso A site and zzso zzso had zzso The culture zzso showed two bands of relative zzso mass about 40 zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso which were zzso to be the proceeded products of the fuse zzso during zzso process from cell into culture zzso 

These results suggested that it may be feasible to use zzso system as a high efficient zzso reactor for producing zzso zzso
