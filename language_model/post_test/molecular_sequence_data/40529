zzso the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso is an attractive candidate for an zzso vaccine and target for the design of specific zzso A complicating factor for the inclusion of zzso in a vaccine is that multiple zzso of zzso are present in the zzso of the zzso In order to determine whether the zzso zzso genes code for zzso with zzso activities different to those of zzso two zzso were cloned and zzso Two truncated zzso domain zzso were zzso expressed in zzso zzso The two expressed zzso domain zzso differed slightly from one another in zzso preferences and also from that of C2 (the zzso truncated form of zzso Surprisingly, a zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was shown to be active against classical zzso zzso zzso and inhibited by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso domain clones and C2 had pH zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso that these zzso zzso are likely to be expressed and active in the zzso of the host zzso
