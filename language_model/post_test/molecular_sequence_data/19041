The zzso status of a zzso strain zzso isolated from zzso of zzso zzso was determined using a zzso zzso zzso The strain zzso can grow at zzso zzso zzso 32 zzso at pH ranges of zzso zzso growth occurs at pH 7) and in zzso % zzso zzso zzso analysis based upon on zzso zzso gene sequence comparison revealed that strain zzso belonged to zzso zzso zzso zzso showed highest similarity to the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and less than 97 % with other species of the zzso The zzso zzso value of strain zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was 55 and zzso zzso zzso The zzso data revealed the major zzso as zzso and dominant cellular fatty acids were summed feature 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the strain was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, zzso data, strain zzso can be differentiated from the zzso named members of zzso zzso and thus represents as a new species, for which the name, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
