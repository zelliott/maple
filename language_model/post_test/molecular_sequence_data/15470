The zzso position of a novel bacterial strain, zzso isolated from the zzso of rice zzso zzso zzso managed under zzso practice in zzso South Korea, was studied using zzso zzso zzso of the strain were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The novel strain grew at a temperature of zzso degrees C zzso at 28 degrees zzso Growth of the strain occurred between pH zzso and zzso with an optimum at pH zzso The zzso content of the total DNA was zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of the strain was most closely related to species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The novel strain showed zzso % similarity with other species of the zzso zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso major polar zzso zzso zzso and zzso and major fatty zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso : zzso iso and zzso : 1) iso zzso supported the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso data and zzso and zzso characteristics strongly supported the zzso and zzso differentiation of strain zzso from recognized species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, represents a novel member of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
