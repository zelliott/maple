The zzso zzso is important in cell growth, differentiation and zzso Several promoter elements have been identified as zzso for the induction of zzso by serum, tumor promoting agents, zzso growth factor and other zzso zzso including heat zzso zzso and cadmium can induce zzso transcription, but a heat shock element in the zzso promoter has not been zzso In this report we show that the induction of zzso by heat zzso zzso and cadmium can be zzso by the serum response zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso II, which has been proposed to be involved in serum induction via the serum response element, may also be involved in heat zzso zzso and cadmium induction of zzso
