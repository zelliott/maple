A zzso clone derived from zzso zzso of hog zzso virus zzso was identified using an zzso complementary to the zzso zzso a zzso from the putative zzso zzso zzso of the closely related bovine viral zzso virus zzso This clone served as a probe for screening different zzso zzso zzso After molecular cloning and zzso sequencing the zzso zzso was shown to consist of zzso zzso containing one long open reading zzso zzso comparison revealed a high degree of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso With respect to zzso the zzso of zzso contains an zzso coding for 90 zzso zzso
