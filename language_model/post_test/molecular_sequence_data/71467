A scaffold of zzso consisting of a pair of zzso tracts and several zzso is established during early development of the zzso zzso We report here that zzso a cell surface zzso is selectively expressed by a zzso of growing zzso in this scaffold in zzso zzso is present on two zzso one of which is a novel zzso of the neural cell zzso zzso zzso When the function of zzso was zzso using either soluble carbohydrates or zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso exhibited zzso growth at specific points in their zzso zzso is the zzso zzso guidance zzso essential for development of the zzso scaffold in the embryonic zzso zzso
