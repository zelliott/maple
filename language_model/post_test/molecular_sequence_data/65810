zzso proteins have important functions in cell growth and differentiation of zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso in malaria have recently shown strong promise as effective zzso In studying protein zzso in the malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso we have shown earlier that the incubation of zzso zzso cells with zzso precursors resulted in various size classes of labeled zzso To understand the zzso function of zzso proteins of malaria zzso that are targets of zzso zzso we searched the zzso database for proteins containing the zzso zzso zzso We have identified, among other potentially zzso zzso an zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso termed zzso Here, we show that zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso where it partially associates with zzso zzso and within a zzso of the food zzso Additionally, zzso targeting parallels that of zzso membrane zzso in developing zzso zzso zzso shows zzso activity that is zzso inhibited by a zzso zzso inhibitor suggesting that zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso zzso can also be zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity can be achieved with the zzso zzso which zzso to the zzso of zzso This study provides the first evidence for expression of zzso active zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso and demonstrates the potential of peptides derived from zzso zzso proteins as zzso zzso zzso
