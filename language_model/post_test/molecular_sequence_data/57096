We have used zzso cloning to isolate a zzso zzso that identified a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in rabbit vascular smooth muscle zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed one major open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the DNA as well as the putative protein sequence with various data bases revealed no zzso with other zzso In zzso translation of zzso zzso zzso generated a major zzso of 12 zzso zzso stimulation of zzso smooth muscle cells in culture induced a rapid increase in the level of zzso zzso zzso of this message was detected by 1 zzso peaked at approximately 4 zzso and became zzso by 12 zzso The induction of zzso by serum was completely blocked by zzso indicating its expression required prior protein zzso zzso growth factor, zzso zzso growth factor, and transforming growth zzso 1 also induced a strong increase in zzso zzso By contrast, zzso growth zzso was only able to mildly stimulate the level of zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso was unable to enhance zzso zzso There was a high level of zzso zzso in rabbit fetal muscle, zzso zzso and zzso a low level in fetal zzso and heart, and an zzso level in fetal liver, brain, as well as, in the zzso The expression of zzso in the corresponding adult zzso was low or zzso Our analysis indicate that zzso expression is zzso regulated and tightly controlled by growth factors, suggesting this novel gene has a role in cell growth and zzso
