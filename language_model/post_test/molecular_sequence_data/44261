The zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso a zzso that is able to grow on zzso as the sole carbon source, was cloned by means of the zzso chain reaction with two zzso zzso based on the zzso and zzso sequences of the zzso The zzso zzso gene coded for a protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of 34 zzso An identical zzso zzso gene was cloned from zzso DNA of the closely related strain zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was expressed up to zzso of the total cellular protein content in zzso coli zzso and the zzso zzso had a zzso of 21 zzso with zzso zzso acid sequence similarity of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso indicated that it belonged to the zzso fold zzso This conclusion was supported by secondary structure predictions and analysis of the secondary structure with circular zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are proposed to be zzso zzso and zzso Replacement of these zzso to zzso zzso and Ala, respectively, resulted in a dramatic loss of activity for zzso The reaction mechanism of zzso zzso proceeds via a zzso bound zzso zzso as was shown by single turnover experiments with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in which the zzso intermediate could be zzso
