zzso zzso zzso zzso is an inherited blinding condition zzso by abnormal development of the retinal zzso zzso has multiple modes of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso have recently been reported as underlying the zzso form of this zzso The aim of this study was to examine zzso in a zzso zzso zzso family and to clarify the eye and bone zzso associated with zzso zzso 

All family members were examined by slit lamp zzso and indirect zzso zzso to zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso constructing zzso and calculating zzso zzso zzso screening of zzso was performed by zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso DNA followed by direct zzso Bone mineral density zzso was evaluated in all family members using dual energy zzso ray zzso zzso 

The clinical features observed in this family were consistent with a diagnosis of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in all affected individuals and all unaffected family members screened were zzso carriers of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were features of the zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso can cause zzso with reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso Assessment of a patient with a provisional diagnosis of zzso should therefore include investigation of zzso with reduced levels suggestive of an underlying zzso zzso
