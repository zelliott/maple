The zzso zzso zzso zzso not only is responsible for zzso iron acquisition in zzso zzso but also is essential for zzso zzso colonization in animal zzso In this study, we determined the feasibility of targeting the zzso outer membrane protein zzso for immune protection against zzso zzso zzso of complete zzso sequences from 15 zzso zzso showed that the levels of zzso acid identity for zzso range from zzso to zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was dramatically induced under zzso conditions and was widespread and produced in 32 zzso primary strains from various sources and from geographically diverse zzso The zzso survey results were highly correlated with the results of an zzso growth promotion zzso and a zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene also impaired zzso growth promotion, suggesting that zzso is required for zzso zzso to sense zzso stress hormones during zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso in trans fully restored the production and function of zzso A growth zzso using zzso zzso zzso G demonstrated that specific zzso zzso could block the function of zzso which diminished zzso zzso growth promotion under zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso was dose zzso zzso analysis also indicated that zzso was expressed and zzso in chickens zzso infected with zzso zzso zzso acid substitution zzso demonstrated that zzso a basic zzso acid that is highly zzso in zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso acquisition in zzso zzso Together, these findings strongly suggest that zzso is a promising vaccine candidate for preventing and controlling zzso infection in humans and animal zzso
