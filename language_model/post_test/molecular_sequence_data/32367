We investigated the nature of the zzso cassette zzso zzso zzso elements and zzso zzso sites in a collection of 42 clinical zzso zzso of various species from zzso The zzso and zzso genes and the attachment sites zzso were identified by zzso Southern zzso zzso and DNA zzso We found 10 possibly new zzso types and one previously zzso zzso of zzso type III zzso complex A, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Eleven of 42 strains contained multiple copies of zzso suggesting the presence of mosaic structures composed of multiple SCC zzso zzso zzso contained zzso genes identical to those in zzso zzso zzso type IV but lacked zzso and zzso zzso Two new zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Also, the presumed functional version of zzso was found in a zzso zzso zzso strain and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Only minor differences in direct repeats in the left and right boundaries zzso were observed, while there was more variation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained several representatives of different zzso complexes and thus seemed to harbor multiple or composite new types of zzso The enormous diversity observed in the zzso elements implies a large zzso zzso in zzso
