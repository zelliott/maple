Here, we investigate the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso known as zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing, and zzso analyses of bacterial zzso zzso genes identified two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso belonging to the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso infection zzso in the host species and populations and were separately zzso within different zzso that constituted a pair of coherent zzso in the abdomen of the host insects, as in other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the novel zzso zzso exhibited infection zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso Although zzso in the above zzso zzso infections were detected in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso insects by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Two genetically distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso and related plant diseases, and zzso zzso zzso associated with rice yellow dwarf disease, were identified from the zzso These results highlight zzso complex zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and suggest ecological interactions between the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso within the same host insects, which may affect zzso competence of the zzso
