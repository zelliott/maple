A full-length zzso zzso of a size of zzso zzso for the goldfish zzso zzso has been zzso This zzso clone encodes a protein of 600 zzso acids zzso to zzso receptors of other zzso A zzso zzso analysis of the zzso indicates that the translated protein consists of a signal zzso of 22 zzso zzso an zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso a single zzso domain of 24 zzso zzso and an zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso Several characteristic landmarks of zzso zzso could be identified in this zzso These include the four zzso zzso zzso and the zzso motif within the zzso domain, and the box 1 and box 2 regions of the zzso zzso Among all the zzso zzso sequences known to date, this clone bears the closest resemblance to the zzso zzso zzso although zzso between these two fish zzso receptors is rather zzso There are only zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso acid sequence identities between these two fish zzso This zzso zzso was zzso into zzso cells for functional zzso zzso analysis with a pair of gene specific zzso indicate that the zzso was transcribed in the zzso zzso Using a cell proliferation zzso based on the reduction of the zzso salt zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso cells can be zzso to zzso upon the addition of zzso zzso in the culture zzso The tissue distribution of the zzso zzso in goldfish was studied by zzso analysis and by Northern zzso The results indicated that the zzso is expressed mostly in the zzso the zzso and the zzso of zzso corroborating with the zzso role of zzso in zzso In addition, an appreciable level of the zzso is also found in the brain and zzso of zzso Northern analysis showed that there are two transcript sizes, a major zzso zzso and a minor zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso
