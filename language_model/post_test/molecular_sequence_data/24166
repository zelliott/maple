We fused four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso promoter and transformed these zzso into zzso zzso Columbia wild type zzso The zzso TD forms consisted of our previously isolated double zzso zzso , and three new zzso zzso zzso , zzso , and zzso with single point zzso We employed zzso zzso to zzso the effects of zzso acid zzso in separate regulatory regions within the zzso zzso zzso zzso TD zzso and growth resistance to the zzso zzso toxic analog zzso zzso confirmed the zzso to feedback zzso and the viability of these zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso , appeared to influence one of the two separate zzso sites and had a notable zzso and zzso increase in free zzso zzso The zzso appeared to influence the other zzso site and resulted in a zzso increase in free zzso The transgenic zzso double zzso affecting both zzso sites, however, displayed a zzso increase in free zzso revealing a profound synergistic interplay between these separate zzso zzso While all of the four zzso zzso zzso resistance to elevated zzso of zzso the progeny of zzso initial zzso exhibited a bushy zzso at the zzso zzso On the other hand, progeny of zzso zzso , zzso , and zzso had a normal zzso zzso from wild zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso , and zzso , proved to be ideal as zzso dominant, zzso markers for plant zzso
