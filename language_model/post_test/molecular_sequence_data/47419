The spread of a zzso element family through a wild population may be of astonishing zzso At least three families of zzso genetic elements have recently invaded zzso zzso worldwide, including the P zzso The mechanism has been a process of effectively zzso zzso and, for the P element, has occurred notwithstanding the zzso induced by unrestricted zzso This zzso invasion into zzso zzso has been accompanied by the development of zzso between P zzso most of which now have internal zzso zzso evidence suggests that some deleted elements can repress P zzso thereby protecting the host from the harmful effects of complete zzso Such zzso elements may rise to high zzso in populations as a result of selection at the level of the zzso We here investigate selective sweeps invoked by the spread of P sequences in zzso zzso zzso Numerous zzso sites have been identified on the X zzso which differ in frequency between zzso and which are associated with repression of zzso zzso zzso sequences adjacent to zzso zzso sites do not show reduced levels of genetic diversity, and DNA zzso is in linkage equilibrium with the presence or absence of a P element at the adjacent selected zzso This might be explained by multiple insertions or through a selection for zzso analogous to that seen in zzso
