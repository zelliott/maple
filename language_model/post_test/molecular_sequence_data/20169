B cell zzso have been associated with chronic infections and zzso However, most zzso develop in the absence of any known chronic zzso zzso B cells process their highly diversified zzso zzso and present zzso unique zzso zzso zzso peptides on their major zzso complex zzso class II molecules to zzso T zzso We show that B cells chronically helped by zzso zzso cells developed into large B cell zzso with zzso DNA zzso The zzso expressed high amounts of Id, zzso class II, zzso and zzso and zzso collaborated with zzso zzso Thus, zzso class zzso Id peptides may represent a chronic zzso stimulus for T zzso zzso Eventually, B zzso grew independent of T zzso Thus, T cells do not only eliminate zzso as currently zzso In fact, zzso zzso cells can induce B zzso
