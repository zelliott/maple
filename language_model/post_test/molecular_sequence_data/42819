Previous investigations into the evolution of the zzso zzso gene family are extended by zzso and zzso DNA sequence comparisons of the zzso locus in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two separate statistical tests of the zzso hypothesis suggest that random genetic drift is responsible for virtually all of the observed zzso acid replacement zzso within the zzso zzso zzso incorporating the zzso zzso sequences are enigmatic due to the zzso of multiple zzso because the zzso test is not zzso to species comparisons that approach zzso zzso However, the data from zzso zzso are not inconsistent with selective zzso The ratio of zzso acid zzso within species to fixed differences between species imply that there are approximately 31 possible neutral zzso zzso zzso at this zzso zzso zzso are zzso distributed among the structural zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of synonymous zzso are analyzed with respect to zzso content and zzso bias, and are compared to other zzso from the same zzso
