A mechanism for the coupled zzso of zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso coli is proposed, based on a variety of experimental zzso The zzso is composed of 12 zzso rods that traverse the membrane with the N and C zzso on the zzso zzso Four zzso are irreplaceable with respect to zzso and the zzso are zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso In an adjacent region of the zzso at the interface between zzso VIII and V is the zzso zzso zzso Because of this arrangement, zzso changes between zzso VIII and V are transmitted to the interface between zzso IX and X and vice zzso Upon zzso zzso a structural change at the interface between zzso V and VIII zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso becomes zzso to water, which drastically increases its zzso In this zzso the zzso zzso a freely zzso zzso change that zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso To return to ground state after release of zzso the zzso interaction must be zzso which zzso loss of zzso from zzso The zzso is released into a zzso zzso between zzso IX and X which becomes zzso accessible to both sides of the membrane due to a change in zzso zzso where it is acted upon equally by either the membrane potential or the pH zzso across the zzso
