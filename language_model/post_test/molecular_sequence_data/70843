zzso has initially been identified as a component of zzso initiation complex of zzso zzso zzso Its role in zzso has been zzso In this paper, we report the characterization and functional analysis of both the zzso zzso large and small zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso is structurally more related to animal than to zzso zzso zzso has at least two genes for the large zzso and one for the small zzso Both types of genes are zzso transcribed in various plant zzso The proteins zzso by the zzso interact each other in zzso zzso zzso Only the zzso part of the large zzso is necessary for the interaction with the small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bind to zzso complex in gel shift zzso The large zzso of zzso can stimulate zzso in zzso and in plant cells when fused to a zzso domain binding to zzso sequences upstream of a minimal zzso This zzso activity is localized to a 35 zzso acid segment within the zzso zzso central zzso
