Human zzso growth factor II zzso zzso from a zzso library was isolated and zzso The zzso untranslated region zzso sequence of this zzso differs completely from that of adult human liver and has considerable base sequence identity to the same region of an zzso zzso of a rat liver cell line, zzso Human zzso zzso zzso was zzso with either the zzso of the isolated human zzso zzso zzso or the zzso of the zzso zzso obtained from adult human zzso No transcripts were detected by using the zzso of the adult liver zzso as the zzso In contrast, three transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected by using the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso as the probe or the probe from the coding zzso A fourth zzso transcript of zzso zzso presumably containing a zzso consisting of a base sequence dissimilar to that of either zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso transcripts detected may be products of alternative zzso as their zzso sequence is contained within the human zzso gene or they may be a consequence of alternative promoter zzso in zzso
