During the replication cycle of zzso delta virus zzso zzso editing occurs at position zzso on the zzso zzso zzso This changes an A to G in the amber termination zzso zzso of the small form of the delta zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso allows the translation of a larger form of the delta zzso with a zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso cells, we examined the editing potential of zzso zzso zzso from G to A at 1011 on the zzso adjacent to normal editing site at zzso Four procedures were used to study not only the editing of the A at zzso but also that of the new A at zzso zzso zzso sequencing, zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Five findings are zzso zzso Even after the zzso at zzso editing still occurred at zzso zzso Site 1011 itself now acted as a novel zzso zzso zzso Sites 1011 and zzso were edited zzso zzso At later times, both sites became zzso thereby allowing the synthesis of the large form of the delta zzso zzso zzso zzso Via zzso such double editing became apparent as a zzso event, in that groups of cells arose in which the changes had taken zzso zzso of these findings and of those from previous studies of the stability of the zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso supports both the recent zzso of zzso zzso editing as occurring on zzso zzso zzso and zzso personal zzso and the interpretation that editing occurs via the zzso zzso known as zzso
