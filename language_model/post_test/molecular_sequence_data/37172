The number of synonymous zzso per synonymous site zzso the number of zzso zzso per zzso site zzso and the zzso usage statistic zzso were calculated for several zzso A virus zzso zzso While zzso was similar to those of zzso zzso and zzso disease virus zzso zzso was 1 order of magnitude zzso The zzso zzso provides information on zzso usage bias and decreases when bias zzso The zzso value in zzso was about 38, while in zzso and zzso it was about zzso The emergence of 22 rare zzso in front of 8 in zzso and 7 in zzso was zzso Most of the zzso rare zzso of the zzso region were zzso located at the zzso borders of beta barrels and alpha zzso their potential function being the assurance of proper folding of the zzso proteins through a decrease in the translation zzso This strategic location was not observed for zzso acids zzso by the zzso rare zzso of the zzso zzso The percentage of bases with low pairing number values was higher in the latter region, suggesting a role of the zzso rare zzso in the maintenance of zzso zzso Many of the rare zzso in zzso are among the most frequent in humans, unlike in zzso or in zzso This fact may be explained by the lack of cellular zzso in zzso One hypothesis is that zzso has evolved in order to avoid competition with its host for cellular zzso
