The mechanism of resistance to zzso zzso and zzso B was studied in four zzso zzso strains that are mixed in a zzso administered to humans for prevention of gastrointestinal side effects due to oral zzso chemotherapy and in three reference strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An zzso gene called zzso which is related to the zzso genes zzso resistance to these antibiotics by zzso zzso was cloned from total DNA of zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence presented zzso identity with that of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of total DNA zzso by zzso followed by zzso with an zzso probe, indicated a zzso location of the gene in all zzso zzso zzso zzso attempts to transfer resistance to zzso by zzso from zzso zzso strains to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso
