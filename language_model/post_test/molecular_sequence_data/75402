Using a gel zzso zzso it was shown that the 87 zzso DNA zzso zzso containing the upstream zzso sequence zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene and a nuclear extract gave rise to three zzso species specific to zzso zzso or zzso of the nuclear extract revealed that these species were zzso zzso The precise binding region of the protein identified by zzso protection analysis was found to include a zzso sequence which forms a zzso zzso The amount of one of the three zzso species significantly increased when cells were grown in medium containing a zzso carbon zzso The introduction of zzso a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso a regulatory gene controlling the expression of several zzso zzso showed no effect on the amount of three zzso zzso
