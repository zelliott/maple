zzso is the zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso during DNA zzso In common with all DNA and zzso zzso zzso has structural and functional features involved in zzso zzso As zzso zzso it has structural and functional features for initiating chain zzso As a zzso it has structural and functional features for initiating chain synthesis on zzso Using zzso acid sequence analysis the structure of zzso coli zzso responsible for binding zzso at least three zzso and zzso zzso has been zzso One of the zzso binding motifs resembles the zzso zzso motif found in all DNA and zzso zzso This motif can be considered to be involved in zzso bond zzso The region with the zzso zinc binding motif is the most highly zzso portion, including more than zzso of identical zzso among bacterial zzso The function of the zinc finger may be to bind zzso in a zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso a sequence found in all zzso zzso which may be involved in chain zzso Many of the observations concerning primer synthesis initiation in zzso have been reproduced by several of the in zzso zzso zzso Important among these is that Okazaki fragments are initiated in zzso from zzso most of the zzso This zzso initiation specificity has been shown to be an intrinsic property of pure zzso in zzso Using artificial zzso templates, zzso has been shown to be the zzso and most zzso zzso yet zzso The zzso step is the first zzso bond zzso Any protein which can influence either the zzso synthesis rate or zzso binding affinity will also play a key role in the regulation of primer synthesis zzso
