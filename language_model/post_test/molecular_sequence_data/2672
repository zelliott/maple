To zzso the role of the zzso zzso in the engineered signal sequence that directs the zzso of human zzso in zzso zzso we have remodeled an idealized signal sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the vicinity of the zzso zzso By analyzing the zzso capability of 10 engineered signal zzso we have shown the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is important for the zzso of human zzso and is allowed at position zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso capability of the engineered signal sequences is correlated with their predicted zzso zzso The functional signal sequences that we have investigated can be generalized as zzso zzso where zzso equals zzso and zzso is zzso Ala, or zzso or can be zzso
