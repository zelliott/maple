Recent studies have demonstrated that depletion of zzso acids results in the induction of several genes and that a zzso zzso termed zzso acid response element zzso is required for the zzso System zzso is an zzso zzso acid transport system highly specific for zzso and zzso and its activity is known to be induced by zzso zzso This zzso is composed of two protein zzso zzso and zzso heavy chain, and zzso is thought to mediate the transport zzso In the present study, the molecular mechanism for the induction of zzso by zzso acid deprivation has been zzso In mouse zzso cells, the activity of system zzso and zzso zzso is induced not only by deprivation of zzso but also by deprivation of other zzso zzso Two zzso each located in the opposite direction with an intervening zzso were found in the zzso region of the mouse zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that both zzso were necessary for the zzso induction of zzso zzso in response to the zzso acid zzso zzso deprivation had no effect on the induction of the activity of system zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that zzso but not zzso is involved in the zzso acid control of zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a new member of the proteins whose zzso control by the zzso acid deprivation is zzso by zzso
