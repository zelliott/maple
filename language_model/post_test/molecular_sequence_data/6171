zzso regulates the copper incorporation and zzso of zzso zzso zzso via a zzso competent complex zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso are known to play important roles in this zzso activity of zzso In this study, we studied the side chain requirement at these two zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso charged, or zzso zzso acid resulted in complete zzso of the zzso activity but no effect on its zzso When similar zzso acid zzso were introduced at zzso both the zzso and the zzso activity of zzso were blocked to different zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity of the zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso could be partially zzso by in zzso copper zzso zzso the defects in the zzso zzso protein did not impair the formation of the zzso zzso complex, but rather produced an incompetent zzso In zzso our results reveal that zzso and zzso of zzso play different roles in zzso zzso In particular, zzso of zzso plays a pivotal role in regulation of the copper incorporation but not the zzso of zzso while zzso plays a dual role in both the zzso and the zzso of zzso
