Using the zzso chain reaction technique with degenerative zzso we obtained from a rat zzso zzso library a zzso fragment, zzso that exhibited considerable zzso to known receptors that belong to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to this zzso were used as zzso to obtain a full-length zzso from the rat zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid protein with seven putative zzso zzso that are characteristic of G zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso to recently cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared from zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso showed specific binding of zzso thus identifying the zzso clone as a novel zzso zzso zzso binding competition analysis using zzso zzso and a number of zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was the most potent competitor of zzso zzso with a approximately zzso greater affinity for the zzso than that of zzso In addition, binding of zzso was markedly reduced in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso indicating zzso of zzso receptors to zzso G proteins in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso thus confirming that the zzso zzso encodes a functional zzso zzso By Northern zzso analysis, a approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso was present in the zzso but not in the liver, small zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Lack of zzso zzso expression in the brain was confirmed by in zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, we report the cloning of a novel rat zzso zzso zzso termed zzso that has marked preferential affinity for zzso and is linked to zzso of zzso zzso
