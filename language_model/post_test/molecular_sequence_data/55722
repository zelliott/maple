Three zzso zzso where the zzso sequence of zzso was converted to zzso zzso and zzso were prepared to investigate the effect of zzso zzso on the stabilization of zzso The free energy changes of zzso for the unfolding in zzso solution at pH zzso and 35 degrees C were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for wild type, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When the energy level in the unfolded state of wild type zzso was fixed at a standard level, the energy levels in the folded state of zzso and zzso zzso were found to be higher than that of wild type zzso on the basis of delta zzso and zzso losses of their zzso chains in the unfolded zzso The presence of some strain in the folded state of these zzso was supported by both the calculation of zzso energy for a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso and the analysis of structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso it is concluded that the formation of the zzso sequence is effective in avoiding possible strain in the folded state of a protein caused by the introduction of zzso zzso
