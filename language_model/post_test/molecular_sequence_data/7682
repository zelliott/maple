DNA zzso at the promoter region of zzso genes is associated with the maintenance of X zzso in zzso One of the zzso DNA binding zzso zzso that binds to zzso bases in DNA is zzso by a gene zzso located on the mouse X zzso zzso To determine whether this gene was expressed from the inactive X zzso and zzso zzso zzso system in which expression from the zzso zzso on the inactive X zzso could be zzso was zzso zzso from these experiments indicate that zzso is subject to X zzso in zzso
