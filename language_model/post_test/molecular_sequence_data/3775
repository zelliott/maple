A zzso protein expressed in rat zzso zzso bed zzso zzso with zzso zzso ability was previously zzso This zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso seems to be the only representative of this family of zzso to be zzso outside the zzso tract and implicated in the generation of zzso zzso The cloning and sequencing of the zzso for the rat zzso zzso by using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction are zzso The sequence of this zzso was found to be identical to the sequence of the rat pancreatic zzso the zzso is zzso zzso in length plus a zzso zzso tail and encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the putative zzso acids in the extended zzso I binding site of the rat zzso zzso reveals features that could explain the zzso zzso activity required for efficient conversion of zzso I to zzso zzso Additionally, the sequence reveals structural features that could contribute to the lack of activity of this zzso toward zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso arteries and lung but not in zzso These results may also indicate that rat zzso zzso is expressed in resistance vessels but not in zzso zzso
