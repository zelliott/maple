zzso in zzso Finger zzso of the zzso 3 zzso cause zzso zzso and isolated cardiovascular zzso Recent data suggest a potential zzso role for zzso in zzso via regulation of zzso and zzso We sought to develop a zzso zzso mouse to model human zzso and investigate zzso mechanisms underlying zzso in cardiac zzso 

zzso zzso mice were created by targeted zzso of a zzso cassette and investigated by zzso zzso and molecular zzso 

zzso zzso expression is sufficient for partial rescue of viability as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso of early zzso molecular marker abnormalities and later zzso abnormalities suggests that the primary effect of zzso in heart development occurs during zzso zzso zzso gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso marked the proper zzso locations in the heart regardless of looping zzso 

zzso zzso mice are useful models to investigate the variable cardiac defects resulting from a single genetic zzso zzso zzso expression zzso the left pulmonary zzso identified in zzso zzso zzso Our data do not support a direct role for zzso in the zzso via regulation of zzso and zzso and suggest that the primary effect of zzso on cardiac development occurs during zzso zzso
