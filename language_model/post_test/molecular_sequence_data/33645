Recently, zzso chain zzso estimates of visual zzso spectral tuning from zzso DNA have offered an alternative to the authoritative but rather slow and complicated retinal zzso zzso The zzso DNA method involves sequencing a zzso of the zzso sensitive zzso type 1 zzso zzso gene covering zzso acid positions 86, 90, and 93 and has been zzso in a wide range of avian zzso Other key tuning sites have been proposed but not zzso in the zzso zzso spectral sensitivity zzso We have designed 5 new zzso for sequencing gene fragments of the zzso zzso zzso gene containing the first, second and third, and sixth and seventh zzso zzso regions and the spectral tuning sites 49, 86, 90, 93, zzso 118 and zzso Testing these zzso on various bird species reveals some novel combinations of zzso acid zzso at the tuning zzso The potential significance of these on spectral tuning is zzso
