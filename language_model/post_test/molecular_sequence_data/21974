zzso zzso that is zzso by zzso genes has a profound effect on zzso baking and zzso quality of bread zzso In this study, 219 zzso and 166 historical zzso from China and 12 introduced zzso were investigated for their kernel zzso and zzso zzso using molecular and zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso of soft, mixed and hard zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in Chinese zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in historical zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in hard wheat of zzso while zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in historical hard zzso A new zzso zzso designated zzso was identified in two zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso province, with the characterization of a zzso to zzso substitution at position 47 in the coding region of zzso zzso Surprisingly, a new zzso zzso designated zzso was detected in the zzso zzso from the zzso province, with the characterization of a zzso to zzso substitution at position 35 in the coding region of Pina zzso it was the first novel zzso found in bread zzso resulting in a hard zzso with zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso an zzso designed as zzso was detected in five zzso with a zzso deletion at position 265 in Pina zzso while another novel zzso zzso designed as zzso was identified in six zzso with the characterization of an zzso acid change from zzso to a zzso zzso in the coding region of Pina zzso The study of zzso zzso in Chinese wheat zzso could provide useful information for the further understanding of the molecular basis of kernel zzso in bread zzso
