zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and their expressions were analyzed by real-time zzso chain reaction zzso to assess hypotheses on the evolutionary origin of the zzso in the zzso In young shoot zzso zzso is expressed in the shoot zzso while zzso is expressed in the scale leaf zzso the shoot zzso This expression pattern is shared by other zzso suggesting that the expression patterns of zzso and zzso are useful as molecular markers to identify the shoot and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso is not zzso to either the shoot or zzso but that it has a double organ zzso
