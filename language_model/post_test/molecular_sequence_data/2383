The zzso of a zzso DNA repair zzso zzso was cloned by screening an embryonic zzso zzso expression library with an zzso that was originally prepared against a zzso human zzso (AP) zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso mapped to a region on the third zzso where a number of zzso zzso were zzso The zzso clone yielded an in zzso translation product of 35,000 zzso in agreement with the predicted size of the translation product of the only open reading frame of zzso and identical to the molecular size of an zzso zzso activity recovered following sodium zzso zzso gel zzso of zzso zzso The zzso portion of the predicted protein contained regions of zzso zzso zzso while the DNA sequence at the zzso end of zzso showed similarity to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso is expressed as an abundant zzso zzso that is detected throughout the life cycle of zzso zzso Another zzso zzso also zzso to the zzso zzso but this species was restricted to the early stages of zzso
