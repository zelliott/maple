We have used differential scanning zzso to measure the effect of replacements of zzso 65 on zzso stability of the isolated zzso domain of tissue zzso zzso zzso The role of this site in stability was examined because a human zzso zzso having this zzso zzso 245 in zzso zzso replaced with a zzso has been described zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Patent Application zzso zzso zzso of zzso having zzso 65 replaced with Met, zzso zzso zzso Ala, or zzso were constructed by using zzso zzso in conjunction with a restricted site selection zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli and zzso as previously described for the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso & Kelley, zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso None of these zzso results in a significant zzso of the native zzso of zzso as judged by zzso circular zzso and equilibrium dialysis zzso of zzso zzso A two-state analysis of the heat capacity profile observed for heating a solution of zzso zzso zzso containing 100 zzso zzso pH zzso provides values of zzso zzso zzso degrees C for zzso zzso zzso 81 zzso 5 zzso for delta H zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for delta C zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso in the pH range 3-6 as indicated by the observation of similar heat capacity profiles for consecutive heating cycles and also recovery of zzso and zzso binding properties upon cooling the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
