A zzso zzso in the putative zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is found only in zzso zzso species and is proposed to play roles in zzso capture, retention and passage to the zzso zzso Here, zzso was replaced with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity and zzso levels at least as high as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all contained substantial zzso zzso The zzso exhibited diverse patterns of native (no zzso zzso activity and a range of defects in zzso growth and in zzso zzso synthesis at pH zzso zzso synthesis by the Ala, zzso and His zzso was also impaired at pH zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso Thus zzso plays a role when the zzso force is reduced at near neutral, not just at high zzso The zzso zzso exhibited no zzso synthesis activity in the zzso setting although activity was reported for a zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Cook, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The hypothesis that zzso from extreme zzso and the zzso represent distinct zzso was supported by demonstration of the importance of additional zzso zzso zzso not found in the zzso for zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso Finally, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with switched positions of zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso 5) retained significant coupled zzso activity accompanied by zzso zzso
