zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was sensitive to zzso zzso zzso when grown at 37 degrees C but not when grown at 22 degrees C because of zzso hindrance by abundant zzso zzso zzso chain zzso expressed at 22 degrees zzso The zzso library of zzso was grown at 37 degrees C and screened for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three types of zzso were isolated: zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not expressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso was characterized in detail; the zzso zzso zzso an zzso named the zzso zzso The main findings based on this zzso are: zzso the zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of the zzso outer core in zzso the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso revealed eight novel genes showing similarly to known zzso zzso genes of various zzso bacteria as well as to capsule zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the core of zzso involves at least two genetic zzso zzso the zzso zzso is required for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso is zzso to the inner core in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is located between the zzso and zzso gene pairs in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in many but not in all zzso zzso zzso The results also allow us to speculate that the zzso zzso is a relic of the ancestral zzso region of zzso zzso zzso carrying genes indispensable for the completion of the core zzso zzso
