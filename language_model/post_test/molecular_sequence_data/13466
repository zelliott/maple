The coronavirus spike protein S is assumed to mediate essential biological functions, including recognition of target zzso Earlier studies from our and other groups identified two regions of the zzso S zzso protein possibly implicated in such zzso The first of these zzso to the 224 zzso acid zzso region which is deleted in zzso the respiratory zzso of zzso We have examined the zzso for the newborn zzso of a series of zzso escape zzso zzso an S protein zzso in this zzso Several zzso acid changes were correlated with a dramatic loss of zzso thus indicating that crucial zzso are associated with this domain of zzso The second region of potential relevance is the major zzso zzso zzso expression of 150 to 220 zzso zzso stretches encompassing this region, which is zzso by both zzso and zzso was zzso The zzso zzso proteins were shown to react with the zzso zzso and to bind zzso specifically, thus zzso the zzso site on the S primary zzso zzso these data lend support to the view that a domain of S protein structurally distinct from the zzso binding site is required for the virus to express its enteric zzso
