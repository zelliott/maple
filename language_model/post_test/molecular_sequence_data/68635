The three-dimensional X-ray structure of zzso zzso from zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso 107 zzso 4 zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution, by the method of molecular replacement, using the zzso part of the refined structure of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso of zzso zzso were obtained with space group zzso a zzso zzso A, c zzso zzso A, Z zzso 12, corresponding to two independent molecules in the zzso zzso The structure was refined to an zzso of zzso The structures of the two molecules are zzso compared with each other and also with that of zzso zzso The zzso atoms are, for the three structures, generally within zzso zzso The zzso zzso edge to edge distances and zzso angles indicate two groups of zzso zzso distances are associated with zzso angles, while longer distances with acute zzso Moreover, two of the four zzso II and IV, are close to only one other zzso while the remaining two zzso I and III, have two close neighbors zzso The two zzso zzso that zzso the zzso irons on the fifth and sixth positions are nearly zzso except in the case of zzso zzso The only substitution from zzso which is inside the zzso zzso occurs in the vicinity of that same zzso However, the zzso between the two zzso zzso zzso was also observed in zzso zzso II has a zzso higher exposure to zzso and one of the lowest zzso zzso in the fully oxidized forms of the two zzso A comparison between data obtained by zzso techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance and electron zzso zzso and the structural results presented here, indicates two types of zzso between zzso I and II and between zzso III and zzso
