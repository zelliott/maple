zzso zzso zzso is a genetic disorder characterized by zzso of elastic fibers in zzso zzso and cardiovascular zzso Recently, zzso zzso were identified as causing zzso In this follow-up study we report the investigation of 61 German zzso patients from 53 families, zzso the largest cohort of German zzso patients screened for the complete zzso zzso In addition, we characterized the zzso zzso promoter of zzso patients according to zzso In this study we identified 32 zzso zzso zzso which had been described previously by us and others, and 10 novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso site zzso The zzso detection rate among index patients was zzso zzso zzso were the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the zzso promoter we found the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The difference in the zzso zzso C zzso between zzso patients and controls were determined as statistically zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso C is located in a zzso zzso sequence of the zzso promoter and occurred in a binding site for a zzso zzso predominantly found in genes that participate in zzso zzso zzso these genetic data zzso our contribution to zzso the zzso of zzso
