The zzso Rev protein plays a pivotal role in viral zzso and therefore, zzso of its function should block the progression of the zzso immune zzso syndrome zzso Here, zzso molecules have been shown to inhibit import of the zzso Rev protein into zzso of zzso zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed in nuclear extracts from zzso cells by binding to either zzso zzso or zzso molecules immobilized on a zzso zzso Using this method together with zzso zzso we determined that nuclear import of Rev is inhibited by the addition of a zzso zzso which routinely is used as a source of nuclear import zzso This zzso was released by treatment with the zzso zzso Also zzso molecules and the zzso zzso zzso zzso the second stem structure of the Rev responsive element zzso of the viral zzso inhibit Rev nuclear zzso Similar results were obtained when zzso molecules with zzso attached zzso rich motif zzso peptides were used as a nuclear transport zzso indicating that the nuclear import zzso of the Rev protein is due to the presence of the zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso molecules inhibit the interaction between the zzso region and zzso zzso zzso that the zzso prevents the formation of the import zzso The implication of our results for the regulation of the nuclear import of Rev as well as for the use of zzso molecules as zzso drugs is zzso
