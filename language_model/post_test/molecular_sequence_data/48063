We have applied the method described in the preceding paper zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1999) zzso 38, zzso zzso zzso selection using zzso display, to explore the sequence requirements for packing in the zzso core of zzso In contrast to the parent zzso which was a structurally compromised zzso the selected zzso could be zzso and zzso in yields for structural zzso In particular, CD and zzso zzso showed that the zzso folded correctly to stable zzso zzso These points demonstrate the utility of our zzso method for stabilizing and redesigning zzso In addition and in contrast to zzso studies on other zzso which suggest that zzso zzso permit zzso provided that zzso and core volumes are generally zzso we find that the core of zzso is surprisingly intolerant of zzso acid zzso zzso that survived our selection showed a clear consensus for the zzso zzso It is probable that our results differed from those from other groups for two zzso First, zzso may be unusual in that it has strict sequence requirements for its structure and zzso We discuss this result in light of sequence conservation in the zzso zzso and proteins of the zzso structural zzso Second, our zzso were selected solely on the basis of stability, in contrast to the other studies that rely on zzso zzso The latter may lead to proteins that are more plastic and tolerant of zzso
