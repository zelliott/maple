The zzso acid sequence zzso which is probably located in a zzso structure, has been identified as a protein destruction signal in the rapidly zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso within this sequence reduced the zzso of the zzso zzso toward zzso and degradation in rabbit zzso zzso This signal is zzso since zzso zzso zzso which is a poor zzso zzso system zzso was found to be zzso and zzso when the signal sequence was either generated at an internal location in the protein or fused to the N zzso An evaluation of the behavior of zzso zzso proteins containing zzso in the signal region indicates that considerable zzso in the primary structure is zzso although the conservation of certain features appears to be required for signal zzso Two zzso zzso zzso that recognize the zzso virus zzso zzso as a zzso were also partially zzso One of these was identified as the previously described zzso and this was shown to require the destruction signal sequence to catalyze efficiently the zzso of the zzso zzso The other is a zzso zzso that appears to recognize a different, unidentified feature of the zzso zzso
