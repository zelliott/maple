The efficacy of zzso zzso in zzso control is mainly affected by various adverse environmental factors, such as heat shock and zzso radiation, and by responses of the host zzso such as zzso stress, zzso stress and zzso In this study, an zzso zzso gene zzso was cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso to various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was adapted to analyze the role of zzso in zzso and tolerance to adverse environmental and host insect zzso 

Compared with the wild type, the zzso growth of the zzso zzso was decreased in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso plates, respectively, demonstrating that zzso affected zzso zzso The zzso levels were also reduced in zzso liquid culture, and zzso zzso restored the growth of zzso zzso These findings suggested that zzso is involved in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso led to a reduction in zzso after injection or topical zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso grew much slower than the wild type in the zzso of locust in zzso and in zzso thus demonstrating that zzso affects the zzso of zzso zzso via zzso growth inside the host zzso A plate zzso indicated that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso under zzso stress, zzso stress, heat shock and zzso radiation was decreased compared with the wild zzso 

zzso is required for zzso and tolerance to zzso stress, zzso stress, heat shock and zzso zzso zzso affects zzso zzso via zzso growth inside the insect and tolerance against zzso stress, zzso stress and locust zzso
