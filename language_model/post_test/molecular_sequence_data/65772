zzso the major cause of cancer death, is a zzso process that requires interactions between cancer cells and zzso cells and between cancer cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the tumor zzso have a considerable impact on the zzso process during zzso Here we report that elevated expression of zzso zzso growth factor, zzso an zzso zzso protein zzso by colon cancer cells, is associated with high-grade human colon zzso zzso expression of the zzso protein enhanced the aggressiveness and altered the zzso properties of colon cancer cells in zzso zzso of zzso expression dramatically reduced zzso zzso zzso appears to promote zzso a critical step in the zzso dissemination of cancer cells, by inducing the zzso of zzso junctions between zzso cells via zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso Thus, zzso associated with zzso of zzso may have an increased zzso potential, leading to poor prognosis in cancer zzso
