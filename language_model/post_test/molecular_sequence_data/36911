zzso of the zzso gene are responsible for type I zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso genetic syndrome with a broad zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be associated with no zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso small to moderate amounts of zzso zzso yellow zzso or unusual zzso patterns zzso zzso zzso A total of 26 zzso of this gene have been described in type I zzso Analysis of all known zzso zzso zzso zzso 17) shows that most cluster in three areas of the coding zzso Two clusters involve the copper A or copper B binding sites and may disrupt the metal zzso interaction necessary for zzso function and the third cluster is located in zzso zzso Computer modeling of the secondary structure of the copper binding regions based on zzso with the known crystal structure of zzso show that they both consist of two alpha zzso containing three zzso zzso that complex to a single copper zzso zzso in the copper B binding region lie in the region between the two alpha zzso that consists of a loop zzso These zzso may affect zzso activity by either altering the position of the alpha zzso zzso and thus preventing proper copper binding to the zzso zzso or affecting a zzso or zzso binding site located between the two alpha zzso zzso
