zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a site that previously had been contaminated with high zzso of the heavy metals cadmium (3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This strain was able to grow on complex zzso zzso medium containing high zzso of cadmium zzso (up to 4 zzso Additionally, it could remove up to zzso of the dissolved zzso but only after reaching stationary growth zzso zzso zzso also tolerated high zzso of other heavy metals such as zzso zzso copper, nickel, and lead at levels more than 2 zzso Although strain zzso can tolerate much higher cadmium zzso than the three zzso zzso strains tested, they all possess resistance to the same range of zzso This suggests that strain zzso possesses a mechanism that allows it to tolerate and remove cadmium differently from those zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso can be a suitable candidate for heavy metal zzso in contaminated environment because it is able to tolerate high concentration of heavy metals and remove cadmium zzso
