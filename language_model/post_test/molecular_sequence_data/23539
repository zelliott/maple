zzso are zzso receptors for zzso that contain an zzso zzso zzso motif zzso and inhibit zzso zzso zzso motif zzso cell zzso When zzso with zzso zzso zzso become zzso and recruit the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which mediate zzso The zzso zzso was proposed to be necessary and sufficient for recruiting zzso We show here that a second zzso motif in the zzso domain of zzso is required for zzso to be zzso with the zzso This motif functions as a zzso site for the zzso zzso adapters zzso and zzso These adapters interact via their zzso zzso domain with zzso to form a stable zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are required for an optimal zzso of zzso with zzso but one adapter is sufficient for the zzso to zzso in a zzso manner with the zzso In addition to zzso the recruitment of zzso the second zzso motif may zzso upon zzso the properties of scaffold proteins capable of altering the composition and stability of the signaling complexes generated following zzso zzso
