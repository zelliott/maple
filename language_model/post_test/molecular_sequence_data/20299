zzso and zzso studies of neurodegenerative disorders require complementary approaches to integrate the massive amount of data generated in high zzso experimental zzso We propose a zzso pipeline in which expression studies guide the selection of candidate genes that should be screened for potential new genetic variations from a public expressed site tags zzso zzso zzso by the former interest of our group in genetic zzso involved with the immune system, we selected five genes from a previous expression zzso study of zzso zzso zzso zzso area of Alzheimer's Disease subjects zzso The zzso zzso Combined version zzso was initially used to build zzso and zzso files retrieved respectively from the zzso of University of California Santa Cruz zzso and National Center for Biotechnology Information zzso databases and latter to perform multiple batches of zzso zzso A total of 116 zzso sequences were selected after proper stringent parameters were applied to the first set of zzso The zzso revealed various classes of variations, most of them deletions zzso zzso this specific group, some were zzso deletions (35) and the virtual translation of a few others zzso were predicted to induce no change other than a single zzso zzso with no subsequent repercussions at the protein zzso In addition, the analysis identified transitions zzso zzso (52), synonymous zzso zzso zzso and deletions in 36 zzso located in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are often associated to major zzso syndromes with zzso zzso However, various recent studies show that common zzso might be highly associated with common zzso disorders such as zzso zzso mental zzso or even in various zzso detected in whole zzso sequencing zzso A virtual validation confirmed that some of the variations identified were previously reported and confirmed in DNA samples, showing that this method is a feasible way to detect genetic variations that merit further exploration in zzso genetic risk factor association zzso
