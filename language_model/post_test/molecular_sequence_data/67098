Ewing zzso zzso zzso a member of a large family of zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso domain zzso and a zzso zzso domain zzso Due to its zzso properties zzso protein is involved in processes such as gene zzso zzso processing and zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso proteins generated by zzso zzso cause zzso zzso zzso protein is located predominantly in the nucleus, but was found also in the zzso and associated with the cell zzso The zzso responsible for the nuclear zzso of the protein were as yet zzso We identified the nuclear zzso signal of zzso protein at its C zzso zzso which is required for the nuclear import and retention of the zzso The zzso sequence is zzso in related zzso suggesting an zzso function also in these zzso Two zzso zzso due to their positive charge, a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso are essential for zzso zzso The nuclear zzso of zzso protein is independent of the regions in zzso containing numerous zzso zzso sites, zzso and zinc finger zzso zzso in zzso guide the zzso partition of zzso protein and contain another but different zzso that allows zzso shuttling of the zzso zzso
