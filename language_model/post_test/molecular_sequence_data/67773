We used next generation sequencing to detect the zzso zzso zzso zzso for the first time in lone star ticks zzso zzso from the eastern United zzso 177 individuals and 11 tick pools from seven sites in four states were tested by zzso with zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso targeting variable regions zzso Average infection prevalence was zzso across all surveyed populations zzso zzso and only the site with the smallest sample size zzso was zzso Three zzso differing by zzso in a zzso region of zzso zzso gene were zzso Two zzso zzso in sites in North Carolina and New York, but were not observed in the same tick at those zzso The third zzso was found only in zzso zzso analysis of this zzso indicated that the three zzso are more closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso from other tick species than to each zzso This variation suggests that multiple independent introductions occurred in zzso zzso which may provide insight into bacterial spread within its zzso and zzso on this zzso Whether the presence of this zzso affects acquisition or maintenance of other pathogens and zzso in zzso zzso or the survival, biology and evolution of the tick itself is zzso
