We have identified a zzso essential zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso shows very high zzso acid sequence identity to zzso zzso from other organisms, suggesting that zzso is involved in protein zzso and possibly degradation during zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of the zzso protein to zzso the zzso pattern of protein zzso is altered in zzso zzso zzso cells are blocked in the ability to properly execute the zzso transition that occurs between the induction of zzso gene expression during mound formation and the induction of zzso differentiation and subsequent zzso zzso cells zzso on zzso form mounds with normal zzso however, they remain at this stage for approximately 10 h before forming multiple tips and fingers that then zzso Under other conditions, some of the fingers form zzso zzso but no culmination is zzso In zzso cells, zzso gene transcripts accumulate to very high levels and do not decrease significantly with time as they do in zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes is very delayed, with the level of zzso gene expression being significantly reduced compared with that in zzso zzso zzso reporter studies using zzso regulated and zzso promoters suggest that zzso cells show an unusually elevated level of zzso of zzso reporters expressed in zzso cells, a regulatory cell population found scattered throughout the aggregate, and reduced zzso of a zzso zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso containing predominantly zzso cells are able to undergo terminal differentiation but show altered spatial zzso In contrast, in zzso containing only a small fraction of zzso cells, the mature zzso body is very small and composed almost exclusively of zzso cells, with the zzso cells being present as a mass of cells located in extreme zzso of the developing zzso The zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso open reading frame zzso and the analysis of the zzso zzso suggest that tip formation and subsequent development requires specific protein zzso and possibly zzso
