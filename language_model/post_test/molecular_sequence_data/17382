The zzso zzso type strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso highly related to the iron zzso zzso produced by the fish pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso This paper reports the initial characterization of the genes and gene products involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in the isolation of several derivatives whose ability to grow in medium containing the iron zzso zzso was zzso One of the insertions disrupted a gene zzso a predicted zzso zzso named zzso highly similar to zzso the zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso was confirmed by Western zzso zzso Another zzso zzso was mapped to a gene zzso a protein highly similar to zzso the zzso component of the zzso transport zzso Further DNA sequencing and zzso sequence analysis revealed that these zzso zzso zzso genes are part of a zzso locus that contains the zzso zzso While the translation products of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the product of zzso is related to the zzso component of zzso zzso cassette (ABC) transport zzso This entire locus is flanked by genes zzso predicted proteins related to zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins required for the zzso of zzso These protein similarities, as well as the structural similarity of zzso and zzso suggested that these two zzso could be zzso by both bacterial zzso a possibility that was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that these zzso which cause serious infections in unrelated zzso express very similar zzso zzso zzso
