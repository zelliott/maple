Genes zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso of 16 zzso zzso from humans and other animals were amplified by the zzso chain reaction, and the corresponding fragments were cloned and zzso zzso of these sequences with the previously reported ones indicated the presence of 7 different sequence patterns in the highly variable regions of the small zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstruction analysis using zzso zzso as the zzso clearly demonstrated that the 7 groups with the different sequence patterns are separated to form independent zzso 5 of which consisted of the zzso zzso from both humans zzso zzso and other zzso The presence of 3 higher order zzso was also clearly supported in the zzso zzso However, a relationship among the 4 groups including these 3 higher order zzso was not settled with statistical zzso The remarkable zzso of small zzso zzso zzso among different zzso zzso found in this study confirmed, with zzso evidence, that these organisms are genetically highly divergent in spite of their zzso zzso The highly variable small zzso zzso zzso regions among the distinct groups will provide useful information for the development of zzso diagnostic zzso
