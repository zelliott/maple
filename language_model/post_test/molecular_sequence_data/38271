zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso to zzso in six zzso Based on the sequence of 3 internal peptides obtained by zzso zzso of the native zzso a set of zzso zzso zzso was used to amplify a zzso segment of zzso corresponding to a portion of the zzso zzso zzso A second round of zzso using specific zzso was used to prepare a zzso zzso segment, which was used to screen an zzso zzso zzso library prepared using zzso resulting in the identification and sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by an open reading frame zzso of 960 zzso corresponding to a protein of 320 zzso acids with a predicted zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the sequence of the previously described zzso zzso from zzso zzso revealed a zzso of identity at the zzso acid level and a zzso identity at the deduced zzso acid level between the zzso zzso from the two different zzso zzso zzso was used to insert the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene into the zzso expression zzso zzso Cloning of the zzso construct into zzso coli zzso and zzso into the expression host zzso coli zzso zzso after induction with zzso soluble zzso zzso as zzso of total zzso The zzso zzso zzso which was zzso zzso to zzso appeared to be identical in all respects with the native zzso zzso zzso displaying essentially the same zzso kinetic zzso with a zzso of 15 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using zzso to amplify the zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso DNA revealed the presence of 2 zzso identical in relative location but different in both sequence and length compared to the corresponding zzso gene of zzso zzso
