zzso cells are located at the bases of zzso zzso and their zzso zzso contain large amounts of zzso We previously showed that administration of zzso zzso a zinc zzso to rats induced the selective death of zzso zzso This was followed by a transient wave of zzso cell proliferation in the entire zzso In the study described here, we again applied this experimental model in an attempt to identify novel zzso factors in the small zzso Male zzso rats were injected with zzso and killed 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were extracted from the terminal zzso for the construction of a zzso zzso This library was then zzso into the human zzso cell line zzso and the cells that continued to grow in the medium containing only zzso zzso were zzso One of the zzso sequences identified from those zzso experiments was the full-length rat zzso zzso zzso To confirm the zzso effect of this zzso we zzso it into zzso cells zzso These clones proliferated in the medium containing only zzso zzso while the control clones failed to show any zzso zzso zzso stress exerted by the addition of zzso zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso partially suppressed the growth of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso expression in rat zzso after zzso treatment was altered in accordance with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso also showed zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso These studies identify rat zzso as a zzso factor for zzso zzso zzso
