The zzso coding for human skeletal muscle zzso was expressed in zzso coli to produce an zzso zzso This zzso was deleted from the sequence corresponding to the zzso 9 and expressed in zzso coli to produce an zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso The main structural and functional properties of the two isolated zzso designated zzso and zzso respectively, were characterized in comparison with those of the genuine rabbit skeletal muscle alpha zzso The folding and zzso stability of the three zzso were zzso zzso but not zzso was zzso in the presence of zzso and did bind to zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso Despite its weak binding to zzso zzso displayed a regulatory function in the presence of zzso with a marked zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso and low zzso of zzso The data were interpreted in the light of the zzso models of regulation and suggest the involvement of the sequence coded by zzso 9 in the stabilization by zzso of the off state of the thin zzso
