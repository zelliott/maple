We report here zzso sequence and characterization of gene 11 from two tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso strains of zzso Gene 11 sequence encodes a zzso zzso zzso and also encodes zzso from an out of phase open reading zzso zzso of zzso gene 11 represents the first report from a zzso zzso which has more than zzso zzso at the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence level with that of its closely related zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene sequence differed from that of published zzso zzso at three zzso positions, one at 264 zzso to zzso another a zzso zzso zzso at position 388 and the third, a deletion zzso at zzso The latter two changes in zzso zzso resulted in drastic zzso acid changes within a zzso region zzso from zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso In this region, zzso zzso is closer to published sequences from other zzso suggesting the authenticity of the present zzso The zzso difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso however, did not affect the zzso deduced zzso acid zzso which is overall highly zzso among all the strains zzso zzso zzso analysis of gene 11 identified a high degree of conservation within the Group A zzso In addition, it also separated zzso and zzso suggesting zzso segregation by zzso An zzso zzso zzso of zzso recognized zzso zzso protein but not zzso zzso from the infected cells, further supporting the zzso segregation of zzso and zzso strains based on their zzso coding zzso
