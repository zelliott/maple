zzso zzso zzso and its complex with a zzso corresponding to the zzso domain of skeletal muscle zzso light chain zzso zzso have been studied by one- and two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso arising from the zzso zzso structures associated with the zzso zzso of zzso and their counterparts in the zzso complex have been zzso The assignments were initiated by application of the main chain directed assignment zzso It is found that, despite significant changes in chemical shifts of zzso arising from zzso acid zzso in this region upon binding of the zzso the zzso have virtually the same structure in the complex as in zzso zzso exchange rates of zzso zzso within the zzso structures are significantly slowed upon binding of zzso These data, in conjunction with the observed nuclear zzso effect zzso patterns and relative zzso and the downfield shifts of associated zzso and alpha zzso upon binding of zzso show that the zzso zzso the zzso state of zzso The observed pattern of zzso within the zzso and their structural similarity zzso closely to those predicted by the crystal zzso These findings imply that the apparent inconsistency of the crystal structure with recently reported zzso X-ray scattering profiles of zzso may lie within the putative central zzso bridging the zzso zzso
