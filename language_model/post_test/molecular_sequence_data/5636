When rat liver zzso zzso was incubated with zzso zzso at pH zzso the total zzso activity decreased gradually to a limited value of initial activity with modification of two zzso zzso in a similar way to the modification of bovine milk zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After modification with zzso the two peptides containing zzso were isolated from the zzso domain after zzso zzso and were identified as zzso and zzso by sequencing the zzso During the modification of these zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be converted to an zzso form in the early stage of zzso zzso of the zzso group into zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso per zzso zzso for zzso conversion to the zzso zzso The modified zzso was zzso to the zzso form by incubation with zzso with zzso release of zzso zzso After modification with zzso followed by zzso under zzso conditions, the zzso was zzso with zzso Three zzso peptides were isolated and zzso The modified zzso were identified to be zzso zzso and zzso These zzso are zzso among the all known zzso zzso but zzso and zzso are not zzso in the chicken zzso zzso of the rat zzso was found not to be involved in the conversion from the zzso to the zzso by limited zzso experiments, but zzso and zzso which seemed to be modified alternatively with zzso appear to be involved in the zzso
