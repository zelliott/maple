Evidence shows the presence on the zzso of zzso zzso of a defective zzso which, by zzso zzso is closely related to the virulent zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso analysis indicated that this zzso is more closely related to other representatives of the zzso zzso than to zzso zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso zzso the putative zzso was found to be deleted for two zzso segments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and thus zzso only 80 to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso region was mapped to a 30 zzso restriction zzso on the physical map of the zzso zzso zzso A randomly chosen DNA zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso DNA, as was its zzso counterpart from the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso region present in both clones exhibited zzso sequence zzso
