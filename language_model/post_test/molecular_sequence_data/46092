zzso and zzso represent a great portion of the zzso zzso These repeated elements can be defined as genetic entities capable of zzso into different positions within the zzso zzso the functions of the genes with which they are zzso The purpose of the present work was to zzso zzso and map the sequences of zzso and zzso zzso elements present in the zzso of zzso of the family zzso The zzso elements were identified through amplification with zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso composition of the zzso was determined by automatic zzso In all the species analyzed it was possible to isolate zzso partial sequences from 520 to zzso zzso in size and zzso partial sequences from 407 to zzso zzso in zzso Comparisons with the available literature showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso have a high sequence similarity to putative zzso genes in different fish zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso experiments conducted in 3 species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using the zzso elements isolated for each species as zzso revealed that zzso and zzso share a similar zzso pattern and are both found on all zzso of the 3 species organized in small clusters and dispersed on all the zzso including zzso and zzso regions, although a larger concentration was observed in the zzso regions of zzso zzso The data found in the present study contradict much of the literature that zzso that the zzso elements are zzso accumulated in the zzso regions in zzso
