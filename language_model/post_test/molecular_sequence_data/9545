zzso are part of the zzso class, which occupy an important position in most oceans both at an ecological level and at a commercial zzso Nevertheless, some zzso species are difficult to distinguish with traditional zzso identification in cases when specimens are heavily damaged during collection or when closely related zzso are zzso As a useful tool for rapid species assignment, DNA zzso may offer significant potential for zzso zzso Here, we used two zzso fragments, zzso c zzso I and the large zzso zzso zzso zzso to assess whether 34 zzso accounting for about one-third of the Chinese zzso zzso could be identified by DNA zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso distances were zzso and relationships among species were estimated by NJ and zzso zzso High levels of genetic differentiation within zzso zzso led to an overlap between zzso and zzso zzso All remaining species forming zzso zzso in the NJ and zzso trees were identical for both zzso zzso zzso possessed two zzso lineages with high levels of zzso zzso suggesting the occurrence of cryptic zzso This study confirms the efficacy of DNA zzso for identifying species as well as discovering cryptic diversity of Chinese zzso It also lays a foundation for other ecological and biological studies of zzso
