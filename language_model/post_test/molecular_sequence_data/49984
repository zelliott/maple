zzso of self zzso that occur during zzso might be involved in the generation of zzso which can break tolerance and induce zzso We have previously identified an zzso at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso and zzso T cells from at least two strains of lupus zzso With the aim of investigating the possible role of zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso and to gain a better understanding of how this zzso can drive zzso response, we zzso two peptides zzso on zzso and zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso on zzso is recognized by both zzso T cells and zzso from zzso zzso Furthermore, intravenous administration to zzso zzso mice of zzso in saline (but not of the zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso production, and significantly prolonged survival of treated zzso We further demonstrated that zzso is recognized by zzso from lupus patients and binds to various zzso DR zzso offering new hope for manipulating T cell response in zzso
