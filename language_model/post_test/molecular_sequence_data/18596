zzso P zzso P) is a ubiquitous zzso zzso that processes the zzso leader sequence of precursor zzso zzso The secondary structure of zzso P zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has several peripheral zzso In order to investigate their functional role, we prepared six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in which the zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso were individually deleted, respectively, and characterized them with respect to zzso zzso activity in the presence of five proteins and also to the ability to form a complex with the zzso The zzso particles containing zzso zzso or zzso retained considerable levels of activity zzso while those containing zzso zzso or zzso had markedly reduced activity zzso It was further found that the zzso particles zzso zzso or zzso lacked zzso and zzso whereas those containing zzso zzso zzso or zzso bound to all five zzso Since it is known that zzso functions in a complex with zzso the present result suggests that the peripheral zzso containing zzso or zzso are involved in the structural formation of a zzso site by interacting with the protein complex zzso
