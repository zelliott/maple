In order to develop a zzso zzso to identify all zzso zzso clinical zzso a specific DNA probe was isolated in zzso zzso A total of 145 zzso zzso clinical zzso were collected from several countries and were examined with three zzso by DNA zzso Of the 145 zzso 115 zzso were positive with the previously described probe zzso zzso zzso Huang, zzso zzso Ross, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1991), 129 zzso were positive with the commercial zzso zzso zzso and 145 zzso were positive with the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA with zzso revealed that all zzso zzso zzso strains exhibited a zzso fragment, whereas all zzso zzso zzso strains displayed DNA fragments of variable molecular zzso These results indicate that, unlike the previously described zzso for zzso zzso the zzso cloned into zzso identified all 145 zzso typical strains tested and provides an ideal target for future zzso zzso zzso
