Although the zzso zzso zzso zzso locus zzso large libraries of variable zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso according to previous studies the zzso chain repertoire is of limited diversity due to restrictions imposed by sequential coordinate zzso zzso By sequencing tens of millions of zzso chain transcripts from zzso mouse zzso T cells, we observed a hugely diverse repertoire, zzso nearly all possible zzso zzso Our findings are not compatible with sequential coordinate gene zzso but rather with a model in which contraction and DNA looping in the zzso locus provide equal access to zzso and zzso gene zzso similarly to that demonstrated for zzso gene zzso Generation of the observed highly diverse zzso chain repertoire zzso deletion of failed attempts by zzso selection and is essential for the formation of highly diverse zzso zzso capable of providing good protective zzso
