Around zzso of chronic zzso infections are caused by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso One of the causes of the chronic infection resides in the zzso effects of the zzso components of these zzso Therefore we have attempted to identify the chemical structure of zzso one of the major zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from the culture medium and zzso into three zzso by zzso zzso Analysis of each zzso by zzso indicated that there are two kinds of zzso present, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso has a linear backbone consisting of zzso zzso units, with zzso zzso units as side zzso The core zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso by a sequential zzso assignment method after removing the zzso units by acid zzso The result indicates that the zzso zzso has a linear repeating structure of zzso zzso units connected by an zzso zzso The zzso signals of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso unit showed a significant zzso shift zzso zzso due to the zzso effect of an zzso zzso zzso The attachment point of the zzso units was determined at zzso of the core zzso by the assignment of the zzso zzso signals of the zzso compared with those of the zzso zzso In these zzso there were no zzso chains which have been found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
