Complete major zzso surface protein zzso gene sequences of benign zzso zzso were isolated from ticks of grazing cattle in zzso A total of 556 tick samples were collected in five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso during zzso Fifteen samples from zzso and zzso were positive for the zzso zzso gene by zzso amplification using a specific primer zzso A zzso tree was constructed with the amplified gene sequences and 26 additional sequences published in zzso The benign zzso zzso were classified into eight types, those isolated from Korean cattle ticks belonged to zzso 1 zzso 2 zzso 4, and zzso zzso 2 and 4 were the most common types, with the rate of zzso followed by zzso 1 and 8 (with the rate of zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequence identities of 23 zzso zzso sequences (15 zzso gene sequences amplified and 8 sequences zzso ranged from zzso to zzso Multiple alignments of the deduced zzso acid sequences also showed that each type was characterized by specific zzso zzso 7 for Type 1, 9 for Type 2, 4 for Type 4, and 3 for Type zzso
