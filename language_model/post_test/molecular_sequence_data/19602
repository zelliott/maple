zzso zzso a zzso agent of bacterial meningitis, has a relatively small repertoire of zzso factors, including zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of regulators that are widely expressed in both zzso and zzso In the present study we show that zzso binds to zzso and zzso and have solved the structure of the protein with and without bound zzso zzso This has zzso for the first time that zzso acid binding does not induce significant zzso changes in the structure of an zzso regulator although it does appear to stabilize the zzso assembly of the zzso zzso profiling of zzso and zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso has shown that zzso is associated with an zzso response to zzso poor conditions reflected in a reduction in major surface protein zzso On the basis of its structure and the zzso response, we propose that zzso is a global regulator in zzso controlling responses to zzso availability through indicators of general zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso
