We used a zzso and zzso gene targeting strategy to generate mice expressing only the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso chain associated with major zzso complex zzso class II zzso zzso cells from these mice appear indistinguishable from wild type with respect to class II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surface zzso and the ability to present intact protein zzso Moreover, these zzso mice have normal numbers of zzso and peripheral zzso T cells, and intact zzso zzso zzso responses towards a soluble zzso In short, zzso class II expression and function are surprisingly unaffected in mice lacking zzso zzso chain, zzso that the zzso and zzso zzso may be functionally redundant in the intact zzso
