Growth of soil bacteria is often limited by the availability of essential nutrients such as zzso nitrogen and zzso The reaction to a specific zzso zzso triggers interconnected responses to zzso the zzso It is known that zzso zzso regulator involved in zzso zzso specifically binds to several promoters of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism which are also regulated by zzso zzso involved in nitrogen zzso In this article we report a novel zzso between zzso and the zzso regulator, zzso zzso binds to some zzso promoters including those of zzso (a small regulatory protein of secondary zzso zzso (a component of the zzso transport zzso and zzso zzso the two component system zzso We have characterized the regulation exerted upon the nitrogen regulator zzso gene by zzso using zzso and zzso I zzso zzso as well as in zzso expression studies with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso proteins are able to bind to overlapping regions within the zzso promoter producing different zzso This work demonstrates a zzso of three different regulators of both primary and secondary zzso
