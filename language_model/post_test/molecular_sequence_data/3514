The zzso zzso zzso is a significant source of environmental zzso A major zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso 18, was identified by two-dimensional zzso using zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 18 was then cloned and the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso considerably larger than mature zzso zzso 18, the differences being due to the zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed extensive similarity with those of zzso zzso zzso from various zzso The zzso zzso 18 coding sequence was expressed in zzso coli as a zzso fusion protein and zzso by zzso affinity zzso On zzso the zzso zzso protein specifically bound zzso from zzso patients, and zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of common zzso zzso on zzso zzso 18 and a major zzso of zzso zzso zzso c zzso When mapping of the zzso zzso was performed, at least nine different linear zzso zzso located throughout the zzso zzso 18 zzso were zzso Of these, zzso zzso located in the zzso region of the zzso was recognized by serum from zzso of the patients tested and therefore appears to be an zzso zzso zzso
