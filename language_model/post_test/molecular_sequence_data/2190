Using zzso zzso we have expressed in zzso coli three engineered zzso zzso containing deletions in the zzso region of the central zzso These are zzso delta 84, zzso zzso zzso delta zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso delta zzso zzso through zzso zzso The abilities of these proteins to activate skeletal muscle zzso light chain zzso plant zzso zzso and bovine brain zzso activities were determined, as were their abilities to bind a synthetic zzso based on the zzso domain of skeletal muscle zzso light chain zzso Similar results were obtained with all three deletion zzso zzso values for zzso activated by the deletion proteins are all within zzso of those values obtained with bacterial control zzso Relative to bacterial control values, changes in zzso or zzso values associated with the deletions are all less than an order of zzso zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso light chain zzso are increased zzso zzso values for binding of the synthetic zzso are increased zzso and zzso values for zzso are increased only zzso In zzso of zzso zzso and zzso light chain zzso zzso some differences between bovine zzso and bacterial control zzso were zzso With zzso zzso zzso values for the bacterial control protein are increased zzso relative to values for bovine zzso and zzso values are increased by zzso with zzso light chain zzso zzso values are increased zzso and zzso values are decreased zzso relative to those values obtained with bovine zzso These differences between bacterial control and bovine zzso probably can be attributed to known differences in zzso processing of zzso in bacterial and zzso zzso No differences between bovine and control zzso were observed in zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our observations indicate that contacts with the deleted zzso zzso through zzso are not critical in the zzso complexes we have zzso zzso of these zzso complexes also does not appear to be greatly affected by the global zzso in the structure of zzso that are associated with the zzso In models in which the central zzso is maintained in the altered zzso each deleted zzso causes the two zzso of zzso to be twisted 100 degrees relative to one another and brought zzso A closer zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
