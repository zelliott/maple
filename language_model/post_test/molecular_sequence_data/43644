The cloning of human and mouse zzso from brain that zzso high affinity zzso receptors was recently zzso We have physically localized the human zzso zzso gene zzso to a region at zzso between the anonymous zzso markers zzso and zzso The zzso structure of the human zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the published human brain zzso zzso spans over 70 zzso and includes 20 zzso Since the zzso zzso gene is a candidate gene for zzso and because of its proximity to zzso a marker previously linked to insulin zzso the zzso gene was zzso in 20 zzso zzso Indians chosen for extremes in percent body fat and in their acute insulin response to intravenous zzso Seven zzso sites were zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso are zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso one zzso is a silent zzso and four occur in zzso regions of the zzso zzso Four of these sites are in linkage zzso with one zzso zzso at three zzso zzso sites were found exclusively in obese zzso zzso This demonstrates an association between variation at the zzso zzso gene and obesity in zzso
