zzso zzso are produced by zzso radiation on zzso zzso in zzso We have studied an zzso containing a zzso opposite the zzso zzso by one and two zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso exists as two zzso with respect to the orientation about the zzso zzso For the trans zzso we find that the zzso and zzso site are positioned within the zzso and are probably hydrogen zzso The zzso adopts a globally B form structure although zzso changes are observed around the mismatch zzso A minor species is observed, in which the zzso zzso and the opposite base adopt an zzso position and this zzso to the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso
