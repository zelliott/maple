To clarify the structural basis of the cell zzso activity of zzso we examined the effects of point zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain 1 of zzso zzso on the zzso properties by zzso scanning zzso zzso of two zzso aromatic zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain 1 resulted in abnormal processing of zzso molecules and no cell zzso activity, whereas zzso of the corresponding aromatic zzso acids in the zzso domain 2 did not show these effects, suggesting a role for the two zzso in the zzso domain 1 in the folding and/or zzso transport processes of zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso suspected to be involved in strand zzso formation resulted in loss or significant decrease in cell zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed weak concentration at zzso zzso sites and chemical zzso suggested that the strand zzso formation was actually impaired in the zzso These results are consistent with the zzso model, in which the zzso domain 1 of zzso has intrinsic strand zzso formation activity in addition to zzso zzso formation activity, both of which are involved in cell zzso zzso The zzso model, however, needs further improvement to fully account for the present zzso
