zzso zzso is the common precursor of a variety of important zzso peptides including zzso zzso of the zzso gene is positively regulated by zzso through zzso regions and is under negative feedback control by zzso which exert their zzso effect trough negative zzso responsive elements zzso In zzso studies using the rat zzso promoter suggested that binding of the zzso zzso complex to a zzso zzso binding site is correlated with repression of zzso gene transcription, and that specific zzso in this region abolish this zzso zzso negative feedback regulation, though to a different degree, is a common feature of both zzso tumors zzso disease) and zzso zzso producing zzso We have analyzed the upstream promoter region of zzso gene from zzso patients with zzso disease, four of which had Nelson's syndrome, and from one patient with an zzso zzso syndrome secondary to a lung zzso for any possible zzso in the zzso and/or zzso zzso DNA was zzso from tumor tissue and was used as template for zzso chain reaction zzso A segment between zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso start site was amplified and cloned into a zzso zzso zzso was performed using the zzso chain termination zzso Analysis of the zzso region revealed no zzso in all tumors zzso We conclude from our results that the defective zzso repression of zzso peptides production may be more likely due to zzso in other components of the complex zzso regulatory zzso
