The primary structure of rabbit zzso zzso zzso 5 has been derived from the zzso sequence of cloned zzso zzso sequences were obtained for zzso constructed with zzso from four different sources, lung and liver of zzso rabbits and liver from rabbits treated once or four times with zzso zzso 5 shows significant sequence identity only with rabbit zzso zzso and rat zzso omega zzso which places it in a previously zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso A zzso library was also constructed from rat pulmonary zzso and screened with zzso zzso rabbit zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence derived from a positive clone was compared with that of rabbit zzso 5 and found to be zzso zzso significantly greater than observed between other similar forms of zzso zzso from rabbit and zzso zzso of the primary structures of rabbit zzso 5 zzso zzso rat zzso 5 zzso zzso rabbit zzso and rat zzso omega shows zzso structural identity and a common zzso zzso near position 300 that is unique to these forms of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso from lung and liver of zzso zzso guinea zzso and zzso indicates that species and tissue differences in the expression and induction of zzso 5 are likely regulated at the level of zzso These differences fall into one of the following three groups: first, expression in lung and liver and induction in liver by zzso zzso second, expression in lung and liver but no zzso induction zzso and third, expression in lung and little or no expression in liver regardless of treatment zzso and guinea zzso
