An interactive procedure has been developed to assign sequences for the design of zzso acid secondary zzso The primary goal of the procedure is to facilitate zzso architecture studies through the design of zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso in a convenient zzso The essential feature of the zzso zzso zzso employed is the treatment of short sequences as vocabulary elements whose repetition decreases control over the resulting secondary zzso Both manual and zzso application of this approach are zzso The design of linear zzso acid molecules or molecules containing zzso zzso or zzso is also possible through application of the zzso
