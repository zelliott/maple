To analyze the induction mechanism of zzso protein gene zzso zzso coding for zzso B have been cloned from the zzso zzso fat body zzso zzso zzso sequences of two positive clones were determined and their zzso acid sequences zzso They revealed that these clones coded for the same zzso which is identical to zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso contained different zzso at the third zzso position and zzso or 3' zzso zzso zzso obtained by Northern zzso analysis showed that the gene expression of zzso zzso zzso B was rapidly induced by zzso coli and reached maximum levels 8 h after zzso The expression of zzso B gene occurred specifically in zzso mainly in the fat body and zzso
