We developed a sensitive method for detection of zzso zzso zzso on the cell zzso As a model of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso was zzso with standard inhibitor zzso containing zzso zzso Then zzso indicator zzso containing zzso zzso and complement were zzso zzso of the marker from the indicator zzso was specifically inhibited by inhibitor zzso The zzso system was simple, sensitive, zzso and zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso could be zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso on the cells was investigated with zzso human melanoma cell line and human red blood cells zzso When zzso melanoma with zzso zzso was used as an zzso specific zzso was zzso However, zzso without zzso zzso showed no significant zzso The marker release was 50% inhibited by zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso The amount of zzso zzso cell was estimated to be at least zzso zzso zzso g from the standard curve made with the zzso containing zzso zzso density of zzso zzso This zzso system may be useful for detection of zzso zzso on the zzso
