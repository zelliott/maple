We have used zzso zzso based zzso platform to identify cell surface proteins zzso on a zzso resistant zzso of an zzso cancer cell line zzso 

zzso associated zzso from zzso and its zzso resistant zzso cell line, zzso were processed for liquid zzso zzso based zzso The expression of proteins found at elevated levels in zzso cell line was confirmed using flow zzso and zzso zzso The expression of these proteins was further evaluated in unrelated zzso cancer cell lines using zzso analysis and flow zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed using zzso tumor zzso to evaluate the protein density on the cell zzso zzso zzso were used in an zzso blue proliferation zzso to examine the zzso effects on cell proliferation in resistant cell zzso 

Six proteins were identified by zzso as being zzso on cell surface of zzso cell zzso Mass zzso and flow zzso confirmed the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in other zzso resistant zzso cancer cell zzso zzso analysis revealed that only zzso was expressed at moderate levels in zzso zzso When zzso resistant zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were treated with zzso against zzso there was a significant decrease in cell zzso 

Using a zzso based zzso approach we have shown that expression of zzso is associated with zzso resistance in zzso cancer cell zzso zzso examination of these tumor cell line findings in clinical tumor specimens with available pathology staging and zzso treatment history is zzso
