zzso zzso analysis of a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as their corresponding zzso core structures zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been performed employing both the zzso and the zzso force fields zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso show that zzso possible three-dimensional structures of the zzso zzso zzso are not limited to a single extended zzso zzso with all zzso side chains oriented at the same side of the zzso zzso zzso equilibrium in zzso zzso obtained by replacements of zzso flexible zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso is not significantly shifted towards the target zzso zzso type; and zzso introduction of zzso bridges between positions 4 and 9 is a very powerful way to stabilize the target zzso in the resulting zzso zzso These findings form the basis for further design of zzso zzso zzso zzso templates with many application areas ranging from zzso to diagnostic zzso
