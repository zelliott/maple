Human zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression is regulated by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The viral components required for zzso zzso function include the zzso 21 zzso motifs present three times within the zzso region of the zzso and the zzso 40 zzso tax protein zzso by the 3' end of the viral zzso A gel zzso zzso binding zzso was used to identify the interaction of nuclear factors with the 21 zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions were observed in all cell lines zzso No differences were observed in the binding patterns obtained from extracts prepared from those cell lines that did or did not express the tax zzso zzso zzso zzso interference analysis indicates that a nuclear factor contacts the zzso zzso in the sequence zzso zzso directed zzso of the putative zzso contact points markedly reduces the zzso zzso These results support an indirect mechanism for zzso zzso regulation of zzso gene expression is controlled by the interaction of the zzso 21 zzso motif with a nuclear factor activated by zzso
