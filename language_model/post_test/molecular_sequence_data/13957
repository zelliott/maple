zzso that comprise the zzso zzso cause significant losses to the livestock zzso Based on sequence analysis, currently 4 distinct zzso are identified of which 3 zzso cattle and zzso zzso between bovine and zzso zzso by zzso tests has often been difficult because of a high degree of cross zzso In this study, a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was developed to identify and distinguish between bovine viral zzso virus zzso type I, zzso type II, as well as border disease virus zzso zzso Consensus zzso zzso were designed to amplify a zzso product from any of the 3 zzso types in a reverse zzso zzso This product was subjected to a second round of zzso zzso with zzso zzso which yielded DNA products of unique size characteristic for each zzso zzso Using this zzso we were able to rapidly characterize several viral zzso and determine that all 3 zzso can be found among zzso zzso
