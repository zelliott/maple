The zzso motif found in many zzso factors is thought to be important for human heart development and zzso In this study, we have identified and characterized a novel zzso gene named zzso using zzso zzso from an early human zzso heart zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso box and 12 zzso zinc zzso The zzso sequence contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a putative protein of 516 zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular mass of 57 zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates that a zzso transcript specific for zzso is expressed only in embryonic zzso In the adult zzso the expression of zzso is restricted largely to heart, skeletal muscle, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in cells activates the zzso activities of zzso and zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso may act as a positive regulator in zzso signaling pathways that lead to the zzso of zzso and zzso
