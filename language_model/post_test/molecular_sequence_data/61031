To investigate the regulation of the zzso zzso sodium channel zzso zzso we have characterized the zzso structure and performed promoter analyses of the alpha zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso clones containing the zzso gene were isolated and subjected to zzso zzso The zzso gene was shown to be composed of 13 zzso and 12 zzso zzso extension analysis confirmed that zzso initiation occurred at the beginning of the reported zzso zzso but also indicated potential zzso initiation zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence revealed a notable absence of zzso or zzso elements but suggested three zzso boxes and several putative zzso factor binding sites, including a zzso response element zzso zzso A 250 zzso minimal promoter was capable of directing expression of a zzso alkaline zzso zzso This promoter activity was enhanced zzso and zzso by upstream zzso zzso zzso treatment induced levels of expression from the longer, zzso promoter fragments from 8- to zzso but not from the minimal zzso zzso deletion of the zzso zzso zzso sequence completely zzso the response of reporter expression to zzso zzso These experiments indicate that zzso zzso of lung zzso zzso transport occurs, at least in part, by direct stimulation of zzso of the zzso zzso
