Certain zzso M proteins bind collagen via an zzso motif that is located in their zzso zzso zzso The interaction with this zzso zzso protein enhances zzso to the host tissue and thereby zzso zzso Moreover, it has the side effect of zzso collagen zzso responses, a phenomenon which is also observed in patients with acute rheumatic zzso zzso the zzso motif was named zzso associated with rheumatic fever zzso Only a comprehensive characterization of the zzso M proteins and their zzso motifs will allow the investigation of their associations with certain zzso infections and their zzso zzso a collection of zzso zzso zzso strains that were isolated from infected humans was zzso in order to identify zzso proteins and zzso zzso that bound collagen independent of a zzso acid capsule belonged to 7 distinct types of the zzso zzso which codes for the M protein zzso zzso Only one of these zzso types was previously described as zzso Five possessed a zzso zzso The other 2 zzso types zzso and zzso had zzso motifs that zzso from the previously described consensus sequence zzso but were able to induce collagen zzso when injected into zzso The results led to the amended zzso consensus zzso Moreover, they demonstrate a zzso power regarding zzso and zzso of collagen zzso indicating that zzso may be one of the markers for strains that cause zzso acute rheumatic zzso
