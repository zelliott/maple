zzso techniques were used to examine the zzso relationships among zzso species isolated from 13 zzso and 15 zzso from Brazil, and from 15 dogs, 20 zzso 45 zzso and 330 domestic cats from zzso zzso infection was confirmed by amplification of the zzso zzso gene and later zzso No zzso infections were found in zzso The prevalence of zzso in zzso ranged from zzso zzso domestic zzso to zzso zzso zzso Four different zzso zzso zzso were zzso as well as an zzso zzso zzso zzso identical to the USA zzso Two Spanish cats were zzso by a zzso species zzso zzso that showed zzso sequence identity to zzso zzso DNA amplification zzso performed on Spanish zzso showed 2 bank zzso zzso zzso to be infected by a zzso species zzso zzso with zzso sequence identity to zzso zzso from zzso zzso analysis showed zzso to be a zzso zzso in which species from carnivorous zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear as a sister lineage of that of lower zzso and zzso This association suggests that zzso zzso evolved in ticks and zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso rather than in other zzso and other types of zzso
