zzso and zzso zzso zzso may be toxic in zzso disease zzso especially after zzso modification cumulative over zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in senile plaques zzso occurs as an zzso process in zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso at zzso is soluble and susceptible to zzso yielding toxic zzso fragments in zzso and in zzso Here, we focus on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso brains within the zzso system, the earliest site of zzso zzso We developed zzso zzso and zzso each with zzso within zzso Two forms of truncated zzso were detected either in zzso or within zzso in all 11 zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was localized to plaque cores, zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso by zzso was observed in most zzso containing zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso These results suggest zzso formed during aging, becomes soluble and zzso from zzso It is then zzso to zzso which is toxic and may contribute to the zzso This hypothesis may explain the long lag between SP formation and zzso zzso in zzso zzso
