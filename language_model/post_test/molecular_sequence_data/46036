The zzso gene families play important roles in the zzso regulation of gene expression prior to and during zzso zzso To identify novel zzso genes expressed in early embryonic development, we conducted a zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso to screen a mouse embryonic stem zzso cell zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso which is zzso expressed in zzso cells and zzso was zzso The full-length zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso with a predicted zzso that has no significant zzso to previously reported zzso zzso zzso was mapped to zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analyses showed that zzso was expressed through zzso and continuing to be expressed through to the zzso zzso De zzso expression of zzso started at zzso days zzso in the zzso which zzso with the initiation of zzso Northern zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso is zzso expressed in both zzso and zzso cells as a zzso zzso zzso from whole mount in zzso zzso revealed that zzso in zzso showed increased expression from primordial to zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso transcripts contained zzso zzso sequences while the length of zzso zzso tails changed during zzso zzso indicating that zzso expression is controlled by zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the novel zzso zzso zzso plays a role during zzso maturation and early embryonic zzso
