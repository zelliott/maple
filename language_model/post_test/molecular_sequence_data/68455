Despite very restricted gene exchange between zzso coli and zzso zzso both species harbor several of the same classes of zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso distribution of these zzso elements is due to common ancestry or to horizontal transfer, we determined the sequences of zzso and zzso from natural zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso One strain of zzso zzso zzso an zzso element identical to that originally recovered from zzso coli, suggesting that the element was recently transferred between these two zzso The level of sequence divergence between copies of zzso from zzso coli and zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso indicating that zzso unlike zzso has not been repeatedly transferred between these enteric species since zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso from a common zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso for strains of zzso coli and zzso zzso show that each class of zzso sequence has a characteristic pattern of zzso within and among host zzso
