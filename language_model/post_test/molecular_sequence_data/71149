During sequencing of an zzso zzso zzso region of a zzso zzso group A zzso zzso strain, a series of genes were identified including zzso regulator of zzso zzso analysis of the region revealed that zzso was primarily zzso zzso zzso expression was found for the three open reading frames zzso downstream and for the four zzso upstream of zzso The deduced zzso protein sequence exhibited zzso zzso to the zzso zzso positive zzso In contrast to zzso zzso was found to be a negative regulator of its own expression and that of the two adjacent zzso by analysis of zzso zzso zzso By zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso of 10 different zzso zzso the zzso presence of zzso zzso or both was zzso zzso genes include the zzso protein zzso gene zzso and a novel zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso was zzso as a zzso zzso protein fusion and shown to bind type I collagen but not zzso In accordance with zzso acting as a negative regulator of zzso and zzso levels of attachment of the zzso zzso strain to immobilized collagen and zzso was increased above zzso zzso In addition, zzso was also found to regulate zzso zzso to zzso the global positive regulator zzso zzso Using a strain carrying a zzso integrated zzso of the zzso 3' end and an zzso reporter gene zzso fusion, zzso expression was observed to reach its maximum during late zzso growth phase, while no significant influence of atmospheric conditions could be distinguished zzso
