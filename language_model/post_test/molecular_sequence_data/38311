The zzso of the zzso zzso acid cycle in zzso are proposed to form a zzso complex, in which there is channeling of zzso between zzso active zzso While interactions have been demonstrated in zzso between most of the sequential zzso acid cycle zzso no direct evidence has been obtained in zzso for such zzso We have isolated, in the zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso acid cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso a zzso that causes a zzso acid cycle zzso without affecting the zzso zzso zzso We have shown that a zzso acid zzso from wild type zzso encompassing the zzso point zzso the zzso acid cycle in a dominant manner, and that the zzso zzso is overcome by a zzso of zzso the zzso zzso zzso These data provide the first direct in zzso evidence of interaction between two sequential zzso acid cycle zzso zzso and zzso and indicate that the characterization of assembly zzso by the zzso zzso zzso method may be a powerful way to study zzso complexes in their zzso zzso
