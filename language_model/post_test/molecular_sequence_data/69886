We have constructed a long-range restriction map of the region on zzso zzso that contains the gene for zzso muscular zzso zzso This region contains the linkage group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which spans a genetic distance of about 5 zzso Pulse field gel zzso zzso mapping indicated that these zzso span a region not more than 1 zzso zzso were developed for several of these zzso which served to isolate four overlapping zzso artificial zzso zzso These zzso confirmed the zzso map and have allowed us to generate a more detailed restriction map using zzso zzso zzso The physical distances were smaller than was expected on the basis of the genetic zzso Two potential zzso islands have been detected within the cloned zzso One zzso island maps about 100 zzso zzso from the tandem repeats involved in the zzso zzso whereas the other maps within these tandem zzso
