Human zzso zzso zzso zzso binds more strongly to the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso than to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we used this fact to determine the binding site of zzso by replacing selected zzso binding zzso of the human zzso with the corresponding zzso binding zzso of the mouse zzso The zzso proteins were expressed in mouse zzso deficient in zzso zzso and zzso zzso both used by minor group zzso for cell zzso zzso was assessed by virus overlay zzso by zzso zzso and by measuring cell attachment of zzso zzso Replacement of zzso binding repeat 5 of the human zzso with the corresponding mouse sequence resulted in a substantial increase in zzso zzso whereas substitution of repeats 3 and 4 was without zzso Replacement of human zzso repeats 1 and 2 with the zzso zzso also increased virus zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, and 5 simultaneously introduced into the human zzso resulted in zzso binding indistinguishable from mouse zzso zzso Thus, repeats 1 and/or 2 and repeat 5 are involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cluster of module 5 in the human zzso to zzso present in the mouse zzso led to substantially increased binding of zzso indicating an important role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
