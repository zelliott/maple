zzso zzso zzso is involved in cell wall zzso and the weakening of plant zzso by degrading zzso zzso in the cell zzso zzso genes are expressed in tomato zzso zzso seeds zzso and zzso and fruits zzso and zzso A novel zzso gene zzso zzso was found in the tomato zzso by zzso zzso and bacterial artificial zzso library zzso The zzso region of this zzso gene contained four copies of the zzso zzso elements zzso zzso A zzso gene driven with the putative zzso promoter zzso to zzso was activated in zzso and zzso of transgenic zzso with the highest zzso activity detected in zzso zzso expression was detected in mature zzso retained in zzso discharged zzso and zzso zzso tubes in transgenic zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso activity was detected in tomato zzso and zzso In zzso the highest zzso expression and zzso activity were detected during late stages of zzso development, when zzso maturation zzso zzso activity was present in discharged zzso which was easily zzso in a zzso indicating that the zzso proteins are probably zzso from, and deposited on, the surface of zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso is associated with zzso and zzso zzso
