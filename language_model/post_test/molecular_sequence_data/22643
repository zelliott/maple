The zzso H activity of reverse zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represent a form of zzso H activity that is carried out on zzso hybrids that contain a recessed zzso zzso Previously, the distance from the zzso zzso has been considered the primary zzso for the location of these zzso zzso model hybrid zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso leukemia virus reverse zzso we demonstrate that zzso sites correlate with specific sequences and that the distance from the zzso zzso determines the extent of zzso An alignment of sequences zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso sites reveals that both zzso strongly prefer A or U at the zzso position and C or G at the zzso position, and additionally for zzso A is zzso at the zzso zzso For both zzso zzso zzso occurred when sites were positioned between the 13th and 20th zzso from the zzso zzso a distance termed the zzso zzso In examining the importance of accessibility to the zzso zzso it was found that the extent of zzso zzso observed in zzso containing a free recessed zzso zzso was most comparable to zzso with a gap of two or three bases between the upstream and downstream zzso Together these finding demonstrate that the selection of zzso zzso sites by zzso zzso H results from a combination of zzso zzso permissible distance, and accessibility to the zzso zzso
