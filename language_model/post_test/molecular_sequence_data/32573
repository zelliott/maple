zzso zzso was zzso with zzso in a batch stirred tank zzso the resulting peptides were identified, in a time dependent and comprehensive manner, using reversed zzso performance liquid zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso by means of database zzso zzso zzso of bovine zzso yields more zzso peptides at a low degree of zzso and more zzso peptides at a later stage of zzso The release zzso of the zzso peptides was also followed based on the zzso zzso In addition, the behavior of zzso zzso of zzso alpha and beta chains was compared in terms of profiling the identified zzso zzso peptides were recovered by a process of zzso from the alpha chain of the zzso whereas the corresponding result for the beta chain was 19 peptides with around zzso sequence zzso The main factor responsible for zzso zzso of the central region of the beta chain was their relatively higher zzso
