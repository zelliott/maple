In zzso and plants, the first two reactions of zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso produces an essential zzso of zzso zzso I, the first zzso of the zzso cycle, and no functional zzso zzso has been zzso Unlike the other zzso cycle zzso whose bacterial counterparts could be readily identified by their sequence conservation with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was very zzso making it the last zzso cycle gene to be zzso Limited sequence similarity between zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso suggests that bacterial and zzso zzso and zzso zzso arose from the fusion of genes zzso an ancestral zzso zzso and an zzso However, zzso zzso no longer retains any zzso zzso zzso 

We identified a novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso order of zzso that appears to resemble this zzso primordial fusion zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso is more closely related to zzso zzso than to other bacterial zzso We cloned the zzso gene from zzso zzso and characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its bacterial zzso have similar affinities for zzso zzso zzso A and zzso as well as for their zzso regulator zzso 

The close zzso relationship and similar zzso properties of zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggest that we have identified a close relative to the bacterial zzso of zzso zzso and that the zzso from zzso zzso could become a good model for zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
