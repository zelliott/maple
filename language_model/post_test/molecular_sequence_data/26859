To screen for the existence and determine the structure of zzso element in zzso zzso zzso II strains isolated from cultured Japanese zzso in western zzso 

In this study, the structure of zzso element and the zzso regions were characterized by zzso chain reaction zzso and inverse zzso followed by cloning and zzso The zzso element is 18 zzso zzso in length and composed of 22 zzso Southern zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso internal structures of zzso elements yielded two patterns among zzso zzso zzso II zzso The zzso sequences were identical with the corresponding region of zzso zzso zzso I strain except for the addition of zzso zzso sequence zzso being adjacent to the upstream of the zzso 

The zzso element exhibited high zzso (more than zzso with zzso observed in other zzso and zzso and was integrated in the same site of zzso for all of the tested zzso zzso zzso II zzso 

The results indicate that the zzso element zzso zzso gene is present in all of the tested zzso zzso zzso II zzso which are zzso in the zzso areas in western zzso
