zzso of African zzso mosaic virus containing extensive deletions across the coat protein gene that remove up to one-third of the zzso component have been constructed and shown to be infectious when mechanically zzso onto zzso zzso by leaf zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso delta 11, containing a zzso zzso zzso is competent for replication in its deleted zzso However, systemic spread of zzso zzso delta 11 and other deletion zzso is associated with zzso of DNA 1 to a size comparable to that of the native zzso zzso This contrasts with the zzso of coat protein zzso of the closely related zzso tomato golden mosaic virus which maintain their deletions during zzso zzso of the different zzso procedures used to introduce the zzso into plants suggests the imposition of a stringent size requirement for localized zzso spread which is relaxed for long distance spread through the vascular zzso
