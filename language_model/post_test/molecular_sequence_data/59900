The zzso zzso is a key group to understand the origin and the early evolution of zzso zzso symmetrical animals, but zzso relationships among zzso orders have been a subject of debates for decades, especially on the position of the zzso zzso Some workers have considered the zzso representing the most primitive zzso order but others have regarded them as zzso We determined almost the entire lengths of the zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso in 17 species from 9 zzso orders (the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso After adding the sequences of a zzso two zzso and some zzso animals obtained from databases, we reconstructed zzso trees using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso All trees significantly indicated that the zzso is the earliest divergent group among the zzso zzso The trees also suggested that the zzso evolved in the separate lineage from that of a cluster of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso after the divergence of the zzso
