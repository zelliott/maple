zzso is a member of a novel class of zzso with resistance already being zzso We used zzso sequencing on three independent zzso zzso strains made resistant to zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso revealed zzso in the zzso zzso gene in all zzso including, notably, zzso a previously recognized resistance zzso zzso in an additional 31 genes were also found in at least one of the three zzso zzso We concentrated on three new zzso that were found in at least two independent zzso All three zzso were zzso confirmed to be involved in zzso zzso zzso upstream of the ABC zzso genes zzso and zzso were correlated with increased expression of these genes and neighboring genes of the same zzso Gene zzso supported a role for these ABC zzso in resistance to zzso and other zzso The hypothetical protein zzso contains an zzso zzso domain, and zzso within that domain were found in all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extension experiments indicated that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso abolished this zzso zzso of a zzso version of zzso in resistant bacteria zzso zzso zzso and led to cells being more sensitive to zzso and other zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso was also zzso in a zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing and comparative analyses of zzso zzso resistant zzso was useful for discovering novel resistance zzso
