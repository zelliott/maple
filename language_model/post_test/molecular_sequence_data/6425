zzso necrosis factor zzso is an important zzso of immune and inflammatory responses and has been recognized as a major zzso factor in several zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso the zzso activities of zzso We here describe molecular cloning and bacterial production of a zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso which possesses zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences were isolated by zzso from the zzso zzso cell line zzso cloned into a zzso expression zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was found as an active soluble protein in the zzso but also formed inclusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from inclusion bodies was shown to be functional and stable at 37 degrees C with a zzso of 50 zzso zzso of the zzso binding characteristics of zzso with the parental zzso produced zzso zzso revealed that both zzso fragments have the same zzso specificity and an identical zzso binding affinity of zzso zzso In an in zzso zzso it was demonstrated that zzso zzso is an efficient inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso with an zzso of 22 zzso which is comparable to the zzso activity of natural zzso zzso with an zzso of 12 zzso As zzso zzso possesses the high affinity zzso binding and zzso zzso activity of the parental zzso zzso but is expected to be less zzso in man, it provides a valuable tool for the development of novel therapeutic zzso against zzso zzso zzso
