A zzso zzso and zzso gliding zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a tidal flat zzso of the Yellow Sea, Korea, and its zzso position was investigated by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at 37 degrees C, in the presence of 2-3 % zzso zzso and at pH zzso It contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso and zzso : zzso as the major fatty zzso Major polar lipids were zzso unidentified zzso and an zzso zzso that is zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences demonstrated that strain zzso formed a distinct evolutionary lineage within the family zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso exhibited similarity values of zzso % to those of other members of the family zzso zzso zzso was distinguished from zzso related zzso by differences in several zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso data, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was classified at the type strain of a novel zzso and species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
