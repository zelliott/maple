A heavily zzso soluble protein was zzso using a combination of zzso affinity and size exclusion zzso from a soluble extract of zzso zzso zzso of blue crab zzso zzso removed at zzso zzso in apparent molecular mass and zzso composition suggest that this protein is the same species previously shown to disappear from soluble extracts coincidentally with the onset of mineral deposition in the newly exposed zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso portion of the core zzso was determined and zzso zzso were raised against both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso soluble extracts taken at various times zzso illustrated that the zzso zzso recognized several zzso with zzso zzso that differ from the zzso zzso These bands may be zzso products which would not have been zzso due to different zzso affinity or zzso zzso analysis indicated uniform protein distribution in the zzso at zzso but decreased zzso binding at the zzso zzso by 2 h zzso The location of the protein is therefore the negative image of the zzso pattern in the zzso and provides a spatial pattern to correlate with the previously reported zzso zzso This strengthens the hypothesis that the zzso under investigation is an inhibitor of zzso nucleation or of initial zzso calcium zzso zzso
