zzso functions to novel proteins is one of the most important problems in the zzso zzso Several approaches have been applied to this problem, including analyzing gene expression patterns, zzso profiles, protein zzso and zzso zzso We develop a novel approach that applies the theory of zzso random fields to zzso a zzso functions using zzso interaction data and the functional zzso of its interaction protein zzso For each function of interest and a zzso we predict the probability that the protein has that function using zzso zzso Unlike in other available approaches for protein zzso where a protein has or does not have a function of interest, we give a probability for having the zzso This probability indicates how confident we are about the zzso We apply our method to predict cellular functions zzso categories including a category zzso for zzso proteins defined in the zzso zzso Database zzso using the zzso interaction data from the Munich Information Center for zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that our approach zzso other available methods for function prediction based on protein interaction zzso
