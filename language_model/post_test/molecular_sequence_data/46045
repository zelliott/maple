In zzso zzso and zzso zzso two types of zzso zzso zzso have been isolated and functionally zzso The zzso zzso zzso 220 zzso contain a zzso domain, which is lacking in zzso zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso zzso exemplified by zzso zzso and rice zzso contain a highly charged repetitive segment designated zzso zzso zzso zzso region, which is an unique domain only found in plant zzso zzso at zzso The zzso region has a length of approximately 300 zzso acids and harboring 11 zzso and 14 zzso repeats, respectively, of a zzso zzso Studies employing a modified zzso zzso of zzso zzso system demonstrate that the zzso region, as well as the former 8 and latter 6 repetitive motifs within the zzso region, are able to target fusion proteins to the plasma zzso Further detection on the zzso expressed zzso fusion proteins in onion zzso cells showed that the zzso region alone, as well as the region containing repetitive motifs zzso was able to direct zzso to the plasma zzso while the regions containing less repetitive zzso zzso 6, 4, 2 or single zzso led to predominantly zzso zzso zzso transient expression of zzso fusion protein further confirms the zzso capacities of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso plasma membrane zzso of zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, strongly binds zzso acid, zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso in zzso providing insights into potential mechanisms for regulating zzso zzso and zzso binding for the plant zzso zzso
