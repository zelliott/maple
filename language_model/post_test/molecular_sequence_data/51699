Two mouse helper T cell clones that zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso could also be grown in zzso medium of zzso human zzso tissue zzso The activity was not due to known T cell growth factors including human zzso which is not effective on mouse zzso This zzso activity for zzso cells zzso was zzso with zzso on normal zzso and certain zzso cell lines zzso with zzso zzso zzso virus or zzso zzso However, the conditions for optimal induction and the zzso of production were found to be different for zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso human zzso cells zzso with zzso but could be separated from it by subsequent zzso zzso liquid zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso was a zzso protein on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso whereas zzso produced by these cells appeared in its zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be inactive in the B cell zzso growth zzso for zzso Finally, zzso was identified by zzso sequence analysis of the mature protein as leukemia zzso factor or human zzso for zzso cells zzso The effect of zzso on T cells was not zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso Since this zzso has not previously been reported to act on T cells, further investigation of its role in T cell zzso should be taken into zzso
