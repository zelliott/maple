zzso class I molecules are zzso receptors of stringent specificity which however still allow millions of different zzso This is achieved by the following specificity characteristics summarized as zzso specific zzso zzso zzso are of defined zzso depending on the class I zzso zzso 8 or 9 zzso exceptions have been zzso Typically, 2 of the 8 or 9 positions are anchors that can only be occupied by a single zzso acid zzso or by zzso with closely related side zzso zzso and characteristics of anchors vary with class I zzso The C zzso of the zzso zzso is frequently an zzso or charged zzso Such zzso class I zzso zzso zzso known so far for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are useful to predict natural T cell zzso The latter can be determined by extraction from cells recognized by the T cell of zzso It is not known how the class I zzso are produced in the cell, although speculative models zzso The zzso specificity of class I molecules and experimental evidence indicate that T cells are tolerant to only a small fraction of the expressed zzso sequences and are not tolerant to the zzso The function of class I molecules is to present a collection of zzso samples at the cell surface for surveillance by T zzso
