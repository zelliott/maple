zzso is a secondary zzso in the zzso system controlling the zzso of zzso zzso zzso like the zzso protein zzso is a zzso protein zzso to the zzso zzso domain of the response zzso We recently reported the crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso bound in the active zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso in the absence of a metal zzso is presented zzso A comparison of the two structures reveals that the zzso zzso significant changes in the active zzso In the present zzso structure, the zzso of zzso points away from the center of the active site, whereas when coordinated to the zzso as in the earlier structure, it points toward the active zzso In addition, zzso the site of zzso is blocked by a salt bridge interaction of an zzso side chain from a neighboring zzso From zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso we found that only the zzso acid zzso binds to zzso in a zzso manner zzso zzso 15 zzso This observation suggests that a small zzso with a shape complementary to the active site and having a zzso group might inhibit zzso between response regulators and their zzso zzso zzso
