The understanding of the structure and function of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has been hindered by the difficulty to obtain large quantities of functional zzso A zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso zzso I alpha was constructed and zzso zzso insect cells zzso large amounts of soluble and biologically active zzso zzso I alpha representing up to zzso of the total cell extract zzso The zzso zzso had an identical apparent molecular mass, zzso affinity and zzso activity as the native bovine lung zzso The high-level expression of functional zzso zzso I alpha should provide an excellent tool to study further the structure and function of zzso zzso
