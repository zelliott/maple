There has been a lack of consensus among results of zzso for insulin zzso zzso carried out by different laboratories, despite a reduction in the zzso effect using a cold insulin competitor in zzso zzso for zzso in type I zzso We speculated that the discrepancies are partly a result of the zzso binding zzso of zzso to unidentified molecules in serum on zzso zzso zzso and tried to improve zzso zzso The molecular weight of a candidate for the factor causing zzso was estimated to be about 700 zzso by gel zzso analysis, resembling that of alpha zzso zzso Further, the addition of zzso zzso to the zzso resulted in an increase in zzso zzso revealed that zzso compounds, such as zzso derivatives zzso were greatly effective at reducing zzso in control subjects from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Using our newly developed zzso zzso with zzso the sensitivity for newly diagnosed type I diabetes patients zzso was zzso and zzso with or without insulin competition, respectively, whereas that of the former zzso without zzso was only zzso
