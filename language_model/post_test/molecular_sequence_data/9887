zzso in zzso does not always start at the first zzso in an zzso zzso that context information also plays a zzso This makes prediction of translation initiation sites a zzso task, especially when zzso zzso and zzso data where the entire mature zzso sequence is not zzso In this paper, we employ artificial neural networks to predict which zzso zzso in an zzso sequence is the start zzso The trained networks correctly classified zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso We find that our trained neural networks use a combination of local start zzso context and global sequence zzso Furthermore, analysis of false predictions shows that zzso in frame with the actual start zzso are more frequently selected than zzso zzso suggesting that our networks use reading frame zzso A number of conflicts between neural network predictions and database zzso are zzso in detail, leading to identification of possible database zzso
