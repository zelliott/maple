The zzso proteins belong to a family of related zzso that are present in all zzso organisms from zzso to zzso Their extraordinary evolutionary conservation suggests that they have essential cellular functions, although their exact role remains zzso zzso in specific zzso acids and zzso of normal proteins have been linked to altered proliferation and/or differentiation and, particularly, to zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are located on the inner side of the plasma zzso and their zzso properties include binding and exchange of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The favored hypothesis for zzso function is that these proteins exist in an equilibrium between an inactive zzso zzso and an active zzso zzso zzso in which they are able to interact with their as yet unknown cellular target or zzso zzso in cellular location, structure, and zzso with other known regulatory zzso proteins suggest that they play a role in zzso of signals from the cell zzso The zzso of the crystal structure of normal and transforming zzso proteins and the identification of cellular proteins that interact directly with them zzso zzso or suppress some of their biological effects zzso have opened new avenues in the search for their elusive cellular targets and in the zzso of the functional role of zzso gene zzso
