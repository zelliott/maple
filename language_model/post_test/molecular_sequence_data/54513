We studied five unrelated Mexican carriers of the Spanish zzso zzso zzso to characterize the size of the zzso the zzso and 3' zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of an zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso two zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso zzso was located at the same position as previously reported, and the 3' zzso was situated zzso zzso downstream of zzso and zzso zzso upstream of zzso The Spanish zzso zzso was associated with the zzso zzso 2 zzso + + - zzso in the studied zzso Because this zzso is relatively frequent in Spain, and the Mexican population contains a high level of Spanish genetic background, we propose that the zzso in both populations share a common ancestral zzso
