It is established that variations in the structure and activities of zzso zzso are zzso by differential zzso zzso The two zzso zzso zzso forms so far identified have either long or short zzso zzso Are analogous mechanisms likely to mediate regulation of zzso zzso Thus far, only a long form of zzso zzso is reported in the zzso Five human expressed sequence tags indicated the existence of a short zzso zzso of zzso zzso The occurrence and DNA sequence of the short zzso zzso was confirmed by analysis of human and rat zzso The novel zzso lacks a zzso zzso domain, and has 28 zzso zzso not present in the previously recognized longer zzso zzso of the short zzso zzso zzso and zzso 0 zzso were most abundant in zzso originating from muscle and nervous zzso zzso raised to a unique sequence of short zzso zzso recognized 240 zzso zzso in cardiac and skeletal muscle and in nervous zzso in zzso and zzso additional zzso zzso zzso were zzso In rat heart and skeletal muscle, both long and short zzso forms of zzso zzso localized in the region of the Z zzso The central region of the zzso zzso with the M line, was selectively labeled with zzso to the short zzso zzso In zzso the short form was not zzso in parallel zzso structures in which the long form was readily zzso In cultured zzso zzso zzso the long form was dominant in zzso with the short form being most abundant in cell zzso In zzso the short form was found to lack the binding activity for the zzso protein zzso which characterizes the zzso region of the long zzso zzso zzso of brain revealed that the short form was scarcely zzso in zzso density zzso in which the long form was readily zzso We conclude that variation in the structure of the zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso with their differential zzso zzso
