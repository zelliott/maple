The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso which adds a zzso zzso to zzso of the central zzso In the present work, 10 zzso of 5, each missing the potentially zzso zzso group, were chemically zzso The key intermediate used was zzso zzso zzso zzso which was zzso in zzso fashion by sequential zzso of protected zzso zzso The zzso group in zzso was then selectively zzso by either zzso or zzso with zzso zzso charged, aromatic and potential zzso zzso zzso The 10 zzso zzso thus produced were evaluated for zzso against zzso isolated from zzso zzso All of the compounds were competitive zzso with Ki values ranging from 21 to 297 zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso (or zzso complex does not involve critical recognition contacts at the position of zzso
