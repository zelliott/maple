We have developed a primary culture system for fetal mouse zzso zzso zzso cells which maintains their differentiated zzso When grown on a zzso basement membrane zzso zzso zzso cells formed zzso which became embedded in the zzso and developed into characteristic and highly zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso consisted of a zzso layer of zzso cells with extensive attachment to the zzso zzso surrounding a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that cells zzso these zzso had a high degree of membrane specialization and polarized zzso which in many respects zzso the in zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that under these culture conditions the zzso pattern of gene expression of fetal zzso zzso zzso was zzso After 6 days in culture these cells contained approximately the same amount of zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and the level of total zzso per cell, which is zzso to the protein synthetic capability of the cells, was also zzso The pattern of protein zzso was also very similar to that generated by fetal mouse zzso zzso cells in zzso In contrast zzso zzso zzso cells attached poorly to collagen I zzso zzso zzso were formed in which zzso interactions were more extensive than zzso zzso and in no cases was a central zzso zzso zzso on the surface of large zzso showed some evidence of membrane zzso while the majority of cells in the cultures exhibited little evidence of polarized zzso Despite the striking difference in zzso and zzso organization these cells still expressed high levels of zzso zzso and maintained the same pattern of protein synthesis as cells cultured on zzso These results indicate that the basement membrane is important for the organization of zzso zzso zzso cells into a functional zzso in zzso and thus presumably the maintenance of the integrity of the zzso barrier in zzso In contrast to several other zzso systems which have been zzso the type of zzso zzso does not appear to directly influence zzso gene expression by zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus the level of gene expression is not dependent on the zzso and zzso organization of this cell zzso
