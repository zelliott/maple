The current consensus view is that a higher zzso zzso of viruses cannot be established for two zzso zzso viruses appear to be zzso in origin, with several sets of viruses arising by different, independent routes at different zzso zzso subsequent virus adaptation for survival in different zzso combinations has involved the selective acquisition of additional genes by a process of cassette or modular evolution, with these additional gene zzso coming from other viruses or host genetic zzso Thus, depending on the gene product used for comparison, different zzso relationships can be zzso Further virus adaptation can arise by zzso of segmented zzso gene duplication, zzso zzso zzso point zzso or de zzso development of new gene products from existing, unused reading zzso The solution to the first objection is to place all viruses in a separate kingdom and assign the current viruses to several zzso that reflect these diverse zzso The solution to the second objection is to consider the core module of replication machinery as the major criterion on which to make the initial assignments to classes and zzso For zzso zzso the major criterion is the sequence identity of the zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso the positive strand zzso viruses can be assigned to five classes that zzso to the recently recognized zzso of zzso zzso These five classes contain four, three, three, three and one zzso zzso These zzso orders contain 31 virus families (including 17 families of plant zzso and 48 zzso (including 30 zzso of plant zzso This approach confirms the separation of the zzso and zzso into two families, the zzso and zzso but suggests that several other current zzso assignments, such as the zzso zzso C virus, zzso zzso E virus and zzso may be zzso The zzso and zzso appear to be distinct families in distinct orders, not distinct zzso of the same family as currently zzso In addition, the zzso are split into two families and apple zzso leaf spot virus appears not to be a zzso but a new zzso of the zzso From an analysis of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso it appears that they are not closely related to each other, but belong to four additional classes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one additional order zzso of one of the classes of positive zzso viruses in the same zzso as the positive strand zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
