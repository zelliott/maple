zzso of zzso complement is inhibited both in the soluble phase and at the membrane surface by a group of structurally similar zzso A possible solution to zzso rejection is to produce donor animals transgenic for human complement zzso Mouse cells expressing the human complement regulatory proteins zzso accelerating factor zzso or membrane zzso protein zzso were produced both by zzso technology and by zzso with the appropriate zzso The expression of either or both of these products protected the mouse cell from zzso by human (though not zzso complement in the presence of naturally occurring human zzso zzso This effect could be zzso by the addition of zzso zzso against zzso or zzso zzso rejection of zzso organ zzso is zzso by human zzso A zzso zzso zzso for zzso has been zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso pigs transgenic for human zzso have been zzso Of these, zzso transcribe zzso The amount of message produced varied substantially from animal to animal and was independent of copy number zzso zzso of human zzso on the zzso zzso surface could be detected and this was able to zzso human complement zzso zzso of protein expressed on different zzso varied both from pig to pig and within animals from tissue to zzso The pigs grow and develop normally with no evidence of ill effects due to possession of the zzso
