zzso zzso are important components of the inappropriate response of the immune system to zzso in zzso zzso In this study, the candidate zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the main target of the zzso response in patients with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Lupus zzso zzso were predicted using as a template the zzso and zzso zzso which are genetically linked to patients with SS and zzso Modeling of zzso and zzso was based on the crystal structure of zzso an zzso zzso of high risk factor of type I diabetes, which is also an zzso zzso The quality and reliability of the modeled zzso and zzso was confirmed by the zzso plot and the zzso molecular modeling zzso Common and/or similar candidate zzso zzso obtained by comparing three different approaches the Taylor's sequence pattern, the zzso quantitative zzso and the zzso artificial neural network, were subjected to zzso modeling with the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso and the best zzso candidate zzso were placed into the modeled zzso and zzso binding grooves to perform energy zzso zzso Six zzso zzso were predicted for zzso and nine for zzso covering parts of the zzso and the central regions of the zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso and zzso pockets of the zzso and zzso binding grooves experience very low zzso because they are less exposed to the zzso of the zzso The proposed zzso zzso zzso with zzso were further evaluated for their binding efficiency according to their potential interaction energy, binding zzso and zzso zzso Our approach constitutes the ground work for a rapid and reliable zzso concerning the zzso zzso mapping of zzso and could lead to the development of zzso zzso as zzso in zzso zzso
