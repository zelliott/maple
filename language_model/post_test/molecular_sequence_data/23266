zzso class zzso zzso are a valuable tool for zzso detection of zzso T zzso However, it has been proposed that T cells in a zzso state can have diminished binding of such zzso In the present study, we investigated this phenomenon at the zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso T cells had a reduced capacity to bind zzso class zzso zzso compared to their zzso zzso zzso the incubation temperature, time, or zzso zzso could not zzso zzso binding by zzso and zzso T zzso Neither zzso T cells nor zzso T cells zzso the zzso class zzso zzso zzso and in both cases the zzso bound to the plasma membrane at locations containing a low amount of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso however, led to decreased zzso binding by zzso T cells and to a lesser extent by zzso T zzso Finally, we show that the depth of the zzso state of the T cell, which determines its ability to regulate other T cell responses, zzso with the reduced zzso zzso We here demonstrate for the first time differential zzso class zzso zzso binding by regulatory zzso and zzso T cells with identical zzso
