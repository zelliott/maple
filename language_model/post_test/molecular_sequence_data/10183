In this report we describe a simple method using the vital dye zzso (and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to follow zzso graft rejection by flow zzso zzso zzso cell suspensions were injected zzso into various recipients and blood samples were taken at different time points to follow the transferred zzso We found that the zzso cells could be readily detected by flow zzso for up to zzso zzso The loss of these zzso cells in various zzso experiments with different major and minor zzso differences followed the rejection zzso previously described for skin zzso Thus, this method offers a simple tool to test the zzso of donor zzso with the host in zzso experiments in which donor and host are not completely zzso Furthermore, we developed a method to trace zzso transferred fluorescent zzso cells by light zzso by converting in zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso
