The band 3 zzso zzso is located in the zzso membrane of a zzso zzso cell line, whereas the zzso zzso is present in the zzso zzso When these cells were seeded at zzso density, they converted to an zzso zzso each of these proteins to the opposite cell membrane zzso The reversal of polarity is induced by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso kidney zzso is a zzso protein composed of eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso Other proteins known to have these zzso include zzso a zzso expressed at high levels in mouse zzso (8 zzso 5 zzso 1 zzso zzso a protein cloned from a rat taste bud library (4 zzso 3 zzso 1 zzso and zzso a sequence in human zzso zzso frequently deleted in zzso zzso (9 zzso 2 zzso 1 zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso clones contained a new zzso that was not found in zzso zzso but was zzso to the first zzso domain in zzso Furthermore, the zzso regions and the signal zzso of zzso were zzso to those of zzso Mouse zzso zzso was localized to zzso 7 band zzso which is zzso to human zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso are alternatively spliced forms of the same zzso The analysis of mouse zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso clone by sequencing and Southern zzso revealed that the gene also likely encodes zzso A new zzso against the mouse zzso domain recognized a protein in the mouse and rabbit brain but not in the immortalized cell line or zzso whereas an zzso to zzso and zzso zzso which are present in all the zzso recognized proteins in zzso zzso and brain from several zzso The most likely interpretation of these data is that one gene produces at least three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may participate in determining the polarized zzso of other zzso and brain zzso
