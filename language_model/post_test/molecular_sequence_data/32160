The aim of this study was to characterize the mechanism of resistance to zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso strain isolated from blood cultures in an 80-year-old patient suffering from severe pneumonia unsuccessfully treated with zzso 

Resistance genes zzso and zzso were searched for by zzso zzso of genes for zzso V and II of the zzso zzso zzso and genes for zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso were amplified by zzso from total zzso DNA and zzso 

Resistance genes zzso and zzso were not zzso Only zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso The strain contained a six zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso protein zzso 

This is the first report of emergence of a zzso resistant to zzso by zzso in zzso protein zzso during treatment with zzso
