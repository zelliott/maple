The use of viral zzso to deliver foreign genes offers some promise of generating new and more zzso zzso However, the zzso of foreign genes into viral zzso often results in the zzso zzso of one or more genes that adversely affect zzso In an attempt to overcome this problem, we constructed two portable zzso zzso The zzso were derived from the zzso late leader 1 zzso and were cloned into either the zzso zzso zzso gene or the zzso gene of zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso into chicken zzso zzso zzso and the cell zzso were later zzso for either zzso zzso or zzso zzso The first zzso cassette zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso sequences remained in the spliced zzso With the type A zzso inserted in the correct orientation for zzso zzso activity was not zzso However, in the reverse orientation, no zzso activity could be zzso The second zzso cassette zzso zzso had the zzso donor and zzso zzso sites converted to the zzso restriction zzso sites zzso I and zzso II, zzso The zzso restriction zzso sites enabled the portable zzso to be removed from the zzso zzso zzso sequences and inserted into any zzso restriction zzso site in the recipient zzso After zzso no zzso zzso sequences remained in the recipient zzso zzso zzso To demonstrate its zzso an zzso cassette was made by cloning the zzso coli zzso gene into a multiple cloning site within the type B zzso The zzso cassette was then cloned into a zzso II site in the middle of the zzso zzso Following zzso in zzso high levels of both zzso and zzso were zzso demonstrating that both genes were properly transcribed and zzso
