The zzso zzso zzso represent a structurally unique class of zzso acting as specific zzso of zzso protein zzso Here we report the cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso gene cluster from zzso zzso zzso and the development of a genetic manipulation system for zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene cluster for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified within a zzso region zzso 29 open reading frames zzso reading zzso 14 of which were assigned to the zzso gene zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso cluster to consist of six zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso incomplete zzso zzso zzso and a single free standing zzso domain as well as genes zzso other zzso and zzso zzso The involvement of the cloned gene cluster in zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso the zzso gene zzso resulting in a zzso production abolished zzso In addition, we characterized the zzso zzso from the zzso by expression in zzso coli and in zzso zzso zzso The previously unknown zzso of most zzso centers in zzso was established from a combined chemical and zzso zzso Taken together, these findings have allowed us to propose a rational model for zzso zzso The results further open the door to developing new derivatives of these promising zzso compounds by genetic zzso
