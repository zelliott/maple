zzso are important zzso of zzso zzso binding proteins zzso zzso regulate zzso actions and have zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso contribute to zzso zzso binding and zzso of zzso actions and zzso some zzso properties, but understanding how they achieve this has been constrained by the lack of a three-dimensional zzso We therefore determined the solution structure of the zzso of zzso using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The domain consists of a zzso type 1 fold zzso an zzso followed by a loop, a zzso zzso zzso incorporating a second loop, and finally a zzso flexible third zzso The zzso binding site on the zzso was identified by examining zzso spectral changes upon complex zzso It consists of a largely zzso surface patch involving the zzso the first zzso and the first and second zzso The site was confirmed by zzso of several zzso which resulted in decreased zzso binding zzso The zzso binding site lies adjacent to surfaces likely to be involved in zzso binding of zzso which might explain their decreased zzso affinity when bound to zzso and nuclear zzso Our structure provides a framework for understanding the roles of zzso zzso in modulating zzso actions and zzso zzso actions, as well as ultimately for the development of therapeutic zzso zzso for diseases including zzso
