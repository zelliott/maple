A zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso study of horse zzso was undertaken in order to define the regions of zzso that are and that are not structurally affected by the binding of the prosthetic zzso It was found that, in spite of the poor spectral resolution, a number of spin systems could be identified by using standard correlated zzso Four clusters consisting mostly of zzso zzso were detected by nuclear zzso zzso two of which involved the zzso side zzso zzso similarities to nuclear zzso zzso data collected on the zzso form of zzso suggested tentative assignments for several zzso It appeared that distinct zzso of side chains on the zzso side of the binding pocket and between the A, B, G, and H zzso maintain the same packing as they do in zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso
