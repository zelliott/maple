The mean zzso zzso of the zzso host zzso zzso containing guest zzso at position X, was measured as a function of pH and zzso strength at 0 degree zzso Changes in zzso at 222 zzso were interpreted in terms of a two-state zzso transition of a zzso zzso zzso pH zzso in low zzso of zzso defined changes in zzso stability resulting from the zzso of each guest zzso zzso zzso zzso at fixed pH generated zzso values for the neutral and zzso forms of each guest zzso free of zzso and zzso zzso These zzso values were used to calculate a zzso propagation zzso for each form of a guest zzso using the zzso zzso and assuming a universal nucleation zzso In all cases, the propagation zzso of a zzso is either unaffected or decreased by zzso of its side zzso
