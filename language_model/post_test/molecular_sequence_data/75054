The zzso zzso fragments of the alpha and beta zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso cell zzso library in the zzso zzso expression zzso by zzso zzso zzso fragments were subsequently used to screen a human zzso zzso zzso library by colony zzso zzso sequence analyses of the positive zzso clones zzso and zzso revealed an insert of zzso zzso zzso for zzso alpha and one of zzso zzso for zzso zzso respectively, allowing us to predict the complete zzso acid sequences of the precursor and mature proteins of these two zzso A putative leader sequence of 29 zzso acid zzso was identified in zzso resulting in a precursor protein of zzso zzso acid zzso (Mr zzso and a mature protein of zzso zzso (Mr zzso A similar leader sequence of 30 zzso acid zzso in zzso was also identified, resulting in a precursor protein of zzso zzso acid zzso (Mr zzso and a mature protein of zzso zzso (Mr zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso regions of the two zzso of human zzso were highly zzso with those of mature zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso sites determined in zzso alpha of bovine and zzso zzso were also zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso cell zzso zzso showed a single zzso of zzso zzso for zzso alpha and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso The precursor proteins of zzso alpha and zzso beta were detected by zzso from an zzso zzso translation zzso
