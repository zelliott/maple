Small molecular zzso zzso represent a new class of drugs for treating zzso zzso The evaluation of the primary resistance zzso associated with entry zzso during zzso zzso transmission is required because they may have a profound impact on the clinical management in zzso 

To evaluate the primary resistance zzso to zzso and zzso during zzso transmission and analyze the sensitivity of zzso derived from zzso pairs to zzso 

Nine zzso infected by zzso C zzso were recruited to analyze the prevalence and transmission of primary resistance zzso to zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso derived from six zzso were employed to construct zzso clones and to analyze the sensitivity to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso partial resistance to zzso zzso and zzso both zzso partial resistance to zzso are prevalent in mother and infant zzso indicating the transmission of primary resistance zzso during zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of acutely infected mothers seem to directly transmit to their corresponding zzso while some zzso at low frequency of chronically infected mothers would be lost during zzso Moreover, zzso clones derived from acutely infected zzso are less susceptible to zzso than those from chronically infected zzso 

Our study suggests that the transmission mode of primary resistance zzso and the sensitivity to zzso are dependent on infection status of zzso either acutely or chronically zzso These results may indicate that higher dose of zzso could be needed for treatment of acutely infected zzso compared to chronically infected zzso
