To zzso the biological significance of zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso tumors, we performed a zzso analysis using 43 cell lines established from tumors that had developed in several kinds of human zzso Because the same zzso point zzso was observed in three of six melanoma cell lines and no such zzso were observed in other types of zzso we focused further on melanoma, performed zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in these cell lines, and found one zzso zzso and three zzso zzso We further searched for zzso of zzso and zzso in 35 primary sporadic zzso from 35 Japanese patients and detected the zzso zzso point zzso in only nine zzso of zzso zzso differences in zzso frequency were observed among four zzso zzso four zzso of eight zzso spreading melanoma and five zzso of 15 zzso zzso melanoma had the zzso whereas none of 12 other types (six zzso melanoma, five zzso melanoma, and one zzso zzso had zzso The zzso zzso was observed frequently even in small zzso indicating that zzso of this gene may be one of the early events in the zzso of some zzso
