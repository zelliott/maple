zzso zzso are short zzso zzso molecules that regulate gene expression at the zzso level and have been shown to play critical roles during animal zzso The identification and comparison of zzso in zzso species are therefore paramount for our understanding of the evolution of body zzso We have characterized zzso zzso from the red flour zzso zzso zzso by deep sequencing of small zzso zzso We can zzso from a single study, that the zzso zzso set is at least zzso larger than that in the model insect zzso zzso zzso tens of zzso sequencing experiments in the zzso The rate of birth and death of zzso is high in zzso Only one-third of the zzso zzso sequences are zzso in zzso zzso and at least 18 zzso zzso are zzso in zzso but lost in zzso More than one-fifth of zzso that are zzso between zzso and zzso exhibit changes in the transcription, zzso organization, and processing patterns that lead to predicted functional zzso For example, zzso of zzso zzso exhibit seed shifting, and we describe zzso events in zzso of zzso zzso These shifts fundamentally change the predicted targets and therefore function of zzso zzso In general, zzso zzso are more representative of the insect zzso than zzso zzso and are more zzso in zzso
