zzso poisoning in primates and humans is due to zzso zzso as a result of low rates of zzso zzso This toxicity is not seen in rats, where zzso zzso rates are zzso zzso zzso in zzso is dependent on zzso zzso levels and on the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso zzso activity is lower in human liver than in rat liver, studies were performed investigating the properties of this zzso in rat and human zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from rat and human liver and was found to possess similar zzso molecular weights on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso acid analysis of the pure proteins showed an identical sequence for the first 16 zzso zzso zzso raised in rabbits against the rat liver zzso were zzso toward the activity of both rat and human liver zzso and appeared to recognize only the zzso zzso in zzso preparations of rat and human zzso zzso of pure rat and human liver zzso zzso showed similar zzso zzso It is concluded that rat and human liver zzso zzso possess very similar properties and that the activity of the zzso in human liver is lower than that of rat liver, due to a reduced amount of zzso protein in human zzso This may be an important factor in regulating zzso zzso in humans and may explain, in part, the zzso of zzso and the mechanism of toxicity of methanol in zzso
