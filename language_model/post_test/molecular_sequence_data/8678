A library of zzso zzso zzso DNA was constructed in the cloning zzso zzso zzso and screened for expression of zzso proteins by using a pool of zzso from patients who had been diagnosed with cat scratch disease zzso and had zzso to zzso zzso as determined by indirect zzso zzso zzso Ten zzso zzso were zzso as zzso plasmids by in zzso zzso All 10 zzso expressed a protein of approximately 17 zzso when they were examined by zzso with the pool of human zzso zzso zzso zzso of each zzso zzso indicated seven profiles, suggesting that cloning bias was not the reason for repeated isolation of clones expressing the zzso zzso The gene coding for the zzso zzso was zzso and shown to code for an open reading frame of 148 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence was zzso in nature and similar in size and composition to signal peptides found in zzso zzso The remainder of the deduced zzso acid sequence was more zzso and may represent zzso zzso Further zzso of the zzso zzso as a zzso fusion protein in the expression zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso protein that was highly zzso on zzso with individual serum samples from patients with zzso The agreement between zzso with the zzso fusion protein on zzso analysis and the results obtained by zzso zzso was zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein should be of value as an zzso for zzso diagnosis of zzso and zzso infections and warrants further study in attempts to develop a zzso vaccine to prevent long-term zzso infection in cats and the potential for further spread of these organisms to zzso
