zzso of four zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso of zzso and alters its zzso zzso This implies that modification (such as zzso and zzso of zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso domain, regulate the biological functions of zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 382 zzso to zzso (the A4 zzso retained the zzso activity of zzso zzso although the zzso activity of zzso promoter by the A4 zzso was slightly zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso and the A4 zzso in zzso cells caused growth zzso due to zzso zzso zzso with previous studies, the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the cells expressing the A4 zzso underwent zzso arrest but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was reduced in cells expressing zzso zzso but not zzso when the cells underwent zzso zzso This suggests that modification of the zzso zzso domain might inhibit zzso zzso zzso In other words, zzso requires an intact zzso to induce zzso zzso
