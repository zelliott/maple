The emergence of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was accompanied by major zzso and zzso zzso such as hinged zzso paired fins and zzso zzso zzso zzso subsequently zzso into two groups, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Here we report the zzso analysis of a zzso fish, the elephant shark zzso zzso We find that the zzso zzso is the zzso evolving of all known zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and features extensive zzso conservation with zzso zzso making it a good model for comparative analyses of zzso zzso Our functional studies suggest that the lack of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso explains the absence of bone in their zzso Furthermore, the zzso immune system of zzso zzso is zzso it lacks the zzso zzso zzso and most zzso factors, zzso and zzso receptors related to the zzso zzso despite the presence of zzso major zzso complex zzso zzso It thus presents a new model for understanding the origin of zzso zzso
