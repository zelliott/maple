Mass zzso comparative screening was used to identify zzso regulatory peptides involved in the successive steps of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of zzso zzso zzso was compared with that of zzso zzso which resulted in the detection of peptides that were present in both zzso These zzso which are suspected of being released by the zzso in the zzso zzso were submitted to a structural zzso This strategy led to the characterization of a new zzso regulatory zzso zzso able to inhibit the zzso of the whole female zzso tract and of the main zzso zzso zzso As zzso appeared to be the first regulatory zzso directly involved, at zzso zzso in the zzso of the egg capsule by the main zzso zzso it was named zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso analysis clearly demonstrated that zzso was expressed during zzso by the zzso zzso and released by the zzso in the zzso of the female zzso zzso In association with the zzso zzso zzso would be responsible for the storage of zzso to avoid the zzso of zzso zzso before zzso Released by the zzso zzso in the mantle zzso zzso probably in association with a cocktail of zzso regulatory factors targets the zzso to regulate the egg capsule zzso Thus, the zzso appeared to be one of the main sources of regulatory peptides involved in the successive steps of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
