zzso cells respond to zzso and environmental zzso such as DNA damage and heat shock zzso with the synthesis of zzso zzso at specific zzso regions, such as DNA breaks or HS zzso by zzso zzso zzso Little is known about the role of this modification during cellular stress zzso We show here that the zzso remodeler zzso is recruited to active HS genes in a zzso zzso zzso binds zzso suggesting that this physical interaction is important for zzso Indeed, a zzso zzso unable to bind zzso does not zzso to active HS zzso in zzso We have identified several zzso regions which bind zzso independently in zzso including the zzso and regions near the zzso containing motifs rich in K and R zzso Moreover, upon HS gene zzso zzso associates with nascent HS gene zzso and its zzso activity is required for efficient zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso compete for zzso binding in zzso suggesting a two step process for zzso association with active HS zzso initial recruitment to the locus via zzso interaction, followed by binding to nascent zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso zzso serves to rapidly attract factors that are required for an efficient and timely zzso zzso
