zzso translation initiation zzso zzso is a large zzso complex that binds to the 40 S zzso zzso and promotes the binding of zzso and zzso The molecular mechanism by which zzso exerts these functions is incompletely zzso We report here the cloning and characterization of zzso the zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is an essential protein of zzso Da that is required in zzso for initiation of protein zzso zzso repression of zzso expressed from a zzso promoter results in depletion of both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso in combination with zzso affinity zzso allows the isolation of a complex containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso binds both zzso and zzso fragments due to an zzso recognition motif near its C zzso zzso of the zzso 71 zzso acid zzso causes loss of zzso zzso but expression of the truncated form as the sole source of zzso nevertheless supports the slow growth of zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso of zzso plays an important role in the initiation phase of protein synthesis and that its zzso domain is required for optimal zzso
