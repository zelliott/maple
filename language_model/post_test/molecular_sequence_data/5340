Our studies are aimed at identifying the zzso factors that activate the zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso we performed a zzso screening of a zzso zzso zzso expression library, using the region of the promoter from zzso to zzso that contains sequences critical for expression in zzso zzso A clone was isolated corresponding to part of the coding sequence of zzso which is a zzso zzso factor that has been found to play an important role in the development of limb buds and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis, using the cloned zzso zzso zzso as a probe, demonstrated that zzso zzso cells zzso cells and zzso zzso contained zzso zzso transcripts of zzso zzso while zzso zzso cells that do not produce the zzso had barely zzso zzso The presence of zzso protein was demonstrated by Western zzso analysis in zzso zzso We also demonstrated that transcripts zzso the closely related zzso factor were not zzso by Northern zzso analysis in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the region from zzso to zzso of the zzso promoter were used in a zzso zzso zzso using zzso produced zzso and demonstrated that binding was localized specifically to the region from zzso to zzso zzso I protection analysis, using zzso zzso zzso demonstrated structurally induced differences in DNA zzso patterns between zzso and zzso and sequence analysis of this region revealed a direct repeat of the sequence zzso which is similar to the zzso zzso zzso When zzso at both sites were zzso zzso binding was dramatically reduced, and the activity of an zzso promoter construct decreased by approximately 50% in zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies suggest that zzso may play a role in the expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso
