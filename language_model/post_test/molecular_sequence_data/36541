zzso of published rat and human sequences for the zzso growth zzso zzso gene indicated the presence of CA zzso repeats in corresponding segments of zzso zzso of similar zzso sequences in the zzso and bovine zzso genes was zzso A zzso segment upstream of the zzso and bovine zzso genes was amplified using the zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso developed from a consensus of human, rat and bovine zzso Both zzso and bovine zzso products contained similar zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was cloned and zzso and an additional primer was developed specifically for zzso marker zzso Six zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 134, 136 or 138 zzso were observed in pigs with differing zzso between breeds zzso zzso zzso The same zzso were used to amplify the corresponding bovine zzso Three zzso of zzso 128 and 130 zzso were observed in a genetically diverse cattle population with estimated zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this study indicate sequence information from the human and laboratory species can be used to facilitate genetic marker development in livestock zzso
