zzso zzso regulators represent one of the largest groups of zzso regulators described to zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso branch of the zzso zzso are zzso within the zzso zzso which is subject to regulation by the zzso protein zzso In this work, zzso zzso was shown to bind strongly zzso zzso constant, zzso zzso to a region at positions zzso to zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso Within this region, we defined a zzso binding site with zzso symmetry that is required for regulation of zzso expression in zzso and for binding of zzso in zzso We also demonstrated that zzso zzso in negative zzso by monitoring expression of zzso via a zzso fusion to zzso Although zzso zzso are present in many zzso this work describes the first reported zzso of this regulator, as well as characterization of its binding site, which is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
