zzso zzso zzso is an abundant nuclear zzso that zzso the synthesis of zzso zzso from its zzso zzso upon binding to DNA strand zzso zzso has been implicated in many cellular processes including zzso transcription, and the maintenance of zzso zzso However, studies with mice and cells lacking zzso reveal a critical role for the zzso in the maintenance of zzso integrity zzso Recently, a significant level of zzso zzso activity has been detected in zzso derived from mice lacking zzso following treatment with zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wilson, zzso zzso Wang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso that originates from zzso zzso zzso and encodes a zzso of 493 zzso acid zzso bearing zzso zzso zzso This zzso that we named zzso for short zzso zzso has a calculated mass of zzso zzso and is identical in deduced zzso acid sequence to the zzso domain of zzso zzso hybrid analysis assigned the zzso gene to the zzso zzso in an immediate proximity to the known location of zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso are most probably products of the same zzso Active zzso is present in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells as demonstrated by zzso zzso and zzso using a specific zzso developed against zzso Like zzso zzso is localized in the cell nucleus, uses zzso as a zzso and is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso produces zzso of similar length and structure to that of zzso However, contrary to zzso zzso does not require DNA strand breaks for its zzso although it is zzso following zzso zzso
