The zzso cycle of the zzso transmitted African zzso involves an obligatory passage through the zzso fly, zzso zzso This intricate relationship requires the presence of molecules within the insect zzso including a zzso zzso that interact with the zzso Recently, a gene zzso for a zzso zzso with zzso activity, was isolated from a zzso zzso library of zzso zzso zzso Austen in our zzso Using the same approach, we have identified a similar gene from a zzso zzso library of zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso by this gene was expressed in bacteria and a zzso expression zzso The zzso zzso was found in the medium of zzso zzso cell cultures, indicating that the zzso zzso signal zzso was recognized and zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso protein also was zzso despite the absence of classical zzso and zzso sugar attachment zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso proteins were shown to zzso zzso and rabbit red blood cells in zzso This zzso was strongly inhibited by zzso zzso also inhibited the action of the authentic and zzso zzso upon the zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, both zzso and zzso zzso showed no significant differences in terms of these activities, indicating that a sugar zzso is not essential for biological zzso Our results provide an important molecular tool for further characterization of zzso zzso zzso
