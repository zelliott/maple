zzso cells zzso are the only professional zzso cells endowed with the ability to stimulate zzso T cells and initiate a primary immune zzso For this reason, zzso zzso has been shown to be highly effective in zzso zzso responses to viruses and zzso zzso Here we report on the use of DC zzso to enhance the B zzso zzso immune response to highly zzso proteins and the application of this approach to the generation of zzso zzso zzso against these zzso To illustrate the technique we describe the production of zzso to class II zzso zzso the major zzso complex zzso zzso a difficult zzso zzso to its high degree of identity among zzso We show that mice zzso with a combination of an intravenous injection of zzso zzso with zzso fragments of zzso followed by zzso injection of the zzso in incomplete zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso response against zzso while zzso from mice zzso using the traditional method zzso zzso zzso with zzso of protein in complete zzso zzso gave an almost zzso zzso Furthermore, a total of four fusion experiments demonstrate that zzso with zzso zzso is necessary for the efficient generation of zzso and a good yield of zzso specific for the zzso and the native zzso zzso zzso zzso four independent zzso carried out with zzso from mice zzso using the traditional method failed to produce zzso zzso We propose that zzso with zzso zzso should be the method of preference when attempting to raise zzso against weak zzso
