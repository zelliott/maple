By using zzso zzso and molecular strategies we have identified and cloned a zzso zzso a zzso from tomato zzso zzso plants zzso that is part of a zzso system activated in the plant as a result of infection with citrus zzso zzso This new zzso is closely zzso in terms of zzso acid sequence and structural organization, to the previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 93, zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso begins with a zzso signal zzso contains a zzso and a zzso mature domain which is zzso to the zzso zzso of bacterial zzso and zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso domain, the essential zzso zzso and zzso zzso that conform the zzso zzso of this family of zzso are zzso in zzso Northern zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction analysis demonstrated widespread induced expression of the zzso zzso zzso in plant zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso We propose that zzso is a member of a complex gene family of plant zzso zzso presumably involved in a number of specific zzso events activated during zzso in plants and that takes place in the zzso zzso
