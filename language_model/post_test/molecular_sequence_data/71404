Human zzso is expressed in germ zzso and in the majority of primary zzso Cell renewal zzso and some zzso zzso also have weak zzso zzso Yet, neither the exact location and frequency of zzso cells nor the changes in zzso expression during differentiation or zzso of individual cells are zzso This paper reports on the expression of zzso zzso reverse zzso protein in tumor and zzso zzso zzso by Western zzso and tissue sections by zzso using zzso raised against partial peptides of zzso Though zzso activity and zzso expression at both zzso and protein levels were generally higher in tumor part than in zzso part, these two were not always zzso expression of zzso did not always give rise to high zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso were stained with zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso In normal zzso zzso protein was zzso though weaker than in zzso in all zzso zzso zzso cells except those at the zzso the zzso distribution was much wider than that of zzso positive cells which were located at the bottom of the zzso zzso zzso contained a significant level of zzso protein revealed by Western zzso while having very weak zzso zzso zzso activity was detected in zzso cells only at the bottom half of the zzso zzso zzso was positive in tissue zzso but negative in almost all other zzso zzso It is of interest to see whether a significant level of zzso expression with low zzso activity is characteristic of zzso zzso zzso containing stem zzso In zzso detection of the zzso protein will permit further analysis of cancer diagnosis and stem cell zzso
