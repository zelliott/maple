zzso zzso that elicit zzso immune responses in responses to zzso stimulation remain poorly zzso We screened a human zzso zzso library with zzso from three zzso zzso patients who responded to zzso and identified a novel zzso zzso zzso belongs to the group of cryptic zzso without conventional zzso structure and is zzso by a cryptic open reading frame located in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso elicits zzso zzso responses in a subset of zzso zzso patients, as well as patients with chronic zzso leukemia and prostate cancer, suggesting that it is broadly zzso The expression of zzso transcripts was zzso in some tumor cells, but only slightly increased in zzso cells in response to zzso zzso By using zzso reporter zzso we showed that the translation of zzso was zzso by a novel internal zzso entry site zzso upstream of the zzso reading zzso Furthermore, the zzso translation, but not zzso transcription, was significantly zzso in response to zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that a novel zzso mechanism may be responsible for the translation of unconventional zzso zzso in responsive to zzso zzso The zzso zzso immune response against unconventional zzso zzso in patients with zzso diseases suggests zzso as a potential target of novel zzso
