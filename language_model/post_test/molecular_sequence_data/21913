We describe a novel zzso gene zzso that is expressed at high levels in embryonic stem cells and is restricted to blood islands and the zzso lineage during embryonic zzso zzso is expressed in zzso precursors but is excluded from the differentiated zzso zzso cells are seen in close proximity to zzso cells in zzso blood zzso zzso encodes a predicted zzso zzso protein that is zzso identical to human zzso The gene zzso zzso maps to a zzso of zzso zzso on human zzso zzso but its expression and function remain to be zzso We demonstrate that mouse zzso is a novel marker for analysis of the zzso zzso
