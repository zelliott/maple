Previous data suggested an elevated rate of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing was performed on five zzso repeats in the factor IX gene in at least 20 unrelated males of European and Asian descent (40 zzso zzso In these zzso zzso the estimated rate of zzso in Caucasians zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar to previously examined zzso sequences in the factor IX zzso and about twofold lower than previous estimates of the average rate of zzso for the zzso which zzso random zzso clones to detect zzso The zzso data on the rate of zzso in zzso sequences suggest that zzso due to gene zzso at these sites are zzso
