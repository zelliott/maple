We have amplified and zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso in 10 strains of zzso zzso Three premature termination zzso occur in the coding region of the gene in two zzso This zzso together with other indirect evidence, leads us to propose that zzso may be a zzso in zzso zzso zzso would be a zzso zzso in the sense that it retains intact the coding sequence (without stop zzso and other zzso usually observed in zzso in most zzso zzso zzso We conjecture that the zzso cluster may consist in other zzso species of functional and zzso zzso We also conjecture that the rarity of detected zzso in zzso may be due to the difficulty of discovering them, because most of them are zzso
