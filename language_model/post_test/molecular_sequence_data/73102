The region for intrinsic zzso termination of the zzso coli zzso gene coding for zzso zzso is repeated three zzso Each region encodes an zzso hairpin and zzso 3' zzso Most zzso is terminated at the first zzso zzso but a complete termination requires the second zzso zzso and the third zzso A deletion experiment, where deletions were extended from zzso into zzso was carried out to determine parameters affecting in zzso zzso termination at zzso The deletion of zzso zzso or the downstream sequences up to near the termination site of zzso showed little or no significant effect on zzso termination at zzso When the base corresponding to the acute termination position of zzso was included in the zzso termination efficiency slightly zzso For zzso bearing the deletion of the region zzso the zzso hairpin and zzso 3' tail, termination was completely zzso When zzso contained only the region zzso the zzso hairpin without the zzso 3' tail, termination still occurred even though the efficiency was zzso zzso of zzso termination were discussed with these zzso
