The rice zzso zzso has a sequence zzso to the gene for zzso protein zzso zzso but the coding sequence is interrupted by internal stop zzso A functional zzso gene was isolated from the rice nuclear zzso suggesting a zzso event from the zzso to the zzso The nuclear zzso gene encodes a long zzso extension showing significant similarity to a part of zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso protein from human and a zzso zzso zzso zzso Isolation of a functional rice zzso zzso and subsequent sequence comparison to the nuclear zzso indicate that the zzso portions of the two zzso are zzso The zzso zzso sequence shows that the zzso region is divided into two zzso Surprisingly, the zzso region is located between the two zzso DNA gel zzso analysis indicates that both zzso and zzso are present at a single locus in the rice zzso These findings strongly suggest that the two gene transcripts result from a single zzso precursor by alternative zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the size of the mature zzso is zzso zzso suggesting removal of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Considering that the rice zzso zzso lacks the zzso gene but contains the zzso zzso transfer of the zzso gene seems to have occurred before the transfer of the zzso zzso The migration of the zzso zzso sequence into the already existing zzso gene could bestow the capacity for nuclear expression and zzso zzso
