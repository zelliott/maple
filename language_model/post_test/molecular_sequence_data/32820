A novel zzso named zzso had previously been isolated from a plant zzso zzso zzso This zzso encodes two interesting properties with applications in the dairy zzso a zzso zzso activity that stimulates zzso acid conversion to aroma compounds, and zzso resistance that can be used as a zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso can be transferred naturally to other zzso but appears to be incompatible with certain other zzso zzso During this study, the complete sequence of zzso zzso 319 zzso was determined and zzso This zzso contains 67 zzso that include 20 IS elements that may have zzso transfer events between zzso zzso and other zzso living in the same zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso Even though it is a zzso zzso it is relatively stable due to a zzso replication mode and the presence of two genes involved in its maintenance zzso However, zzso is incompatible with zzso zzso plasmids because both possess the same replication and partition zzso zzso is not zzso but can be naturally transmitted via zzso by zzso elements carried by the zzso or by other zzso such as the zzso sex factor, which is widely distributed in zzso zzso In addition to several genes already found on other zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso transport and zzso zzso zzso also carries several genes not yet identified in zzso zzso Finally, it does not carry genes that would trigger concern over its presence in human zzso
