zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso requires two template jumps to generate the linear zzso DNA required for zzso The zzso H activity of reverse zzso has several roles during this zzso We have examined zzso H zzso that define the zzso 3' and zzso ends of zzso zzso leukemia virus minus strand DNA prior to the second template zzso In both the zzso reaction and on model zzso in zzso zzso H zzso the zzso zzso template between the second and third zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but other minor zzso between 1 and 10 zzso zzso of this junction are also zzso Similar experiments examining the specificity of zzso H for zzso primer removal revealed that zzso generally leaves a zzso A zzso at the zzso end of minus strand zzso These observations suggest that three bases are typically duplicated on the ends of the minus zzso leading to an intermediate following the second jump which contains zzso zzso Model zzso mimicking the structure of this intermediate demonstrate that reverse zzso has little difficulty in utilizing such a zzso structure for the initiation of displacement zzso
