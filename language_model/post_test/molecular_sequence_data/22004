zzso zzso are small, versatile zzso zzso that recognize zzso sequences zzso They are present in most zzso species zzso so far, but in contrast to other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have not experienced the same amplification in zzso during zzso zzso and structural analysis has shown the zzso signature zzso to be the site of interaction with zzso zzso In contrast, composition and length of the zzso half of zzso zzso are not zzso Similar to other zzso zzso zzso bind to many different zzso that zzso on a minimal consensus zzso All zzso zzso analyzed so far selected for the core motif zzso whereas zzso preferences adjacent to this motif zzso As a result of this analysis, two zzso have been zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The latter zzso comprises most zzso zzso and is characterized by a shorter zzso loop and an zzso instead of the zzso found at position 8 in zzso zzso zzso Recent analysis of binding zzso for zzso zzso allowed identification of novel interaction zzso Thereby zzso has contributed to a functional understanding of zzso zzso proteins and sets the stage for a more systematic investigation of their functions in zzso
