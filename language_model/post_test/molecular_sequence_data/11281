DNA zzso play an essential role in the initiation and termination of zzso DNA zzso zzso and characterization of zzso from several plasmids has revealed the reaction zzso zzso zzso duplex DNA in a zzso and zzso manner by zzso a zzso The product of the reaction is a zzso zzso DNA zzso with a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso bound to the zzso end of the zzso strand via a zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso and zzso a second zzso zzso the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso complex is relatively zzso a property that is likely to be essential for its role as an intermediate in the process of zzso DNA zzso zzso unwinding of the zzso DNA intermediate is required to produce the single strand of DNA transferred to the recipient zzso This reaction is zzso by a DNA zzso an activity intrinsic to the zzso protein in some, but not all, zzso zzso The first zzso zzso is essential for initiation of zzso strand transfer, whereas the second is presumably required for termination of the zzso The zzso in conjunction with several auxiliary zzso forms the relaxation complex or zzso first described nearly 30 years ago as being associated with zzso and zzso zzso
