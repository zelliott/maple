zzso tissue is rarely available from patients with early zzso with the exception of zzso zzso However, T cell populations early in the development of zzso may be enriched in zzso cells and critical to disease zzso To investigate the T cell repertoire in early zzso we zzso a zzso protocol for detection of T cell zzso zzso transcripts present in small amounts of zzso zzso To expand the zzso for zzso zzso of zzso was performed with a 3' constant region primer plus either a mixture of variable region zzso or random zzso zzso this method improved the sensitivity of zzso This technique is applied here to the analysis of zzso transcripts in zzso zzso from individuals with early zzso arthritis zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso specimens zzso with zzso transcripts detected in zzso early zzso and zzso zzso specimens zzso Confirmation of transcripts by sequencing of cloned zzso products verified the specificity of zzso The most frequently expressed zzso V region families in early zzso zzso were V alpha 11, V alpha 14, V alpha 28, V beta 7, V beta 9 and V beta zzso Several of these V regions have previously been implicated in studies of chronic zzso zzso J alpha and J beta region usage was similar to that seen in chronic zzso and zzso N region motifs were zzso We conclude that it is possible to detect zzso transcripts in small zzso zzso from individuals with early zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
