To study the zzso structure and the active site of human zzso virus reverse zzso zzso the zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso to zzso in large zzso The zzso zzso consists of two major zzso of zzso and zzso Da in zzso amounts and a minor species of zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso proteins revealed that the zzso zzso of the two major zzso are identical to that of the zzso zzso The two zzso zzso at positions 38 and 280 in the zzso zzso acid sequence were replaced by zzso in an attempt to zzso the role of the zzso groups in zzso zzso activities, zzso formation, and zzso zzso The results reported here show that the two zzso are zzso and their absence in the zzso acid sequence of the reverse zzso does not affect DNA zzso or zzso H zzso activities or the formation of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso activity such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are equally effective on the zzso containing no zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
