We have generated and characterized a novel zzso zzso highly specific for the zzso form of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used this zzso to examine in detail the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our results extend previous zzso studies by demonstrating that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in late zzso zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso appears to spread throughout the condensing zzso and is complete in most cell lines just prior to the formation of zzso zzso in which a zzso but zzso zzso organization is zzso In general, there is a precise spatial and zzso correlation between zzso zzso and initial stages of zzso zzso zzso of zzso begins in zzso and is complete immediately prior to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We propose that the singular zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso may be involved in zzso two key functions during zzso zzso regulate zzso interactions to promote binding of zzso factors that zzso zzso zzso as cells enter zzso and zzso coordinate zzso zzso associated with zzso
