zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso protein zzso and shares zzso sequence identity with protein zzso zzso zzso in its zzso zzso To investigate the functional zzso of zzso zzso analysis was carried out using various zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso deletion zzso showed that the zzso region of zzso played important roles in the formation of the zzso active structure of the zzso and a critical role in zzso zzso A zzso zzso a fusion of the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso exhibited similar zzso specificity to zzso but not to zzso suggesting that the zzso region of zzso is crucial for its unique zzso zzso Point zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso highly zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain of zzso family, resulted in a significant loss of zzso activity, indicating that these zzso acid zzso may play important roles in the zzso activity of zzso Although zzso a zzso zzso zzso retained zzso activity, it was found to be much less stable upon incubation at 37 degrees C than wild type zzso indicating that the zzso region of zzso is important for the maintenance of the zzso active zzso The results suggested that the zzso and zzso sequences of zzso are essential for the regulation and stability of zzso
