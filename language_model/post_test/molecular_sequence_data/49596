zzso is a zzso integral membrane protein required early in zzso zzso and zzso cells lack identifiable zzso Two zzso zzso zzso strains of the zzso zzso zzso were made to investigate the role of zzso in the early stages of zzso zzso In zzso medium at 16 degrees C, these zzso underwent de zzso zzso zzso and exhibited early zzso protein zzso into zzso structures found at the zzso zzso periphery of cells or sometimes associated with zzso The de zzso zzso zzso seemed zzso with zzso occurring at different stages of development both within cells and between zzso zzso with peripheral nascent zzso and cells with structures zzso distinct from zzso such as zzso zzso structures that zzso with zzso to zzso zzso proteins and to the zzso zzso protein zzso and that surrounded zzso zzso were observed during zzso of zzso zzso in cells incubated in zzso acid medium at 16 degrees zzso These structures were not detected in zzso or zzso zzso Their role in zzso zzso remains zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins to these structures suggests that zzso directly or indirectly sequesters components of the zzso zzso zzso Such a role is consistent with zzso zzso producing cells with fewer, larger, and clustered zzso
