zzso and zzso studies have shown that the product of the zzso coli zzso gene is an integral membrane protein with a central role in protein zzso We found the zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso protein zzso at the same position occupied by zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso coded for a hypothetical product zzso identical to zzso coli zzso a protein thought to contain 10 zzso segments and 11 zzso regions, six of which are exposed to the zzso and five to the zzso We predicted similar segments in zzso zzso zzso and the primary sequences of the second and third zzso regions and the first, second, fourth, zzso zzso and tenth membrane segments were particularly zzso sharing greater than 50% identity with zzso coli zzso We propose that the zzso zzso regions interact with similar zzso zzso factors in both organisms and that the zzso zzso segments actively participate in protein zzso Our results suggest that despite the evolutionary differences reflected in cell wall architecture, zzso and zzso bacteria possess a similar protein export zzso
