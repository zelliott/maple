The membrane bound zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso channel blocker zzso under equilibrium conditions in the presence of the zzso zzso The zzso incorporated into the zzso zzso was reduced by addition of zzso a specific zzso for the zzso side for zzso zzso The zzso was zzso and zzso with zzso and/or zzso and the resulting fragments zzso by zzso zzso analysis resulted in the identification of zzso as a major zzso labeled by zzso in a zzso zzso This zzso is located in the zzso and putative zzso segment zzso of the zzso a region zzso to that containing the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso segment zzso further showed that no zzso in this zzso
