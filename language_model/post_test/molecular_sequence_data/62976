zzso are zzso zzso proteins that are expressed primarily in the male germ zzso in zzso and zzso bodies and within zzso and zzso zzso zzso They are proposed to be important for zzso architecture and zzso stability in the zzso tail and in other zzso and zzso zzso Using an in zzso (electronic zzso zzso approach to identify germ zzso genes in zzso we isolated a new member of the zzso gene family from mice, zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Northern zzso analyses confirm that zzso encodes a zzso zzso transcript zzso zzso in the zzso of adult zzso In zzso zzso analysis in the zzso revealed zzso zzso expression exclusively in late zzso zzso and early round zzso The putative zzso protein shares zzso overall sequence identity with the human zzso and includes a fully zzso zzso terminal zzso signature sequence present in all zzso family zzso In addition, using database mining, highly zzso zzso zzso were identified in zzso fish zzso zzso and rats zzso zzso which shared zzso and zzso identity, respectively, with mouse zzso The zzso gene maps to zzso zzso 11 in a region that is zzso to the human zzso zzso region containing the human zzso zzso Our studies demonstrate that zzso is a novel zzso zzso male germ zzso protein and suggest that it might perform important roles in male zzso development and zzso
