Transfer zzso of the extreme zzso zzso zzso contain several modified zzso among them zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso present in positions 54, 55, 56 and 57 of the zzso zzso At the same positions in zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso are found in the so-called T zzso Using as zzso a zzso transcript of zzso zzso zzso devoid of modified zzso the zzso activities of several zzso modification zzso including those for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in cell extracts of zzso Here, we demonstrate that modification of zzso into zzso in zzso zzso occurs via a zzso zzso zzso The first step zzso to the formation of zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso followed by the zzso of the zzso group of the zzso zzso by a zzso zzso This zzso zzso differs from that leading to the formation of zzso in the zzso loop of zzso zzso In the latter case, zzso formation zzso the zzso zzso of zzso into zzso Thus, zzso strategies for catalyzing the formation of zzso in zzso differ in organisms from distinct evolutionary zzso
