The zzso zzso division cycle zzso complex is a zzso zzso that also plays a role in DNA zzso The complex contains the zzso factor zzso also known as zzso or zzso which is involved in cellular zzso regulation and zzso zzso In a recent large-scale zzso analysis for proteins associated with this complex, proteins involved in transcription, zzso regulation, DNA repair, the zzso system, zzso zzso cellular aging, the zzso and trafficking, including four members of the zzso complex, were zzso In the present paper we report that zzso interacts directly with zzso and zzso to the nucleus, where it associates with the zzso We mapped the interaction site to the zzso 100 zzso acids of zzso which interfere with zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso influences the zzso of a model zzso as well as of its own zzso in zzso In addition, we found that zzso is alternatively spliced in a zzso and zzso dependent zzso These results suggest a novel and unexpected role of zzso in nuclear zzso zzso where it might signal membrane events to the zzso zzso
