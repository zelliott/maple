zzso zzso is a zzso viral surface zzso that is essential for virus release during influenza virus zzso Previous studies have not explored why influenza zzso forms a zzso when the bacterial zzso zzso already exhibits excellent zzso zzso activity zzso In this study, we focused on 28 highly zzso zzso among all zzso zzso identifying 21 of 28 positions as crucial zzso for viral survival by using reverse zzso Maintaining zzso zzso activity levels is critical and numerous zzso zzso were located at the zzso zzso however, these zzso did not affect zzso zzso activity levels or zzso cellular zzso but rather affected the stability of zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso is essential for viral zzso An increased understanding of the biological functions of zzso in particular zzso zzso could facilitate an alternative design for zzso to combat influenza virus zzso
