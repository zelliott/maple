In this paper we have studied the zzso of expression of the two functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in root zzso of the model zzso zzso zzso We have used a combination of different techniques, including zzso in zzso zzso and promoter zzso zzso zzso in transgenic plants, to provide the means of zzso gene expression with protein zzso These studies revealed that zzso regulation zzso zzso plays an important part in controlling zzso protein levels in zzso of zzso zzso The major locations of zzso zzso zzso and protein are the central zzso the zzso and the zzso of the vascular zzso These findings indicate that in zzso zzso might be involved in other zzso processes in addition to the primary zzso of zzso released by the bacterial zzso The two genes show different but overlapping patterns of expression with zzso being the major gene expressed in the infected cells of the zzso zzso fragments of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, have been zzso and primer extension revealed that the zzso promoter is expressed in zzso from an additional start site that is not used in zzso Generally these fragments in the zzso transgenic system were sufficient to drive zzso expression in almost all the zzso and cell types where zzso proteins and transcripts are located except that the zzso promoter zzso did not express zzso highly in the zzso infected zzso These results indicate that the zzso regulatory elements responsible for zzso expression are missing from the zzso promoter zzso
