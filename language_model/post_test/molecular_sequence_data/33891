We carried out zzso and molecular dynamics simulations on zzso and zzso which are zzso of the zzso family of zzso We modeled the binding mode of zzso with zzso , zzso and zzso and examined their zzso zzso We found that the binding of the zzso end of zzso was quite stable across all three zzso However, the zzso zzso group was dramatically more mobile in zzso compared to either zzso or zzso The zzso group at the zzso binding site was zzso in zzso and zzso but was somewhat more mobile in zzso although the zzso ring itself on average stayed close to the zzso binding site in zzso This greater mobility is likely due to the greater openness of the zzso and zzso binding sites on zzso The calculated binding free energies were consistent with the much weaker binding affinity of zzso for zzso zzso was predicted to bind at the zzso and zzso binding sites of zzso and the binding mode was quite stable during the molecular dynamics simulation with zzso wrapping around the zzso The modeled binding mode suggests that zzso is able to inhibit all three proteins because it makes use of the zzso and zzso binding sites alone, which is a fairly narrow groove in all three proteins unlike the zzso binding site, which is much broader in zzso
