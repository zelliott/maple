The Atlantic cod zzso zzso is an important natural resource for northern societies and is now also considered to be a promising candidate for zzso In recent years, much effort has been directed towards the development of zzso tools, and zzso initiatives for Atlantic cod have been zzso Despite the growing attention devoted to the Atlantic cod zzso basic aspects of its zzso structure and organization remain zzso Thus, the present work aims to study zzso features of the Atlantic cod as a contribution to the knowledge of this zzso zzso The Atlantic cod displays a zzso number of 46 zzso with a zzso formula 16 zzso + 30 zzso Conventional zzso was improved by zzso mapping of two classes of repetitive zzso zzso zzso clusters were assigned to pairs 2 and 4; small amounts of zzso zzso clusters were occasionally detected on pair zzso These findings could not be related to the geographical origin of the zzso but were consistent with the zzso of these repeated genes in fish in zzso zzso zzso gene zzso apparently corresponding to a single zzso zzso class, were detected on twelve zzso zzso 11, 12, 14, 17, 20 and zzso The present update of the existing but zzso information on the zzso of Atlantic cod, plus the first physical mapping of repetitive genes in this species zzso opens the way for an integrated approach that combines genetic and physical mapping with the assembly of the zzso of this commercially important zzso
