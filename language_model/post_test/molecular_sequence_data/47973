zzso zzso C zzso a member of the family of membrane bound zzso zzso is the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso peptides and the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso is activated upon zzso binding to increase zzso zzso levels, which in turn activates other downstream zzso events in the zzso zzso is also activated in zzso by zzso zzso We have used the zzso cell line as a model system to investigate the regulation of zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso in the presence of zzso whereas zzso activity is zzso The zzso of zzso activity by zzso is dependent on the presence of zzso zzso and is probably brought about by a direct binding of zzso to zzso The protein zzso domain of zzso which has earlier been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of zzso activity, may be a possible site for the binding of zzso to zzso
