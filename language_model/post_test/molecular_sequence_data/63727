zzso zzso zzso the final step of the zzso of zzso the replacement of the zzso group of zzso zzso by a zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso is very tightly bound to the zzso it accepts 8 hydrogen bonds from zzso side chains and a pair of water zzso and is in close proximity to a zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso that, via a water zzso is responsible for positioning the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso was predicted to increase the freedom of the zzso and as a result the zzso giving a decrease in the overall rate of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso was thus prepared and characterized by zzso zzso fluorescence, visible CD, and zzso zzso spectral studies, as well as steady state and zzso state kinetic zzso zzso zzso and visible CD zzso are consistent with a shift in the zzso to zzso zzso equilibrium toward the neutral zzso in the internal Schiff base of the free zzso zzso the zzso acid external Schiff base zzso and the zzso intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso clearly indicate the presence of two zzso (presumably open and closed forms of the zzso that zzso slowly on the zzso time scale in the zzso and zzso zzso data suggest the decreased rate of the zzso likely reflects a decrease in the amount of active zzso as a result of an increased flexibility of the zzso which results in substantial zzso binding of zzso in its external Schiff base, and a stabilization of the external Schiff bases of zzso and zzso The zzso binding and stabilization of the external Schiff bases are thus linked to the shift in the zzso equilibrium and increase in the rate of zzso of the open and closed forms of the zzso The location of the zzso in the zzso site determines additional interactions between the zzso and zzso in the closed zzso form of the zzso consistent with an increased rate of zzso of the open and closed forms of the zzso upon increasing the rate of flexibility of the zzso
