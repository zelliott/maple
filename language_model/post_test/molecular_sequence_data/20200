zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene reduce cell zzso and in strongly affected individuals cause zzso shoot development that leads to zzso zzso growth in zzso zzso zzso showed increased activity of zzso zzso reduced root growth and enhanced zzso The expression zzso of the shoot zzso marker genes zzso and zzso were enlarged in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso but overall showed zzso similar to that of the zzso zzso The zzso gene was identified by zzso zzso It encodes a novel 684 zzso acid zzso containing a single zzso domain in the zzso part and zzso binding and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso reporter gene was detected mainly in zzso and young zzso A green fluorescent zzso zzso protein localized to the zzso zzso The zzso defects indicated altered zzso properties, and we zzso that zzso acts as a zzso zzso However, analyses of the zzso composition revealed no significant differences of the zzso zzso the zzso acid content and the overall degree of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso The findings support a function of zzso as a zzso with an essential role in cell zzso and coordinated plant zzso
