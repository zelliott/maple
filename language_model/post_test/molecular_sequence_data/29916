The zzso zzso virus zzso type 1 zzso regulatory protein zzso is required for induced expression of zzso early and late zzso yet the mechanism by which this occurs is not zzso We examined the promoter and zzso sequences of the zzso early gene that encodes zzso zzso for the ability to interact specifically with zzso in gel zzso zzso zzso complexes containing zzso were observed with several distinct regions zzso the zzso zzso zzso elements that interact with cellular zzso factors were apparently not required for these interactions to zzso zzso zzso formed zzso complexes with fragments from these regions, and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the interaction between zzso and these sequences can be zzso None of the zzso sequences that interact with zzso contains a consensus binding site for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Wilcox, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reflecting the ability of zzso to interact with more than one DNA zzso A zzso zzso protein expressed from the viral zzso that retains the ability to bind to a consensus binding site but does not bind specifically to the identified sites zzso the zzso promoter results in induced zzso of the zzso zzso These data support hypotheses for zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in zzso cells that do not require the intrinsic ability of zzso to bind specifically in or near the promoter of the zzso zzso
