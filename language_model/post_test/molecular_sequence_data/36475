Short tandem repeats zzso base zzso are not uncommon in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with such sequence zzso when under zzso stress, manifest unusual sensitivity to zzso specific zzso To explain this, it has been suggested that one DNA thread should be shifted relatively to another, so that they could form two zzso zzso protruding from the opposite chains and separated on the DNA zzso by the length of a direct zzso The structure was proposed to play a role in the regulation of transcription, organization of zzso and in the zzso Such type of folding could have been zzso by base pairing between the zzso This attractive possibility of the zzso zzso formation requires a delicate zzso analysis and direct experimental zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was tested by a chemical modification method at one zzso level zzso The results show that bases located within the proposed zzso zzso are well protected from the zzso zzso This fact encourages us to publish a 3-D model for the zzso DNA (and zzso The zzso is characterized by a remarkable symmetry having three mutually perpendicular zzso zzso zzso the bank of zzso sequences has revealed more than 500 sites, the transcripts of which are capable of folding into the zzso form, which allow us to regard the zzso form as a novel universal structural zzso zzso the abundance of zzso in zzso three times exceeds that of the coding zzso This may reflect a functional role (or zzso of the zzso zzso
