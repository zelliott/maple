The formation and zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso represent a potentially important means for plants to regulate zzso levels and thereby zzso zzso The identification and characterization of zzso defective in these processes is advancing the understanding of zzso regulation and zzso Here we report the isolation and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso which has reduced sensitivity to several zzso acid zzso zzso is less sensitive to a synthetic zzso and low zzso of an zzso precursor but responds to free zzso and other hormones tested similarly to wild zzso The gene defective in zzso encodes a zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which converts zzso to zzso zzso We did not detect zzso or zzso defects in the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in the zzso coding sequence zzso similar zzso as the originally identified zzso zzso In contrast, we found that disruption of the previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso does not alter zzso responsiveness or zzso any obvious zzso It is possible that zzso acts in the conversion of zzso to zzso A, which is a potential precursor of zzso and zzso zzso
