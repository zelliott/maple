zzso ephemeral fever virus zzso is an zzso zzso that causes a debilitating disease of cattle in Africa, Asia, and zzso however, its global zzso are poorly zzso An evolutionary analysis of G gene zzso zzso zzso sequences of 97 zzso zzso collected from Australia during 1956 to 2012 revealed that all have a single common zzso and are zzso distinct from zzso sampled in other geographical zzso The age of the Australian zzso is estimated to be between 56 and 65 years, suggesting that zzso has entered the continent on few occasions since it was first reported in 1936 and that the zzso zzso was the source of all currently circulating zzso zzso the Australian zzso has evolved as a single genetic lineage across the continent and at a high evolutionary rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso of 66 zzso using zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso sites zzso zzso and zzso have been relatively stable, although variations in site zzso defined four zzso zzso A shift in an zzso at site zzso which occurred in the mid-1970s, was strongly associated with a zzso zzso Similarly, a shift at site zzso was associated primarily with zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso which map to the tip of the spike on the zzso form of the G zzso Finally, we propose that positive selection on zzso 215 was due to zzso zzso zzso to Kimberley virus zzso This is the first study of the evolution of zzso in Australia, showing that the virus has entered the continent only once during the past 50 to 60 years, it is evolving at a relatively constant rate as a single genetic zzso and although the virus is relatively stable zzso zzso have resulted in four zzso zzso Furthermore, the study shows that the evolution of zzso in Australia appears to be driven, at least in part, by zzso zzso to zzso which has a similar distribution and ecology but has not been associated with zzso As zzso and zzso are each known to be present in Africa and Asia, this interaction may occur on a broader geographic zzso
