zzso 1 plays a crucial role in zzso metabolism in zzso zzso skeletal muscle, and zzso Its zzso role involves two cellular zzso regulation of zzso zzso activity and regulation of fatty acid zzso In this study, we have demonstrated that zzso 1 gene zzso expression is regulated by cellular zzso which are key regulators of zzso zzso We have also characterized the zzso element and nuclear factor zzso sites in the human zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that these elements are responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso regulatory zzso protein 1) and nuclear factor zzso Furthermore, we investigated whether zzso 1 is involved in zzso by zzso of zzso small interfering zzso We zzso that zzso regulation of zzso 1 gene zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso involves changes in the activity of zzso zzso
