We report the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains zzso zzso including a zzso direct terminal zzso The gene content and organization clearly place zzso in the zzso zzso group of zzso but there is approximately 5 zzso at the right end of the zzso that is not present in other members of the group, and the zzso of zzso genes zzso through 3 appear to have undergone an unusual zzso zzso analysis identified 10 putative promoters for the zzso zzso zzso and seven putative zzso zzso The zzso following the gene zzso the major zzso zzso has a termination efficiency of about 50% with the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso related to zzso provided clear evidence for horizontal exchange of sequences in the ancestry of these zzso and clearly demarcated exchange zzso one of the zzso zzso lies within the coding region for a zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sequence strongly suggested that DNA replication occurs in large part through a zzso zzso possibly with circular zzso
