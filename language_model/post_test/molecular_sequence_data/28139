The gene for an zzso protein from a group A zzso strain was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso called protein zzso was zzso on zzso allowing complete zzso in a single zzso Analysis of protein zzso by Western zzso demonstrated a major zzso band, with an apparent molecular weight of 42 zzso The zzso protein was shown to bind serum zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso of both zzso There was no binding to zzso zzso or zzso but a weak binding to zzso zzso experiments with whole bacteria indicated that zzso and zzso bind at separate zzso zzso with zzso fragments showed that protein zzso binds to the zzso region of both zzso and zzso The equilibrium constant of the reaction between protein zzso and zzso human zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing of protein zzso demonstrated a direct repeat of 7 zzso acids in the zzso region, a feature previously found in several zzso M zzso This suggests that protein zzso like M zzso may be a zzso zzso zzso
