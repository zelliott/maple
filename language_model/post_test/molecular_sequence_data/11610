The basic zzso zzso zzso protein Max associates with members of the zzso family, as well as with the related proteins Mad zzso and zzso Whereas both zzso and zzso zzso bind related zzso zzso zzso activates zzso and promotes proliferation while zzso zzso zzso and suppresses zzso dependent zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of two novel zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso interact with both Max and zzso and repress zzso from a promoter containing zzso binding zzso Using a rat zzso zzso transformation zzso we show that both zzso and zzso inhibit zzso dependent cell zzso An examination of the expression patterns of all mad genes during zzso zzso reveals that zzso zzso and zzso are expressed primarily in zzso zzso zzso zzso is also expressed in zzso cells, but is zzso with either zzso zzso or both in zzso cells of the developing central nervous system and the zzso In the developing central nervous system and zzso zzso of zzso genes occurs zzso with zzso of mad family zzso These expression patterns, together with the demonstrated ability of Mad family proteins to interfere with the proliferation promoting activities of zzso suggest that the regulated expression of zzso and Mad family proteins function in a concerted fashion to regulate cell growth in zzso zzso
