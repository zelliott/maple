We have isolated and cloned a zzso repeating element from zzso zzso for use as a zzso DNA zzso The repeat zzso only with DNA from zzso zzso not with DNA from other zzso zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the repeat is approximately 180 zzso long and is zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cloned zzso with zzso large DNA molecules of 3 zzso zzso stocks revealed a band in the position expected for zzso although these were believed absent in zzso zzso This band migrated to the zzso zzso area of the gel at 4 different pulse zzso and also zzso with a zzso repeat probe from zzso zzso The band is unlikely to be simply zzso material, since it failed to zzso with another highly repetitive sequence from zzso zzso and was consistently present in different zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso does possess zzso although possibly only 1 or 2 per zzso
