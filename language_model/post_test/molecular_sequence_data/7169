The zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso promoters of zzso zzso recruit an zzso zzso sharing characteristic with zzso I, but there is no sequence zzso between them nor between these promoters and zzso zzso We report the detailed characterization of the zzso zzso The zzso region upstream of the zzso start site was sufficient for full promoter zzso zzso analysis revealed three short critical stretches at positions zzso to zzso zzso 1), zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso the spacing of which was zzso These elements were zzso in the promoter for a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences containing box 1 of the zzso promoter and box 2 of the zzso promoter were zzso A specific binding of proteins to the zzso strand of box 2, but not to zzso DNA, zzso Competition experiments indicated that these proteins also bind to the corresponding region of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of such a zzso of 40 zzso appeared to be shared by these zzso
