A rapid zzso method for the identification of zzso peptides in zzso protein zzso by specific marker zzso signals is zzso In our study we investigated the use of alkaline conditions together with a previously described method for selective and sensitive detection of zzso zzso combining zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso marker zzso zzso 79, zzso and zzso 97, zzso were generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The method was evaluated and validated for zzso synthetic peptides using different alkaline pH values and zzso zzso zzso conditions zzso zzso enhance the generation of zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso and enable the use of zzso 79 zzso and zzso 97 zzso as zzso marker zzso Note that zzso separation in zzso acid containing zzso zzso the use of zzso 97 zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso method was applied for the detection of zzso peptides in a zzso zzso zzso The expected zzso and zzso peptides were detected and rapidly identified by zzso and zzso zzso
