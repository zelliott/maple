zzso in base composition appear to be prevalent in zzso and zzso zzso evolution, but their zzso zzso zzso and causes remain zzso Here, we study base composition evolution within the X zzso of zzso zzso and five of its close zzso zzso were zzso on six extant and two ancestral lineages for 14 zzso and 9 zzso zzso zzso content evolution is highly variable both within the zzso and within the zzso zzso In the lineages leading to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso content at silent sites has increased rapidly near zzso but has decreased in more zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a zzso excess of zzso zzso zzso synonymous changes within a small zzso zzso region close to the zzso zzso Base composition changes within zzso are consistent with changes in zzso patterns, but stronger zzso zzso at synonymous sites suggests contributions of natural selection or biased gene zzso The zzso zzso lineage shows a less extreme zzso of zzso content distributed over a wider genetic region zzso zzso zzso A lack of change in zzso content for most zzso within this region suggests a role of natural selection in localized base composition zzso
