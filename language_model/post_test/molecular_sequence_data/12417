A novel gene zzso an zzso zzso which zzso resistance to zzso zzso and zzso was cloned from zzso zzso Stone zzso Its sequence was determined and found to show considerable similarity to an zzso gene previously cloned from R plasmids from zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have designated the genes from the R plasmids and this work zzso and zzso zzso The two zzso genes share zzso zzso identity, and their deduced protein products are zzso zzso These data suggest that the genes derive from a common zzso zzso between the zzso sequences of both zzso genes and other resistance zzso known to reside in zzso environments was also zzso zzso zzso specific for either zzso or zzso were used in zzso studies with a series of zzso zzso and zzso clinical zzso Of 59 clinical zzso tested, no zzso zzso with both zzso 30 zzso zzso with the zzso probe, 12 zzso zzso with the zzso probe, and 17 zzso did not zzso with either zzso These data suggest the existence of at least one other zzso zzso
