zzso studies indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, has direct effects on cardiac muscle zzso However, conventional zzso studies designed to establish the presence of zzso zzso sites in the heart have yielded conflicting zzso There are discrepancies also between the latter and the zzso distribution predicted from the pattern of the zzso transcripts localized by in zzso zzso Here we have employed the technique of zzso amplification with the zzso chain reaction to confirm the presence of zzso zzso A, B, and C zzso zzso in rat and human cardiac zzso In the rat heart, the distribution of the A and B zzso transcripts appears to be relatively zzso in contrast, the C type zzso is concentrated principally in the zzso with no difference between the left and right sides of the zzso A and B zzso DNA products were obtained after amplification of left, but not right, zzso zzso from the heart of a zzso male with zzso zzso the yield of C zzso DNA was similar for both zzso If these zzso transcripts are translated into functional receptors in the rat and human heart, zzso and the other zzso peptides may have direct effects on cardiac function, including regulation of zzso zzso release via a short feedback loop, zzso of zzso of the heart, or zzso of cardiac zzso
