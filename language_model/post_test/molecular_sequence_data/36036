zzso zzso acid zzso is the major zzso neurotransmitter in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and deep nuclear zzso are known to receive zzso zzso Since zzso exerts its zzso effects via zzso zzso it is of interest to determine the zzso relationship between the formation of zzso zzso and the expression of genes coding for the zzso zzso In a previous study, we have examined the zzso expression of binding sites for zzso which binds with high affinity to the beta zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso were used to examine the appearance and distribution of zzso beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3 zzso zzso in the developing zzso mouse zzso by in zzso zzso In the adult zzso the distribution of the three zzso zzso was clearly different, despite considerable zzso and their zzso expression differed throughout zzso zzso The beta 1 zzso signal appeared within the zzso zzso during the second zzso week as a discrete band at the interface of the molecular and zzso cell zzso zzso were distributed zzso over small densely zzso cells surrounding the zzso zzso relatively few grains were visible over zzso cell bodies zzso This distribution may reflect an association with zzso zzso or basket zzso The beta 2 and beta 3 zzso signals were present considerably earlier than that of the beta 1 zzso The beta 2 signal was present at birth in the zzso cell zzso as development zzso the signal became increasingly intense over both zzso and zzso zzso At birth, the beta 3 zzso zzso was present in the external zzso and molecular zzso later becoming largely localized within the zzso cell zzso zzso beta 2 and beta 3 zzso probe labeling was present over the adult zzso cell zzso zzso levels of beta 2 signal were seen over zzso cell zzso considerably less labeling was observed with the beta 3 zzso The adult distribution of beta 2 and beta 3 zzso zzso showed good spatial correspondence with the known zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso each being present within the zzso cell zzso Our results indicate that the zzso expression of zzso zzso beta zzso messages within a given cell type may be independently zzso and that acquisition of the beta 2 and beta 3 zzso occurs before these cells become integrated into mature synaptic zzso
