Four zzso of potato zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso and zzso were established on four potato zzso The identity of each isolate was confirmed by zzso using two universal primer pairs and one specific primer set derived from zzso of zzso zzso zzso The four isolate samples formed similar zzso patterns after zzso of zzso zzso zzso products with restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The direct DNA sequencing with the specific primer pair showed that there are no differences in the base sequences among zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and that zzso is closely related to zzso Thus, the four zzso were identified as members of the zzso proliferation zzso
