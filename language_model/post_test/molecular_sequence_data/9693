Small zzso zzso zzso are involved in many aspects of zzso processing and zzso In animals and zzso a large number of zzso are zzso within zzso of zzso zzso These zzso contain only single zzso genes and their processing involves zzso release of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso In contrast, some zzso genes in plants are found in small clusters and are expressed zzso An examination of zzso zzso sequences in zzso has identified four additional zzso genes which are closely linked to the zzso zzso The presence of seven and five zzso genes respectively on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments further emphasizes the novel organization of plant zzso genes as clusters of multiple different genes zzso both box zzso and box zzso zzso The plant zzso gene clusters are transcribed as a zzso zzso transcript from an upstream zzso The lack of zzso sequences between the genes suggests that processing of zzso zzso involves zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso zzso can be processed from both zzso and zzso transcripts in tobacco zzso such that processing is zzso zzso
