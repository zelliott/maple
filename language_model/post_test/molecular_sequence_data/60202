zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the synthesis of zzso zzso which is essential for the incorporation of zzso into zzso This zzso acid has uniquely moderate basic properties and is an important group in many zzso functions of zzso A compilation of currently known primary structures of zzso shows that the zzso of these zzso zzso consist of zzso zzso acid zzso This represents a relatively short chain length among zzso zzso zzso whose zzso chain sizes range from about 300 to zzso zzso acid zzso The crystal structures of zzso from two organisms and their complexes with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso have been zzso zzso from zzso coli and zzso zzso are very similar zzso zzso consisting of three zzso the zzso zzso domain containing the zzso zzso zzso and the three motifs characteristic of class II zzso a zzso zzso domain inserted between motifs 2 and 3 that may contact the zzso stem of the zzso and a zzso zzso domain that may be involved in the recognition of the zzso stem and loop of zzso The zzso reaction follows the standard zzso zzso zzso also belongs to the group of zzso that can rapidly zzso zzso zzso a compound that is suspected to be involved in several regulatory mechanisms of cell zzso Many zzso of zzso have been tested for their properties as zzso or zzso of zzso leading to the zzso of zzso relationships concerning zzso importance of the zzso and zzso group, and the nature of the side zzso zzso has been found to act as a particularly important zzso in zzso diseases such as rheumatic arthritis or zzso zzso attempts have been made to identify zzso responsible for the zzso with such zzso
