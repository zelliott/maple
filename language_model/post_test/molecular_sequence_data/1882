Thirty species and one variety of zzso zzso including all zzso distributed in Japan, were zzso analyzed with DNA sequence zzso The evolution of zzso characters is discussed on the basis of the zzso relationships zzso All species were Asian, except one, zzso zzso from zzso The nuclear zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso region and two zzso zzso regions, between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso of zzso DNA were zzso The zzso of trees obtained from ITS and the zzso zzso zzso are largely zzso zzso zzso the representative of the zzso zzso in Asia, was sister to all other zzso The position of the American species, zzso zzso which also belongs to the zzso zzso was not well zzso The zzso tree based on combined sequence data largely supports the zzso origin of the zzso sections proposed zzso However, the zzso relationship between them is not well zzso probably due to rapid zzso The section zzso a zzso group, is well defined in the DNA analysis, suggesting its independent status in the zzso zzso In spite of their zzso zzso the three endemic species of the zzso Islands are zzso The occurrence of curved seeds seems to be zzso scattered over the zzso tree without showing a particular zzso zzso
