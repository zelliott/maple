We have isolated two novel zzso designated zzso and zzso from the Down syndrome critical region zzso on zzso zzso which has been defined as minimal overlapping region of partial zzso 21 patients and located between zzso break point and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes consist of 6 and 5 zzso zzso Alternative use of zzso start sites and alternative zzso events produce different zzso species and proteins from both zzso Three different transcripts of zzso gene zzso three putative zzso proteins of zzso 134, and 108 zzso zzso while 4 different transcripts of zzso gene zzso two forms of proteins with 190 and 106 zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed in various human zzso zzso whereas the zzso gene is expressed only in limited zzso at low zzso Both zzso and zzso genes are candidates for the zzso of Down syndrome, although the function of these genes remains to be zzso
