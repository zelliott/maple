zzso zzso evolution has been largely characterized by rampant, zzso horizontal gene transfer involving both zzso and zzso source zzso This pattern has emerged through study of the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and is based upon a sparse sampling of the enormous diversity of these zzso The zzso DNA zzso of the family zzso including zzso appear to evolve through zzso different mechanisms, possibly as result of their strictly zzso lifestyle and small zzso zzso However, this apparent difference could reflect merely a dearth of relevant zzso We sought to characterize the forces that contributed to the molecular evolution of the zzso and to examine the genetic structure of this single family of zzso by sequencing the zzso of zzso zzso isolated on a single bacterial zzso zzso comprised zzso of the zzso zzso in our environmental samples, and sequencing yielded 42 new zzso zzso zzso analysis of the genes contained in these and five previously described zzso zzso identified three distinct zzso and revealed at least two horizontal transfer events between zzso All members of one zzso have a block of five putative genes that are not present in any member of the other two zzso Our data indicate that horizontal transfer does contribute to the evolution of the zzso but is both zzso and zzso different from what has been observed for the zzso zzso
