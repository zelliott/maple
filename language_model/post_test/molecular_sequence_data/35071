Acute zzso B related to injection drug use is often caused by zzso a zzso that probably was introduced in Western Europe in the zzso The aim of this study was to describe genetic change over time in injection drug zzso zzso in one geographic zzso Fourteen complete zzso and partial zzso regions of 17 zzso strains of zzso D3 causing acute zzso or chronic zzso zzso B at different time points between 1975 and 2009 were zzso The 14 complete zzso clustered in zzso trees on a zzso of zzso along with a few published sequences with high zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso tree zzso based on zzso coding for surface zzso or core was uncertain with zzso values below zzso or zzso Variation of zzso coding for zzso acids zzso zzso and 143 in the a zzso of zzso was however linked to complete zzso zzso indicating that these zzso might be useful as markers for zzso The results show that knowledge about circulating strains is critical for the interpretation of molecular epidemiology zzso The low degree of genetic change over time of zzso in the studied groups suggests that outbreaks of acute zzso B in injection drug users might originate from a limited number of individuals with chronic zzso zzso based on core or S region zzso obtained poor support from zzso values, but the presence of zzso zzso acid zzso suggests that the S region may be useful for zzso molecular epidemiology of zzso
