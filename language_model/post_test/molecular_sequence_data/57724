One of the two mechanisms that regulate expression of the zzso zzso in the single stranded zzso zzso is zzso zzso This mechanism prevents zzso from binding at the start of the zzso zzso unless the upstream coat zzso is being zzso zzso analysis had identified a zzso region of 132 zzso in the coat gene over which zzso should pass to activate the zzso zzso zzso deletion studies in our laboratory had further narrowed down the regulatory region to 12 zzso Here, we identify a long-distance zzso interaction of 6 base pairs as the basis of the zzso zzso The 3' side of the zzso region is located in the zzso zzso region, some 20 zzso before the start zzso of the zzso The zzso side encodes zzso acids 31 and 32 of the coat zzso zzso that disrupt the long-range interaction abolish the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by second site base zzso restores zzso zzso
