An zzso isolated from a zzso saline zzso pond in Kazakhstan zzso zzso resembles a small zzso in the light zzso but has a zzso zzso cell coat without zzso Thus it can be identified zzso as a new species of zzso Sawyer, 1980, and it is zzso named zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences of the new species and four zzso zzso zzso additionally shows that zzso zzso is a sister zzso to a robustly zzso zzso The close relationship between zzso and zzso is also confirmed by the analysis of zzso zzso secondary structure showing the specific zzso in the region zzso in all species of both zzso Analysis of zzso gene sequences fails to resolve the position of zzso but demonstrates that zzso zzso 1993 is probably related to zzso The position of zzso within zzso remains zzso despite our efforts to resolve it using broader zzso sampling of zzso testing alternative tree zzso and removing the zzso zzso Among zzso zzso zzso and zzso Olive et zzso 1984 are probable relatives to zzso zzso trees zzso support an inclusion of the family in zzso zzso but more zzso data are necessary to test this zzso
