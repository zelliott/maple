The beta zzso of zzso translation initiation factor 2 zzso is a representative of a family of proteins whose members include the beta zzso of zzso translation initiation factor 2 zzso and the zzso domain within translation initiation factor 5 zzso no members of this family of proteins have been structurally characterized up to this zzso In the work presented here, zzso from zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli, zzso and analyzed using zzso zzso zzso The zzso was found to contain two independent structural zzso The zzso domain contains a zzso zzso beta sheet and two alpha zzso and is structurally similar to the zzso domain of a zzso heat shock zzso factor and a domain within zzso protein zzso This structural similarity was an unanticipated result, since no significant zzso was detected at the level of primary zzso The zzso domain of zzso contains a zzso motif of three zzso beta zzso with four zzso zzso arranged as two zzso units separated by 17 zzso zzso zzso on the surface of each domain that are likely candidates for direct interaction with other components of the zzso apparatus were zzso The significant primary sequence zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso when combined with the structural results in the work presented here, permitted structural features to be predicted for these latter two zzso zzso
