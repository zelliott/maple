The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso route used by zzso cells to channel to downstream targets a diverse array of signals, including those controlling cell proliferation and zzso Recent findings suggest that the zzso is assembled by specific scaffolding proteins that in turn regulate the efficiency, the location and/or the duration of signal zzso Here, through the angle of studies conducted in zzso and zzso zzso we present two such zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and highlight their implication in a novel mechanism regulating zzso zzso zzso Based on recent findings, we discuss the possibility that zzso a zzso zzso does not solely act as a scaffold, but directly zzso zzso zzso function by a zzso mechanism apparently shared by zzso zzso
