We describe the characterization of a novel zzso of human zzso zzso zzso variable zzso gene zzso detected through zzso to a mouse zzso gene segment zzso The new human zzso gene segment zzso zzso contains three members, all of which have been characterized with respect to zzso zzso zzso location, and expression in human zzso and peripheral T zzso Our results indicate that one member of the zzso zzso is not expressed in either tissue type although its coding region, promoter, recognition, and zzso sequences all appear to be functional at the zzso level, possibly indicating regulation at the level of zzso
