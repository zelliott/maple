zzso gene maps of zzso species are becoming increasingly valued in assigning gene zzso to function in human and animal models, as well as zzso the natural history of zzso zzso To extend this power to the domestic cat, a radiation hybrid zzso map of the cat was constructed zzso zzso Type zzso genes with 176 zzso zzso providing coverage over all 20 zzso zzso zzso of parallel zzso maps of human and cat reveal 100 zzso segments ordered zzso between the species, nearly three times the number observed with zzso zzso painting zzso The observed number is equivalent to theoretical predictions of the number of zzso segments to be found between cat and human, zzso that zzso Type I gene markers is sufficient to reveal nearly all zzso segments for species that exhibit the most frequently observed zzso rate of zzso zzso The zzso zzso map comparisons provide a new zzso tool for comparative gene mapping in the cat and related zzso and provide confirmation that the cat zzso organization is remarkably zzso compared with zzso These data demonstrate that ordered zzso gene maps provide the most precise assessment of comparing zzso short of zzso construction or zzso zzso
