Many regions within the envelope of human zzso virus type 1 zzso that affect its structure and function have been zzso We have previously reported that the interaction of the second zzso zzso and third variable zzso regions of zzso influences the ability of zzso to establish a productive infection in susceptible zzso To better understand the basis for this interaction, we have conducted zzso analyses of envelope expressed from molecular zzso clones of zzso containing defined zzso in C2 and zzso that individually and in combination zzso affect envelope zzso The substitution of a zzso for an zzso zzso zzso at a potential zzso zzso site in zzso which severely zzso virus zzso reduces zzso processing of zzso into zzso the association of zzso with zzso and the ability of zzso to bind to the zzso cell surface zzso zzso zzso The change of an zzso to an zzso zzso in zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso restores virus zzso to near zzso levels by increasing the amount of zzso associated with zzso as compared with the zzso zzso but does not compensate for the zzso processing zzso The zzso change in the context of the zzso zzso has no affect on processing, association, or zzso zzso These results indicate that the impaired zzso of the zzso zzso virus is due to a marked reduction in the amount of zzso zzso and suggest that the interaction of C2 and zzso zzso the association of zzso with zzso
