It has been proven that zzso zzso zzso might play an important role in the zzso and progression of numerous zzso zzso The aim of this study is to detect the zzso and protein expression of zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso as well as to analyze the zzso features and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression was detected in zzso and zzso cell lines by reverse zzso chain zzso zzso protein expression was determined in 55 cases of zzso and 17 cases of adjacent zzso lung zzso by zzso zzso The zzso features and zzso interactions of zzso were zzso Gene zzso zzso and signal zzso analysis were zzso 

zzso zzso expression in zzso cells was zzso lower than that in zzso zzso zzso protein expression was significantly higher in zzso zzso than that in adjacent zzso lung zzso A significant difference of zzso protein expression was existed between zzso cell lung cancer and zzso zzso zzso zzso but was not correlated with the zzso age, zzso zzso zzso tumor size, and zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso was a highly zzso and stable protein located in the zzso An zzso domain and several sites of zzso which may function in signal zzso gene transcription, and molecular transit, were zzso In the 54 selected zzso interactions of zzso zzso and zzso play roles in the zzso zzso 

zzso may play an important role in the zzso and progression of zzso Thus, zzso may be a novel zzso for the diagnosis of zzso or a new target for its zzso
