The avian zzso of zzso provides an essential zzso for B cell development and zzso repertoire expansion by a gene conversion zzso To explore regulatory interactions between B lineage cells and the zzso zzso we sought to identify genes zzso cell surface molecules selectively expressed on zzso B zzso We report in this work the identification of the zzso gene that encodes a zzso zzso zzso that is a distant relative of the zzso B cell differentiation zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed by zzso B cells and a B cell line, zzso that also zzso its zzso V region genes by gene zzso Two forms of this type II membrane zzso differing in their zzso zzso are generated by the differential usage of two zzso initiation zzso The longer zzso zzso which is the most abundant, contains a consensus zzso zzso zzso motif in its zzso zzso zzso of the zzso molecules zzso proliferation of zzso B cells and the zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso may thus zzso zzso B cell zzso
