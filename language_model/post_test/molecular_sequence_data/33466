The zzso of zzso remains zzso Recently, by mass zzso sequencing of peptides zzso from zzso molecules of zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso patients, we identified potential zzso in zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the capacity of selected peptides to stimulate lung and blood T cells of zzso patients using an zzso zzso zzso In peripheral blood, there were strong T cell responses to a zzso derived from the zzso protein zzso in 6 out of 11 zzso patients with active disease but not in patients with other zzso zzso zzso T cell responses against peptides derived from zzso zzso or from zzso zzso were detected in zzso as well as zzso zzso By using zzso peptides presented in zzso in the lungs of zzso patients, we have identified blood and lung T cell zzso responses that may help sustain the inflammation in this zzso
