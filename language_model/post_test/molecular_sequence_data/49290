zzso and feather disease is a major avian disease of both captive and wild zzso and zzso zzso Clinical signs include beak zzso and abnormal growth, together with weight loss and in some individuals the disease is zzso We investigated the relationship between viral zzso and their hosts in order to test for a positive association between distinct viral zzso and avian zzso Specifically, we used the zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify and sequence a zzso zzso segment of a coding region in the zzso and zzso Disease zzso zzso zzso zzso and blood samples from 25 zzso birds representing 10 species were zzso and the zzso was detected in 21 samples from New zzso A zzso analysis of DNA sequences from 17 specimens together with previously published sequences from Australian zzso revealed three lineages present in New zzso One viral lineage was found in six zzso representing two species zzso zzso a second lineage was detected in a zzso zzso zzso and a third was found in 10 zzso representing seven species zzso zzso This distinctive zzso pattern of viral sequences with groups of zzso species indicates a zzso association between the virus and these zzso
