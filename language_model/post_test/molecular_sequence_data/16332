It was demonstrated that zzso sequence zzso contains a zzso bent zzso zzso DNA structure at its zzso close to one of its 16 zzso terminal zzso The minimal number of copies of zzso related sequences and the locations of the latter on the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso were zzso Evidence is presented of the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of a large DNA segment on the zzso coli zzso
