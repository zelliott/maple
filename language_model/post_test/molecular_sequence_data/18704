The human zzso virus zzso protein zzso has a central role in the zzso of host innate zzso by zzso cellular zzso degradation pathways to zzso the zzso activity of host restriction zzso however, the underlying mechanism by which zzso achieves this remains zzso Here we report a crystal structure of the zzso zzso The structure reveals that zzso by means of two zzso organizes formation of the zzso complex by interacting with zzso zzso and zzso The larger domain zzso zzso of zzso binds to the same side of zzso as zzso indicating that zzso and zzso are exclusive for zzso zzso zzso of the smaller domain zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso are cooperative and mimic those of zzso with the latter two zzso A unique zzso motif of zzso which is located between the two zzso zzso makes no contacts with the other proteins but zzso the zzso of the zzso which may be important for zzso zzso Together, our data reveal the structural basis for zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso complex, laying a foundation for rational design of novel zzso zzso
