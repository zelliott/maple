zzso natural killer T zzso cells are innate T zzso that specifically recognize zzso zzso zzso as zzso presented by zzso zzso zzso zzso cells by administering zzso improves disease outcomes in zzso cancer models and, thus, there is great interest in the clinical potential of these lipids for treating human zzso However, humans possess several other zzso zzso that are not present in mice and it is not clear whether these zzso zzso which also bind zzso affect human zzso cell zzso We demonstrate here that zzso which is zzso with zzso on blood zzso cells and on a fraction of B cells, is able to present zzso zzso as a weak zzso to human zzso cells, and that the presence of zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso of zzso cells by zzso zzso human B cells expressing zzso induced stronger zzso cell responses to zzso than the zzso zzso and an zzso against zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso zzso These results suggest that therapeutic zzso of human zzso cells by zzso will be driven zzso by zzso cell zzso Thus, B cell zzso that zzso zzso and zzso may be particularly susceptible to zzso therapy, and cancer vaccines using zzso as zzso may be most effective when presented by zzso zzso zzso
