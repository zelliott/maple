In this study we report on the cloning of two novel human type II zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were specifically expressed in the inner root sheath of the hair zzso Together with the genes of two previously described type II inner root sheath zzso zzso and zzso the zzso and zzso genes were zzso in the type II zzso zzso gene domain on zzso zzso zzso tree analysis using all known type II zzso and hair zzso revealed that the zzso formed a branch separate from the other zzso and hair zzso zzso in zzso zzso and indirect zzso studies of human hair zzso which also included the zzso zzso demonstrated that both zzso and zzso were specifically expressed in the inner root sheath zzso but showed a different onset of expression in this zzso Whereas the zzso expression began in the zzso bulb region, that of zzso was delayed up to the height of the zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso was specifically expressed in the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was zzso suited to further investigate the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso cells, characterized by horizontal cell extensions that pass through the zzso layer, abut upon the companion layer, and form zzso connections with the surrounding zzso Previously, we detected zzso only in the region along the differentiated zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso we now demonstrate this cell type to be clearly zzso to the entire zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso penetrate the zzso layer actively and may play a role in zzso plasticity and resilience to the otherwise rigid upper zzso zzso
