The zzso protein zzso has a prominent role in the zzso of zzso signals zzso by the zzso zzso Upon zzso engagement, zzso becomes zzso and zzso recruits to the membrane several proteins implicated in the zzso of downstream signaling zzso However, little is known about the role of other zzso motifs present in the zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso contains several zzso zzso zzso which are essential for proper signal zzso through the zzso zzso of these zzso motifs in the human T cell line zzso prevents proper calcium influx, zzso zzso and zzso production in response to zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso form of zzso has a reduced ability to bind to zzso and zzso although zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and 191 is not zzso raising a possible role for the zzso motifs of zzso for the binding of important zzso The functional role of zzso zzso motifs in signal zzso could be zzso by an effect on zzso zzso as their zzso significantly diminishes the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, these zzso motifs seem to have a regulatory role, given that upon their zzso zzso shows enhanced zzso zzso the zzso zzso motifs likely regulate signaling pathways that are essential for T cell zzso
