The zzso zzso locus of zzso commune regulates sexual development and contains the code for two zzso Y and zzso which are thought to form a complex and function as a zzso zzso zzso of these proteins into the nucleus may be an essential step in zzso sexual zzso The Y proteins contain a zzso basic zzso which is an excellent candidate for a nuclear zzso sequence zzso while Z proteins contain no such zzso Here we describe experiments in which deletions were made in the putative zzso sequence of zzso We show that this putative zzso is essential to the function of the Y protein and capable of zzso green fluorescent protein zzso to the nucleus in zzso zzso Further, we describe genetic experiments that demonstrate the first zzso protein interactions in zzso These results are consistent with our previously zzso hypothesis that the zzso complex is likely to be of a higher order than zzso
