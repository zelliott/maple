The zzso domain of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso was characterized using zzso zzso zzso The peptides used as zzso have sequences corresponding to zzso acids zzso and zzso the two zinc finger regions of the zzso domain of the human zzso and produced zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso Mouse zzso nuclear zzso and zzso 4 S zzso zzso as well as 8 S zzso zzso zzso were observed to react with the zzso by Western zzso and zzso density zzso zzso analyses indicating that the zzso domain of the 8 S zzso zzso is not completely masked by heat shock protein 90 or other zzso Only zzso detected a zzso zzso form of the zzso on Western zzso zzso In a gel shift zzso neither zzso altered the pattern of the nuclear zzso interaction with the zzso zzso zzso response element zzso In contrast, zzso zzso partially shifted the 8 S zzso zzso zzso This concurs with zzso analysis and zzso zzso studies with the human zzso that have shown that the second finger is not in contact with the zzso The results of the gel shift zzso were confirmed by zzso density zzso analysis using the same buffer zzso The nuclear zzso complex did not react with either zzso suggesting that when the zzso nuclear zzso form binds the zzso the specific zzso zzso involved with the DNA binding may be blocked and unable to bind the zzso The zzso zzso complex reacted only partially with the second finger zzso zzso suggesting that on zzso zzso the second finger zzso is not completely blocked by DNA binding or zzso zzso
