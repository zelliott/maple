The molecular adapter zzso is likely to be implicated in the development of certain cancer zzso In this study we show that zzso binds the insulin zzso when they are activated and zzso zzso This interaction is documented by zzso experiments, zzso pull-down zzso and in zzso zzso In addition, our results argue in favor of a preferential association between zzso and the insulin receptors when compared to other zzso zzso receptors like the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso is not a zzso of the insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds the activated zzso zzso loop of the insulin zzso Two zzso of zzso are implicated in the insulin zzso zzso the zzso domain and the zzso zzso interacting zzso The role of these two zzso in the interaction with the insulin zzso was already reported for zzso and zzso the other members of the zzso family of zzso However, the relative importance of these zzso varies, considering the zzso and the zzso zzso These differences should be a zzso of the specificity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and thus of the implication of zzso in signal zzso
