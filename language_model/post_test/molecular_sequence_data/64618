A new regulator gene named zzso which is located downstream of the zzso gene cluster in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was identified, zzso and characterized in this zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shares significant zzso with other bacterial regulators in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso disruption zzso gave rise to zzso enhancement of zzso zzso but did not exert significant influence on the zzso of zzso acid compared with the zzso zzso The negative regulation of zzso on zzso zzso was further confirmed by multiplied zzso gene dosage experiments and zzso zzso fusion zzso
