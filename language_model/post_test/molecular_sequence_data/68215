zzso reduction of the structurally related zzso zzso and zzso to their zzso forms, zzso and zzso respectively, generates species which interact and zzso DNA at distinct zzso zzso Within single target site duplex zzso zzso was found to zzso DNA at zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso was found to zzso predominantly at zzso within a zzso zzso In a zzso site duplex zzso which contains either the target sequence zzso or zzso zzso was found to zzso at both a zzso (a zzso zzso and a zzso (a zzso zzso site with approximately equal zzso zzso dynamics simulations were able to accurately reproduce the experimental results and provide a structural basis for the zzso zzso zzso were performed to determine the mobility of the zzso species following zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso consistent with the formation of both zzso and zzso zzso were observed when zzso was placed within a zzso zzso The zzso zzso orientation was more stable and zzso zzso For zzso at the same site the zzso was unable to form stable zzso or zzso zzso zzso primarily due to clashes with zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso with a zzso sequence adopted a very stable zzso consistent with formation of a zzso zzso
