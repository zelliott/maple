A zzso clone zzso a zzso small zzso binding protein was isolated from a zzso library of Chinese cabbage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flower buds and named zzso The zzso zzso contains an open reading frame zzso 198 zzso acid zzso with an estimated molecular mass of zzso Da and this coding region has zzso zzso and motifs unique to the zzso zzso of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein is closely related to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso but it shares relatively little zzso with other members of the Ras zzso (about zzso zzso To further characterize zzso a zzso expression zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso and zzso was used to purify the zzso Using a zzso plate, zzso activity of this protein was confirmed and competition binding studies, using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that the zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso strongly bind zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso enhanced by zzso in the presence of protein zzso C, but not in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso belongs to a zzso zzso zzso transcripts were expressed in all the zzso of zzso but were especially prevalent in flower zzso
