zzso zzso zzso are a large and diverse family of zzso which, in addition to their zzso functions, regulate cell signaling zzso zzso and zzso These zzso are zzso zzso zzso utilizing a unique zzso zzso zzso center for the reduction of zzso and are known to form two zzso zzso individual zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Here we characterize both the zzso properties and crystal structure of a bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and dynamic light scattering show that zzso zzso state is zzso linked, with zzso favoring the zzso zzso The zzso A resolution crystal structure (R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso reveals a zzso zzso zzso allowing us to identify a loop that adopts distinct zzso associated with zzso and zzso states, with zzso bond formation favoring the zzso This molecular switch contains the zzso zzso and acts to buttress the zzso interface in the reduced, zzso zzso A structurally detailed zzso cycle incorporating these ideas and linking activity to zzso state is zzso Finally, on the basis of sequence zzso we suggest that the zzso and signaling activities of all zzso zzso are regulated by a zzso zzso to zzso zzso
