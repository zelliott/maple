Unlike the human zzso gamma zzso and zzso gamma zzso families, which exhibit considerable diversity at both the zzso acid and protein levels, the human zzso gamma zzso family has only a single recognized product expressed as a zzso cell surface zzso with high affinity for zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso Using both zzso chain zzso amplification and Northern zzso we document multiple zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso transcripts in human zzso cells and zzso The sequences of two of these zzso gamma zzso related transcripts indicate that they are alternatively spliced products of a second zzso gamma zzso family zzso termed zzso gamma zzso The zzso derived from the larger of these zzso termed zzso gamma zzso encodes a surface zzso that is not recognized by zzso gamma zzso specific zzso zzso when zzso into zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso gamma zzso gene product, zzso gamma zzso does not bind zzso zzso with high zzso However, both zzso gamma zzso and zzso gamma zzso do bind zzso human zzso Previously zzso diversity within the zzso gamma zzso family includes an zzso putative low affinity zzso gamma zzso that may play an important role in the mechanism by which zzso gamma receptors participate in the zzso immune zzso
