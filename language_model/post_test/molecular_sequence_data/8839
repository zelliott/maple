In zzso rat liver zzso cells, zzso II zzso zzso and other zzso which activate zzso C stimulate zzso zzso activity in a zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso Since zzso II also produces a zzso response in these cells, we investigated downstream signaling elements traditionally linked to growth control by zzso zzso First, zzso II, like zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso binding activity in a zzso zzso Because increases in zzso can reflect induction of zzso and zzso we examined the activity of the zzso protein zzso zzso family members zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso which are known to influence zzso and zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso activity but only approximately 50% as effectively as zzso again, these effects were independent of zzso zzso II also produced a 50- to zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso Unlike its smaller effect on zzso zzso II was approximately zzso to zzso more potent in zzso zzso than zzso zzso Although others had reported a lack of calcium zzso zzso activity in zzso and several other cell lines, we examined the role of calcium in zzso zzso The following results suggest that zzso zzso in rat liver zzso cells is at least partially zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hormones that increase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso a compound that produces an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a dramatic increase in zzso activity (up to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso acid zzso inhibited zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso zzso partially inhibited zzso zzso by zzso II or zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso II was inhibited by zzso of cells with zzso and zzso a procedure which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso following zzso II stimulation did not involve zzso either zzso nor zzso in zzso sufficient to inhibit zzso zzso II, blocked zzso zzso by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso in zzso sufficient to inhibit zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso II and zzso zzso zzso In zzso in zzso rat liver zzso cells, zzso II stimulates zzso via a novel zzso zzso The zzso by zzso suggest that zzso zzso zzso may zzso the zzso zzso in a cell zzso manner, particularly in cells with a readily zzso zzso zzso zzso
