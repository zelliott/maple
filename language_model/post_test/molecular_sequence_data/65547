Plant zzso zzso transfer protein 2 zzso is a small (7 zzso protein that binds zzso zzso An inner zzso cavity surrounded by zzso is the defining structural feature of zzso Although zzso structures have been reported earlier, the detailed mechanisms of zzso binding and zzso transfer remain zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso to determine the role of various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the structure, stability, zzso zzso and zzso transfer activity of rice zzso Three single zzso zzso zzso and zzso drastically alter the native zzso structure and zzso zzso binding and zzso transfer zzso zzso these three zzso are structurally zzso The zzso zzso however, retains a zzso structure but has decreased zzso binding affinity and zzso transfer activity, zzso that this aromatic zzso is critical for these biological zzso The zzso zzso and zzso exhibit quite different zzso binding zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso binding but not linear zzso zzso As for zzso it had the highest zzso binding affinity in spite of the lower zzso binding and transfer zzso Our results suggest that the long zzso side chain of zzso would restrict the flexibility of loop I zzso for zzso zzso Finally, zzso can markedly increase the exposed zzso surface to maintain its transfer efficiency despite reduced zzso binding zzso These findings suggest that the zzso forming the zzso cavity play various important roles in the structure and function of rice zzso
