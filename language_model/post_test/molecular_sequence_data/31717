zzso zzso analysis of two beach samples collected form zzso zzso India indicated rich bacterial zzso While the zzso analysis of sample one yielded zzso zzso gene sequences which represent six zzso and 16 zzso sample two yielded very rich diversity representing 17 zzso and zzso zzso Six species of bacteria were isolated from the zzso zzso and most of them have zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso % with known zzso except for strain zzso having zzso % sequence similarity with zzso with valid zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene based zzso zzso analysis indicated that strain zzso is closely related with the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other members of the zzso zzso with zzso % sequence zzso zzso zzso was characterized based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could tolerate up to 5 % zzso resistant to zzso (10 zzso and was positive for zzso and zzso The major fatty acid is summed feature 8 zzso with minor amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso summed feature 2 zzso zzso summed feature 3 zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso unidentified lipids zzso zzso unidentified zzso zzso constitute the polar lipids of strain zzso The strain has zzso zzso zzso zzso and two unidentified zzso zzso 2) as major zzso zzso is the major zzso of strain zzso Based on zzso zzso analysis, strain zzso represents a species in the zzso zzso for which, the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
