A striking aspect of many zzso immune system is the exceptionally high level of zzso they zzso A convincing case can be made that this zzso is driven by the diversity of pathogens that face selective pressures to evade attack by the host immune zzso Different organisms accomplish a defense against diverse pathogens through mechanisms that differ widely in their requirements for specific zzso It has recently been shown that innate defense mechanisms, which use proteins with zzso zzso properties, are common to both primitive and advanced zzso In this study we characterize DNA sequence variation in six pathogen defense genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso including zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso The necessity for protection against diverse zzso which themselves may evolve resistance to insect defenses, motivates a zzso zzso Estimates of variation levels show that the genes are not exceptionally zzso but zzso and zzso have patterns of variation that differ significantly from zzso zzso of zzso and zzso differentiation also reveal differences among the genes in evolutionary zzso
