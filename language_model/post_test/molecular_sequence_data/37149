zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso which is of a variable structure in zzso is the central regulator of the zzso system through its stimulation of zzso release from the zzso A second form of zzso zzso zzso is ubiquitous and zzso in structure from fish to humans, suggesting that it has important functions and a discriminating zzso that selects against structural zzso zzso II is distributed in discrete regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems and in zzso zzso The zzso zzso for zzso II has recently been cloned from zzso and zzso It is highly selective for zzso II, has a similar distribution to zzso II in the nervous system and, notably, in areas associated with sexual zzso It is also found in zzso zzso An established function of zzso II is in the zzso of M currents zzso zzso through the zzso II zzso in the zzso sympathetic zzso and it might act through this mechanism as a zzso in the central nervous zzso The conservation of structure over 500 million years and the wide tissue distribution of zzso II suggest that it has a variety of zzso and zzso functions and will be a productive area of zzso
