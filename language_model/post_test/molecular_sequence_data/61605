We have recently identified in zzso brain a series of new zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but failed to find their counterparts in humans and zzso by either database searching or experimental zzso In this study, we isolated zzso zzso precursors of bovine zzso canine zzso and canine zzso from their zzso zzso zzso Although the deduced mature zzso acid sequences of bovine and canine zzso and canine zzso showed identity with their respective zzso zzso counterparts, none of them had a zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso bovine and canine zzso enhanced the zzso production, while canine zzso did not stimulate it at zzso zzso zzso had a high identity in its zzso acid sequence with zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells at a potency comparable to that of zzso zzso None of these zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso even in the presence of zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso a new class of biologically active zzso is present in animals zzso close to pigs and zzso its activity through the zzso zzso suggesting a wide existence and common properties of this zzso in zzso
