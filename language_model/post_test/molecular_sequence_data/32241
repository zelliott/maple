zzso receptors are zzso zzso channels that open in response to binding of zzso zzso Each zzso contains a large zzso zzso binding domain and two zzso zzso zzso zzso that form the zzso but the extent of gating motions of the TM zzso is zzso We zzso these motions using zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso the open state of zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso partitions into zzso zzso and that transfer of the TM regions of zzso receptors is sufficient to convey sensitivity to the zzso suggesting that zzso interacts most favorably with the open zzso of the two TM zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso identifies zzso that change environment between closed and open states, and zzso at a subset of these positions weaken zzso zzso The emerging patterns point to widespread zzso of the TM zzso during opening of zzso zzso zzso
