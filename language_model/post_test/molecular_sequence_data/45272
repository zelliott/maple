The mechanism of zzso gene zzso zzso exists in all zzso zzso but the organization and structure of zzso zzso zzso as they differ in fish and among fish species, reveal their capability for rapid zzso In systems where there can exist 100 zzso zzso zzso restructuring and sequence changes of the constant regions led to divergence of zzso zzso zzso among these zzso created hybrid zzso the zzso of which zzso variable zzso regions that function as part of zzso molecules and, as the result of an ancient zzso are also grafted onto the zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso structure, created by zzso zzso acting on zzso zzso signal zzso led variously to the generation of fixed zzso zzso zzso templates for gene conversion, and ultimately to zzso sequences that evolved away from zzso zzso The presence of so many zzso zzso in zzso raises interesting questions not only as to how their regulation is achieved but also how successive zzso zzso are zzso by a system whose function in other zzso is based on zzso zzso zzso zzso
