Human heat shock protein of apparent molecular mass 20 zzso zzso and its zzso zzso mimicking zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso were cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The proteins were obtained in a homogeneous state without zzso of zzso or zzso On size exclusion zzso at neutral zzso zzso and its zzso zzso were zzso as symmetrical zzso with an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso Chemical zzso resulted in the formation of zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 42 zzso At pH zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and were zzso in the form of two zzso with apparent molecular mass values of zzso and zzso zzso At pH zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso by its ability to prevent the zzso zzso of insulin or zzso zzso of zzso alcohol zzso was similar to or higher than that of commercial zzso Under these conditions, the zzso zzso of zzso possessed lower zzso activity than the zzso zzso At pH zzso both zzso and zzso zzso with zzso alcohol zzso however, zzso zzso whereas zzso either did not affect or zzso the zzso zzso of alcohol zzso The mixing of zzso human zzso and zzso resulted in a slow, zzso formation of zzso complexes, with apparent molecular mass values of 100 and 300 zzso which contained approximately equal amounts of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso activated protein zzso protein zzso 2 was zzso by replacing zzso 78 and 82 with zzso A zzso zzso of zzso mixed with zzso rapidly formed a zzso complex with an apparent molecular mass of 100 zzso containing approximately equal quantities of two small heat shock zzso
