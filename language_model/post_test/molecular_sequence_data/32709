zzso M and N zzso and zzso zzso are among the few proteins that are zzso across the zzso zzso The function of the complex is largely zzso Whereas deletion from most zzso has marginal effects on the replication of the respective zzso both proteins are essential for replication of human zzso zzso We have constructed a series of zzso in zzso to study the function of this zzso zzso of zzso is a type I zzso containing a short zzso domain of 14 zzso zzso including two zzso zzso directly adjacent to the predicted zzso anchor at positions 125 and zzso zzso of the entire zzso domain as well as substitution with the corresponding region from alpha zzso or zzso of both zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso viruses containing point zzso of either zzso zzso could be zzso These viruses were profoundly defective for zzso Complex formation of the zzso zzso with zzso and transport of the complex to the viral assembly compartment appeared zzso compared to the wild zzso However, in infected cells, large numbers of zzso accumulated in the zzso that failed to acquire an zzso zzso expressed zzso was shown to be modified by zzso acid at both zzso zzso In zzso our data suggest that the zzso domain of zzso plays a critical role in secondary zzso of zzso and that zzso of zzso appears to be essential for function in secondary zzso of zzso and virus zzso
