zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor to target zzso was initially proposed to occur through interaction with release factors at terminating zzso However, recently emerging evidence points toward zzso interaction with the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso We mapped zzso zzso sites by zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human cells and found that zzso zzso associated with 3' zzso in zzso active cells but underwent significant zzso toward coding regions zzso upon translation zzso thus indicating that zzso binds zzso before translation and gets displaced from the zzso by translating zzso zzso by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso to long zzso zzso our evidence for zzso zzso interaction suggests that the triggering of zzso occurs after zzso binding to zzso presumably through zzso of zzso zzso by zzso translation zzso
