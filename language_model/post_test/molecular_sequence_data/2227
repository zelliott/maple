The structure of the insulin zzso was studied with zzso zzso obtained from rabbits which were zzso with synthetic peptides having a sequence identity to three regions of the zzso and five regions of the zzso None of the zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Bell, zzso zzso zzso Herrera, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gray, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mason, zzso zzso zzso Grunfeld, zzso Rosen, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso (12 zzso acid zzso extension zzso zzso Ellis, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Roth, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 9) zzso the human insulin zzso zzso from zzso zzso however, zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso prepared against the N zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso binding site zzso zzso zzso did not react with the intact zzso under any zzso however, zzso to the C zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and to the zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in both its zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso with the regulatory region of the zzso which contains the major zzso sites zzso zzso zzso only zzso the zzso zzso Thus the zzso of the zzso domain of the zzso is rigid and stabilized by zzso bonds, whereas several regions of the zzso domain are accessible to zzso and undergo zzso changes during zzso
