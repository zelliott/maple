zzso in gene expression in prostate cells are believed to be secondary to zzso zzso We theorized that bone zzso may provide a fertile zzso for prostate cancer by inducing zzso genes and allowing for zzso zzso 

Human prostate cancer cells zzso were grown under different conditions and analyzed for differential expression of zzso zzso cells were grown in the presence of 10 zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso derived from bone cells (without zzso zzso and on plastic culture dishes without zzso zzso A differential display of zzso produced by zzso cells grown in the above conditions was then zzso 

Multiple unique transcripts were present in cells that were grown in the presence of zzso and on bone zzso (without zzso zzso but not on plastic culture dishes without zzso zzso Nine of these transcripts were then cloned and zzso Many zzso of these transcripts were found to contain multiple zzso motifs in their corresponding zzso zzso zzso motifs have been shown to be zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins and their target genes are thought to regulate cellular zzso zzso with this, we demonstrated by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso that zzso genes were zzso expressed in zzso cells when the cells were grown in the presence of zzso and on bone zzso (without zzso zzso but not on plastic culture dishes without zzso zzso Furthermore, we zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso 8) that were grown in male nude zzso Some of these tumors continued to grow in these mice despite treatment with surgical zzso In blinded studies, we were able to determine which tumor samples were zzso independent by their expression of zzso zzso All samples that were zzso independent zzso zzso 4) expressed the zzso zzso Finally, gel zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso proteins were able to bind to our cloned DNA zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis showed that the zzso proteins bound to the zzso motif in the zzso of our target zzso 

Bone zzso in the absence of zzso has the ability to regulate zzso zzso Furthermore, many of these genes contain zzso binding sites and the expression of zzso genes may itself be regulated by bone zzso If so, this may partially explain the clinical observation that bone provides a fertile zzso for prostate cancer growth and zzso
