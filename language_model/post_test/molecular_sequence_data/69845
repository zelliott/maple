The chicken zzso locus gives rise to two distinct zzso factors differing by structurally and functionally unrelated zzso zzso shows a striking zzso conservation from zzso to humans, while zzso the cellular counterpart of the zzso zzso zzso is apparently restricted to avian and zzso zzso In the chick zzso both zzso are expressed in a wide array of zzso of zzso zzso however, in the zzso and after zzso zzso is excluded from zzso cells where zzso zzso In this report, we define the basis of the differential expression of the chicken zzso products to assess their different zzso as zzso zzso We demonstrate that the two distinct zzso arise from alternative promoter usage within the chicken zzso zzso zzso of both promoters reveals that zzso zzso from multiple sites, consistent with the absence of zzso and zzso zzso Of these two regulatory regions, only the one that zzso the zzso zzso synthesis is of the G + zzso type, and its organization is zzso in zzso The zzso zzso promoter activity was enhanced by its own zzso In addition, we identify numerous potential binding sites for zzso zzso factors that might contribute to a tight zzso effect in zzso zzso
