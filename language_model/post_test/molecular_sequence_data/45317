zzso zzso zzso 1) from zzso zzso was characterized as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso from bovine heart and zzso By designing zzso synthetic peptides containing potential zzso sequence targets zzso zzso and zzso we determined that the zzso zzso was a zzso for zzso in zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso higher than zzso for bovine heart and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein was decreased by as much as zzso when compared with zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso values for zzso and zzso zzso were the same, indicating that both proteins are zzso at the same site by zzso zzso PAGE of zzso and zzso zzso indicates that in zzso the zzso zzso prevented the formation of one of the zzso zzso We conclude that in zzso the major zzso zzso site of zzso is zzso zzso of zzso leads to a zzso zzso that is more active in the absence of zzso zzso zzso The specificity of zzso and zzso zzso towards the zzso zzso and towards whole zzso protein was measured and zzso The zzso for the zzso zzso is higher than that for zzso indicating that the zzso zzso on zzso is a much better zzso than zzso regardless of which tissue was used as the source of zzso However, the zzso of zzso protein is lower than that of the better zzso the zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso binding is not the major zzso of zzso specificity for zzso
