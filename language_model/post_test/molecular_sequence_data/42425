zzso synaptic zzso contain a mixture of soluble low molecular mass zzso Besides zzso these include zzso zzso zzso small amounts of zzso and zzso and also the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In synaptic zzso isolated from the electric ray these zzso zzso occur in zzso zzso and might represent a novel zzso The membrane proteins of zzso synaptic zzso presumably are identical to those in other types of zzso synaptic zzso A zzso exception are the zzso zzso The life cycle of the synaptic zzso in intact zzso and in zzso was investigated by analysis of all zzso membrane compartments that share membrane integral proteins with synaptic zzso The results suggest that the synaptic zzso membrane compartment might originate from the zzso network and, after cycles of zzso and zzso in the nerve zzso might fuse into an zzso membrane compartment early on retrograde zzso zzso experiments using membrane proteins and soluble contents suggest that the synaptic zzso membrane compartment does not zzso with the zzso plasma membrane on repeated cycles of zzso and zzso if low frequency stimulation is zzso A zzso has been isolated from the electric ray electric lobe that codes for zzso a small zzso protein highly zzso to zzso zzso While abundant in the nerve terminals of the electric organ and at the zzso junction this protein occurs only in limited zzso of nerve terminals in electric ray zzso zzso analysis using the zzso gold technique and a zzso zzso against zzso suggests that the zzso protein remains attached to recycling synaptic zzso No evidence was found for a major contribution of an zzso zzso sorting compartment involved in synaptic zzso zzso
