The large form of the zzso delta virus zzso protein zzso can be zzso near its C zzso and this modification is considered essential for particle zzso Using gel zzso we separated L into two species of similar zzso The slower species could be labeled by the incorporation of zzso and is interpreted to be zzso L zzso In serum zzso infected liver, zzso cells, and assembled zzso 25 to zzso of L was zzso zzso was also demonstrated by zzso incorporation in zzso with a rabbit zzso coupled zzso zzso However, the species obtained migrated even slower than that detected by labeling in zzso Next, in studies of zzso particle assembly in the presence of the surface proteins of human zzso B virus, we observed the zzso zzso Relative to zzso zzso was zzso assembled into zzso zzso zzso zzso could zzso the unmodified L and the small delta zzso zzso zzso In contrast, a form of L with a deletion in the zzso domain was both zzso and zzso but it could not support the zzso of zzso Finally, to test the expectation that the zzso of L would increase its zzso we applied a phase separation strategy based on zzso formation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso We showed the zzso zzso The unique zzso 19 zzso acids present on L relative to S caused a significant increase in the zzso zzso This increase was independent of zzso zzso In contrast, other, artificial modifications at either the N or C zzso of S did not increase the zzso zzso The increased zzso was not sufficient for particle zzso zzso we speculate that it might facilitate zzso zzso
