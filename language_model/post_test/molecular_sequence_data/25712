Type II zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso plasmids are different both in sequence and in structure from known zzso zzso These zzso zzso are responsible for zzso zzso resistance to the host zzso A zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Bennett, zzso zzso zzso Gene 41, zzso With this cloned and zzso zzso a rapid zzso procedure has been developed that yields zzso quantities of apparently homogeneous zzso zzso with a specific activity zzso greater than that previously reported for the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso & Smith, zzso zzso (1976) zzso zzso zzso 61, zzso The pH versus activity profile and the native molecular weight of zzso zzso were found to be similar to those previously reported for other type II zzso but different from those of the known zzso zzso zzso labeled zzso was zzso and used to determine the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to specifically transfer the zzso hydrogen of zzso to zzso making it a member of the zzso class of zzso Thus, although zzso zzso is different both in sequence and in structure from known zzso zzso both zzso catalyze identical zzso zzso Two distinct zzso zzso zzso complexes were detected by monitoring the zzso zzso chemical shifts and line zzso of the zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
