zzso zzso is increasingly recognized as an important mechanism of gene zzso Here, we show that zzso controls gene expression in an zzso zzso zzso zzso the recruitment of termination factors zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to initiate zzso pausing and premature termination at the zzso promoter through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso further processes the zzso product, which generates a small zzso that is required to mediate potent zzso repression and zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso coupled to zzso sequencing zzso we identified cellular gene targets whose zzso is modulated by zzso Our study reveals zzso pausing and premature termination zzso by the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulatory mechanism of zzso zzso zzso
