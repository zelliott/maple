Single zzso zzso zzso have emerged as a major class of DNA markers with the advantage of permitting the development of zzso genetic maps adequate for quantitative trait zzso zzso identification by zzso zzso Here we describe results of a relatively zzso survey of chicken broiler and layer populations for zzso in targeted zzso regions of chicken expressed sequence tag zzso zzso The sequences zzso representing the composite sequence of 12 amplified fragments for a total of zzso zzso were randomly distributed, occurring on six different zzso or linkage groups in the chicken zzso Although one of the zzso DNA sequences did not match the reference zzso zzso another contained an zzso that separated two putative zzso The number of zzso observed within each of the 12 zzso zzso regions ranged from 0 to 10 for a total of 44 and a frequency of zzso About zzso of the zzso were shared between layer and broiler zzso The average zzso within the populations ranged from zzso to zzso with the layer populations showing the higher zzso zzso and zzso described will provide a resource for genetic analysis in commercial chicken zzso The data appear to indicate that the relative frequency of zzso in the targeted regions scanned is higher than the frequency reported for any of the other regions scanned to date in other zzso zzso Additionally, the results suggest that the use of DNA pools may offer an efficient approach to zzso detection in zzso as has been shown in other zzso
