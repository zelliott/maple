zzso zzso are few and far between, and as such, the appearance of resistance toward such treatments is an obvious medical zzso In this article, we analyze the mechanism by which influenza attains resistance toward zzso a blocker of the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso to zzso peptides from different viral strains showed that the virus has developed two alternate routes to avoid zzso of its zzso zzso a conventional route, in which the channel no longer binds the blocker and, zzso the blocker cannot exert its zzso zzso and zzso a novel zzso in which binding of the blocker is zzso yet the function of the protein is zzso zzso diameter profiles revealed the molecular mechanism by which the virus may attain this novel type of zzso an increase in the size of the zzso Thus, despite the drug binding the channel, it may not be able to block the zzso since the channel diameter has zzso Our findings may have broad ramifications in the design of new zzso and of novel zzso against malfunctioning human channels implicated in zzso
