The detailed distribution and characterization of 51 zzso zzso and 59 nitrous acid zzso zzso in the zzso zzso T4 zzso zzso zzso gene is reported zzso zzso were mapped in 10 regions of the zzso gene by zzso marker rescue using zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso crosses using deletion zzso with known zzso in the 3' end of the zzso zzso subdivided zzso and zzso zzso which mapped in this zzso At least 31 of the zzso map within the zzso group I zzso zzso zzso zzso mapped only in the zzso and 3' ends of the zzso zzso in accordance with the hypothesis that the zzso and 3' zzso of the T4 zzso zzso are essential for correct zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of a number of mapped zzso zzso has identified two zzso zzso and one zzso zzso where both zzso and zzso zzso commonly zzso These three zzso are characterized by a zzso zzso with the zzso occurring at the zzso zzso Thus, these data indicate at least three potential sites of both zzso and zzso zzso hotspot activity within the zzso zzso
