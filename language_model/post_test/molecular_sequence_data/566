zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso zzso of banana zzso zzso is one of the most destructive strains of the vascular zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso among and within zzso zzso groups zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied by sequencing two nuclear and two zzso DNA regions in a collection of 70 zzso zzso zzso that include representatives of 20 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso other zzso zzso and zzso To determine the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to sexually zzso crosses were made between zzso of opposite mating zzso zzso analysis separated the zzso zzso zzso into two zzso and eight zzso zzso relationships between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the relationships among zzso and races of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clearly showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ability to cause disease on banana has emerged multiple times, zzso and that the ability to cause disease to a specific banana zzso is also a zzso zzso These analyses further suggest that both zzso with the host and horizontal gene transfer may have played important roles in the evolutionary history of the zzso All examined zzso zzso one of the two zzso zzso but never both, which suggests a zzso mating system should sexual reproduction zzso zzso no sexual structures were observed, some lineages of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a potential that these lineages have a sexual origin that might be more recent than initially zzso
