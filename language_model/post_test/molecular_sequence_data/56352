Since the discovery of zzso peptides with exceptional zzso potency that were originally suggested to act by causing the opening of zzso channels, it has emerged that these agents are important in zzso communication in many zzso They exert their effects through G zzso zzso of which two classes have been zzso Robert Miller, John zzso and John zzso review the progress made towards a molecular understanding of zzso recognition by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have emerged from attempts to understand the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso from zzso studies and from zzso zzso From the nature of the zzso and action of zzso it would seem that these peptides are involved in long-term changes rather than in acute responses to zzso and that they are likely to be important in a number of pathological zzso Evidence suggests that zzso zzso with appropriate affinity and selectivity may be useful in the treatment of conditions as diverse as hypertension, zzso and zzso zzso
