The accuracy of DNA synthesis zzso by the zzso zzso DNA zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli DNA zzso I varies as a function of reaction pH zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we demonstrate that the zzso of human DNA zzso alpha increases zzso when the pH of the in zzso synthesis reaction is lowered from pH zzso to pH zzso zzso degrees zzso as determined using a base substitution zzso zzso to score zzso errors within the zzso alpha gene of zzso zzso Similarly, the base substitution zzso of zzso DNA synthesis by the human zzso virus type 1 reverse zzso zzso zzso was improved zzso at pH zzso relative to pH zzso zzso degrees zzso A detailed comparison of zzso zzso error specificity at neutral and low pH in a zzso alpha forward zzso zzso revealed that low pH suppresses both zzso and zzso zzso however, the characteristic zzso zzso pattern of zzso hotspots at zzso sequences is retained at the lower zzso zzso with the presumption that these zzso result, in part, from increased termination of DNA synthesis within the hotspot sequences relative to other zzso zzso the zzso zzso termination pattern during zzso DNA synthesis is not altered by low zzso The zzso zzso results are in agreement with our previous hypothesis that the observed increase in zzso zzso at low pH results from a decreased efficiency of continuing DNA synthesis from zzso DNA zzso
