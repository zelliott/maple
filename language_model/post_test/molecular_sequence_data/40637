Under zzso conditions, zzso sequences of DNA and zzso can adopt stable and zzso zzso zzso structures called zzso zzso Such zzso structures have been shown to occur in zzso and to play a role in various processes such as transcription, translation and zzso zzso zzso to their zzso stability, resolution of zzso structures in zzso requires specialized zzso zzso is a human zzso zzso of the zzso family that exhibits a unique zzso zzso activity with a high affinity and specificity for its zzso in zzso How zzso recognizes zzso has not yet been zzso Here, we show that the zzso region of zzso is essential for zzso to bind zzso structures and further identify within this region the evolutionary zzso zzso zzso zzso domain as a major affinity and specificity zzso zzso activity and strict zzso dependency are also observed with zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso terminal region of which the zzso is the only zzso zzso Thus, these results reveal a novel motif in zzso protein that plays an important role in recognizing and resolving zzso structures, properties unique to zzso among many known zzso zzso
