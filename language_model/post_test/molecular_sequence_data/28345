The products of the nuclear zzso zzso and zzso are known to form zzso that bind to DNA and zzso zzso Both proteins contain a zzso zzso that is important for zzso zzso zzso corresponding to these zzso zzso were zzso When mixed, these peptides zzso form zzso over zzso by at least zzso Both zzso and the zzso are parallel alpha zzso The zzso zzso regions from zzso and zzso therefore zzso to autonomous zzso zzso sites that are likely to be short coiled zzso and these regions are sufficient to determine the specificity of interaction between zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso forms a relatively unstable zzso zzso of zzso provides a zzso driving force for preferential zzso zzso
