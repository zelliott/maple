The initial step of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells is zzso by an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Previously, an alternatively spliced zzso zzso of zzso was identified although the functional significance of the zzso protein was zzso We sought to characterize the contribution of this zzso zzso to overall zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of three novel zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to the previously described zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso using zzso protection experiments revealed that the zzso without zzso zzso sequence represents approximately zzso of total zzso zzso while the newly identified transcripts together represent approximately zzso Despite the significant amounts of these three new zzso their features indicate that they are unlikely to substantially contribute to overall zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso studies show that the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produces a functional zzso albeit with slightly reduced activity and with affinity for the zzso beta zzso of zzso zzso zzso comparable to that of mature zzso It was also established that the first 49 zzso acids of the zzso zzso are necessary and sufficient for zzso across the zzso inner membrane and that this process is not affected by the absence of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the major zzso zzso of zzso is functional in zzso and could significantly contribute to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
