Three direct repeats of zzso 340 and zzso zzso were detected upstream to the zzso end of the zzso zzso gene of an zzso unit present on a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the rice zzso The primer extension analysis showed that the site of initiation of zzso is in the 1st repeat at an A, the zzso zzso upstream to the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso Different stretches of the zzso zzso DNA linked to the zzso zzso zzso gene were transcribed in the intact zzso of rice zzso The zzso zzso protection analysis of the transcripts using zzso zzso zzso zzso gene as the probe showed the presence of multiple promoters for zzso zzso
