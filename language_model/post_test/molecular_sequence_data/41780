zzso zzso with a new zzso have been obtained from lobster tail muscle zzso from which 11 zzso at the zzso have been zzso removed to avoid zzso zzso In contrast to the conventional Bailey crystal form in which the zzso zzso molecules form a mesh, in the present zzso the molecules are packed zzso with the long axes parallel to the zzso of the zzso The unit cell is zzso with a zzso b zzso 109 A, c zzso zzso A, and the symmetry is either zzso or zzso with zzso zzso axes parallel to the zzso This suggests that a group of molecules surrounding a local zzso axis is regarded as the building unit of the zzso It is likely that the unit cell contains eight molecules with one zzso per zzso zzso
