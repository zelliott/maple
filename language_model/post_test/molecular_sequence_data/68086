zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein which zzso in the formation of zzso zzso We cloned canine zzso alpha and beta zzso zzso from canine gastric zzso libraries and the alpha zzso gene from a canine zzso zzso The alpha zzso gene is 13 zzso in length and contains 21 zzso ranging from 77 to zzso zzso Its zzso region contains putative regulatory motifs for zzso that are similar to those found in zzso genes from other zzso The open reading frames of alpha and beta zzso zzso are 3,500 and zzso zzso in length and zzso proteins of zzso and 290 zzso zzso zzso They are zzso zzso to corresponding zzso previously identified in zzso and zzso gastric zzso
