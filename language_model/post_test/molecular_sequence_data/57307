The sequence of gene 26 consisting of 624 zzso codes for two peptides zzso the smaller zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso of the same open reading zzso zzso of gene 26 from zzso containing various fragments from the terminal part of this zzso allowed us to determine the gene 26 internal segment responsible for the initiation of zzso zzso By zzso zzso the zzso sequence of this DNA segment has been changed, and in further expression experiments of the zzso gene 26 it was determined that an unusual zzso zzso zzso 114 of gene 26, is used to initiate the synthesis of the smaller zzso Thus gene 26 encodes two peptides of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The regulation of the expression of gene 26 in zzso cells is zzso
