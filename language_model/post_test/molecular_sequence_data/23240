The cloning and expression of the zzso DNA zzso and modification system zzso by zzso virus zzso is zzso The system consists of a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso separated by 12 zzso zzso possesses eight zzso zzso acid motifs (I to zzso typical of zzso zzso but, like another zzso virus zzso zzso lacks zzso motifs IX and zzso In addition to modification of the first zzso in zzso zzso zzso A, G or zzso zzso zzso zzso both the first two zzso in zzso and zzso sites as zzso zzso has significant zzso acid sequence similarity to Type II restriction zzso zzso that recognizes an overlapping sequence zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli with or without a zzso in a host zzso by zzso zzso zzso recognizes the DNA sequence zzso and zzso the zzso bond zzso of the first zzso while the other strand of DNA at this site is not zzso zzso displays site preferences with zzso (R zzso A or zzso sites preferred over zzso zzso zzso is active from 16 to 65 degrees C with a temperature optimum of zzso degrees zzso zzso can be used to generate zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was used in combination with zzso DNA zzso I large zzso to rapidly amplify anonymous DNA from zzso DNA or from a single bacterial zzso
