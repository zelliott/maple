Although the important role of protein zzso in insulin signaling networks is well zzso its analysis in zzso has not been pursued in a systematic fashion through zzso zzso Here we undertake a global analysis of zzso changes in the rat liver zzso and zzso zzso by sequential enrichment of zzso and zzso After zzso zzso proteins were zzso and loaded onto zzso zzso zzso with immobilized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with 50 zzso zzso and zzso zzso The digest was then loaded onto an zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with 50 zzso zzso and resolved by zzso liquid zzso which combined zzso weak zzso exchange and online reverse phase zzso The peptides were identified by tandem mass zzso which also detected the zzso zzso zzso peptides found in the zzso of the zzso columns were also analyzed providing complementary information for protein zzso In this study we enriched zzso to zzso purity and identified zzso zzso from zzso liver zzso zzso zzso including 45 novel ones in 83 proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and structure, gene expression and various signaling pathways were changed in response to insulin zzso Together these findings could provide potential new markers for evaluating insulin action and resistance in obesity and zzso
