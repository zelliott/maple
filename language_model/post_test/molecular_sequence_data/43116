zzso mouse zzso cell cultures were infected with mouse zzso virus strain zzso zzso and maintained over an 18 week zzso zzso isolated from these cultures zzso weeks zzso produce small plaques on zzso and cause only minimal levels of zzso fusion at times when wild type causes nearly complete cell zzso However, when zzso cultures were examined zzso hours zzso approximately zzso of the cells were in zzso showing that the fusion zzso is not absolute but rather zzso zzso of zzso to zzso cultures enhanced cell fusion a small zzso to zzso but significant zzso zzso of portions of the spike genes of six zzso zzso revealed that all contained the same single zzso zzso resulting in a substitution of zzso acid for zzso in the spike zzso zzso zzso zzso contained only the 180 zzso form of spike protein suggesting that this zzso prevented the normal zzso zzso of the 180 zzso protein into the 90 zzso zzso zzso of zzso of the zzso supports this zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso acid with either the wild type zzso or a zzso zzso acid was associated with the restoration of spike protein zzso and cell zzso
