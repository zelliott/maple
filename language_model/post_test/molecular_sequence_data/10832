A zzso analysis of human zzso leukemia virus type 2 zzso Tax zzso was performed to identify regions within zzso important for zzso of promoters through the zzso or zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso within the putative zzso region as well as zzso at the zzso zzso disrupted zzso zzso A single zzso within the central zzso region of zzso disrupted the zzso of the zzso zzso Surprisingly, this zzso which is thought to be in a separate zzso domain, was suppressed by zzso within or around the putative zzso region, suggesting an interaction between these two zzso These analyses indicate that the functional regions or zzso important for zzso through the zzso or zzso signaling zzso are similar, but not zzso in zzso and zzso Identification of these distinct zzso zzso should facilitate comparative biological studies of zzso and zzso and ultimately lead to the determination of the functional importance of Tax zzso capacities in zzso transformation by zzso
