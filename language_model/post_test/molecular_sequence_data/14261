During the late M to the zzso phase of the cell cycle, the origin recognition complex zzso binds to the replication origin, leading to the assembly of the zzso complex for subsequent initiation of zzso zzso zzso We found that the cell zzso zzso of human zzso one of the six zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and -5 zzso zzso from zzso and replication zzso zzso at zzso and zzso of zzso occurs by zzso zzso during the S phase and is maintained until the M zzso zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso zzso the zzso from zzso zzso with this, the zzso zzso protein exhibited defective binding to replication origins as well as to zzso whereas the zzso protein persisted in binding throughout the cell zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso and replication origins and zzso binding of zzso to newly zzso zzso
