zzso suppression zzso zzso was carried out between an avian zzso zzso coli zzso and an zzso coli isolate from apparently healthy poultry zzso zzso zzso coli or zzso to understand the zzso differences between zzso and zzso and to identify potential zzso zzso In an effort to ensure that the genes identified were novel, tester and driver strains were chosen by their similarities in certain known zzso zzso In total, 24 zzso zzso fragments specific for zzso were zzso Eight of the fragments were zzso or zzso zzso 13 matched to zzso regions and three did not show zzso to any known zzso We further determined the association of zzso fragments with zzso by screening a collection of zzso zzso and human zzso zzso coli zzso using the zzso zzso located fragments that matched to the zzso zzso element zzso the zzso invasion zzso zzso the zzso invasion zzso genes zzso P zzso and a gene zzso zzso zzso were present at significantly higher zzso in zzso and zzso than in zzso suggesting their contribution to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso No genes were found to be specific to zzso zzso
