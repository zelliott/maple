zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso is characteristic of genetically extensive zzso In this study, five SPF pigs were zzso with two strains of zzso zzso and zzso and 352 viruses were cloned by plaque zzso from the zzso of the infected pigs on days 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21 zzso zzso and the zzso events between the two viruses were systematically investigated by sequencing the zzso zzso and zzso genes of each cloned virus and using zzso and zzso Algorithm for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 133 zzso viruses out of the plaque viruses were acquired from four of five infected pigs during days zzso upon zzso with zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso exchange of the zzso zzso and zzso genes between the two viruses exhibited different patterns, and the zzso for zzso gene and zzso occurred as early as on day zzso The zzso between the zzso zzso or zzso gene resulted in the generation of zzso zzso zzso or zzso Of the three zzso zzso gene exhibited more complicated zzso zzso Meanwhile, the putative zzso zzso and hotspots for the three genes were zzso Our findings not only provide valuable zzso for understanding that zzso is an important genetic mechanism contributing to the variation and evolution of zzso but also suggest that extensive use of attenuated vaccine of zzso undoubtedly contributes to the increased diversity of zzso in zzso
