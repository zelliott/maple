The bacterial zzso channel of large zzso zzso directly senses and responds to membrane zzso It serves as an zzso release zzso upon acute decreases in the zzso environment, thus preventing cell zzso It is one of the best studied zzso channels and serves as a paradigm of how a channel senses and responds to its membrane zzso The zzso protein is highly zzso found throughout the bacterial kingdom, and has been shown to zzso a functional zzso channel in all species where it has been zzso However, channels from different species have shown some functional zzso an extreme example is the zzso tuberculosis zzso which when zzso expressed in zzso coli requires significantly more membrane tension for gating than the zzso zzso coli zzso We previously speculated that the membrane environment or factors not found in zzso coli promoted the proper gating of the zzso tuberculosis zzso channel in its native zzso Here, by zzso the zzso tuberculosis and zzso coli zzso channels in various zzso we demonstrate that inclusion of zzso a zzso found in zzso tuberculosis but not zzso coli, is sufficient for gating of the zzso tuberculosis zzso channel within a zzso range of membrane zzso
