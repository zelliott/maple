There has been interest in the literature in the possible existence of a gene that zzso to both breast cancer zzso and zzso cancer zzso We describe the detailed zzso of one zzso zzso with 10 cases of BC or zzso invasive cancer among 26 zzso second- or zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that a zzso was present in zzso DNA sequencing from zzso 22 zzso with zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso Her sister zzso 25) had BC and zzso cancer and carries the same zzso Following zzso and zzso instability studies, zzso analysis by protein zzso test, zzso sequencing and quantitative real-time zzso revealed a deletion of zzso zzso 8 in zzso 25, confirming her as a double zzso for zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso The zzso 8 deletion was identified as a zzso zzso deletion occurring between two zzso zzso The zzso lies within a sequence of 45 zzso that is identical in both zzso zzso In this large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in both zzso and zzso There appeared to be no increased zzso to the development of zzso zzso in zzso zzso carriers or to the development of breast zzso in zzso zzso zzso Additionally, two double zzso did not appear to have a different zzso than would be expected from the presence of a zzso in each gene zzso
