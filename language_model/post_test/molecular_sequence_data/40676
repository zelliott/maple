In this study, different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D7 were zzso varying in zzso type, position of zzso tags and zzso zzso From these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed and their biological activities against prostate cancer cells were zzso 

zzso of the zzso to zzso prostate cancer cells was determined by flow zzso zzso activity was zzso and zzso was measured with zzso zzso 

Different zzso types did not influence the characteristics of the zzso or zzso The addition of an zzso zzso however, resulted in decreased zzso binding and zzso zzso in zzso orientation showed the highest expression and zzso whereas zzso in zzso orientation exhibited the best binding and zzso 

The present study showed how structure influences the characteristics of zzso and zzso It is therefore suggested that for each individual construct the optimal structure has to be determined zzso
