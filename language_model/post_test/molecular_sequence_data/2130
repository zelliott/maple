DNA fragments containing the regulatory regions of two genes zzso by the zzso gene product exhibit retarded zzso mobility in zzso gels indicating the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso In the zzso gene this bend has been localized to a region containing two zzso zzso zzso A point zzso between these two sites reduced the degree of zzso observed but did not reduce the level of repression, indicating the zzso bend may not be an important component of the repression zzso
