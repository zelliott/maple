A zzso zzso zzso gene zzso which encodes zzso in the zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso to form the zzso zzso zzso was zzso The cud locus comprises four zzso three of which zzso proteins with significant similarities to those known to be involved in zzso transport and conversion in other zzso The zzso role of the gene products was confirmed by analysis of cud deletion zzso The fourth gene possibly codes for a regulator zzso Part of the gene cluster was shown to be zzso regulated by zzso and elevated zzso zzso as zzso
