The major components of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso were zzso and zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso are composed of five major proteins zzso masses 44, 37, 35, 34 and 32 zzso and present their location, zzso zzso acid sequence and zzso zzso The 44 zzso and the 35 zzso protein are on the sheath of the zzso zzso whereas the 37, 34 and 32 zzso protein reside in the zzso zzso zzso The two sheath zzso proteins are zzso related but have different zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso of the 44 zzso protein shows zzso with the sheath zzso of other zzso but the 35 zzso protein does zzso The three core proteins are zzso zzso and their zzso zzso acid sequences are almost, but not completely, zzso indicating that the core proteins are zzso by three distinct zzso The core proteins show extensive zzso sequence similarities and an zzso relationship with zzso zzso core proteins of other zzso
