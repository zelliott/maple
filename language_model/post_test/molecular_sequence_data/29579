A zzso of the a zzso of the retinal rod zzso zzso channel, zzso zzso corresponding to a truncated zzso zzso was previously described in patients with zzso zzso when expressed in zzso cells, this zzso a zzso was retained inside the cell, but had normal channel activity in one case where it reached the plasma zzso indicating that the mechanism of targeting is altered by the zzso but not the function of the zzso The corresponding zzso of the bovine rod channel zzso zzso and of the closely related zzso zzso channel zzso alpha zzso were expressed in zzso zzso and their activity was analyzed by zzso Like their human zzso these two channels have no activity, and we show that their zzso fusion proteins are accumulated into zzso zzso The zzso alone or the zzso zzso alone do not prevent or modify channel activity, indicating that neither the zzso zzso nor the zzso domain downstream of zzso is necessary for zzso channel targeting and zzso Several zzso of zzso and of the preceding zzso in the zzso zzso disclose that the motif responsible for the absence of channel activity is an zzso zzso retention signal zzso in which the nature of the zzso in positions zzso and zzso is zzso
