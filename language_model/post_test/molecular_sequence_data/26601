The zzso Clay in Belgium is investigated in the context of geological nuclear waste zzso making use of the High zzso zzso Experimental Site zzso underground research zzso This facility, located in the zzso Clay at a depth of zzso below the surface, offers a unique access to a microbial community in an environment, of which all geological and zzso characteristics are being thoroughly zzso This study presents the first elaborate description of a microbial community in water samples retrieved from a zzso Clay zzso zzso zzso Using an integrated approach of zzso zzso activity screening and zzso the presence and activity of this community are zzso Despite the presumed low-energy environment, zzso and molecular analyses show a large bacterial diversity and zzso tending to correlate positively with the organic matter content of the zzso Among 10 zzso water samples, a core bacterial community zzso seven bacterial zzso is zzso including both zzso and zzso zzso with a range of zzso zzso In addition, a corresponding large fraction of this community is found zzso and zzso In conclusion, this study shows the possibility of a microbial community of relative complexity to persist in subsurface zzso Clay zzso zzso
