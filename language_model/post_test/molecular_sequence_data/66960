The role of zzso T zzso responses in controlling viral replication during chronic zzso infection remains zzso zzso escape zzso driven by immune pressure have been zzso to be an important mechanism contributing to the evasion of zzso T cell zzso To explore this issue in more detail, zzso zzso sequence zzso was examined in chronically zzso patients, in parallel with the level, zzso and function of zzso zzso T zzso Thirty-one zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso patients were zzso The zzso of zzso zzso T cell and their ability to produce zzso were analyzed by zzso flow zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the mean zzso score for each zzso within zzso and the two zzso zzso regions were calculated using Shannon zzso The mean zzso of zzso and the proportion of patients with zzso acid changes within zzso were similar in zzso and zzso zzso Patients without zzso cells had a significantly higher prevalence of zzso changes in zzso than patients with zzso zzso Interestingly, in patients with zzso cells, the zzso zzso within zzso tended to be associated with lower levels of zzso zzso We did not find any association between zzso acid changes within zzso and the differentiation stage of zzso cells, or with zzso zzso A similar analysis within the zzso zzso sequences did not reveal differences in the zzso of these zzso These results suggest that viral zzso driven by immune selection pressure may play an important role in evading the zzso response in chronically zzso zzso
