Using a human zzso probe, we have isolated zzso zzso and zzso clones corresponding to the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis with the mouse zzso clones reveals transcripts of zzso zzso corresponding in size to the human zzso zzso DNA sequence comparisons between mouse and human clones reveals extensive zzso acid sequence conservation within regions harboring DNA zzso zzso binding or zzso zzso A survey among mouse zzso strains for restriction zzso length zzso zzso reveals at least three distinct zzso zzso The segregation of zzso among mouse genetic zzso positions zzso on mouse zzso 1 between the complement zzso gene zzso and the zzso zzso locus zzso Furthermore, zzso is closely associated with the zzso locus zzso zzso zzso
