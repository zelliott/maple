To emphasize the role played by the zzso bridge in the structural features of zzso zzso newly recorded CD and zzso zzso of this zzso zzso and its open analogue obtained by zzso substitution are zzso CD zzso of both peptides recorded in zzso solutions in the zzso zzso concentration range are zzso zzso They reveal principally that random zzso constitute the major population in both zzso zzso the zzso bridge has no structuring effect at zzso zzso In zzso the CD spectrum of zzso keeps globally the same spectral shape as that observed in water, whereas its open analogue presents a major population of zzso zzso zzso zzso recorded as a function of zzso concentration zzso zzso and also in the presence of 150 zzso zzso provide valuable zzso zzso All zzso zzso present a mixture of random and zzso structures for both zzso and open zzso More importantly, the presence or the absence of the zzso bridge does not seem to influence considerably different populations of secondary structures within this range of zzso CD and zzso data obtained in the zzso and zzso ranges of zzso respectively, lead us to accept the idea that zzso zzso zzso upon increasing zzso thus stabilizing zzso zzso in zzso However, even at high zzso random zzso do not zzso zzso zzso of zzso also reveal a concentration effect on the flexibility of the zzso linkage and consequently on that of its zzso zzso In conclusion, although the zzso linkage does not seem to markedly influence the zzso zzso features in zzso solutions, its presence seems to be necessary to ensure the flexibility of the zzso part of this zzso and to maintain its closed structure in lower zzso constant zzso
