zzso substitution rates have been shown to vary among evolutionary lineages of both nuclear and zzso genes across a broad range of zzso zzso In animals, rate zzso does not appear to be correlated across nuclear and zzso zzso In this paper, we contrast substitution rates in two plant groups and show that grasses evolve more rapidly than palms at synonymous sites in a zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the relative rates of synonymous substitution between grasses and palms are similar at the three zzso The correlation in synonymous substitution rates across genes is particularly striking because the three genes evolve at very different absolute zzso In contrast, relative rates of zzso substitution are not zzso among the three zzso
