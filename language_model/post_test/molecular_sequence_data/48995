The zzso agents of zzso disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso differ in their zzso to zzso zzso This phenomenon apparently depends on the expression of proteins termed complement zzso surface proteins zzso and their binding to the zzso plasma proteins factor H and zzso To characterize these bacterial proteins in more detail we have now isolated from a zzso zzso expression library a novel factor zzso zzso In accordance with our previous studies this protein was termed zzso and represents a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso On the basis of zzso accessibility zzso using intact zzso zzso is identified as a zzso protein and binds the zzso short consensus repeats of factor zzso zzso deletion zzso of zzso the factor zzso site was mapped to the zzso motif zzso localized at the zzso end of zzso Factor H bound to zzso maintains its zzso activity in factor zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to factor H can be inhibited by zzso a zzso zzso of the complement regulator factor zzso zzso of zzso by soluble zzso leads to an increase of complement deposition on intermediate zzso strain zzso In conclusion, zzso has been identified as a novel factor zzso protein on zzso zzso which by zzso complement resistance to the pathogen may contribute to its persistence in the zzso zzso
