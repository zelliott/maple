zzso is a membrane protein that mediates zzso cell zzso between zzso cells and zzso zzso cells of the zzso and is implicated in the initial attachment during the process of human zzso zzso The present study identified novel zzso gene zzso which zzso proteins structurally distinct from zzso protein in the zzso We designated these proteins zzso because they share consensus zzso acid sequences with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among many zzso zzso zzso are closely related to zzso which mediates zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which is a strong zzso of cell proliferation in zzso zzso There are three major forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso which are formed due to alternative usage of different zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso are expressed in brain, zzso zzso and zzso In addition, Western zzso analysis and in zzso translation experiments showed that zzso expressed in the mouse zzso and zzso are translation products utilizing the second initiation zzso zzso and contain an active nuclear zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells resulted in nuclear zzso of zzso and suppressed cell zzso zzso of the mouse zzso and zzso showed that zzso proteins are distributed in the zzso of the male and female germ cells, whereas these proteins are zzso to the nucleus at a specific stage of zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso regulate cell proliferation during zzso in the zzso
