Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso shuttle zzso zzso into zzso cells are efficiently zzso by an zzso zzso zzso To determine whether and with what specificity free zzso zzso breaks are rejoined by this pathway, a structural mimic of such a break was introduced at a specific site in an zzso shuttle zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso into 3' recessed ends generated in the zzso zzso These terminally blocked linear zzso were efficiently repaired and zzso when zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso across the repair zzso in progeny zzso indicated that, for a zzso zzso the most frequent mechanism of rejoining was zzso at a terminal zzso zzso however, a significant fraction of the zzso retained all bases from both ends of the break, consistent with a mechanism involving simple zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso For the analogous zzso terminated break, the fraction of simple zzso zzso was considerably zzso For a zzso zzso with cohesive ends the most frequent repair mechanism was simple zzso of the zzso cohesive ends, presumably preceded by zzso zzso For all these zzso the remaining repair zzso showed small or large deletions from one or both of the ends, usually with apparent zzso at short zzso zzso The results suggest that while breaks with zzso can be zzso these blocked zzso represent a significant barrier to DNA zzso and can significantly alter its zzso The presence of cohesive ends appears to improve markedly the zzso of rejoining for terminally blocked zzso zzso
