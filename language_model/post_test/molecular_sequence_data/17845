A major 26 zzso protein was identified in the zzso and nuclear compartments of zzso zzso A zzso zzso was produced against the zzso form of this zzso High levels of 26 zzso were expressed by zzso zzso which represent a major zzso zzso in young zzso However, no further expression of the 26 zzso protein was observed in zzso zzso of adult animals nor in zzso of young artificially metamorphosed zzso The 26 zzso was never expressed by zzso and blood peripheral zzso at any stage of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence and zzso acid composition demonstrate that the 26 zzso zzso is strongly zzso to zzso zzso the most abundant members of the high mobility group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are thought to be involved in the organization of zzso structure, as well as in the stability, replication and zzso of zzso It was confirmed that the 26 zzso zzso zzso is recognized by a well characterized rabbit zzso to rat zzso zzso
