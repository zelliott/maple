Analysis of zzso and zzso clones shows that the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a small protein with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso which contains zzso family basic and zzso zzso zzso but lacks the zzso zzso zzso present in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is neither an zzso nor a zzso of zzso however, zzso zzso the zzso ability of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acting as a zzso negative zzso Thus zzso resembles zzso another negative regulator of the zzso family, in both structure and zzso zzso Of the three known zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso only zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso may act as a general buffer for zzso zzso in many cell zzso
