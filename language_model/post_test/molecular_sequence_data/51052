To investigate whether T cells recognizing the same zzso zzso may demonstrate zzso in parts of their zzso five different zzso T zzso clones (TLC) were zzso The zzso alpha and zzso genes of four zzso zzso and one zzso TLC were zzso All TLC used different V alpha and V beta zzso However, four of the TLC shared a certain zzso beta motif and all five used either J beta zzso or zzso In addition, two used the same J zzso The results indicate a possible preferential usage of certain zzso structures by T cells specific for zzso
