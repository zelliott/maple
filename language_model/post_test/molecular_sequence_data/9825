Members of the zzso zzso family of zzso linking proteins have zzso and zzso zzso that associate with the plasma membrane and the zzso zzso zzso To search for zzso binding partners potentially involved in membrane association, tissue zzso were subjected to affinity zzso on the immobilized zzso zzso of zzso and zzso which comprise the zzso domain zzso A collection of zzso at zzso zzso from human zzso and at zzso zzso from bovine brain bound directly to both zzso The zzso zzso proteins migrated as a major zzso species after zzso treatment, indicating that the zzso is due to different zzso zzso We refer to these zzso as zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso analysis of human zzso was used to identify an approximately zzso human zzso that encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso binds tightly to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso sequences from the brain candidate indicated that it is closely related to zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso and is most likely a zzso of rabbit protein zzso which is involved in the protein zzso A regulation of the zzso brush border zzso zzso zzso is widely distributed in zzso and is particularly enriched in those containing polarized zzso zzso zzso of cultured cells and zzso revealed that zzso zzso with zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso cells, and zzso zzso demonstrated that it is specifically associated with the zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso can be zzso as a complex from isolated human zzso zzso These findings show that zzso is a zzso relevant zzso binding zzso Since zzso zzso are known to mediate associations with integral membrane zzso one mode of membrane attachment of zzso is likely to be zzso through zzso
