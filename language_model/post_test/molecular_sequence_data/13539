zzso pine zzso zzso zzso libraries were constructed and screened with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Eight zzso were identified from zzso clones zzso The longest zzso stretch found, zzso was amplified from bud and single zzso grain zzso In order to clarify the complex amplification pattern revealed, two zzso products were zzso The size differences were caused both by varying repeat numbers of the zzso stretches and by differences in other parts of the amplified zzso This kind of complex molecular basis of zzso amplification within a species has been previously zzso zzso sequences were used as zzso zzso to detect zzso and to estimate the abundance of zzso
