The zzso zzso linear zzso DNA viruses zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso form a novel virus family, the zzso The sizes of the zzso are zzso 3 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The zzso consist of a zzso zzso formed by the DNA and a single basic zzso zzso zzso The tube carries a plug and three tail fibers at each zzso One turn of the zzso zzso measures zzso zzso and comprises zzso turns of B zzso The linear DNA molecules appear to have zzso closed hairpin zzso The viruses are not zzso and are present in their original hosts in carrier zzso Both viruses are quite stable in these carrier zzso In several laboratory hosts zzso was zzso but zzso formed many different zzso that completely replaced the zzso zzso Some of these zzso were still zzso whereas others were zzso Up to zzso zzso substitution was found between corresponding zzso fragments of three zzso Some zzso showed zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso an zzso response in zzso We propose that zzso zzso is unable to zzso in some hosts but zzso this host range barrier by inducing a host response zzso extensive variation of the viral zzso
