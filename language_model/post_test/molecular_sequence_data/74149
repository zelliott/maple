The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso strain most frequently used for zzso zzso and has also often been employed for basic research on zzso zzso This strain has been reported to contain a truncated carbon zzso zzso gene zzso and is consequently carbon zzso zzso To date this and an additional zzso zzso in the zzso zzso II zzso gene are the only known genetic differences in strain zzso zzso 

In the present paper we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks an 85 zzso zzso fragment, and consequently misses additional 29 genes zzso zzso factors, zzso of the primary metabolism and transport zzso This loss is already present in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso seems to have occurred in a zzso zzso repeat zzso typically inducing zzso zzso and is not linked to the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso locus has specifically occurred in zzso zzso Some of the genes that are lacking in zzso zzso could be correlated with pronounced zzso in its zzso such as poor growth on zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso 

Our data place a general zzso on the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso for further basic zzso
