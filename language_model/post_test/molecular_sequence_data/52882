zzso of zzso cells to zzso is known to inhibit zzso However, the role of zzso zzso in zzso cell survival remains zzso zzso cultures of mouse zzso zzso zzso cells were used to examine the role of zzso zzso in promoting zzso When zzso cells were deprived of both zzso and zzso zzso they died by zzso However, when incubated in zzso culture dishes (to prevent zzso zzso and at high cell density (to allow zzso zzso zzso cells zzso to one another and remained zzso zzso of zzso among suspended, zzso cells increased with zzso A zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso binding prevented zzso zzso and promoted zzso of zzso cells in zzso By contrast, zzso of potential zzso interactions between cells in suspension did not prevent either zzso or survival of suspended zzso zzso of cells in suspension activated zzso zzso zzso an event that was markedly reduced by the presence of the zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso also inhibited survival of suspended zzso In zzso we provide novel evidence that zzso cells, when deprived of normal zzso zzso can adhere to one another in a zzso fashion and remain zzso Survival of zzso cells depends on zzso of zzso
