The direct optical resolution of a number of zzso and zzso was achieved by zzso zone zzso using an zzso crown zzso as buffer zzso The zzso primary zzso form inclusion complexes with the crown zzso zzso resolution is based on different stability zzso of the zzso complexes thereby changing the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is strongly affected by the distance between the zzso functionality and the zzso carbon zzso This effect was studied using zzso and zzso especially zzso for this zzso In general, baseline resolution was obtained for those peptides with the zzso group located as far as four bonds from the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso possessing two zzso centers were separated to investigate the potential of the zzso zzso for the analysis of complex zzso with related zzso Experimental factors such as crown zzso zzso buffer pH and temperature also show a strong influence on the zzso These factors can be successfully employed for method zzso
