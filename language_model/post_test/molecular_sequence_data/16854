The Ras protein activates at least three different pathways during early zzso Two of them regulate zzso gene expression and the third is thought to participate in the control of zzso zzso dynamics via the Ral zzso From a zzso zzso screen of a zzso maternal zzso library, we identified the zzso zzso of the Ral interacting protein zzso zzso or zzso a putative zzso of small G protein zzso Previously, we observed that a zzso activated form of Ral zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of the animal zzso and disruption of the cortical zzso zzso To demonstrate that zzso is the zzso of zzso in early development, we show that the artificial targeting of zzso to the membrane zzso a similar zzso to that of activated zzso We show that zzso of the Ral binding domain zzso of zzso which binds to the zzso site of zzso acts in competition with the zzso zzso of Ral and protects against the destructive effect of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso has a synergistic effect on the activated form of zzso which is dependent on the zzso of zzso We provide evidence for the involvement of zzso by way of its zzso on the dynamics of the zzso zzso and propose that zzso from Ral to zzso is required for zzso
