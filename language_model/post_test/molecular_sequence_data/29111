zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso zzso of zzso zzso It zzso the conversion of zzso into zzso with the transfer of a zzso group to zzso to form zzso The zzso provides energy for cell growth and zzso and zzso zzso in many zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in cell zzso Southern zzso analysis, zzso and sequencing were used to determine the content of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that the insert of zzso comprised zzso zzso upstream of and zzso zzso downstream of the zzso start point of the zzso zzso The size of the insert was zzso zzso in total, which contained six genes including zzso zzso mapping was applied to identify the promoter region and zzso elements zzso of zzso Ten serial deletions produced by zzso were inserted upstream of the reporter gene zzso to form zzso zzso which were then zzso into zzso zzso zzso The results revealed that the regions zzso approximately zzso and zzso approximately zzso of the zzso end of zzso possessed positive regulatory function for zzso zzso zzso increased gene zzso There were redundant putative zzso zzso including zzso response element zzso zzso and broad complex zinc finger zzso binding zzso Both zzso and zzso belong to the early genes regulated by zzso This result suggested that zzso might be regulated by zzso directly or zzso However, the results of the zzso profile of zzso expression by Northern zzso analysis suggested that the effects of zzso on zzso were repressive, not zzso In addition, it was found that in these regions, there were many zzso elements related to egg and zzso zzso Both zzso approximately zzso and zzso approximately zzso contained a zzso box, and deletion of these regions decreased reporter gene zzso zzso it is suggested that both zzso boxes are functional and that the promoter of zzso might be located in the region of zzso approximately zzso No zzso box or downstream promoter element were identified around the zzso start site of zzso Additionally, zzso might share a regulatory region with an unknown neighboring zzso It was concluded that zzso has the characteristics of a zzso zzso
