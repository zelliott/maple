To address whether B cells expressing a zzso zzso are regulated in normal mice, we have established a zzso factor zzso transgenic model of zzso using V genes derived from an zzso zzso zzso isolated from an zzso zzso zzso As we wished to study induction of tolerance during B cell development, we cloned the zzso gene into an zzso expression zzso The zzso we chose binds only zzso of the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso allowing us to produce transgenic animals on zzso and zzso backgrounds, which either express or lack the zzso Two transgenic lines were zzso Using mice which lack the zzso we show by zzso activated cell sorting and zzso analysis that the H and L zzso are expressed to the exclusion of zzso genes in most zzso B zzso In spite of good zzso zzso transgenic mice which are genetically capable of expressing zzso have reduced but significant zzso 50 zzso serum zzso Nonetheless, the frequency and numbers of zzso B cells in peripheral zzso zzso of such mice which have the zzso are similar to those which lack it zzso zzso Thus, B cells expressing an zzso zzso surface zzso can develop in this zzso Whether such B cells are zzso or otherwise regulated in zzso mice is zzso
