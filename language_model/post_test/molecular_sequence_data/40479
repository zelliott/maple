DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the two main zzso zzso in zzso it zzso the lagging DNA strand and also functions in DNA zzso In previous work, we demonstrated that zzso expression of the pol zzso zzso zzso in mice results in normal life span and no apparent zzso whereas a different substitution at the same position, zzso is associated with shortened life span and accelerated zzso Here, we report in zzso analysis of the zzso zzso at position zzso in human pol zzso zzso human pol zzso zzso that harbor or lack 3' zzso zzso zzso activity were zzso from zzso zzso The pol zzso zzso and zzso zzso retain zzso activity and zzso similar to that of wild type pol zzso pol zzso zzso is highly error zzso incorporating single zzso zzso at a high frequency during DNA zzso whereas pol zzso zzso is extremely accurate, with a higher zzso of single zzso incorporation by the active site than that of wild type pol zzso However, pol zzso zzso is impaired in the bypass of DNA zzso and the zzso zzso in mouse embryonic zzso results in a decreased rate of replication fork progression in zzso These results indicate that different zzso at a single active site zzso in a zzso zzso can either increase or decrease the accuracy of synthesis relative to wild type and suggest that enhanced zzso of base selection by a zzso active site can result in impaired zzso bypass and delayed replication fork zzso
