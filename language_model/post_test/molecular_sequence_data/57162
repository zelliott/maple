zzso and zzso expression of the rat zzso protein gene zzso is dependent on a zzso pair sequence of a zzso zzso response element zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ann, zzso zzso (1992) Gene zzso 2, zzso To unravel its zzso zzso we used zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso to screen a randomly primed zzso zzso zzso expression library made from zzso of rat zzso zzso In this report, we describe the zzso cloning of these zzso zzso proteins zzso and demonstrate that there are at least three zzso in zzso cells, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and sequence analyses further confirmed the existence of these three different zzso zzso which code for putative proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cloned zzso zzso in zzso cells stimulates the expression of a zzso reporter construct containing zzso of the zzso cloned upstream of the zzso zzso promoter and the zzso zzso structural zzso This stimulation is much more pronounced in zzso in which zzso alpha and zzso beta are zzso than when they are zzso zzso Furthermore, when low zzso of zzso alpha and zzso beta are zzso with the zzso reporter zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of protein zzso A is required to efficiently activate the expression of the reporter zzso These results strongly suggest that the observed stimulation of the zzso is achieved through the coordinated expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso A activities, perhaps via a direct association of the two zzso and their zzso by protein zzso zzso We conclude that the isolated zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso that participate in the control of the zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
