zzso insects such as zzso zzso frequently feed on plants expressing zzso zzso Apparently, their zzso system can adapt to the presence of zzso zzso To study this, a zzso zzso was zzso from the gut of insects that were raised on an zzso zzso The zzso sequence of this zzso was zzso by tandem zzso which allowed assignment of zzso of the mature protein zzso acid zzso This zzso called zzso corresponded to a known zzso sequence from zzso The zzso acid sequence is closely related zzso zzso to that of a zzso zzso which was zzso and identified in a similar way from insects raised on a diet without additional zzso The zzso properties of zzso and zzso were zzso Both zzso appeared to be equally efficient in degrading zzso Four typical plant zzso were tested in zzso zzso zzso could not be inhibited by zzso zzso zzso excess of any of zzso The same zzso inhibited zzso with apparent equilibrium zzso zzso ranging from 1 zzso to 30 zzso Thus, zzso seems to allow the insect to overcome different defensive zzso zzso in zzso
