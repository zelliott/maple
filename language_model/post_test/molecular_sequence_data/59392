Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of tomato were identified by isolation of the corresponding zzso These three zzso are derived from only two genes zzso and zzso This additional complexity results from differential zzso of the primary transcript of one of the genes zzso giving rise to two different transcripts zzso and zzso delta zzso All three zzso were individually expressed in zzso coli both as precursor proteins with zzso transit peptides and as mature zzso Only the mature but not the precursor zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso The zzso zzso delta was unstable in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso to near zzso and their zzso properties were zzso They differ substantially in their zzso values for the zzso zzso zzso (11 and 80 zzso for the mature forms of zzso and zzso zzso The two zzso appear to be active only as zzso and the potential zzso implications of this result are zzso
