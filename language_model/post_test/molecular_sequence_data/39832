zzso zzso zzso forms an zzso zzso in the region zzso with the zzso zzso interacting with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Morelli, zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso 13, zzso To uncover the structural requirements for the hormone zzso we investigated several zzso zzso They were designed so as to alter the length of the central zzso by removal and/or replacement of zzso zzso and by selectively mutating or deleting zzso inside the zzso The zzso content was assessed by circular zzso and zzso zzso the zzso binding affinity in human breast cancer cell line T zzso and the in zzso zzso activity were also zzso In particular, by zzso zzso and molecular dynamics calculations we studied zzso in which zzso and zzso were replaced by zzso inducing zzso Compared with zzso it assumes a longer zzso zzso with decreased binding affinity and one-fifth of the zzso activity, therefore supporting the idea of a relationship between a zzso zzso length and zzso From the analysis of other zzso zzso we zzso that the correct zzso length is located in the zzso region and requires long range interactions and the presence of specific regions of zzso within the sequence for high binding affinity and zzso zzso Taken together, the structural and biological data identify well defined structural parameters of the zzso for zzso zzso
