These data show the presence of zzso for two complement components zzso in the adult rat brain and describe their responses to experimental zzso zzso zzso caused zzso in zzso zzso and C4 zzso that coincided temporally and overlapped zzso with the course of zzso of zzso zzso zzso By in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was zzso to cells zzso for zzso a complement zzso found on zzso The zzso for zzso a putative C inhibitor in zzso showed parallel zzso Similarly, in zzso and other brain regions, zzso acid zzso increased zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso and possibly other cells in rat brain rapidly zzso zzso in response to zzso and local zzso zzso These experimental responses provide models to analyze changes in C components during Alzheimer's disease and other chronic neurodegenerative zzso
