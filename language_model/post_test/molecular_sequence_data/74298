zzso is a zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is active against zzso and has great potential for zzso zzso Here, we predict the first theoretical model of the three-dimensional zzso structure of a zzso toxin by zzso modeling on the structure of the zzso zzso which is specific to zzso zzso zzso resembles the previously reported zzso toxin structure in that they share a common zzso structure with three zzso but there are some zzso with the main differences being located in the zzso of domain zzso zzso exhibits a zzso extending zzso structure, and this special structure may also be involved in zzso and specificity zzso A fuller understanding of the zzso structure will be helpful in the design of zzso experiments aimed at improving zzso and lead to a deep understanding of the mechanism of action of zzso zzso
