zzso and zzso are the two major zzso of the zzso that converts zzso into zzso in a single step zzso Despite studies describing zzso and zzso zzso expression in the zzso brain, both zzso and zzso zzso expression has not yet been fully described for a zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the expression patterns of zzso zzso the major zzso involved in zzso zzso have not been described for any zzso In the present study, we zzso zzso in zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the adult goldfish brain and zzso this with an in zzso assessment of total zzso and zzso zzso zzso A partial zzso of goldfish zzso was cloned for a zzso that showed approximately zzso deduced zzso acid identity to zzso zzso and zzso identity to human zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were detected throughout the brain and were detected largely in the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso nucleus zzso nucleus zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso cell layer of the zzso zzso zzso was significantly more abundant in the nucleus zzso zzso of the zzso than zzso and zzso zzso Total zzso and zzso specific zzso activity was highest in the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso activity was significantly higher than total zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are generally correlated with total zzso and zzso activity and all three transcripts have a largely overlapping zzso distribution in the goldfish zzso
