The identification of peptides that result from zzso modifications is critical for understanding normal pathways of cellular regulation as well as identifying damage from, or zzso to zzso zzso the zzso However, because of their low abundance in zzso effective detection of modified peptides by mass zzso zzso typically requires enrichment to eliminate false zzso We present a new method for confidently identifying peptides with mercury zzso zzso that is based on the influence of zzso seven stable zzso on zzso isotope zzso detected by high-resolution zzso Using a pure protein and zzso coli cultures exposed to zzso zzso zzso we show the pattern of peak heights in isotope zzso from primary zzso single scans efficiently identified zzso zzso in data from zzso separation coupled with tandem mass zzso with sensitivity and specificity greater than zzso zzso zzso are independent of zzso identifications based on zzso fragmentation zzso by zzso so both methods can be combined to eliminate false zzso zzso zzso isotope zzso across multiple scans improved specificity to zzso and sensitivity above zzso zzso identification of an unexpected zzso zzso We also illustrate the theoretical zzso of the method for detection of several less common elements including the essential element, zzso as zzso in zzso
