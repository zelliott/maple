The characterization of the zzso zzso of two closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is important to zzso the common mechanisms of zzso zzso In this context, a gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression library with zzso from mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso by a gene with open reading frame of zzso zzso which zzso a protein of 311 zzso zzso The zzso gene existed as a single copy in the zzso and was interrupted by a 432 zzso zzso The zzso showed zzso zzso acid identity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized a native zzso protein with a molecular mass of 34 zzso in Western zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso was localized to the surface of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a potential common vaccine candidate to control both zzso
