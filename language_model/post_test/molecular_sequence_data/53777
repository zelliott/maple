The zzso acid zzso responsible for stable binding of zzso acids by the intermediate filament zzso zzso protein zzso were identified by a combination of zzso and chemical zzso sequencing of zzso zzso complexes and analysis by zzso mass zzso Three zzso peptides of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be zzso to zzso zzso From a zzso standpoint, it was necessary to remove the bulk of the bound zzso by zzso with zzso zzso to get zzso zzso for most of the peptides zzso Additionally, removal of the zzso group of the zzso bound zzso or modification of the zzso zzso of the zzso complexes with zzso zzso dramatically improved the quality of the zzso zzso zzso particularly for the zzso zzso A single zzso zzso within each of these peptides zzso zzso and zzso was unequivocally demonstrated to be the unique site of zzso in each zzso These three zzso zzso are contained within the two zzso zzso wings proposed for the middle of the zzso zzso head zzso The experimental approach described should be generally zzso to the study of zzso acid interactions and is currently being employed to characterize the zzso sites of several other IF zzso zzso
