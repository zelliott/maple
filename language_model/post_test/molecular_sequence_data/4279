zzso zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Both zzso were selected based on their increased sensitivity to zzso and they had the zzso zzso in the same zzso 34 zzso zzso zzso analysis of the interrupted gene showed clear zzso with the zzso gene from zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso involved in the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had an altered zzso zzso pattern, consistent with synthesis of incomplete zzso zzso For these reasons, the zzso zzso gene was designated zzso The zzso were also sensitive to zzso zzso transfer proteins zzso and to an zzso cell wall extract from tobacco zzso zzso zzso and zzso died rapidly in zzso and failed to produce necrosis when infiltrated in tobacco leaves or to cause zzso when injected in tobacco zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso were respectively obtained from zzso zzso and zzso by transformation with a DNA zzso harboring gene zzso They had a different degree of zzso zzso zzso Both strains retained the rough zzso of the zzso and their zzso zzso patterns were intermediate between those of the wild type and those of the zzso
