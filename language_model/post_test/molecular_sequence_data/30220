zzso protein is a major protein component of zzso plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's disease zzso A major advance in understanding the molecular biology of Alzheimer's disease came with the zzso and sequencing of this zzso Because zzso protein is very zzso extreme conditions such as zzso zzso acid were commonly used to zzso its zzso We now report that zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso protein fragments, probably by the formation of a zzso zzso to a zzso in the zzso The zzso of the zzso is approximately zzso zzso and the zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso is much longer, being zzso h in water and 66 h in zzso zzso This suggests that if zzso acid is used in the zzso of zzso protein or zzso fragments of this zzso it is likely that some zzso zzso will be present in subsequent zzso Although zzso modification of a protein is inherently zzso it is uncertain what effects this zzso will have on ensuing zzso Certainly, investigations into the zzso physical, and zzso properties of zzso protein could be zzso
