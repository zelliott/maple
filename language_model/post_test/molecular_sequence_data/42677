zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid form of basic zzso growth factor zzso are in good agreement with a consensus sequence for nuclear zzso To evaluate the role of this sequence in zzso the zzso zzso and biological activity of zzso basic zzso zzso zzso and zzso were changed to neutral zzso zzso by zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cells and in zzso cells, from which it was zzso to zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells followed by zzso and by zzso zzso indicated that both molecules zzso in the nucleus, as well as in the zzso of zzso cells, and interact with nuclear zzso and with zzso DNA in a similar zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso yields a zzso endowed with a zzso capacity and zzso activity similar to that exerted by zzso zzso However, zzso zzso showed a drastically reduced capacity to induce the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was fully restored by the presence of soluble zzso in the culture zzso In conclusion, the sequence zzso does not appear to represent a nuclear zzso and/or retention sequence for zzso However, zzso of its basic zzso seems to modify the zzso structure of the growth factor, thus affecting some of its biological zzso
