To identify the primary structure of zzso zzso and to zzso its function, a full-length zzso clone of zzso was zzso The zzso sequence contained an open reading frame that encodes an zzso zzso The zzso 25 zzso acids represented a typical signal zzso sequence and the zzso zzso zzso acids were characteristic for zzso zzso The predicted mature protein sequence showed zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso The number and the distribution of zzso zzso were zzso zzso that the zzso represented a human zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso The zzso was not only expressed in zzso lines but in some of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In all of these zzso and cell lines, at least four zzso species were zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis revealed a rather simple zzso structure, which suggested a single gene as compared with the complex zzso family of zzso zzso
