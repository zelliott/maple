The major zzso complex zzso zzso chain zzso associates with the class II zzso zzso during its zzso zzso association of zzso peptides with the zzso zzso It is therefore not surprising that there are significant similarities in regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression of the structural class II zzso and zzso zzso One important similarity is that both classes of genes can be expressed via zzso or zzso zzso In this report, we have dissected zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene using an zzso zzso cell pair zzso and zzso which do or do not express the class II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso or deletion zzso of the zzso gene promoter indicate that while both the zzso and zzso elements are critical for zzso zzso in B zzso the zzso element is of greater importance for zzso zzso gene transcription, with the zzso playing a secondary zzso Despite these clear differences in zzso dependence of zzso and zzso zzso transcription, there are only subtle differences in the occupancy of these elements in zzso as assessed by zzso zzso These differences are restricted to occupancy of the zzso and zzso with which the zzso and zzso complexes interact in zzso zzso This difference in the occupancy of the zzso and zzso in this cell pair indicates that while zzso interactions between zzso and zzso factors stabilize promoter occupancy, these interactions are not absolutely required for occupancy and zzso of the zzso chain zzso
