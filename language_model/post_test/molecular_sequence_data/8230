We report the first systematic study on short zzso structure affinity and activity for the zzso Y zzso zzso A series of linear zzso has been zzso that display affinities in the low zzso range toward rat brain zzso zzso Furthermore, some of these compounds competitively antagonize the zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso The inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso was modified by replacing zzso with an aromatic zzso acid and zzso with zzso This resulted in a series of zzso with dramatically improved affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso for the rat brain zzso The zzso data suggest that these peptides may represent a zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso
