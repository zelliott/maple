The association between zzso coding region variation and hair zzso in humans has been examined by zzso 25 red zzso and 62 zzso zzso all of whom were 12 years of age and members of a twin pair zzso Twelve zzso acid zzso were seen at 11 different sites, nine of these being newly described zzso zzso The previously reported zzso zzso shows no association with hair zzso but the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were associated with red hair and one zzso zzso was most frequent in zzso and light brown hair zzso zzso zzso zzso are associated with lighter skin types and red hair zzso zzso zzso However, comparison of the zzso zzso in zzso twin pairs zzso for red hair zzso indicates that the zzso gene cannot be solely responsible for the red hair zzso since five of 13 pairs tested had both zzso identical by state (with three of the five having both identical by zzso Rather, it is likely that additional modifier genes exist, making zzso in the zzso gene necessary but not always zzso for red hair zzso
