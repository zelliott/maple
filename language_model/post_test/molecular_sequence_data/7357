The ability of curved DNA upstream of the zzso region to affect the interaction of zzso coli zzso zzso and promoter DNA was examined through the use of hybrid zzso These promoters were constructed by substituting the curved DNA from two zzso zzso zzso zzso promoters for the comparable DNA of the zzso zzso promoters zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso promoters possessed intrinsic DNA zzso upstream of their zzso regions, as characterized by runs of zzso in phase with the zzso zzso In zzso the relative affinities of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the promoters were determined in a competition binding zzso zzso promoters derived from zzso zzso that contained curved DNA were bound by zzso coli zzso zzso more efficiently than was the original zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso to these hybrid promoters was favored on zzso DNA templates according to gel zzso zzso Both the zzso and relaxed forms of the hybrid zzso zzso series were better competitors for zzso coli zzso zzso binding than was the original zzso zzso The results of zzso I zzso analysis provided evidence for the wrapping of the upstream curved DNA of the hybrid zzso zzso promoters around the zzso coli zzso zzso in a tight, zzso zzso The tight wrapping of the upstream DNA around the zzso may facilitate the subsequent steps of DNA zzso and strand zzso
