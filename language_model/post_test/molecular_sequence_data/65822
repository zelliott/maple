zzso was previously shown to be required for maturation of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Here we report the determination of the crystal structure of zzso at 2 A resolution in complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso This structure identifies zzso as a novel member of the zzso knot fold zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso core, zzso has two unique zzso that form an extended surface, which we predict to be involved in binding of zzso zzso A point zzso within a basic patch on this surface almost completely abolished zzso binding in zzso Three point zzso designed to disrupt the interaction of zzso with SAM each zzso reduction in SAM binding in zzso zzso of only zzso with these zzso could support growth and apparently normal zzso zzso in strains genetically depleted of zzso We conclude that the zzso activity of zzso is not essential and that the presence of the protein is both necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso
