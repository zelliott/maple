zzso zzso B virus zzso is a model virus for human zzso B virus zzso which zzso approximately 360 million individuals zzso zzso zzso can decrease virus production by zzso the viral zzso however, complete clearance by these drugs is not common because of the persistence of the zzso zzso zzso DNA is present in the nucleus as a zzso closed circular zzso form, where it drives viral zzso and progeny virus zzso zzso is not the direct target of zzso zzso zzso and is the source of zzso zzso when zzso therapy is zzso To target zzso six different zinc finger proteins zzso were designed to bind DNA sequences in the zzso zzso zzso After the binding zzso were assessed by using zzso mobility shift zzso and surface zzso zzso two candidates with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were focused on for further zzso The zzso were cloned into a zzso expression zzso and zzso into zzso male zzso cells with the zzso zzso which replicates the zzso life zzso In the presence of each zzso viral zzso was significantly reduced, and protein levels were dramatically zzso As a result, zzso viral particle production was also significantly zzso In zzso designed zzso are able to bind to the zzso zzso and interfere with viral transcription, resulting in decreased production of viral products and progeny virus zzso
