How zzso zzso modification coordinates dynamic regulation of protein function is an issue fundamental to many biological zzso Related to this, a composite sequence motif has recently been identified that couples zzso zzso and perhaps also zzso to control zzso repression in stress response, zzso and nuclear hormone zzso zzso and zzso zzso This motif is present in many zzso zzso cellular signals from diverse zzso and serves as a valuable signature for in zzso identification of proteins regulated by adjacent zzso and zzso
