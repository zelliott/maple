zzso zzso genes in human and mouse have been zzso to play a role in zzso The mouse Y long arm zzso carries hundreds of supposedly zzso copies of zzso for which no protein has zzso been zzso mice lacking zzso are sterile with zzso abnormal zzso We have now identified an zzso protein zzso that is expressed in zzso The protein is absent from zzso of mice that lack zzso but is not reduced in mice with a two-thirds reduction of zzso copies, zzso that most do not produce this zzso Furthermore, no protein was produced by a strongly transcribed zzso zzso zzso raising doubts as to the zzso potential of these zzso zzso We have now identified an zzso copy that is also present in multiple copies on zzso One or more zzso copies are retained in the zzso mice and may be the source of the zzso zzso
