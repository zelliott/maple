The zzso prion can be induced by overproduction of the complete zzso zzso but only in strains carrying the zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that just as zzso zzso strains can exist as zzso and zzso zzso zzso can also exist in the presence or absence of zzso zzso and zzso tend to be cured together, but can be lost zzso zzso zzso are not affected by zzso Thus, zzso is required for the de zzso formation of zzso not for zzso zzso Although zzso induction is shown to require zzso even when the only zzso region of zzso is the prion domain, two altered prion domain fragments zzso the zzso requirement are zzso Finally, in strains cured of zzso prolonged incubation zzso the reappearance of zzso zzso appearing zzso elements are often unstable but become stable in some zzso zzso Such zzso of zzso together with our previous demonstration that the inheritance of zzso is zzso supports the hypothesis that zzso is a zzso Models for zzso action, which explain these findings, are zzso
