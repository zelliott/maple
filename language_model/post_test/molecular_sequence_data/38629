The zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso encodes four proteins responsible for the zzso of zzso acid zzso by zzso These zzso play an important role in controlling the net zzso charge of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso carrier protein zzso zzso and zzso carrier protein zzso zzso Whereas the functions of zzso and zzso are zzso the functions of zzso and zzso are zzso To define the role of zzso the gene was cloned and zzso and a zzso was constructed by zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso cells of a zzso zzso lacked the ability to incorporate zzso into zzso This zzso was zzso by the expression of zzso from zzso In in zzso zzso zzso bound zzso for zzso with zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso the zzso coli zzso carrier protein zzso involved in fatty acid zzso was not bound to zzso and thus was not zzso with zzso zzso also zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence of zzso was required for zzso the protein in the zzso It is hypothesized that this zzso zzso zzso the binding of zzso and zzso for zzso of zzso with zzso and that the resulting zzso is zzso to the primary site of zzso
