We have used the techniques of DNA zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso specific for zzso repetitive DNA sequences zzso and zzso zzso to analyze 36 zzso strains belonging to 10 species and 2 zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA and the zzso sequence zzso as zzso and zzso respectively, we obtained DNA zzso which allowed us to discriminate 23 zzso important strains of the zzso zzso zzso and to distinguish them from strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that both DNA and zzso zzso are suitable tools for an easy, fast and reliable molecular typing of zzso The DNA zzso method seems to be more sensitive than zzso zzso with respect to the zzso of zzso Nevertheless, using the zzso zzso technique we were able to zzso discriminate between zzso of different zzso zzso zzso zzso might become a useful tool in the zzso of zzso on the basis of zzso zzso
