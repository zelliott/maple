Three zzso genes zzso the D1 protein of the zzso II reaction center are zzso expressed under different light zzso in the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso Two of the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso are induced rapidly when light intensity is increased from 125 zzso zzso zzso to 750 zzso zzso zzso A zzso cloning zzso that carries a zzso zzso reporter gene was used to characterize the controlling elements responsible for light zzso At least three distinct zzso elements are present in the regulatory regions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso comparable to zzso coli zzso 70 promoters in position and zzso zzso zzso expression of the genes under both low and high light zzso negative elements upstream of the promoters zzso the expression of the corresponding zzso and sequences downstream of the promoters that zzso to the untranslated leader regions of the zzso zzso to zzso in zzso and zzso to zzso in zzso are responsible for increased expression under high zzso When these zzso elements were combined with an zzso coli promoter zzso in different positions and zzso the expression of the zzso gene was induced zzso to zzso The induction of gene expression under high light by these enhancers was position independent but orientation zzso When the elements were combined with the zzso promoter in the correct orientation, they also zzso a small but zzso level of zzso expression on this zzso coli zzso
