The role of zzso hormone zzso zzso and the zzso hormone zzso zzso in regulating growth, development, and zzso zzso is well zzso It is also emerging that zzso is associated with zzso stress through the regulation of the activity of zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in the metabolism of oxygen free zzso We found that zzso reverses the zzso of the zzso promoter caused by the free radical generators zzso and zzso zzso zzso through the direct repression of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso zzso the zzso promoter is significantly zzso by zzso zzso This regulation requires the zzso domain of the zzso which is recruited to an zzso element between zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which abolish recruitment of zzso zzso block repression of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso that zzso zzso binding to the zzso prevents zzso Together, our findings suggest a mechanism of negative regulation in which zzso binds to the zzso promoter but zzso and zzso binding surfaces have an zzso zzso This effect may be important in zzso induction of zzso stress in zzso hormone zzso
