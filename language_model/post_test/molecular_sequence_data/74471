The zzso of crops involves a complex process of selection in plant evolution and is associated with changes in the DNA regulating zzso important zzso Here we report the cloning of a newly identified zzso zzso zzso for seed zzso on zzso zzso involved in the determination of grain zzso in zzso Through fine zzso zzso testing and association analysis, we found that a deletion in zzso resulted in a significant increase in sink size zzso to an increase in cell number in the outer zzso of the rice zzso this trait might have been selected by ancient humans to increase yield of rice zzso In addition, we mapped two other defective functional zzso zzso of rice zzso genes with zzso zzso zzso of various rice zzso These analyses show that the zzso deletion had an important historical role in artificial selection, propagation of zzso and natural crossings in rice zzso and shed light on how the rice zzso was zzso
