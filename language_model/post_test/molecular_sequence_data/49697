zzso zzso animals that spend a zzso life after zzso exhibit a marked development of zzso during and after zzso In order to see whether changes occur in the muscle protein components in the course of zzso development, we subjected zzso muscle extracts from growing zzso to two-dimensional zzso zzso As a result, we found two proteins to undergo a change in zzso One spot, indicating a molecular mass of approximately 12 zzso and an zzso point zzso of zzso first became zzso at 45 days after zzso Another spot, corresponding to a protein of 11 zzso and zzso zzso was prominent until the former spot zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis and comparison of the spots with those of zzso zzso revealed that these two proteins were PA alpha and PA zzso Northern zzso analysis using PA alpha and PA beta zzso as zzso revealed that the PA beta zzso level declined whereas that of PA alpha zzso rose as the frogs zzso
