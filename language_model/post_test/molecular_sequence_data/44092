The zzso constitute the most diverse animal group, but, despite their rich fossil record and a century of study, their zzso relationships remain zzso zzso previously proposed to be sister groups to the zzso include zzso zzso zzso and others, but hypotheses of zzso relationships have been zzso For example, zzso like zzso zzso periodically, have an zzso arrangement of zzso and have been related to zzso in zzso and zzso DNA sequence zzso Like zzso they possess zzso zzso and muscles that are a combination of smooth and obliquely zzso zzso Our zzso analysis of zzso zzso DNA sequences indicates a close relationship between zzso zzso and all other zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso arose once and support the idea of a new zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso No support is found for a zzso of segmented animals, the zzso uniting zzso with zzso The hypothesis that zzso are related to zzso has important implications for zzso genetic studies using as model systems the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso which are generally held to be zzso distant from each zzso
