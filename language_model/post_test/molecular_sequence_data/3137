The zzso c from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was studied by zzso in zzso (4 : 4 : zzso In this zzso zzso c consists of two zzso zzso comprised of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso On comparing the secondary structure of zzso c from zzso zzso in the organic zzso mixture with that in zzso zzso several zzso became zzso in the organic zzso the interruption of the alpha zzso structure within the zzso zzso motif was shortened from five to two zzso the prominent interruption of the alpha zzso structure in the zzso loop region was not apparent, and neither was there a break in the alpha zzso after the sodium zzso zzso zzso The folding of zzso c of zzso zzso in the organic zzso also deviated from that of zzso coli in the same environment, the most important difference being that zzso c of zzso zzso did not adopt a stable hairpin structure like zzso c of zzso zzso
