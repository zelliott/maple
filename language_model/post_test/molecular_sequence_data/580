zzso identification of zzso by zzso zzso expression cloning zzso is an established method for detecting new zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso may be useful for the detection of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso library of a human zzso SCC cell line was screened using zzso of patients with zzso zzso The presence and levels of serum zzso to zzso zzso were established by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The newly identified zzso SCC zzso is zzso by a novel gene located on zzso 1, here designated zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in 14 of 54 patients with zzso SCC zzso by Western zzso zzso zzso zzso were positive for zzso together with zzso zzso or zzso in 44, 41 and zzso of cases, zzso There was no zzso association between the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that the levels of zzso were significantly higher in patients with zzso SCC than in healthy volunteers zzso in the former using the zzso zzso of zzso in healthy controls as the zzso 

A new tumor zzso zzso was identified by zzso zzso zzso might be a useful serum marker to detect zzso zzso
