zzso repeat sequence instability is associated with zzso neurological diseases and with certain types of zzso Here we study one form of this instability, deletion of zzso repeats during replication of template zzso by DNA zzso To monitor loss of zzso zzso we inserted zzso zzso into the zzso sequence in zzso and changed one repeat to a zzso zzso to yield DNA zzso with zzso plaque zzso zzso containing these zzso within gaps were copied and errors were scored as blue plaque zzso zzso whose DNA was zzso to determine if loss of the zzso zzso resulted from zzso or zzso DNA synthesis by either DNA zzso beta or zzso zzso DNA zzso produced deletions involving loss of from 1 to 8 of 9 or 15 of 17 zzso Thus, these zzso zzso zzso zzso containing from 3 to 45 extra template strand zzso zzso zzso were much higher than substitution zzso at the zzso zzso in certain repeats, indicating that zzso repeats are at high risk for zzso in the absence of error zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso generated deletions at zzso to zzso lower zzso than did its zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso repeat sequences are subject to zzso but at reduced efficiency compared to editing of zzso zzso
