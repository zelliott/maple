zzso binding specificity of the zzso major zzso of zzso extract zzso was studied by an zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and compounds containing multiple zzso zzso The results indicate that 1) both zzso and zzso zzso are recognized equally well; 2) each of the zzso groups of zzso contributes to varying degrees to the binding process, the zzso being the most important and the zzso the least important zzso zzso 3) zzso sequences of Gal beta zzso and Gal beta zzso have much higher affinity than zzso whereas affinity of all other zzso is only slightly better than zzso 4) zzso zzso having 10 or more terminal zzso zzso have zzso higher affinity than zzso and 5) a group on zzso with zzso alpha of zzso appears to be involved in the binding of zzso
