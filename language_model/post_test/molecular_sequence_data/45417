In the present study, zzso has been applied to detect and analyze DNA of zzso zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso Collection of zzso zzso was made in 6 forested areas of zzso zzso Poland, during 2 seasonal zzso of tick activity, zzso spring and autumn, zzso In total, zzso zzso zzso were collected and processed for zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in 28 zzso of zzso zzso zzso 26 were identified as zzso zzso The other 2 were identified as zzso zzso zzso was conducted with zzso zzso specific zzso and sequencing was processed to precisely identify and compare these zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences from Europe, North America, and Asia obtained from the zzso Analysis revealed that sequences of zzso zzso from northwestern Poland are almost identical zzso with those referred to as zzso zzso both form a zzso different from other European zzso as well as those from Asia and North America (called zzso zzso zzso zzso An investigation performed with zzso zzso sequences showed that the sequence from northwestern Poland is zzso zzso to an isolate from Ireland zzso and differs in just a few zzso from other European zzso zzso analysis revealed that the sequence of B zzso isolated from Polish ticks form a group that comprise 4 European sequences from Great Britain and Ireland and is, therefore, closely related to other European and North American zzso zzso zzso
