The zzso family of zzso proteins has a zzso domain which includes three or four zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso show that when zzso and zzso are zzso assembled into zzso the presence of zzso reduces the amount of zzso zzso In the absence of zzso strong binding sites for zzso are filled by one repeat motif per zzso zzso additional zzso molecules bind more zzso We have zzso a repeat motif with zzso and used three-dimensional electron zzso to compare images of zzso assembled with zzso or zzso zzso With zzso motor zzso bound to the zzso outer surface to distinguish between zzso and zzso we show that the gold label lies on the inner surface close to the zzso binding site on zzso zzso within the repeat motifs of zzso have sequence similarity to an extended loop which occupies a site in zzso equivalent to the zzso pocket in zzso We propose that zzso in bound zzso stabilize zzso in a similar way to zzso although with lower affinity so that assembly is zzso
