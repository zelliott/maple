A DNA zzso is a zzso short and highly variable region of DNA supposed to facilitate a rapid identification of zzso In many zzso zzso a lack of zzso zzso characters zzso an identification of species by light or electron zzso and difficulties to perform mating experiments in laboratory cultures also do not allow for an identification of biological zzso Thus, testing candidate zzso markers as well as establishment of accurately working species identification systems are more challenging than in zzso zzso In cryptic species complexes the performance of a potential zzso marker can not be monitored using zzso characters as a feedback, but an inappropriate choice of DNA region may result in zzso species trees for several zzso Therefore a zzso knowledge of the zzso of a group is zzso In addition to identification of known species, methods for an automatic zzso of species with DNA zzso have been zzso The zzso provide a mixture of systematically well characterized as well as badly characterized groups and are used in this study to test the suitability of some of the methods for zzso As species identification method the performance of blast in searches against badly to zzso reference databases has been tested with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A to D of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso In addition the performance of two different methods for automatic species zzso fixed thresholds of genetic divergence and the general mixed zzso model zzso have been zzso The study demonstrates some pitfalls of zzso methods that have to be taken care zzso Also a zzso approach towards establishing a DNA zzso system in zzso is zzso
