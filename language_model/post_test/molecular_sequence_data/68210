The structure of zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso was investigated by two-dimensional zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso The zzso and zzso chemical shift assignments are largely complete, and a preliminary structural characterization is zzso The protein consists of five zzso that form a single zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso are connected by several extended zzso and two of these contain zzso types that are frequently seen in the zzso sites of zzso Additionally, two point zzso that affect zzso resistance, zzso zzso and zzso assembly are located in these two regions of the zzso Since these potential zzso sites are distributed over a large surface of the zzso it appears that the zzso may interact with several regions of zzso zzso
