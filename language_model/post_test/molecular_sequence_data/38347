A zzso zzso study of human transforming growth factor alpha zzso in complex with the zzso growth factor zzso zzso domain zzso provided an effective method for zzso the relative contributions of the zzso of the zzso to its affinity for the zzso In conjunction with previously obtained zzso data, these results indicate that while a large number of zzso are involved in complex formation and make up the binding zzso a small subset contribute most of the binding zzso They also show that while the zzso which contribute to zzso binding are localized on one face of the zzso the specific zzso that play the major role in the affinity of zzso in the complex are in two distinct regions of zzso This suggests that two small functional zzso each composed of two zzso exist within a larger structural zzso presented on the binding zzso These results give the most detailed picture to date of the zzso binding zzso and yield further insight into the formation of the zzso zzso
