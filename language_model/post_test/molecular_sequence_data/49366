A zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso shows zzso similarity to the zzso zzso collagen zzso zzso over the entire protein and is more similar to zzso zzso and zzso similarity with zzso A and B zzso zzso than to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which shares zzso with zzso only in the A zzso Despite the detection of zzso in 32 out of 32 zzso zzso zzso only 11 of these (all clinical zzso including four zzso zzso zzso and seven other zzso exhibited binding to collagen type I zzso Although zzso from three zzso zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso showed zzso identity, analysis of zzso genes and their promoter regions from six zzso strains identified deletions or zzso that introduced stop zzso and/or IS elements within the gene or the promoter region in five out of six zzso suggesting that the presence of an intact functional zzso gene is necessary for binding of zzso zzso strains to zzso zzso zzso A domain showed specific and zzso binding to zzso and this protein zzso with zzso zzso binding to immobilized zzso zzso with the adherence zzso and sequence data, probing with zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso A zzso rabbit serum confirmed the surface expression of zzso in three out of three zzso clinical zzso of zzso zzso tested, but in none of the strains with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Introduction of a functional zzso gene into two zzso natural zzso zzso strains zzso a zzso zzso further confirming that native zzso is sufficient for the binding of zzso zzso to zzso These results demonstrate that zzso which encodes a potential zzso factor, is functional only in certain zzso clinical zzso of zzso zzso and suggest that zzso is the primary zzso responsible for the ability of zzso zzso to bind zzso
