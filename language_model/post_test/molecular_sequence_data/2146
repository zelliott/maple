The zzso for a widely distributed neuroendocrine protein called zzso has been cloned from beta cell tumors of transgenic mice and zzso As deduced from the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein of 186 zzso zzso nearly identical to its human and zzso zzso The presence of several pairs of basic zzso in the zzso terminal portion of the protein suggests that zzso can undergo zzso maturation in zzso zzso and thus generate potential zzso zzso zzso zzso is about zzso zzso long and is apparently transcribed from a single gene per zzso zzso The use of zzso promoters to express zzso in rare cell types of transgenic mice is a powerful tool for zzso and expansion of these cells, and it zzso the isolation and the study of rare proteins such as zzso
