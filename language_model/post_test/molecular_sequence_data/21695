zzso require the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in their zzso domain repeating sequence zzso to function properly as a main structural component of the zzso zzso in animals at zzso relevant zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a specific zzso zzso zzso as a zzso processing zzso 

A zzso human collagen type I zzso zzso with high percentage of zzso zzso zzso was produced in transgenic zzso seeds when zzso with both the zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso human zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso using zzso zzso gene promoter resulted in an average yield of 12 zzso seed for the full-length zzso in seeds without zzso of zzso and 4 zzso seed for the zzso zzso in seeds with zzso of zzso zzso mass zzso zzso analysis revealed that nearly half of the zzso repeating triplets in zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso line had the Pro zzso changed to zzso zzso The zzso analysis determined the zzso content of zzso zzso as zzso which is comparable to the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso and the native human zzso zzso zzso The increased zzso percentage was correlated with a markedly enhanced zzso stability of zzso zzso when compared to the zzso zzso 

This work shows that zzso has potential to produce adequately modified zzso proteins with zzso zzso modifications that may be require for their use as pharmaceutical and industrial zzso
