During photosynthesis, two zzso centers located in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso I and II zzso and zzso use light energy to mobilize electrons to generate zzso and zzso Different modes of electron flow exist, of which the linear electron flow is driven by zzso and zzso generating zzso and zzso whereas the zzso electron flow zzso only generates zzso and is driven by the zzso zzso Different environmental and zzso conditions require the adjustment of zzso ratios and a switch of electron distribution between the two zzso With the exception of zzso other components zzso zzso are zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso a zzso protein present in zzso of zzso zzso Plants lacking zzso show zzso of zzso similar to zzso zzso We find that zzso and zzso interact physically and associate with zzso We therefore propose that the zzso complex zzso zzso in zzso
