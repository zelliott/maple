The chick type III collagen gene contains an internal promoter in zzso 23 in addition to the promoter preceding zzso zzso The internal promoter, which is used zzso in cultured zzso directs production of an alternative transcript that cannot zzso type III zzso This promoter is used zzso in skin zzso which transcribe the gene from the upstream zzso We show below that the internal promoter is regulated by an zzso element containing a potential zzso protein 1 zzso site and a zzso element containing a potential binding site for leader binding protein 1 zzso zzso mobility shift zzso indicate that the zzso and zzso elements are bound by zzso and an zzso zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso site resulted in substantially decreased promoter activity in both zzso and zzso indicating that this site is required for promoter function, but the low level of promoter activity in zzso is not due to loss of functional zzso In contrast, replacement of the zzso site increased activity only in zzso suggesting that this site is responsible in part for repression of promoter activity in zzso
