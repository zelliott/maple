Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the small zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis have zzso identity at the zzso acid level and are both highly zzso with zzso zzso zzso The calculated molecular masses of zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of crude zzso tuberculosis extracts indicates that both zzso are expressed in zzso zzso zzso is zzso active when zzso with pure zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso for zzso reduction up to 2 and 1 zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso is not linked to zzso nor is either gene linked to the gene zzso the large zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso The gene zzso zzso was found downstream from zzso and the gene zzso alcohol zzso was found downstream from zzso A zzso strain of zzso coli zzso could be zzso by simultaneous transformation with zzso tuberculosis zzso and zzso An zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso in which the zzso for the zzso necessary zzso was replaced by the zzso zzso did not complement zzso when zzso with zzso tuberculosis zzso Similarly, zzso tuberculosis zzso and zzso did not complement zzso zzso of zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso was inhibited by zzso the zzso with a zzso corresponding to the 7 zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis is a species in which a zzso system appears to zzso the biologically active species of zzso and also the only bacterial species identified so far in which class I zzso zzso are not arranged on an zzso
