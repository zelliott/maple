The zzso zzso family of zzso signaling proteins is responsible for zzso patterning in a variety of systems, including the neural tube, limbs and zzso Within the neural tube, at the level of the spinal cord, products of the zzso gene sonic zzso zzso are proposed to function as a zzso patterning influence, with the capability of inducing floor plate and motor zzso 

We report the isolation of zzso zzso zzso a novel member of the zzso zzso gene zzso Both zzso and zzso are expressed in the zzso zzso of the embryonic zzso neural tube and brain, but zzso expression becomes limited to the neural tube, whereas zzso is also expressed in the zzso Both genes are expressed in the developing brain, in zzso that include a discrete region in the floor of the zzso located between the sites of the future zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso as markers of zzso fate within the developing eye, we found that zzso expression of either zzso gene promoted zzso fates and suppressed zzso zzso In contrast, zzso fates were lost in zzso zzso zzso which lack zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso proteins undergo zzso processing in zzso a zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso product was sufficient to carry out all signaling activities associated with zzso in eye and brain zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso signals zzso by members of the zzso gene family, emanating from the zzso zzso of the neural tube, not only play important roles in zzso patterning of the brain but also appear to constitute an early patterning activity along the zzso axis of the developing zzso
