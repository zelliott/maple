The purpose of this study was to assess zzso the expression of zzso molecules by human retinal zzso zzso zzso and to study their regulation by inflammatory zzso These molecular events and the role played by inflammatory zzso are important for selective zzso trafficking into the eye during zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso zzso zzso by early passage human zzso cells was assessed by flow zzso In addition, the regulation of the expression of these molecules by the inflammatory zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso and zzso gamma zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used to characterize further zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso analysis determined that zzso was zzso expressed on zzso cell lines and that in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso there was a median fold increase in expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, flow zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso indicated that these zzso molecules were not zzso expressed at the cell surface; only the expression of zzso was zzso by the presence of zzso The results of zzso on zzso cells indicated that zzso for all the zzso molecules was present zzso in some zzso zzso After zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the number of zzso cell lines expressing all the zzso molecules zzso 

zzso expression is markedly zzso by inflammatory zzso Although zzso for other zzso molecules is expressed in zzso cells and is enhanced by inflammatory zzso this does not necessarily reflect the cell surface protein zzso Thus, the expression of zzso molecules by zzso cells, and the subsequent recruitment of specific zzso may be determined by the local zzso zzso
