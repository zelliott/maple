Fluorescent and zzso zzso of mast cell zzso zzso zzso were zzso and the labels zzso and zzso were zzso at position 1 in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso with these zzso retained zzso activity as high as that of the parent zzso zzso in rat zzso mast cell zzso These labeled zzso were used in rat zzso leukemia cells zzso to demonstrate by zzso zzso and flow zzso the specific binding of zzso zzso to mast cell zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to compete with and inhibit the binding of fluorescent zzso on zzso cells as monitored by flow zzso Thus zzso zzso may prove to be useful in the study of zzso zzso zzso
