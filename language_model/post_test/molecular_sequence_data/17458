The zzso protein has been implicated in a zzso zzso in the zzso but its role in muscle function remains zzso Here, we show that zzso interacts with several zzso zzso proteins including, amongst others, zzso C and the slow zzso of the zzso protein zzso These interactions were confirmed in zzso and because of its central role in skeletal muscle disease, characterized in more detail for zzso zzso A role for zzso in regulating zzso C function in zzso is supported by the expression analysis of zzso C in the zzso zzso mouse zzso where distinct irregular zzso zzso of zzso C was found in zzso of muscle zzso which appears to be a specific outcome of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso shows zzso activity in in zzso zzso and specific degradation of zzso C by zzso is shown in zzso zzso Given the zzso nature of the zzso zzso it is likely that some of the identified partners are zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is an intrinsic part of the protein networks underlying the molecular mechanism of several zzso muscular zzso particularly those where interactions between zzso C and disease causing proteins have been zzso
