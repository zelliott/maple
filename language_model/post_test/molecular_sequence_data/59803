Marine zzso zzso are major contributors to the overall productivity of the zzso The present study indicates that the structural genes of the carbon zzso system are unusually arranged and possess a unique primary structure compared to previously studied zzso Southern zzso analyses of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso DNA zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso large zzso gene from zzso zzso strain zzso as a zzso probe, revealed the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso that was zzso at only low zzso Three complete open reading frames zzso were detected within this zzso Two of these zzso potentially zzso the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso The third ORF, situated immediately upstream from zzso potentially encodes a zzso of the zzso gene from zzso zzso strain zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of each of these zzso are more similar to zzso among the zzso purple bacteria than to existing zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso large and small zzso sequences confirmed an unexpected relationship to sequences from among the zzso purple zzso This is the first instance in which the possibility has been considered that an zzso zzso three genes involved in carbon fixation may have been zzso transferred from a purple zzso Analysis of zzso extracted from cells grown under zzso conditions indicated that zzso zzso and zzso were regulated at the zzso zzso specifically zzso transcripts were highest during the midday period, decreased at later times during the light period and eventually reached a level where they were all but zzso during the dark zzso zzso extension analysis indicated that the zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso
