The zzso zzso B zzso complex regulates gene expression and DNA replication zzso but its activities in zzso have not been thoroughly zzso In zzso zzso zzso cell zzso the largest zzso zzso is a negative regulator of zzso whereas another zzso zzso is a positive zzso Here, we identified a zzso in zzso and generated a zzso in zzso two additional zzso zzso Both zzso were viable, but zzso zzso had many complex zzso including shortened longevity and severe eye zzso zzso zzso females had severely reduced zzso whereas zzso zzso females were zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso for zzso zzso zzso and binding to zzso zzso was dependent on the core factors of the zzso zzso In contrast to the documented zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso males were zzso We zzso zzso complexes from zzso nuclear extracts and identified zzso a new zzso zzso arrest complex that contained zzso zzso the zzso family member, Always early zzso and a zzso family member, zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate that zzso serves diverse roles in different zzso zzso and members of zzso can be found in alternative, zzso complexes in different cell zzso
