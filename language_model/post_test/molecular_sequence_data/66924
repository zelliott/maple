zzso of zzso dynamics is essential to zzso plasticity during development and zzso zzso of these mechanisms may contribute to zzso and neurodegenerative zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso is involved in multiple aspects of zzso function, including regulation of zzso A zzso search identified the zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso in zzso at zzso and zzso previously identified as zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly zzso zzso while zzso and zzso zzso predominantly zzso zzso zzso was zzso at both sites in mouse brain, with higher levels in zzso and zzso zzso knockout mice exhibited decreased zzso zzso During development, zzso and zzso levels peaked at zzso day 7, followed by reduction in total zzso zzso of protein zzso in zzso slices caused an increase in zzso and a decrease in total zzso Interestingly, the prefrontal zzso of schizophrenic patients had increased zzso zzso In contrast, total and zzso zzso were decreased in the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso Thus, zzso regulatory mechanisms involving the zzso of zzso may contribute to zzso synaptic pruning and structural zzso and may be involved in zzso and neurodegenerative zzso
