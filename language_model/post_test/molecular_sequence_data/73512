zzso segments of zzso rod zzso cells contain an abundantly expressed membrane protein that zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 220 zzso by zzso zzso We have zzso the bovine protein by zzso zzso determined its primary structure by zzso cloning and direct zzso sequence analysis, and mapped its distribution in zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The full-length zzso encodes a zzso acid protein zzso molecular mass of zzso zzso consisting of two structurally zzso tandem arranged zzso Each half consists of a zzso domain containing six putative zzso segments followed by an zzso zzso A data base zzso search showed that the rod outer segment zzso protein is zzso identical in zzso acid sequence to the zzso and zzso proteins cloned from a mouse zzso cell zzso zzso labeling with zzso and zzso zzso studies confirmed that both zzso and zzso bind to this protein with similar zzso zzso A labeling and zzso H zzso indicated that the rod outer segment protein contains at least one zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies have revealed that the zzso zzso is distributed along the rim region and zzso of rod outer segment disc zzso From these studies we conclude that the zzso zzso of bovine rod outer segment disc zzso or zzso ABC protein is a new member of the zzso of ABC zzso and is the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso rim zzso
