zzso have been employed extensively to study the zzso zzso zzso and cell biology of the visual system for decades, yet there have been no reports concerning the primary structure of zzso visual zzso zzso Thus, we have determined the entire zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including a putative zzso start point and zzso A tail, by sequence analysis of zzso products and zzso The open reading frame predicts an zzso of 354 zzso six zzso longer than the zzso rod zzso containing 11 potential zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed two transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits approximately zzso identity to zzso zzso at the zzso acid zzso zzso analysis of additional components will produce the framework from which a more detailed understanding of zzso zzso can zzso
