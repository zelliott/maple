zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances host innate zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of this strain lose the zzso A zzso zzso zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed, and nine zzso zzso zzso out of them were zzso Cloning and sequencing analyses identified three independent genes that were disrupted by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso the molecular zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using an in zzso mouse model of zzso infection, only zzso zzso showed zzso in their ability to enhance host innate zzso and zzso of the zzso by introduction of the zzso zzso in the zzso strain recovered the zzso zzso zzso protein exhibited zzso zzso activity when the zzso cell wall extracts of zzso zzso zzso zzso was added as zzso The zzso zzso lost the thick and rigid zzso features that are characteristic to the zzso cells, indicating that zzso of zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is required for the construction of the zzso composition involved in the zzso capacity of zzso zzso zzso zzso
