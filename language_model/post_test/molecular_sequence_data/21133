A zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from human zzso showed high activities of zzso and reduction of zzso based on rapid TLC zzso A zzso strain zzso was identified as a new species showing zzso zzso to zzso species, based on zzso zzso sequence zzso The strain zzso showed zzso activity toward zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso were produced, zzso However, the strain zzso did not react with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Besides, zzso showed zzso zzso activity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting in the formation of corresponding zzso zzso The new zzso of zzso and zzso were characterized by zzso and the absolute zzso of the zzso were determined with CD zzso The kinetic study of the zzso zzso showed both activities were exceptionally fast compared to the reported conversion by other zzso zzso
