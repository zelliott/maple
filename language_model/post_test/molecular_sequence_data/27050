zzso disease zzso is the largest cause of premature death in human populations throughout the zzso zzso plasma zzso levels, specifically high levels of LDL or low levels of zzso are zzso of zzso to zzso The scavenger zzso class B member 1 zzso is the primary zzso for the selective zzso of HDL cholesterol by liver and zzso zzso zzso zzso influences plasma zzso levels and is vital for reverse cholesterol zzso Here we describe the mapping of a novel zzso zzso induced point zzso in the zzso gene identified in a zzso zzso The zzso is located in a highly zzso zzso acid in the zzso loop and leads to the conversion of an zzso to an zzso zzso zzso zzso mice express normal zzso zzso levels and are zzso zzso protein levels are markedly reduced in liver zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso This leads to approximately zzso increased plasma HDL levels due to reduced HDL zzso zzso selective zzso zzso knockout mice have zzso reduction of zzso protein as does this zzso however, in zzso analysis of the zzso indicates that the regulation of zzso protein in this zzso is independent of zzso This new zzso model may help further our understanding of zzso and zzso regulation of zzso that may aid the important clinical goal of raising functional zzso
