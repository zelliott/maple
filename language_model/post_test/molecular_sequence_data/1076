We have cloned and characterized the full-length zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso from zzso grouper zzso zzso It contains zzso zzso with an open reading frame zzso 146 zzso acids with a 20 zzso acid signal zzso The grouper mature zzso has 75, 70, 61, 59, 41, 42 and zzso identities to that of rainbow trout, Atlantic zzso zzso European zzso chicken, mouse and human, zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso was expressed abundantly not only in zzso but also in zzso A more interesting finding is to reveal the differential zzso expressions between the zzso and the transitional zzso or zzso in natural individuals of zzso grouper and zzso grouper zzso zzso and in artificial sex reversal individuals of zzso grouper induced by zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso provided direct evidence that the zzso was transcribed in the germ zzso In the growing zzso the zzso transcripts were concentrated on the zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso expressed zzso cells were found to be zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso This is the first report of a zzso expressed in the zzso of any zzso in addition to the expected expression in the zzso and it expresses more transcripts in the zzso during sex reversal or zzso than in the zzso both in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso identification in germ cells allows us to further investigate the functional roles and the molecular mechanisms in zzso of zzso especially in sex reversal and in zzso
