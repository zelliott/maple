The plasma membrane zzso pump zzso is an essential element in the complex of mechanisms that maintain low zzso zzso concentration in the living zzso This pump is tightly regulated by zzso through binding to a high affinity zzso domain at the C zzso that also serves as an zzso of the zzso zzso of the C zzso of zzso the most widely distributed form of zzso revealed a zzso consensus sequence zzso just a few zzso upstream of the zzso zzso We demonstrate here that, in the early phase of zzso zzso is zzso at zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso cells or in zzso cells that naturally express this zzso This zzso of zzso produces a single zzso zzso that is fully active in the absence of zzso because the whole zzso region downstream of the zzso sequence is zzso Our experiments show that zzso or a zzso zzso is responsible for the formation of the zzso active zzso zzso zzso 1) zzso of the cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso was able to block the production of the zzso zzso 2) In zzso treatment of zzso with zzso zzso also generated a zzso zzso product, consistent with that seen in cells undergoing zzso 3) zzso in which the zzso consensus sequence was altered zzso zzso and zzso zzso were resistant to zzso Based on these data, we conclude that zzso is a newly identified, natural zzso zzso We suggest that a zzso active form of this zzso responding much faster to an increase in zzso concentration than the zzso form, may have an important role in regulating zzso zzso concentration in the zzso zzso
