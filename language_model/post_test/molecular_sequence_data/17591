The DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso An open reading frame of 999 zzso was zzso The primary structure of zzso was deduced and analysis revealed the presence of a signal sequence of 22 zzso acid zzso The mature protein contains 311 zzso acid zzso (Mr zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso showed similarity with the zzso major zzso zzso A specific mouse zzso against zzso was prepared by constructing and zzso a hybrid zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso and zzso revealed a pool of zzso in the zzso of zzso cells and zzso zzso that zzso is a minor component of zzso zzso present at the top and in or along the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso this zzso produced all zzso zzso except zzso but produced zzso of the zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic observations showed that cells defective in zzso produce only a few (apparently zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, was supposed to play a role in initiation and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments involving zzso zzso material showed that zzso is not required for binding of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso produced by an zzso strain carrying a zzso in the zzso major zzso zzso were shown to contain a normal amount of zzso
