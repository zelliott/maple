To test whether zzso gene zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso many vascular diseases, including zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso decreases expression of the zzso zzso factor zzso By using human zzso vein zzso cells zzso we showed that zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso 8 zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of the zzso promoter, nuclear factor zzso activity, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was also inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso binds to the zzso zzso promoter region, which contains 7 putative zzso binding zzso To test the zzso role of zzso in zzso we used a zzso model of zzso acute zzso The injection of zzso into the paw decreased zzso inflammation compared with zzso Finally, zzso of human coronary plaques showed loss of zzso expression from the zzso zzso active plaque zzso 

We have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso factor zzso this zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inflammation in zzso These results suggest a novel approach to zzso zzso
