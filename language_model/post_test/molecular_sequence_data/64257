A zzso zzso protein of the zzso zzso but with an unusually high molecular mass of 28 zzso has previously been identified and zzso to zzso in a zzso scheme for resolution of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso green algae, zzso zzso An apparently analogous protein of 26 zzso was described in a zzso zzso zzso but no such large zzso species f exists in the zzso profiles of higher zzso The structure of the 28 zzso zzso which had been zzso to represent a zzso or fusion product of the two more zzso common zzso zzso f and m has now been determined by zzso acid zzso Although it exhibits virtually all the properties and zzso activities of a zzso proper this zzso zzso surprisingly, does not belong to the zzso family of small zzso proteins but is identical with zzso zzso evolving zzso protein 1, an auxiliary component of the zzso II zzso zzso zzso of Chlorella zzso and zzso zzso also contain zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso capable of specifically stimulating zzso zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso protein 1 from spinach is not able to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso from spinach zzso A dual function of the zzso protein in zzso photosynthesis is zzso
