The zzso zzso spectrum of the the cyanide zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso c zzso in the oxidized form has been assigned through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso out of a total of zzso have been zzso The solution structure, the first of a zzso zzso zzso was determined using zzso meaningful zzso constraints out of a total of zzso measured zzso The zzso values at the stage of restrained energy zzso of 17 structures obtained from distance geometry calculations are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A for the backbone and all heavy zzso zzso The quality, in terms of zzso of the present structure is the same as that obtained for the solution structure of the zzso horse heart zzso c zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 33, zzso The secondary structure elements and the overall folding in the zzso are observed to be the same as those of the zzso protein for which the X-ray structure is zzso However, the replacement of the zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso creates a zzso zzso zzso The properties of the zzso cavity seen in this solution structure are compared to those of other zzso zzso
