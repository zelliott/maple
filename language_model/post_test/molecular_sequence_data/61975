In this study, we examined the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso light chain zzso A zzso using zzso active zzso protein zzso zzso as a surrogate zzso zzso zzso was zzso at zzso by zzso active zzso protein zzso zzso resulting in an approximately zzso increase in zzso activity, using intact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II regulatory light chain and zzso were also readily zzso by activated zzso Mass zzso analysis revealed that zzso expressed by zzso coli was zzso at zzso and that, subsequent to zzso zzso zzso also underwent a slow rate of zzso at multiple zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso at zzso is required for efficient zzso and zzso by an upstream zzso By performing zzso zzso analysis on a series of zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso function as an zzso domain and that zzso is fully relieved by zzso zzso zzso removal of this region resulted in a significant increase in the zzso of zzso however, it did not generate maximum zzso zzso Together with the results of our kinetic analysis of the zzso these findings demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso by an upstream zzso subsequent to zzso at zzso results in generation of maximum zzso activity through both release of an zzso domain from its zzso core and a further increase zzso in the zzso of the zzso
