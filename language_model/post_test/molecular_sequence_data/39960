zzso zzso virus infections can be treated with a number of drugs, but as for all zzso there is a constant need for new zzso In the search for lead compounds some peptides have proven to possess an zzso effect, but it is still unclear what mechanisms are responsible for this zzso We wish to report on the use of principal properties of zzso acids for developing quantitative zzso relationships zzso as a tool for zzso zzso activity and predicting the activity of new zzso In order to test the reliability of the method, new peptides have been designed by using zzso methodology, zzso and tested for a number of zzso Two of the new peptides zzso were active at lower zzso than experienced before regarding entry and zzso zzso virus activity, but they were not able to completely inhibit viral zzso This may reflect differences in mode of action of peptides depending on the zzso acid zzso
