The small G protein zzso has been zzso in complex with zzso zzso and zzso The zzso complex is the first structure of a small G protein with its natural zzso zzso It shows that the zzso group of zzso forms a hydrogen bond with the zzso of zzso and with zzso This interaction does not exist in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso in many small G zzso which probably also form this hydrogen bond with zzso In addition, zzso is structurally equivalent to a zzso zzso that binds zzso in zzso G zzso The actual participation of zzso in zzso zzso is not yet clear, but several possible roles are zzso The zzso changes between the zzso and zzso complexes are located essentially in the switch I and II regions as described for the related zzso zzso However, the mobile segments vary in length and in the zzso of zzso This suggests that even though similar regions might be involved in the zzso cycle of small G zzso the details of the changes will be different for each G protein and will ensure the specificity of its interaction with a given set of cellular zzso
