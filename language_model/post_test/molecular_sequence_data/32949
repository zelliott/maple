zzso proteins produced using zzso DNA technologies are generally complex, heterogeneous, and subject to a variety of zzso or chemical modifications during zzso zzso and long-term zzso The use of mass zzso zzso for the evaluation of zzso protein sequence and structure provides detailed information regarding zzso acid modifications and sequence zzso that have the potential to affect the safety and activity of therapeutic protein zzso General zzso approaches for the characterization of zzso therapeutic protein products will be reviewed with particular attention given to the standard zzso tools available in most biotechnology zzso A number of recent examples will be used to illustrate the utility of zzso strategies for evaluation of zzso protein zzso resulting from zzso modifications zzso sequence variations generated from zzso or zzso zzso and degradation products which are formed during processing or final product zzso zzso attention will be given to the zzso characterization of zzso zzso as a model system for large, zzso zzso zzso zzso examples highlighting the use of zzso for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mapping will be used to illustrate the application of these techniques to a wide variety of zzso therapeutic protein zzso The potential use of zzso to support the selection of cell zzso selection and zzso development for therapeutic zzso products will also be zzso
