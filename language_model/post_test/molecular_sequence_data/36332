The major zzso domain of zzso contained in the third variable region zzso of the external zzso is highly variable at positions zzso a zzso zzso zzso We investigated the relation between zzso sequences of zzso zzso circulating in a host and that zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso sequences were obtained directly, via zzso and subsequent zzso from serum zzso or cellular DNA from 26 individuals (from 12 around zzso Then, specificity of zzso from these individuals to a panel of zzso peptides was zzso The specificity zzso recognized zzso of the early zzso response accurately reflected the virus population circulating around zzso in zzso individuals and zzso zzso zzso A change in serum specificity at later stages of infection was rare: five years after zzso only 3 of 46 individuals had a specificity that differed completely from that in the first zzso However, the zzso domain of the virus does change over time, as evidenced by the poor correlation between zzso sequences obtained late in infection and zzso zzso zzso at the same time zzso Thus, in contrast to the accurate zzso response to zzso zzso early after infection, generally a specific response to zzso emerging at later stages seemed to be absent or of low zzso Instead, the early response appeared to be zzso Finally, we made use of the observed accurate reflection to analyze the variation for the zzso domain of zzso in the Netherlands by probing zzso of early zzso from 129 Dutch zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was found in zzso to zzso in zzso and to zzso in zzso of these Dutch zzso
