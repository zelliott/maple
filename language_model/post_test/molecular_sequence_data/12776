The zzso zzso encodes a membrane zzso protein with intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso differentiation or migration among different cell zzso The present study provides evidence that zzso plays an important role in the cell differentiation rather than in cell proliferation in zzso zzso We found that normal human zzso and a limited number of melanoma cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines, expressed the zzso gene together with zzso and zzso zzso When exposed to zzso stimulating hormone, these three cell lines also showed an increased zzso zzso zzso By zzso these cells with 20 zzso of stem cell factor zzso which is a zzso of zzso zzso we found a transient increase of zzso activity 2-4 h zzso indicating an early response of zzso zzso either by zzso zzso protein expression or by zzso protein modification zzso zzso However, Western zzso analysis using zzso zzso suggested that there was no change of zzso protein expression between zzso and zzso zzso We therefore suggest that protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso
