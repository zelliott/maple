The zzso gene is a zzso factor required in numerous species for major zzso steps zzso limb development, boundary zzso and its evolution is known to be closely related to the evolution of the zzso body zzso zzso exhibit numerous zzso peculiarities among zzso such as a direct development, a complex sensory and nervous system zzso brain, giant zzso a reduced zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso We assessed a potential recruitment of zzso in the development of these derived traits and examined the expression pattern of zzso during the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was detected at the margin of the prospective internal zzso which is consistent with studies on zzso having an external shell and confirms a zzso role of zzso in zzso the zzso shell zzso Interestingly, unexpected patterns were early detected in the emerging arms, funnel and zzso zzso and latter in tentacles and eye zzso We also identified an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which provides new evidence that zzso in zzso is not restricted to a zzso zzso and has been recruited in the zzso lineage for the emergence of zzso zzso in zzso
