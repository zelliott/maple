We report the identification and zzso of a new inflammatory zzso zzso by the zzso tumor cell line zzso zzso in response to zzso This zzso which we term zzso inflammatory zzso zzso is a zzso with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 8,000 zzso on zzso but forms zzso of greater than 2 zzso zzso zzso as assessed by gel zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence data reveal no significant zzso with any previously described zzso Although the zzso is zzso under zzso conditions, it is one of two major zzso proteins that bind to zzso at high salt zzso At 100 zzso or greater, zzso is zzso for human zzso cells and triggers hydrogen zzso zzso zzso injection of 10 zzso or greater of zzso into zzso of zzso mice elicits an inflammatory response, characterized by zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso is an zzso zzso that may play a role in the host responses that occur during zzso and other inflammatory zzso
