zzso types of linear zzso and DNA autonomously replicating genetic elements exist in zzso and zzso zzso yet linear elements that replicate by reverse zzso have not been zzso Here, we report the sequence and organization of two linear zzso plasmids of the zzso plant pathogen zzso zzso and the characterization of a zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso in length and have a zzso zzso structure, which includes a terminal hairpin and a zzso iteration of a 5 zzso sequence at the other zzso The zzso replication cycle involves novel strategies for copying terminal zzso which may provide clues concerning the origin of zzso as well as the evolution of linear zzso
