zzso pollution contains a rich and diverse community of bacteria derived from animals and humans, many of which might serve as alternatives to the traditional zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso We used zzso parallel sequencing zzso of the zzso zzso gene to characterize microbial communities from wastewater treatment plant zzso zzso sewage from 12 cities geographically distributed across the zzso We examined members of the zzso which included the families zzso zzso and zzso for their potential as sewage zzso zzso was one of the most abundant groups of zzso bacteria in zzso and several zzso zzso sewage zzso occurred in at least 46 of 48 human zzso zzso zzso libraries targeting zzso zzso zzso in sewage samples demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso the previously reported zzso zzso We used zzso to profile the zzso zzso within zzso and found zzso comprised of 24 zzso components that showed patterns of host zzso These findings suggest that indicators based on zzso might have the capacity to discriminate between different zzso pollution zzso Development of zzso alternative indicators would enhance water quality zzso which leads to improved zzso health and reduced human health risk due to zzso zzso
