The zzso receptors for the neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso channels that mediate zzso zzso The functional diversity of these receptors comes from the use of a large repertoire of zzso zzso by separate zzso as well as from differences in zzso composition of individual zzso In zzso a majority of zzso zzso zzso genes are located in gene clusters that may be important for their regulated expression and zzso We have established a high-resolution physical map of the cluster of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and specific sequence zzso for all three zzso zzso zzso genes have been used to initiate the construction of a zzso zzso of bacterial artificial zzso zzso encompassing this zzso In the process of zzso construction clones from zzso and zzso zzso libraries were zzso The assembled zzso zzso consisting of 45 zzso gives five- to zzso coverage over the gene cluster and provides an average resolution of one marker every 32 zzso A number of zzso insert ends were zzso generating 30 new sequence tag sites zzso in addition to 6 zzso zzso and 3 expressed sequence tag zzso zzso zzso from, and zzso the zzso gene cluster were mapped in the zzso mouse radiation hybrid zzso The integration of the zzso zzso with a map of zzso ordered by radiation hybrid mapping suggested the most likely zzso orientation of this cluster on mouse zzso 5: zzso zzso This established zzso will serve as a template for zzso sequencing and for functional analysis of the zzso gene cluster on mouse zzso 5 and the corresponding region on human zzso zzso
