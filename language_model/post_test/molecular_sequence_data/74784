The zzso acid zzso degradation zzso consists of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and is essential for the development and functionality of the nervous system in zzso while little is known on its role in zzso In this study we report the gene zzso zzso cloning and zzso functional expression of a zzso from the cattle tick zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso and the insect model zzso zzso zzso which have one zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses several gene zzso One representative of these genes has been functionally expressed in zzso zzso This zzso cattle tick protein has potent zzso zzso activity, but possesses also marked zzso activity on other zzso and aromatic zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso kinetic properties as well as zzso and inhibitor zzso with those of a zzso zzso zzso reveals overall similarities, but also subtle differences, that may be exploited for the design of specific zzso with selective zzso zzso
