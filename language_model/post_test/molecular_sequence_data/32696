zzso membrane protein zzso is one of the zzso virus zzso proteins consistently expressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso have been used in patients with zzso to induce zzso T cell lines which have been in turn zzso for zzso mapping of T cell zzso However, comprehensive mapping of naturally recognized zzso zzso in non zzso individuals has not been zzso Here, we applied a low sensitivity zzso technique for the identification of zzso zzso responses zzso ex zzso in zzso zzso This screening tool has been previously validated by analyzing memory zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso and the melanoma associated zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso from ten Caucasian and ten Chinese individuals were zzso ex zzso with pools of zzso zzso peptides overlapping in a zzso fashion each single zzso acid of the zzso zzso No obvious differences were observed between the immune response of the two ethnic groups save for those related to the divergence in the ethnic prevalence of zzso zzso Several novel and known zzso zzso were zzso zzso toward at least one zzso zzso was detected in 18 of the 20 donors but no prevalent human zzso zzso zzso combination was observed confirming that zzso zzso in the context of common zzso zzso is more zzso than that of zzso and zzso We believe that the usefulness of these zzso occurring naturally in zzso bearing patients as zzso for the zzso of patients with early or advanced stage zzso deserves further zzso
