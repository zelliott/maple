We have characterized two related zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to genes from zzso zzso the expression of which is zzso induced by low, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso small (54 zzso zzso highly zzso proteins that bear two potential zzso zzso They show similarity to proteins zzso by genes from barley zzso zzso zzso and wheatgrass zzso zzso that are regulated by different stress zzso Their high level of sequence zzso zzso and their zzso location in a single restriction zzso suggest that both genes originated as a result of a tandem zzso However, their regulatory sequences have zzso enough to zzso on them different expression zzso Like most of the zzso plant genes zzso the expression of zzso and zzso is also promoted by zzso acid zzso and zzso but is not a general response to stress conditions, since it is not induced by salt stress or by zzso Furthermore, low temperatures are able to induce zzso and zzso expression in zzso and zzso genetic backgrounds, indicating that both zzso and zzso pathways regulate the zzso responsiveness of these two zzso
