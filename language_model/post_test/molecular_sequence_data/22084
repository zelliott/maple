Cell culture work has identified the tumor zzso zzso as a component of the zzso checkpoint control system, while in zzso studies of this role of zzso in zzso systems were zzso Here, we describe zzso zzso in the DNA zzso delta zzso zzso 1, based on the zzso cloning of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso display specific defects in late zzso zones, such as eyes, brain and zzso elements of the visceral head zzso where cells display compromised DNA zzso followed by zzso and partial or complete loss of affected zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso leads to a striking rescue of all zzso traits, including completion of zzso survival of cells, and normal differentiation and tissue zzso This indicates that under zzso conditions, the zzso branch of the zzso checkpoint is responsible for eliminating stalled cells that, given more time, would have otherwise finished their normal zzso zzso
