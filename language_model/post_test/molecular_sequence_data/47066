zzso and zzso 2 are the only pancreatic zzso with zzso that remain attached to the active zzso via a zzso zzso It is zzso although not zzso that these zzso are functionally important in the active zzso as well as in the zzso A zzso zzso was constructed to test this hypothesis, but it was demonstrated that the lack of the zzso had no effect on the zzso efficiency, zzso zzso or folding of the protein zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we investigate the role of the zzso zzso in the zzso stability of zzso We compare the zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso in their zzso zzso and active zzso zzso The zzso exhibited a substantially increased sensitivity to heat zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a faster loss of activity at extremes of pH relative to those of their zzso zzso From zzso zzso zzso experiments, we determined that zzso linked zzso provides about 24 zzso of free energy of extra stabilization zzso In addition, the zzso zzso lacked the normal resistance to zzso by zzso This may also explain zzso keeping the zzso zzso the evolutionary conservation of the zzso zzso zzso fluorescence, circular zzso zzso and activity zzso suggest that the zzso of zzso restricts the relative mobility between the two zzso of the zzso In pancreatic zzso zzso such as zzso that lose the zzso upon zzso this function appears to be accomplished via alternative zzso zzso
