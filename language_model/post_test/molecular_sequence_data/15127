Members of the zzso box O zzso family of zzso factors are key regulators of cellular responses, but their function in the immune system remains incompletely zzso Here we showed that T zzso deletion of zzso gene in mice led to spontaneous T cell zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso production, and the induction of inflammatory zzso disease in a transfer zzso In addition, zzso was critical for the maintenance of zzso T cells in the peripheral zzso zzso zzso analyses of T cells identified zzso genes zzso among others, zzso zzso signaling zzso and nuclear factors that control gene zzso zzso studies validated zzso zzso as a zzso target gene essential for zzso maintenance of zzso T zzso These findings reveal crucial functions of zzso zzso in control of T cell zzso and zzso
