The zzso zzso gene product is a zzso protein that functions as a zzso of zzso signals in several zzso zzso zzso Two other zzso zzso zzso by the genes Delta and zzso genetically and zzso behave as zzso zzso All these proteins share the presence of zzso growth factor zzso repeats in their zzso zzso The zzso protein has 36 zzso repeats, 2 of which, numbers 11 and 12, are required for the interaction with the Delta and zzso zzso We have isolated and zzso characterized a zzso zzso in its zzso and zzso domain that behaves genetically as both a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso This zzso zzso carries a zzso substitution in the zzso zzso repeat zzso The zzso zzso interacts with other zzso zzso such as zzso and split and with zzso in the zzso genes Delta and zzso The basis for the genetic zzso of zzso seems to reside in the zzso of zzso zzso products into zzso zzso zzso and/or the zzso of Delta products into zzso zzso zzso
