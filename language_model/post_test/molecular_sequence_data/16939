The zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso the function of diverse immune and zzso zzso Here, we examine the zzso structural changes associated with zzso gene zzso by zzso and differentiated zzso T zzso zzso T cells lack zzso I hypersensitive zzso sites in the vicinity of the zzso zzso whereas differentiated T cells display a strong 3' zzso HS site as well as several zzso zzso The majority of HS sites map to regions that are strongly zzso in sequence between mouse and human zzso In committed zzso cells, the mechanism of zzso gene zzso is associated with the development of repressive zzso modifications near the zzso promoter and also near zzso hypersensitive regions of the zzso zzso Our results constitute the first report of zzso structural differences within the zzso gene in differentiated zzso and zzso cells and emphasize the surprising diversity of mechanisms used to regulate zzso gene expression at the zzso zzso
