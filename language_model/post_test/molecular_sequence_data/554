zzso zzso has been widely used in chemical manufacturing processes and as a zzso Due to its resistance to biological degradation, zzso has mainly accumulated in freshwater bodies and agricultural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria that are capable of degrading zzso were previously isolated from river zzso Yet there is limited knowledge about the zzso diversity, and activity of this zzso in the zzso This study focused on the molecular analysis of the composition and abundance of active zzso zzso in zzso European river zzso zzso zzso real-time quantitative zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso in combination with zzso statistics were zzso Moreover, a functional gene array was used to determine reductive zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso fluctuations were observed not only in the abundance of zzso zzso but also in the composition of the populations and zzso gene zzso zzso statistics revealed that zzso zzso abundance is primarily affected by spatial differences, whereas species composition is under the influence of several environmental zzso such as seasonal changes, total organic carbon and/or nitrogen content, and zzso zzso This study provides new insight into the natural occurrence and dynamics of active zzso zzso in zzso river zzso
