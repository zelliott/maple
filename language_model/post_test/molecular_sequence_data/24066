zzso zzso zzso is a class I zzso that zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso and zzso using zzso as the specific electron zzso This zzso has a key function in scavenging zzso oxygen species zzso and the protection against toxic effects of zzso in higher plants, algae, and zzso Here we report the identification of an zzso zzso family in rice and propose a molecular evolutionary relationship between the diverse zzso zzso In rice, the zzso gene family has eight members, which zzso two zzso two putative zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were conducted using all zzso protein sequences available in the zzso zzso The results indicate that the different zzso zzso arose by a complex evolutionary process involving several gene zzso The structural organization of zzso genes also reflects this process and provides evidence for a close relationship among proteins located in the same zzso zzso A molecular evolutionary pathway, in which zzso and zzso zzso zzso early from zzso ones, is zzso
