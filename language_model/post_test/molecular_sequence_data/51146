A new approach for the analysis of hotspots of zzso is zzso It is based on the zzso of hotspot site zzso Using this approach, the zzso zzso and zzso of hotspot sites were revealed in the V zzso zzso between zzso zzso and these zzso is investigated by the statistical weight method in 323 zzso zzso in 14 V zzso Assuming the absence of any zzso the probability of observing such data in the sample would be very low zzso These results support the idea that emergence of zzso zzso is significantly influenced by zzso base zzso This idea was also supported by the analysis of 296 zzso zzso in zzso sequences of V zzso It is supposed that this influence is an important feature of zzso zzso
