A zzso of zzso B virus zzso having a specific zzso within the S gene has been found to zzso zzso To know whether similar zzso were involved in Japan, we analyzed two cases of maternal transmission of zzso in infants zzso with zzso B immune zzso and zzso B zzso DNA clones of zzso S genes were zzso from patients and family members and zzso In one family, the DNA clones from the baby patient had a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of the S zzso whereas those from her mother had no such zzso In the other family, all the DNA clones obtained from the two infected children had the zzso zzso intact, but they had a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of the S zzso causing an zzso acid substitution of zzso for zzso or zzso This same zzso was observed in 12 of 17 clones of DNA obtained from their zzso In comparison with the wild type zzso zzso B surface zzso the two types of S gene zzso either at the zzso or the zzso zzso were associated with a significant decrease in the zzso of some zzso on the zzso B surface zzso measured by zzso zzso acid substitution at these sites, therefore, would have induced the escape from conventional vaccines that were S gene products of wild type zzso and also from zzso B immune zzso whose main components were probably also zzso against the S gene products expressed by wild type zzso
