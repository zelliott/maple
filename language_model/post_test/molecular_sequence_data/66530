zzso zzso of the ABC family facilitate the export of diverse zzso drugs across cell zzso This is clinically relevant, as zzso cells may become resistant to agents used in zzso To understand the molecular basis of this process, we have determined the zzso A crystal structure of a bacterial ABC zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso protein consists of 12 zzso zzso in an arrangement that is consistent with zzso studies and electron microscopic imaging of the human zzso resistance protein zzso but critically different from that reported for the bacterial zzso zzso zzso The observed, zzso zzso reflects the zzso state, with the two zzso zzso in close contact and the two zzso zzso forming a central zzso the drug zzso zzso is zzso from the inner leaflet of the zzso zzso and from the zzso but exposed to the outer leaflet and the zzso zzso
