The zzso zzso zzso of zzso disease virus was isolated by zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso with zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso had occurred at zzso acid zzso freeing the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso retained its zzso and zzso binding activities and reacted with specific zzso zzso showing that the isolated zzso was biologically and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso were obtained in zzso buffer zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and ammonium zzso and belong to the zzso space group zzso with unit cell dimension of approximately a zzso 72 A, b zzso 78 A, and c zzso 198 zzso zzso of zzso grown in the presence of zzso acid zzso were grown in zzso buffer zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and belong to the zzso space groups zzso or zzso with unit cell dimensions of a zzso b zzso zzso A and c zzso zzso The zzso zzso produced in this study zzso X rays to at least zzso resolution, thereby setting the stage for the solution of the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso of a zzso
