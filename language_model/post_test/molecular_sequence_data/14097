zzso zzso clones containing repeated DNA sequences were isolated from the zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso by differential zzso with total zzso DNA and zzso zzso From this survey zzso of the zzso clones appeared to contain repeated zzso zzso analysis led to the identification of a dispersed repetitive DNA zzso It was named zzso element zzso production zzso and appears to be strain specific, since it is absent from other related strains or zzso zzso with zzso restriction fragments indicates an equal distribution of the zzso element in the zzso The copy number was estimated to be between 20 and 30 per zzso zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso from three copies of the zzso element revealed strong conservation of this sequence among all zzso A zzso region exhibits similarities to a repeated sequence from zzso zzso The use of this DNA sequence as a molecular marker for identification of this zzso strain zzso zzso is discussed as is the relevance of repeated DNA sequences for zzso of zzso zzso
