The zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso I and II from the zzso of a solitary zzso zzso zzso were determined after reduction and zzso The results indicated that inhibitor I consists of a single zzso chain with 55 zzso acid zzso and four zzso zzso bridges, whereas inhibitor II is composed of two zzso chains corresponding to a form derived from inhibitor I by zzso at the zzso zzso zzso may be the zzso zzso of these zzso because zzso B treatment destroys most of the zzso activity of inhibitor II but not that of inhibitor zzso
