We report the structure and the functional activity of the promoter region of zzso the gene zzso zzso of class A in the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso was trans zzso to the zzso spliced leader and that zzso was initiated at a cluster of multiple zzso There was neither a zzso nor a zzso box at consensus distances from these zzso zzso sequence comparison of the zzso regions of zzso in zzso zzso and in the related zzso zzso zzso identified four blocks of zzso sequences located within a sequence of zzso zzso upstream from the zzso zzso In zzso expression of zzso reporter genes in zzso cells allowed the determination of a minimal promoter in the first 288 zzso In zzso rescue experiments in zzso the zzso gene containing zzso zzso of zzso zzso region of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso was found to restore a coordinated mobility to the zzso double zzso zzso zzso zzso This showed that the zzso promoter was contained in zzso zzso of the zzso region, and indicated that zzso zzso elements as well as coding sequences of zzso were functionally zzso between the two zzso zzso The pattern of zzso expression was established through zzso of Green Fluorescent zzso reporter gene zzso and showed a major zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that two of the four blocks of zzso sequences act as zzso zzso The zzso block is a zzso zzso responsible for the expression in body wall muscle cells, zzso zzso and zzso muscle zzso Another block of zzso sequence directs expression in zzso muscle cells zzso and three pairs of zzso sensory zzso
