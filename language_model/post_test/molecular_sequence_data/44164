zzso zzso was recently identified as a novel family of bacterial zzso zzso possessing zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso coli gene coding for zzso zzso was isolated from three different strains and the zzso sequence was zzso Multiple alignment of zzso acid sequence revealed that a previously unidentified zzso is most zzso among all bacterial zzso zzso and zzso to the active site in the zzso zzso zzso analysis further supported that zzso zzso is a novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso is indispensable for the zzso activities of zzso zzso Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that the zzso zzso are structurally and functionally related to zzso
