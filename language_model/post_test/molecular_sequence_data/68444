zzso recipients successively develop benign, zzso and zzso skin zzso on zzso zzso It has been suggested that zzso zzso might induce zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso responsible for skin zzso With zzso and zzso zzso we investigated zzso gene zzso at zzso 12 and 61 in 120 zzso zzso from grafted patients, since they could represent a marker of the evolution of benign skin zzso towards zzso in this population; 29 similar skin zzso from zzso patients were also zzso In transplant recipients, we detected zzso at zzso 12 only in zzso zzso skin zzso and zzso zzso zzso No zzso was detected in 11 cases of zzso zzso disease from grafted patients and in zzso and zzso skin samples from control zzso zzso warts exhibited an overall zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso at zzso 12 of zzso gene in grafted and control patients zzso We detected only one zzso at zzso 61 in a zzso zzso Human zzso zzso are thought to be involved in the zzso evolution of zzso disorders in transplant recipients and cooperate with a zzso zzso to induce zzso in zzso The presence of zzso DNA in our series of skin samples from grafted patients showed no correlation with the occurrence of zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso by zzso is rare in zzso zzso from transplant recipients, and is unlikely to play a crucial role in transformation towards zzso in skin zzso among grafted zzso
