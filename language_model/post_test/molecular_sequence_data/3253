zzso zzso factor A zzso is essential for the initiation of zzso and the replication of zzso DNA zzso The zzso region of the rat zzso gene was isolated from rat zzso DNA by extending the zzso sequence of newly identified zzso zzso using zzso Genome zzso The identified rat zzso gene showed little sequence zzso with the upstream region of human zzso No typical zzso or potential nuclear respiratory factor 1 zzso binding site was found, whereas three potential binding sites for zzso and one for zzso were present in the zzso upstream zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region zzso to zzso into rat skeletal muscle zzso cells demonstrated that the promoter activity was 10 times higher than that of control zzso Despite the absence of the zzso consensus binding zzso zzso of human zzso expression zzso increased the zzso promoter activity zzso The gel mobility shift zzso for zzso demonstrated that zzso could bind to the zzso region of the promoter between zzso and zzso The addition of 50 zzso zzso for 24 h increased zzso promoter activity by up to zzso but 100 zzso zzso for 24 h zzso the activity to zzso of the zzso From these results, the sequence presented here is that of authentic rat zzso promoter and it is hoped that it will prove useful in studies of zzso zzso and zzso
