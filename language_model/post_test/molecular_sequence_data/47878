Tight junctions zzso in zzso cells are thought to determine vascular zzso Recently, zzso to zzso were identified as major components of zzso zzso Among these, zzso (also called zzso protein deleted in zzso syndrome zzso was expressed zzso even in zzso lacking zzso zzso suggesting the possible involvement of this zzso species in zzso zzso We then obtained a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso that recognized both zzso and zzso In the brain and zzso zzso zzso with these zzso zzso showed that zzso was exclusively concentrated at zzso borders of zzso cells of all segments of blood vessels, but not at those of zzso zzso zzso electron zzso revealed that zzso was a component of zzso zzso In contrast, in the zzso the zzso signal was restricted to zzso cells of zzso but was zzso in those of veins and zzso In addition, in all other zzso we zzso zzso was specifically detected in zzso cells of some segments of blood vessels, but not in zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso zzso was introduced into mouse L zzso zzso strands were zzso that resembled those in zzso cells in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso These findings indicated that zzso is an zzso zzso component of zzso zzso
