To identify zzso zzso and its adulterants using DNA zzso zzso 

Total zzso DNA was isolated from zzso zzso and its zzso Nuclear DNA zzso sequences were amplified and zzso zzso products were zzso zzso assembly and consensus sequence generation were performed using the zzso zzso zzso The Kimura zzso distances were calculated using software zzso zzso zzso Identification analyses were performed using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso methods, and the secondary structure of the zzso sequence differences between species were zzso 

Different samples of zzso zzso were gathered together and distinguished from its adulterants by NJ zzso The zzso secondary structure showed that zzso zzso could be differentiated obviously from its zzso 

zzso sequence is able to identify zzso zzso and its adulterants correctly, which provides a scientific basis for fast and accurate identification of the zzso
