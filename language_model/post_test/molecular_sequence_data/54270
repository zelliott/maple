We use the zzso zzso zzso zzso to test hypotheses about diversification in the zzso zzso We zzso three zzso genes and one nuclear zzso from all zzso species and used these data to reconstruct zzso trees based on maximum zzso maximum likelihood, and zzso zzso These zzso trees were used to make zzso regarding both the pattern and timing of diversification for the zzso We used the zzso of the zzso zzso of Costa Rica and western Panama as a zzso zzso for zzso divergence times on the zzso tree and compared these results with a standard molecular clock zzso Then, we used likelihood methods to model the rate of zzso Based on our zzso the onset of the zzso radiation predates the zzso which has been predicted to have played a pivotal role in diversification in the Amazon rainforest zzso We found a constant rate of diversification in zzso evolutionary history, and thus no support that events during the zzso caused an increase in zzso We compare our data to other avian zzso to better understand major zzso events in the zzso These comparisons support recurring forest connections between the zzso and Atlantic forests, and the splitting of zzso Andean species after the final zzso of the zzso At the subspecies level, there is evidence for zzso zzso and groups are often separated by major rivers, demonstrating the important role of rivers in causing or maintaining zzso Because some of the results presented here conflict with current zzso of zzso new zzso arrangements are zzso
