A horizontal transmission of a zzso DNA zzso into the germ line of an ancestral zzso gave rise to multiple repeats of zzso DNA, zzso in the zzso We follow zzso evolution in zzso zzso zzso an zzso and its zzso relatives, and show zzso are derived from zzso zzso occur in two families: the zzso family's zzso integrated into the common zzso of three zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso group 4 zzso The zzso family was acquired more recently on zzso 2 in a lineage of zzso zzso the paternal zzso of zzso Both zzso families include individual members that are zzso and zzso Using relative rates of synonymous and zzso zzso zzso we tested for evidence of selection on zzso units and found none within the zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso between zzso and zzso do show a significant excess of synonymous changes, suggesting zzso selection and hence a period of autonomous evolution between zzso and zzso zzso We observe in the zzso family, features of zzso a major new class of putative zzso replicating zzso zzso not found in the zzso family or zzso We speculate that the second integration event, resulting in the zzso family, involved a zzso zzso a zzso and perhaps also zzso Thus our data point towards zzso dynamic interplay between zzso and plant DNA in zzso
