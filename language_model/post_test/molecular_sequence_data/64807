The cauliflower mosaic virus zzso factor zzso interacts with host translation initiation factor 3 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to accomplish translation of zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso is critical for the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso can zzso formation of the zzso complex via competition with zzso for zzso zzso indeed, the zzso and zzso sites on zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso interferes with zzso zzso complex formation during the first initiation zzso zzso zzso of zzso in plant zzso affects only second initiation zzso zzso zzso of zzso in plant zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso of a second zzso These data suggest that zzso enters the host translation machinery at the zzso removal step to stabilize zzso on the translating zzso thereby allowing translation of zzso viral zzso
