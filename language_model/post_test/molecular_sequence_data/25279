zzso factor 1 zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso member of the family of bacterial zzso proteins that includes zzso coli zzso and integration host factor zzso We have initiated a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso to understand better its unique zzso properties and to investigate its zzso zzso We report here the consequences of mutating the putative zzso zzso of zzso At position 61 in its primary zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso in place of the zzso zzso found in all other known members of the zzso zzso Substituting zzso zzso zzso for zzso substantially reduced the zzso affinity and zzso of zzso in zzso whereas the substitution of zzso had no zzso Substituting zzso or zzso for zzso had little effect on the affinity of zzso for zzso DNA, but altered the zzso zzso of zzso complexes in zzso zzso The zzso substitution increased the affinity of the protein for zzso sites on zzso DNA, thus reducing the natural preference of zzso for zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also correlated with decreased zzso yield and zzso regulation of viral protein synthesis in zzso
