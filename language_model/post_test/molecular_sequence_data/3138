To analyze the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso we cloned the zzso gene and its zzso region, determined their molecular organization, and characterized the zzso properties of the core zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene is organized into five zzso one more as its zzso zzso The first two zzso in the zzso gene zzso the DNA sequence that zzso to the first zzso in zzso whereas the last three zzso show zzso organization in the zzso zzso gene and in the zzso zzso We characterized the zzso regulation of the zzso gene in transient zzso using zzso A6 zzso In our zzso system the identified promoter was shown to be zzso active, resulting in a zzso induction of reporter gene zzso zzso analysis of the zzso end of the zzso promoter revealed a minimal zzso element in the sequence from zzso to zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso containing three copies of the defined regulatory element delivered zzso zzso demonstrating its potential for the recruitment of zzso zzso In gel mobility shift zzso we demonstrate binding of zzso zzso nuclear factors to an extended regulatory element from zzso to zzso the specificity of the interaction was proven in competition experiments using different fragments of the zzso zzso By this approach the major site of factor binding was demonstrated to be included in the minimal zzso promoter zzso from zzso to zzso zzso In addition, in transient zzso experiments we could show that this element mediates calcium dependent zzso and increasing zzso of zzso calcium lead to a significant dose dependent zzso of reporter gene zzso
