zzso of a fusion protein composed of zzso zzso and a zzso of growth zzso factor resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies in zzso coli at 37 degrees zzso Among various zzso such as detergents, protein zzso and zzso acid, tested for the ability to zzso the inclusion bodies, zzso acid, zzso zzso acid sodium zzso zzso and zzso showed a strong zzso effect without damaging the zzso zzso zzso acid was useful in terms of preparing zzso zzso since it could be easily removed by zzso and this made it easy to perform the succeeding zzso treatment for cutting out the zzso zzso from the fusion zzso The zzso zzso was zzso by reversed phase zzso from the zzso digest of the zzso acid zzso and its growth zzso activity was zzso However, for obtaining a highly zzso fusion protein itself, zzso of inclusion bodies by zzso was preferred because zzso was the only agent which did not cause serious zzso of the zzso fusion protein after zzso dilution of the extracted inclusion bodies with zzso The fusion protein was highly zzso by means of a zzso affinity zzso
