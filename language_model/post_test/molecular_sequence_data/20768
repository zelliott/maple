In zzso environments there are plenty of zzso belonging to both zzso and zzso zzso These zzso have developed zzso adaptations which comprise the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and the zzso and/or the zzso of organic zzso zzso zzso within the zzso Moreover, to maintain the zzso of the cells zzso enhance the production of zzso zzso and alter the fatty acid composition of the membrane zzso but very little is known about zzso structural changes of the zzso zzso the main constituent of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of zzso zzso The aim of this work is to investigate the chemical structure of these zzso in order to provide insight into the adaptation mechanism of zzso to live at high salt zzso For this, zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso isolated from salt sediments of a saline lake in Cape Russell in the Antarctic continent, was cultivated and the zzso were extracted and zzso The structure of the zzso of the zzso from zzso zzso was determined by chemical analysis, zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was constituted of a linear zzso repeating unit as zzso zzso A comparison among the zzso structures of zzso zzso and other zzso species is also zzso
