zzso zzso zzso microbial communities were enriched with a synthetic zzso mixture zzso of zzso zzso , and CO2 ) or with CO zzso zzso zzso and zzso were incubated and successively transferred with zzso (16 zzso or CO (9 zzso respectively, with increasing CO partial pressures from zzso to zzso Culture zzso after 4 successive transfers with zzso was also incubated with CO and subsequently transferred (9 zzso with solely this zzso - cultures zzso zzso with zzso and CO caused a rapid decrease in the microbial diversity of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed identical microbial composition and were dominated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso initiated with CO resulted in the enrichment of bacteria from the zzso zzso and zzso Methane was detected in the first two to three transfers of zzso but production ceased zzso zzso was the main product formed by zzso and zzso Enriched zzso cultures showed a zzso conversion, in which zzso was formed first and then converted to zzso This research provides insight into how zzso zzso communities develop using zzso as sole energy and carbon source can be steered for specific end products and subsequent microbial synthesis of zzso
