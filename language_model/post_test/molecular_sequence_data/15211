To understand whether bone zzso protein plays any role in the formation of primordial zzso in the zzso we examined the zzso and spatial expression of bone zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and protein in embryonic zzso 13 through zzso day zzso 15 zzso cells and a possible regulation by zzso during the formation of primordial zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were significantly higher than that of zzso throughout zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels increased significantly on zzso and declined by zzso through zzso Whereas zzso zzso increased again by zzso zzso zzso levels increased through zzso concurrent with primordial zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso levels increased greater than zzso on zzso with a further zzso increase by zzso zzso proteins were low in the zzso cells and zzso on zzso but increased progressively during zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells increased markedly on zzso Whereas zzso expression declined by zzso and remained steady thereafter, zzso protein expression zzso until zzso when it became low and zzso Overall, zzso zzso also declined by zzso and then remained low in the zzso cells through zzso zzso zzso treatment on zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso and protein levels by zzso but zzso zzso zzso replacement on zzso reversed the zzso Furthermore, zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso This unique pattern of zzso expression in the zzso and zzso cells during zzso zzso development suggests that zzso may play a regulatory role in primordial zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso may regulate zzso action by modulating the expression of its zzso
