The zzso zzso protein factor zzso which binds upstream of the cluster of the chicken zzso zzso has previously been found to interact with a DNA zzso containing a replication origin and a nuclear zzso binding zzso This protein has been partially zzso Based on its molecular weight and binding zzso zzso belongs to a family of zzso zzso the chicken equivalent of zzso factor zzso An zzso including the binding site for zzso competes for binding of the zzso DNA zzso to the nuclear zzso This indicates an involvement of this protein in the interaction between DNA and the nuclear zzso
