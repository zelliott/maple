zzso zzso in zzso zzso is under genetic control by the A and B zzso Plants containing zzso zzso at both the A and B zzso zzso zzso zzso have lower nicotine levels, reduced nicotine zzso zzso activities, and reduced zzso levels of the corresponding zzso zzso The A and B zzso therefore appear to be coordinate regulators of several nicotine zzso genes and define a group of zzso genes called the zzso zzso To investigate the composition of genes in the zzso zzso a fluorescent differential display zzso screen was used to randomly sample the zzso of wild type and zzso zzso zzso This resulted in the isolation of 64 zzso zzso representing 49 unique genes or gene zzso Four genes associated with nicotine zzso were identified, whereas most of the other zzso clones were zzso with an assortment of stress response zzso zzso genes or gene families showed zzso zzso zzso effects, representing seven distinct zzso expression patterns in response media treatments that increase the zzso levels of known zzso zzso zzso Thus, the A and B zzso regulate the zzso levels of some target genes differently than zzso Eleven genes or gene families showed only zzso effects, representing four zzso zzso zzso These results indicate the zzso zzso is complex network of zzso expressed stress response zzso only a small subset of which are involved in nicotine zzso
