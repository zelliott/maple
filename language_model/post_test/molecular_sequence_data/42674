We have compared the expression patterns of the zzso insulin 1 and 2 genes during prolonged zzso culture of the mouse zzso cell line zzso where transformation by the zzso T zzso is targeted to the differentiated zzso zzso and the rat zzso cell line zzso in which the zzso zzso is induced by transient zzso zzso The zzso clone carries, in addition, a single copy of a zzso silent human insulin gene which contains 3 zzso of regulatory sequences known to zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression was measured by an zzso based on a reverse zzso chain reaction, to determine whether the ancestral zzso insulin 2 genes (and the human zzso in the zzso zzso are regulated differently from the duplicated rat and mouse insulin 1 zzso We have shown that zzso of insulin gene expression in the zzso cells includes zzso zzso of all three zzso but that extended propagation of zzso cells in zzso leads to a selective and equal decline in the quantities of transcripts from the rat 2 and human genes relative to transcripts from the rat 1 zzso In the later passages, insulin transcripts were derived almost exclusively from the rat 1 zzso In early zzso passages of the mouse zzso cell line zzso the expression pattern of the mouse 1 and 2 insulin genes resembled that seen in isolated mouse zzso After more than 45 zzso passages, expression of the duplicated mouse 1 gene decreased tenfold when compared with the ancestral mouse 2 zzso As previously shown for zzso cells, the differential expression of zzso insulin genes in the zzso line was also clearly evident at the cellular level, where a zzso of cells selectively expressed readily zzso levels of mouse zzso 2 zzso while devoid of zzso zzso Our results suggest that the maintenance of insulin gene expression in zzso zzso cells is influenced by zzso sequences which are not shared by the ancestral and duplicated insulin zzso and that either zzso conditions or zzso differences exist between the rat and mouse cell lines that govern which gene remains active during prolonged zzso zzso
