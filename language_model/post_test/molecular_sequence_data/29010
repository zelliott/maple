The zzso zzso zzso is a large zzso protein with a zzso domain at the zzso end that resides in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso membrane and forms the zzso pore of a zzso release zzso Our previous studies showed that zzso expressed in zzso cells localized to the zzso zzso zzso microscopic imaging indicated that the zzso retention signal is likely present within the zzso portion of zzso a region that contains four putative zzso zzso To identify the zzso acid sequence responsible for zzso retention of zzso we expressed fusion proteins containing zzso zzso zzso zzso various fragments of zzso and green fluorescent protein zzso in Chinese zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a plasma zzso zzso and serves as a reporter for protein trafficking to the cell surface zzso Imaging analyses indicated that zzso fusion proteins with zzso sequence preceding the four zzso zzso zzso and with zzso sequence corresponding to zzso segments 1, 2, and 3, zzso and zzso were localized to the plasma zzso fusion proteins containing the fourth zzso segment of zzso zzso were retained in the zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso fusion proteins that target to the plasma membrane are fully zzso and those retained in the zzso membrane are zzso Together our data indicate that zzso acids zzso of zzso contain the signal sequence for zzso retention of the zzso release zzso
