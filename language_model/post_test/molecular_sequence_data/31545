zzso possess zzso regulators (of the zzso zzso specifically dedicated to zzso genes for zzso zzso involved in zzso of zzso fatty zzso zzso of these zzso with operator sequences is disrupted in the presence of fatty zzso and they are therefore known as zzso zzso Here, we describe a novel mechanism of zzso the interaction of these proteins with DNA, illustrated by the example of zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso was found to interact in a zzso zzso with zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is zzso specifically at the zzso zzso 45 in its zzso domain by the zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that the zzso group of zzso 45 interacts with DNA, and we show that this zzso reduces zzso DNA binding zzso Point zzso mimicking zzso of zzso in zzso lead to a strong zzso of the zzso zzso indicating that this regulatory mechanism works independently of zzso by zzso fatty zzso zzso 45 is a highly zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso from other zzso This indicates that zzso of zzso 45 may be a general mechanism of switching off bacterial zzso zzso
