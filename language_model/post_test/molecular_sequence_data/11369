In this study zzso of the soluble tumor necrosis factor zzso type I zzso zzso by the use of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso were filled with buffers varying in pH and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso was then rapidly diluted and allowed to zzso for a variable time at different zzso The extent of zzso was measured by a sandwich zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the use of two zzso zzso obtained against urinary zzso Among about 100 different combinations tested, a maximum zzso yield of zzso has been obtained in 100 zzso zzso pH zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso bovine serum zzso 2 M zzso at a zzso protein concentration of 10 zzso and at 26 degrees zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso and its activity evaluated by zzso and biological zzso A good correlation was observed between the data obtained with different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sandwich zzso indicating that the zzso zzso has gained biological and zzso zzso comparable to those of the soluble zzso type I expressed in zzso zzso
