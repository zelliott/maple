We have carried out zzso surveys at various sites in Japan to investigate wild animals that serve as reservoirs for the agents of human zzso in the zzso Small zzso zzso six species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were trapped at various places, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Animals harboring zzso zzso zzso were detected in all six zzso zzso of their blood samples into zzso gave rise to a total of 20 zzso zzso 19 were from zzso zzso and the other 1 was from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso sequence revealed that 2 of the 20 zzso were classified as Kobe type because their zzso were identical to that of the Kobe strain (the strain from the Japanese index zzso The other 18 zzso were classified as a new type, designated the zzso type, because they all shared an identical zzso sequence which differed significantly from both that of zzso zzso and that of northeastern United States zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso closely related to each other but clearly different from each other zzso The zzso from zzso were demonstrated to be zzso for human zzso by zzso into zzso mice whose zzso had been replaced with human zzso The results suggest that a new type of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso type, is the major one which is prevalent among Japanese wild zzso that zzso zzso serves as a major zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso may also be an additional zzso on zzso zzso
