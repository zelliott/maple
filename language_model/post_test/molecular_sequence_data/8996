zzso zzso are a zzso of small, zzso zzso proteins that bind metal zzso through the formation of zzso zzso Although universally zzso they exhibit distinct zzso preferences, either for zzso zzso or zzso zzso metal zzso zzso constitutes a bizarre exception, since it is currently the only case of zzso zzso only zzso which are similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Until recently, the zzso zzso system was assumed to be composed of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of them responsive to heavy metal load through the zzso zzso zzso The significance of this zzso has been analyzed in depth both at zzso and zzso zzso zzso a fifth zzso zzso was recently zzso and named zzso The analysis of the zzso expression pattern revealed some differential traits with regard to the other zzso We analyze here the peculiarities of the metal binding abilities of the zzso zzso and compare them with those of the other zzso zzso determined through the same zzso zzso by zzso zzso and CD and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso complexes obtained by zzso synthesis demonstrates that zzso is the least zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and therefore it could play a role zzso a broad spectrum of metal coordination abilities are advantageous in terms of zzso zzso
