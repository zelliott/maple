zzso transformation with new zzso zzso now enables zzso tests of gene function via zzso protein expression or zzso interference in zzso zzso The problem remains of how to drive the zzso expression in zzso We employed zzso transformation using the zzso zzso zzso to test whether the zzso heat shock zzso promoter will be active in the live zzso We modified the original zzso by cloning the coding sequence for zzso nuclear zzso zzso between the zzso promoter and the zzso Three independent transgenic lines expressing the zzso zzso marker in zzso and adult zzso were obtained with efficiencies of up to zzso of fertile zzso adults that gave zzso zzso zzso integration of the zzso was confirmed with inverse zzso Heat induction of the transgenic zzso was proven at both the zzso and protein zzso zzso data showed that the zzso heat shock promoter was functional in all three transgenic zzso Although zzso activity was apparent at 25 degrees C, 1 h at 42 degrees C induced zzso zzso at different stages of development and in diverse zzso The relative levels of induction differed among the transgenic zzso Northern zzso zzso detected transgenic zzso only after heat shock and low levels of the zzso were still present 6 h after the heat zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso showed a clear increase of nuclear signal 90 zzso after a heat zzso
