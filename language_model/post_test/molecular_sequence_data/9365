zzso is an essential trace element in zzso due to its presence in proteins in the form of zzso zzso Human zzso codes for 25 zzso protein zzso and mouse and rat zzso for zzso 

We characterized the zzso of 44 zzso zzso by applying gene prediction and zzso reconstruction methods, supplemented with the analyses of gene structures, alternative zzso zzso untranslated regions, zzso zzso and zzso In total, we detected 45 zzso zzso 28 of them were found in zzso and 41 in zzso zzso We define the ancestral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and describe how they evolved along lineages through gene zzso (20 zzso gene loss (10 zzso and replacement of zzso with zzso (12 zzso We show that an zzso zzso zzso 2 gene evolved in early zzso and replaced functionally the original zzso gene in zzso zzso whereas both genes remain in zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso evolved from an ancestral zzso containing zzso still present in zzso zzso V and zzso evolved specifically in zzso zzso from zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso lost zzso several times zzso zzso zzso were characterized by zzso of several zzso families zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, we report identification of new zzso for several zzso and describe unusually zzso zzso zzso 

This analysis represents the first comprehensive survey of the zzso and zzso zzso and depicts their evolution along zzso It also provides a wealth of information on these zzso and their zzso
