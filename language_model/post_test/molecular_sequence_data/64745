zzso zzso is a bacterial zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to play an important role in the biology of the host and in the zzso of zzso Several species of zzso including the most important zzso of humans and animals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to zzso these zzso Other zzso species, including an important zzso species zzso zzso which has been used as a model for the study of zzso do not appear to zzso these zzso There are still several open questions about the distribution of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the number of species examined is still zzso zzso it is not clear whether the absence of zzso zzso in negative species could represent an ancestral characteristic or the result of a secondary zzso zzso several aspects of the zzso of zzso zzso are still unclear and it is thus difficult to overlay the zzso of zzso zzso on a tree representing zzso zzso Here we present the results of a zzso screening for zzso zzso in 16 species of zzso and related zzso representing different zzso Evidence for the presence of zzso zzso is reported for five species examined for the first time (representing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso original results on the absence of this zzso are reported for nine zzso for the remaining two species, we have confirmed the absence of zzso zzso recently reported by other zzso In the positive species, the infecting zzso zzso bacteria have been identified through zzso zzso gene sequence zzso In addition to the screening for zzso zzso in 16 species, we have generated zzso reconstructions based on zzso gene sequences zzso zzso zzso including a total of 28 zzso species and related zzso zzso The mapping of the zzso of zzso zzso on the trees generated indicates that these bacteria have possibly been lost during evolution along some lineages of zzso zzso
