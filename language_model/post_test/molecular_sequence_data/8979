zzso proteins 7 and 8 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso have previously been shown by X-ray zzso to form an zzso zzso In addition, it has been demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso able to zzso zzso zzso with a length of up to 6 zzso We present here the zzso crystal structure of the zzso coronavirus zzso zzso complex, which is a zzso zzso containing two copies of the zzso zzso with zzso differences between them, and one copy of zzso that consists of an zzso domain and a zzso zzso The same zzso is found for the zzso complex in solution, as demonstrated by chemical zzso size exclusion zzso and zzso X-ray zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso like its zzso counterpart, is able to zzso short zzso of up to 6 zzso in length when carrying an zzso zzso zzso zzso the same protein harboring the sequence zzso instead of the zzso tag at its N zzso exhibits a substantially increased, zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon addition of zzso the zzso zzso activity is further enhanced so that zzso up to template length zzso zzso can be zzso Further, we show that the zzso intermediate zzso zzso of human coronavirus zzso zzso is also capable of zzso zzso up to a chain length of zzso These results indicate that in case of zzso as well as of zzso zzso the formation of a zzso zzso complex is not necessary for zzso zzso zzso Further, the zzso zzso complex functions as a zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso of up to template zzso
