Diversity of zzso zzso strains is a central problem in zzso disease research because of its correlation with the wide range of clinical manifestations and the zzso zzso zzso The role played by zzso zzso in zzso disease epidemiology is still zzso Also awaits clarification whether such diversity is associated with the outcome of oral zzso zzso infection, responsible for frequent outbreaks of acute zzso zzso 

We addressed the impact of zzso in oral zzso zzso infection, by comparative analysis of two zzso zzso and zzso both derived from Y strain, a widely used experimental zzso Network zzso of four nuclear genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is closely related to zzso zzso Unit zzso while zzso is more closely related to zzso a group containing hybrid zzso Nevertheless, zzso one zzso transition at position zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso strain, expressing the surface zzso zzso infected mice orally more efficiently than zzso which expresses a related zzso zzso Both molecules are involved in zzso zzso host cell invasion, but exhibit differential gastric zzso capacity, a property critical for zzso migration toward the gastric zzso zzso Upon oral infection of mice, the number of zzso and zzso zzso in gastric zzso cells differed zzso 

We conclude that zzso forms of zzso zzso strain, closely related to zzso are better adapted than zzso strain zzso to traverse the stomach zzso layer and establish oral route zzso The efficiency to zzso target cell is the same because zzso and zzso strains have similar zzso zzso Unknown is whether differences in zzso and zzso are natural zzso adaptations or a product of zzso evolution by differential selection along the 60 years elapsed since the Y strain zzso
