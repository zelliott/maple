zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso condition caused by zzso in the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso Alternative zzso mechanisms involving zzso and coding zzso result in multiple protein zzso whose molecular weight ranges between 90 and 300 zzso We examined the zzso zzso coding region and identified nine new transcripts generated from alternative and/or zzso zzso Three of these preserve the reading frame and the corresponding proteins include the zzso zzso and the sequences required for zzso zzso The other six transcripts create a zzso that produces a premature stop zzso one of these has an additional zzso zzso zzso between zzso 1 and 2 that leads to a zzso and a premature stop zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that the expression of this transcript is regulated during zzso cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso surveillance mechanism that detects and degrades zzso that have premature termination zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso containing zzso and their subsequent degradation via zzso seems to be a general mechanism of gene zzso zzso of zzso cell lines with zzso a chemical inhibitor of translation that is known to inhibit also zzso indicates that the zzso zzso zzso that includes zzso zzso is zzso by zzso thereby suggesting that regulated zzso zzso and zzso degradation could zzso zzso protein zzso
