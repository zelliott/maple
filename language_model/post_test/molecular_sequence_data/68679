The human zzso nuclear protein zzso zzso zzso is the zzso of a well zzso family of zzso that can regulate both zzso progression and zzso zzso zzso Ran has been proposed to undergo tightly controlled cycles of zzso binding and zzso to operate as a zzso switch whose zzso and zzso forms interact zzso with regulators and zzso One known regulator, the protein zzso zzso 12, zzso interacts with Ran to zzso zzso zzso exchange, and both zzso and Ran are components of an intrinsic checkpoint control that prevents the premature initiation of zzso To test and extend the zzso model, we searched for a zzso zzso protein zzso and for putative zzso zzso that interact specifically with zzso We report here the identification of a Ran GAP and its use to characterize the zzso properties of zzso Ran zzso and the identification and cloning of a binding protein specific for zzso
