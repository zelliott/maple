To assess the effects of transforming growth factor alpha zzso on zzso skin in zzso we have targeted its expression to the zzso of transgenic mice using a zzso based on the human zzso zzso zzso Neonatal mice expressing the zzso zzso were often smaller than normal zzso and had precocious zzso opening and zzso zzso skin with diffuse zzso Juvenile transgenic mouse zzso was zzso zzso but this pattern was generally less pronounced in adult transgenic mice unless they expressed high levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred at sites of wounding in adult mice expressing high levels of zzso however, most were prone to zzso zzso zzso was 2-6 times higher in the zzso of these zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso had a normal pattern of expression in zzso adult zzso but a marked reduction in the zzso population was detected in zzso newborn zzso and zzso adult zzso zzso zzso of zzso growth factor showed a similar pattern of distribution, suggesting that the sites of increased zzso expression induced zzso growth factor zzso zzso These data demonstrate the in zzso effect of zzso zzso expression on zzso proliferation and differentiation and suggest a potential role for zzso in zzso and other zzso zzso zzso
