The complete sequence of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the bovine zzso zzso zzso was obtained by zzso of zzso expression libraries and by zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso The zzso zzso is similar in sequence to the zzso zzso of zzso the zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso As with these, the predicted zzso sequence comprises a zzso array of similar zzso with regularly spaced consensus zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was designated zzso zzso zzso zzso and the gene zzso The deduced zzso sequence of zzso showed features not observed before in other zzso zzso a zzso leader zzso is present, zzso none of the 12 units in the array are identical and the sequences diverge to a degree zzso unseen in the zzso of other zzso zzso zzso the predicted zzso zzso sites are also diverse in sequence and, in two instances, no consensus zzso site was identifiable at the expected position, zzso a short repeat unit is present, which is the only one containing a consensus zzso site and zzso a zzso extension zzso is zzso which shows no similarity to that from zzso zzso zzso zzso of independent zzso revealed slight variations in the sequence of the gene within the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso identified zzso zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso for which the complete coding sequence is available and the new principles which it illustrates may lie zzso in the zzso genes of all zzso zzso
