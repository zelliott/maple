Architectural proteins play an important role in zzso and organizing the zzso DNA in all three zzso of life zzso zzso and zzso These proteins are generally not zzso at the zzso acid sequence level, but the mechanisms by which they zzso the zzso do seem to be functionally zzso across zzso On a generic level, architectural proteins can be classified based on their structural effect as DNA zzso DNA zzso or DNA zzso Although zzso organization in zzso has not been studied zzso quite a number of architectural proteins have been zzso In the present paper, we zzso the knowledge currently available on these proteins in zzso By the type of architectural proteins available, the zzso zzso shows similarities with that of zzso It relies on the action of a large set of small, abundant and generally basic proteins to compact and organize their zzso and to zzso its zzso
