A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from coastal seawater from the zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity zzso the strain was most closely related to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso investigations using zzso zzso gene sequences showed that this Antarctic marine isolate formed a robust zzso zzso with the two zzso species but constituted a distinct zzso line in the zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso and the major respiratory zzso was zzso Several zzso and zzso zzso including the temperature range and zzso optimum for growth, several zzso activities and the cellular fatty acid zzso served to differentiate the strain from the two zzso zzso Therefore strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
