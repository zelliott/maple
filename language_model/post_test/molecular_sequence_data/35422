The human zzso zzso zzso zzso in base zzso repair zzso which is critical for repairing oxidized DNA bases and maintaining DNA replication zzso The zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso has been shown to associate with an zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso DNA and to serve as a risk factor for age-related zzso In this work, we demonstrate that this zzso is associated with a significant reduction of the type 1 zzso protein that zzso to zzso zzso this zzso affects zzso DNA zzso maintenance and functional zzso mass in individuals zzso for the zzso zzso These findings provide evidence for an association between the zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso and, consequently, contribute to zzso the roles of the zzso zzso in zzso the zzso base zzso repair zzso system and increasing the risk of acquiring an age-related zzso
