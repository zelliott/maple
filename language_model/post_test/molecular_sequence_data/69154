We have previously shown that expression of the zzso zzso is zzso regulated in zzso zzso cells by a nuclear factor zzso zzso that binds to the zzso promoter region just upstream of the zzso zzso zzso To understand how zzso zzso can regulate zzso gene zzso by zzso of the zzso function, we have used an zzso probe containing a binding site for this protein to clone the mouse zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of six zzso zinc finger zzso zzso which were highly related to those found in the zzso family of human zinc finger zzso Analysis of the tissue distribution of the zzso zzso zzso suggested that its expression was ubiquitous but at variable levels, most likely as a result of zzso regulation of zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor is a nuclear zzso the extent of its zzso is regulated during the cell zzso zzso binding of the zzso form of this protein to DNA was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso reporter gene under the control of the zzso zzso in several human cell lines resulted in repression of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, when the zzso zzso binding site upstream of the zzso was zzso no zzso of zzso function was zzso Based on these observations we conclude that we have cloned the cellular zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso activity of this protein is regulated during the cell zzso
