zzso genes zzso a large zzso of zzso factors with widespread roles in animal zzso Within zzso there are over 100 zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso and over 200 in zzso Set against this general trend of increasing gene number in zzso evolution, some ancient zzso genes that were present in the last common zzso of zzso have been lost from zzso Here, we describe the embryonic expression of four zzso descendants of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso All four genes are expressed with a striking asymmetry about the zzso axis in the zzso region of zzso zzso mirroring the pronounced asymmetry of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also zzso expressed in an anterior neural tube region destined to become the cerebral zzso These findings suggest significant zzso of zzso gene regulatory networks occurred during zzso evolution, zzso with zzso gene zzso We propose that loss of otherwise widely zzso genes is possible when these genes function in a confined role in development that is subsequently lost or significantly modified during zzso In the case of these zzso zzso we propose that this has occurred in relation to the evolution of the zzso zzso and zzso
