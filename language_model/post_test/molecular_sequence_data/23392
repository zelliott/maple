zzso zzso , a leading cause of bacterial infections in humans, is endowed with a wealth of zzso factors that contribute to the disease zzso Several zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso referred to as the zzso zzso A, zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso B, zzso by zzso ), have proposed roles for zzso zzso Here we present data regarding the distribution, copy number and genetic zzso of the genes zzso the zzso in a large number of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso and zzso genes in three laboratory strains and 126 clinical zzso was analyzed by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso length zzso zzso Both genes were detected in all zzso by zzso amplification and, based on the zzso patterns, classified as four types for zzso and six types for zzso zzso Those with the most divergent patterns were subjected to DNA sequencing and compared with zzso sequence data for the seven available strains of zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso sequences indicates that they are strongly zzso as zzso genes in the zzso of each zzso zzso strain zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the zzso have important zzso and/or zzso functions, and therefore may constitute an interesting target for the development of therapeutic zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso
