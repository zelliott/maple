zzso screening was used to isolate a zzso zzso the zzso zzso of rabbit skeletal muscle zzso zzso The zzso is identical to that zzso the zzso zzso except that it contains an zzso zzso of zzso zzso near its zzso end, apparently resulting from alternative zzso The protein zzso by the zzso would contain a zzso zzso signal sequence and a zzso zzso sequence identical to the zzso zzso It would also contain a zzso acid insert between these zzso This insert would be highly zzso suggesting that it might bind zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso expressed in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso the zzso zzso were shown to bind zzso in a gel overlay zzso The protein was shown to be located in the zzso of the zzso zzso and to be associated through zzso with the zzso We propose that this zzso zzso binding zzso of the zzso zzso be designated zzso
