zzso zzso cells, either of zzso origin or zzso and depleted of seminal fluid, are spontaneously able to bind zzso DNA molecules which are subsequently zzso into zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that the zzso DNA was specifically zzso by zzso zzso and showed typical fragmentation patterns of localized zzso zzso were activated in response to the zzso of zzso DNA by zzso cells and their activity increased with the DNA zzso zzso zzso was efficient in zzso zzso cells, while being drastically reduced in zzso washed zzso zzso were zzso dependent, and were, respectively, inhibited and activated by zzso zzso cells with zzso Acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are known to, respectively, inhibit and activate zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso also caused a partial degradation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments were released from the zzso cells to the zzso Taken together, these results suggest that a metabolically active process similar to zzso is triggered in the zzso of mature zzso cells upon interaction with zzso zzso
