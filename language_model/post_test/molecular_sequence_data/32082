zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is similar in sequence to family zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso system, and it functions to release zzso zzso groups from the zzso position of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here, we characterize the zzso of zzso zzso zzso as being zzso and find that it serves as a zzso for the zzso The influence of pH on the activity of zzso zzso was determined, and zzso values of zzso and zzso for the zzso complex zzso and free zzso zzso respectively, were zzso The zzso was zzso by zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso alignment of the zzso zzso family 1 zzso with members of the zzso zzso and protein modeling studies identified zzso zzso and zzso as three zzso zzso acid zzso that could potentially serve as a zzso zzso Replacement of each with zzso was accomplished by zzso zzso and the resulting zzso proteins were zzso to apparent zzso The specific activity of each of the three zzso derivatives was greatly reduced on zzso Using the artificial zzso zzso zzso a kinetic analysis revealed that the turnover number zzso but not zzso was affected by the zzso These data thus indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso the zzso family of zzso function as zzso zzso involving a zzso zzso zzso
