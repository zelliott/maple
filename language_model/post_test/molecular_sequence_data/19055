Excavations of a complex of caves in the Sierra de zzso in northern Spain have unearthed zzso fossils that range in age from the early zzso to the zzso One of these sites, the zzso de los zzso zzso of zzso has yielded the world's largest zzso of Middle zzso zzso zzso consisting of at least 28 individuals dated to over 300,000 years zzso The skeletal remains share a number of zzso features with fossils classified as Homo zzso and also display distinct zzso zzso Here we determine an almost complete zzso zzso sequence of a zzso from zzso de los zzso and show that it is closely related to the lineage leading to zzso zzso of zzso an eastern zzso sister group to zzso Our results pave the way for DNA research on zzso from the Middle zzso
