The zzso E protein is one of four zzso proteins associated with the zzso of the U family zzso and zzso zzso of a human zzso zzso library with a partial zzso for a human zzso zzso resulted in the isolation of a zzso clone containing the entire coding region of this zzso core zzso zzso of the zzso end of this zzso with the sequences of two processed zzso and primer extension data suggest that the zzso is nearly full zzso The longest open reading frame in this clone codes for a basic 92 zzso acid protein which is in perfect agreement with zzso acid sequence data obtained from zzso E zzso The predicted sequence of this protein reveals no extensive similarity to other zzso zzso but contains regions of similarity to a zzso zzso zzso
