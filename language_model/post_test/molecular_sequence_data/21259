The zzso coli zzso master regulator, zzso binds to the promoter regions of zzso class II zzso yet, despite extensive analysis of the zzso promoter region, a detailed consensus sequence has not zzso We used in zzso and in zzso experimental approaches to determine the zzso in the class II promoter, zzso required for the binding and function of zzso zzso protects 48 zzso zzso zzso to zzso relative to the zzso zzso start zzso in the zzso zzso We divided the zzso footprint region into 5 sections to determine the requirement of each DNA segment for the binding and function of zzso zzso from an in zzso binding competition zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and DNA fragments possessing zzso in one section of the zzso protected region showed that only one-third of the 48 zzso protected by zzso is required for zzso binding and zzso promoter zzso This in zzso binding result was also seen in zzso with zzso zzso zzso carrying the same zzso Only seven bases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are absolutely required for the promoter zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso within the 7 bases are highly specific to zzso promoter activity, and those bases form an zzso recognition site for zzso The implications of the asymmetry of the zzso binding site and its potential impact on zzso are zzso
