The zzso zzso small zzso zzso genes appear to comprise an interesting subset of class III genes different from any previously identified, including zzso and zzso zzso genes have functional A and B box zzso control zzso In addition, they contain three upstream elements that together stimulate in zzso expression zzso and resemble sites associated with typical class II zzso zzso I zzso analyses using zzso proteins or zzso competition demonstrate that zzso zzso to zzso bind zzso zzso factor zzso or a related zzso while zzso zzso to zzso bind zzso protein or a related zzso The element between positions zzso and zzso resembles a zzso zzso zzso are unusual zzso zzso III transcripts shown to be controlled by zzso and zzso promoter zzso suggesting mechanisms for their high level expression in zzso zzso
