zzso zzso is a significant pathogen in zzso aquaculture, though knowledge of zzso zzso is zzso Through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we have identified two gene zzso to classical zzso zzso zzso factors: zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso possesses a zzso locus containing zzso and a zzso transcribed putative zzso regulatory zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso locus of group A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is located zzso in the zzso Comparative sequence analysis of the zzso locus revealed only one significant zzso a strain with an zzso zzso zzso in zzso and a deletion zzso in a region downstream of zzso generating an zzso which may zzso a second putative zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso of zzso and zzso was employed to investigate the potential role of these genes in zzso zzso zzso Our hybrid striped bass zzso and zzso models of infection revealed that zzso protein contributes significantly to zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso protein does zzso Further, in zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso like other M family zzso contributes to cellular adherence and invasion and provides resistance to zzso zzso zzso in our zzso models was also observed in the zzso zzso isolate possessing a natural zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the Delta zzso zzso provided zzso protection against subsequent challenge with a lethal dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso after 1,400 degree days, and shows promise as a target for live attenuated vaccine zzso 

Analysis of zzso protein and zzso zzso through zzso replacement revealed that zzso protein plays a significant role in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso which may regulate expression of this zzso has an unusual zzso The zzso protein zzso created in this research holds promise as zzso zzso
