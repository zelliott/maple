The availability of multiple bacterial zzso sequences has revealed a surprising extent of zzso among strains of the same zzso The human gastric pathogen zzso zzso is known as one of the most genetically diverse zzso We have compared the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso strain zzso and six other zzso zzso zzso to zzso the genetic repertoire and zzso evolution mechanisms of this zzso In agreement with previous findings, we estimate that the core zzso comprises about 1200 genes and that zzso zzso possesses an open zzso zzso genes are zzso located at potential zzso zzso sites or in distinct plasticity zones, suggesting two different mechanisms of zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains three plasticity zones, two of which zzso type IV zzso systems and have typical features of zzso zzso We demonstrate for the first time that one of these islands is capable of zzso and horizontal transfer by a zzso zzso We also show that zzso is zzso by a protein of the zzso family of zzso zzso Thus, in addition to its natural transformation zzso zzso transfer of zzso islands has to be considered as an important source of genetic diversity in zzso zzso
