zzso protein zzso zzso pathways form the backbone of signal zzso in the zzso zzso Here we applied a systematic experimental and zzso approach to map zzso interactions between human zzso proteins and other cellular machinery and to assemble these data into functional zzso Multiple lines of evidence including conservation with zzso supported a core network of zzso zzso Using small interfering zzso zzso we observed that approximately one-third of zzso proteins modulated zzso zzso We uncovered the zzso zzso zzso as a potential zzso scaffold, found links between zzso zzso and zzso pathways and identified zzso as the human analog to the zzso signaling zzso zzso This study makes available a large resource of zzso interactions and clone libraries, and it illustrates a methodology for probing signaling networks based on functional refinement of zzso derived zzso zzso
