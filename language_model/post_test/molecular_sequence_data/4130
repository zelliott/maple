zzso are a family of proteins that catalyze zzso long-term extension of isolated plant cell zzso They are divided into two groups, alpha and zzso the latter consisting of the grass group I zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso are suggested to mediate plant cell growth by interfering with either structural proteins or the zzso network in the cell zzso Our group reported zzso properties of zzso of Timothy grass zzso zzso zzso zzso p 1, and suggested that zzso of cell wall structural proteins may be the underlying mechanism of zzso wall zzso Here, we report additional data showing that zzso resemble ancient and modern zzso B, which is a member of the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso expression system, we show that zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso is facilitated by its zzso and that the zzso activated zzso shows zzso activity, resulting in very low stability of the zzso We also show that zzso full-length zzso is not activated efficiently and therefore is relatively zzso zzso and zzso search tools detected significant similarity between zzso and zzso of modern animals as well as the zzso zzso zzso confirming the presence of zzso zzso active site and other functional zzso zzso as well as a zzso location of these features within these zzso Lastly, we demonstrate by zzso zzso that the zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso activity of zzso These results indicate a common origin of zzso B and zzso especially if taken together with their previously known zzso zzso
