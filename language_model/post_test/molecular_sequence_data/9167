From the zzso libraries made from the zzso zzso of two zzso belonging to the zzso family, four different putative non zzso zzso peptides were zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso plus zzso and zzso from zzso zzso These short peptides (with only 13 zzso acid zzso each) share important zzso acid sequence similarities among themselves and with other reported zzso zzso but their biological activities vary zzso This communication reports the zzso chemical synthesis and characterization of these zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso zzso activity with minimum zzso zzso zzso in the range of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, whereas their zzso activity at these zzso was zzso zzso relationships that might determine the differences in activities are zzso
