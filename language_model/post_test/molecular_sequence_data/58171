zzso between viral proteins and zzso has been studied in zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso followed by zzso and labeling with T4 zzso zzso allowed us to detect interactions between zzso and zzso viral zzso The zzso linked to the zzso protein zzso have been identified as zzso zzso and the sequences of the zzso zzso fragments have been zzso These sequences zzso to the 3' end sequence common to all zzso group A zzso We also show that the last 3' zzso is zzso to the protein and that zzso and zzso forms of zzso are bound to zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso replication is discussed in the light of our results and by comparison with other zzso proteins of members of the zzso zzso
