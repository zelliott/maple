zzso zzso virus zzso is classified to the family zzso but has not been grouped into any zzso so zzso Four overlapped fragments were amplified from the zzso zzso with zzso chain reaction zzso The assembled length of the four fragments was zzso zzso which contained the genes zzso unique long zzso 24, zzso zzso zzso and zzso H zzso zzso The zzso overlapped with zzso by 64 zzso zzso in a head-to-head zzso orientation, and the zzso and zzso had the same zzso zzso The comparison of zzso acid sequences of these 3 deduced zzso proteins with other 12 zzso displayed 5 highly zzso sites in the zzso as well as another 5 consensus regions in the zzso and 4 consensus regions in the zzso The zzso zzso II zzso control elements were identified in all the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso These elements included core zzso zzso motifs and zzso zzso zzso analysis for the genetic zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso with other 12 zzso was zzso The result showed that zzso was more closely related to avian zzso except infectious zzso virus zzso than to other zzso zzso according to the zzso analysis and the zzso comparison of functional zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso should be classified to a separate zzso of the zzso zzso in the family zzso
