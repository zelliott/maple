The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has recently been shown to be a major target for zzso zzso in zzso zzso In the present study we demonstrate that zzso human zzso can be modified with zzso in a zzso zzso ratio by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as major zzso zzso zzso This was confirmed with several zzso zzso including deletions in the zzso domain I of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and fusion of the zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso to an unrelated zzso The results showed that the zzso target site is sufficient for modification by zzso but at a low zzso For high efficiency zzso incorporation an intact domain I is zzso The conservation of at least one of the zzso target zzso in the known zzso zzso sequences and their absence in an zzso zzso point to an important, but yet unknown, role of this modification in zzso
