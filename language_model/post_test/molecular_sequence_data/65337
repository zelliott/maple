The development and critical evaluation of new technologies for identifying genetic zzso will rapidly accelerate the discovery and diagnosis of zzso zzso We report a novel way for distinguishing a new class of human DNA zzso short zzso zzso zzso A sensor with zzso pores named channel glass in combination with tandem zzso which uses a zzso labeled stacking probe and zzso short zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso This methodology allows zzso to be detected individually and rapidly with small quantities of target zzso This establishes a reliable quantitative zzso zzso for simultaneously zzso different targets to arrayed zzso designed to detect various zzso in zzso were zzso Five markers were consistently detected in a single zzso zzso factors zzso the zzso reaction process are zzso
