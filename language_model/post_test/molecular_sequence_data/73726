The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso which is involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is involved in controlling expression of zzso at the level of translation in response to changes in the zzso concentration of zzso We performed in zzso experiments using zzso zzso to zzso the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso footprint analysis showed that zzso zzso interacts with one zzso one zzso and seven zzso repeats present in the zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso experiments indicated that the zzso and zzso binding sites zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso translation system demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso regulates translation of zzso by blocking zzso access to the zzso zzso binding zzso Our results are consistent with a model in which each zzso zzso zzso interacts with one zzso repeat in an zzso target, thereby wrapping the transcript around the periphery of the zzso zzso
