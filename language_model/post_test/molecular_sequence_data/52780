zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to induce single base zzso in zzso DNA both in zzso and in zzso The zzso mouse strain has a point zzso in the zzso zzso the consequence of which is a muscular zzso resulting from zzso of the zzso protein in skeletal zzso To test the feasibility of zzso gene therapy for muscular zzso we used a zzso zzso zzso designed to correct the point zzso in the zzso gene in zzso zzso After direct injection of zzso into muscles of zzso mice, zzso analysis revealed zzso fibers clustered around the injection zzso Two weeks after single injections into zzso anterior muscles, the maximum number of zzso fibers zzso 30) in any muscle represented zzso of the total number of fibers in that zzso Ten weeks after single injections, the range of the number of zzso fibers was similar to that seen after 2 zzso suggesting that the expression was stable, as would be predicted for a zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed that none of these were zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso from zzso muscles was full length by zzso zzso No zzso was zzso by zzso or zzso analysis after control zzso zzso Finally, reverse zzso analysis demonstrated the presence of transcripts with the zzso zzso sequence only in zzso muscles injected with zzso zzso These results provide the foundation for further studies of zzso gene therapy as a therapeutic approach to muscular zzso and other genetic disorders of zzso
