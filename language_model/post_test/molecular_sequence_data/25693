zzso zzso and zzso zzso assignments have been made for zzso that form the zzso parallel zzso and the zzso zzso zzso binding site of oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso enhancements zzso indicate that the zzso arrangement is similar to that observed in the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1983) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of 62 zzso were zzso 8 between zzso of bound zzso 29 between zzso of the protein in the zzso binding site, and 25 between zzso of bound zzso and zzso of the zzso These constraints were used to determine the localized solution structure of the zzso binding zzso The electronic environment and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso ring were investigated by determining zzso chemical shifts, zzso zzso and zzso zzso constants, and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso edge of the zzso ring was found to be slightly zzso The zzso ring was found to be zzso zzso 94, located adjacent to the zzso zzso ring, was shown to have a hindered aromatic ring flip zzso
