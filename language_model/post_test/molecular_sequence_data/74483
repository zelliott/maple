zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso that delivers negative signals upon interaction with its two zzso zzso or zzso The high-resolution crystal structure of the complex formed by the complete zzso of zzso zzso and zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso and displayed a binding interface and overall molecular organization distinct from that observed in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, our structure also provides insights into the association between zzso and zzso and highlights differences in the zzso formed by the two zzso zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed the details of the proposed zzso binding zzso and allowed for the design of a zzso zzso zzso with enhanced zzso These studies define spatial and organizational constraints that control the zzso and signaling of zzso complexes within the zzso zzso and provide a basis for manipulating the zzso pathways for zzso
