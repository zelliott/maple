zzso zzso zzso and accumulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated by zzso density zzso zzso Whereas only one type of zzso could be isolated from zzso zzso two types of zzso with different specific zzso were isolated from zzso zzso Both types of zzso zzso zzso showed a similar content of zzso and zzso zzso but the protein profiles of both types were significantly zzso The zzso with the lower specific density were zzso the zzso with the higher specific density had a deep orange zzso zzso studies revealed three different groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso bound zzso zzso relatively zzso associated zzso and zzso proteins that resisted zzso by treatment with 2 M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 M zzso zzso up to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The strong association of proteins of the last group suggested that these may play a specific role in the synthesis or zzso of storage lipids or in the structure of the zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of the most tightly bound proteins were zzso zzso of low molecular weight with striking sequence similarity to the zzso protein zzso from various zzso were always zzso with the zzso
