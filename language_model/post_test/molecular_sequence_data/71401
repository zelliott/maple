A zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso a root zzso zzso of zzso zzso was cloned and its zzso sequence was zzso The zzso DNA of about 280 zzso was amplified using two zzso zzso zzso from the zzso sequences of the type I zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the amplified zzso revealed three regions that were zzso in the zzso showing it as being part of the zzso zzso A zzso Southern zzso using this zzso as a probe showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fragments zzso strongly with the zzso The zzso zzso library constructed into the zzso zzso was screened, and one zzso clone was zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the clone revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso Da and a zzso of zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso is zzso identical to that of zzso zzso but was only zzso identical to the zzso zzso zzso
