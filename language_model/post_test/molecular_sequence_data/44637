To clarify a universal mechanism of the zzso rotation of zzso an zzso zzso a stable, ancestral zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso of about 7 zzso contained genes zzso C, G, A, B and D zzso zzso with predicted molecular weights of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequence was compared with that of zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso which are zzso zzso The cause of zzso The main exchanges in the zzso acid zzso of zzso proteins included zzso zzso zzso (11 zzso of A zzso of zzso and, zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso needed for the zzso zzso The zzso similar to those established in zzso zzso were also found in the zzso zzso of species with a different energy zzso
