zzso were made to a thirteen zzso acid synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso binding sites by the zzso zzso was studied using a zzso preparation of rat brain zzso Under these conditions a zzso of zzso binding sites was recognized by the zzso but no zzso binding sites were zzso zzso analysis of this zzso of zzso binding sites yields a zzso plot which fits a zzso model with zzso zzso of zzso and 323 zzso These studies show that the zzso zzso complex, zzso binds zzso but not zzso and suggest that zzso the binding sites for these two zzso reside on different zzso and zzso the zzso zzso identified zzso is not equivalent to the zzso binding sites identified with zzso zzso
