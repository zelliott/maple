A new protein of the zzso infectious zzso virus zzso was discovered in zzso of infected zzso zzso of the gene zzso open reading frame zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso virus infected cells was used to identify it as the zzso zzso It is a novel type of viral zzso whose function is not zzso It is a soluble protein contained in zzso its slow export from the cell is caused by the presence of an zzso signal at the zzso This zzso acid zzso zzso closely resembles the consensus zzso of soluble resident zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein with the zzso sequence zzso became resistant to zzso by zzso H with a zzso that was reduced zzso In contrast, a zzso with the sequence zzso was completely retained in the zzso The zzso zzso protein is the first example of a viral protein with a functional zzso zzso zzso
