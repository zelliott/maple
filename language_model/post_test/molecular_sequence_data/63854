The direct interaction of zzso zzso zzso with four functional basic proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso core zzso and three synthetic zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso was characterized in zzso It was found that zzso zzso inhibited zzso the activity of zzso but not zzso through its direct binding to the zzso zzso zzso activity was sensitive to zzso rather than zzso but significantly zzso by zzso zzso the zzso zzso of these basic zzso except zzso and synthetic zzso containing potent zzso sites for zzso was inhibited zzso by zzso and zzso two consensus zzso motifs zzso and zzso B, basic zzso zzso in these basic proteins and synthetic peptides could be overlapping to the potent zzso site zzso for the zzso in zzso These results presented here suggest that zzso functions as a selective inhibitor for zzso and the zzso zzso of cellular zzso functional basic proteins in zzso
