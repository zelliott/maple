The zzso system of zzso acid bacteria is of eminent importance for the rapid growth of these organisms in protein-rich zzso The combined action of zzso and zzso provides the cell with small peptides and essential zzso zzso The zzso acids and peptides thus liberated have to be zzso across the zzso zzso To that purpose, the cell contains specific transport zzso The zzso peptides are further zzso to zzso acids by zzso zzso The zzso economic importance of the zzso acid bacteria and their zzso system has led to an intensive research effort in this area and a considerable amount of zzso data has been collected during the last two zzso Since the development of systems to genetically manipulate zzso acid bacteria, data on the zzso of zzso and processes involved in zzso are rapidly being zzso In this review an overview of the latest genetic data on the zzso system of zzso acid bacteria will be zzso As most of the work in this field has been done with zzso the emphasis will, zzso be on this group of zzso Where possible, links will be made with other species of zzso acid zzso
