The zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso mediates the zzso zzso repression of three zzso zzso zzso a small regulatory zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso concentration of zzso was determined to be around zzso molecules per zzso The zzso zzso zzso was scanned for potential new zzso target zzso out of which three showed zzso activity in their upstream zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that the promoter regions of two putative targets, zzso zzso zzso zzso B and zzso zzso a zzso zzso bound zzso with significant zzso A detailed contact probing of zzso interactions revealed an interesting new binding pattern at the zzso promoter, where the whole promoter appears to be contacted by zzso Using zzso gene zzso and in zzso zzso zzso the zzso promoter was investigated for a regulatory effect of zzso Surprisingly, zzso does not repress zzso at this promoter, but instead acts as an zzso zzso of the zzso promoters of different zzso bacteria zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso sites in a significant number of zzso Our data show that a zzso approach combined with in zzso and in zzso experiments can be used to identify new targets of zzso zzso
