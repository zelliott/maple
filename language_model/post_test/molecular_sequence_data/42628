zzso zzso is a basic protein of an apparent molecular weight of zzso zzso of zzso has been found largely in the zzso of zzso cells in the peripheral nervous zzso Although the function of zzso is unknown, its striking zzso to a family of fatty acid binding proteins has led to the idea that zzso may function as a fatty acid transport zzso To investigate the DNA elements that control the expression of zzso sequences zzso to the coding region were cloned upstream of the cat reporter zzso A series of 3' and zzso promoter zzso was constructed and their activity determined following zzso into secondary zzso cells and the zzso zzso cell zzso Using this strategy, we have identified a 217 zzso zzso region and a 142 zzso positive regulatory zzso In addition, we have localized the zzso zzso sequences in the promoter that are responsive to zzso induction and to the zzso factor zzso binding protein zzso
