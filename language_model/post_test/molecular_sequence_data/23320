zzso characterization of zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed that strain zzso zzso zzso with zzso coli zzso zzso coli, and zzso zzso but not with other human zzso In addition, cells of these pathogens zzso in the presence of the spent culture zzso zzso of strain zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso remained viable in the zzso and zzso for up to 24 zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso occurred at pH zzso to zzso and was sensitive to heat (85 degrees C for 15 zzso and zzso zzso The zzso factor zzso was zzso and the gene was identified by zzso with zzso zzso derived from internal zzso acid zzso The zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso with a zzso leader and an zzso point of zzso The zzso acid sequence had no significant similarity to proteins with known zzso Northern analysis revealed not only major zzso from the promoter of zzso but also major zzso from the promoter of the preceding zzso element, zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso coli zzso zzso of pathogens comparable to the zzso obtained with zzso zzso or zzso of strain zzso zzso zzso could be removed from cells of strain zzso zzso by treatment with 5 M zzso and could be subsequently zzso to the cell surface by using zzso or zzso zzso which resulted in restoration of the zzso zzso These results together with those of the zzso acid sequence analysis suggest that zzso is a novel surface protein of zzso zzso that mediates zzso of some zzso
