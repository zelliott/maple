zzso of DNA from the zzso into the zzso zzso is an obligatory step for an in zzso zzso zzso or gene therapy approach on zzso DNA zzso In this context, we have developed an artificial DNA zzso zzso that is composed of the zzso signal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and a DNA zzso While this zzso is capable of directing attached passenger molecules to the zzso zzso the recognition of this artificial zzso by the zzso zzso signal zzso processing machinery as well as the zzso of the zzso plays a pivotal role in the release of the attached zzso To study the zzso processing of the artificial zzso various signal zzso were treated with zzso zzso intermediate zzso When the leader zzso is directly linked to the DNA zzso without an intervening zzso zzso processing is zzso zzso of the zzso can be zzso however, when the first ten zzso acid zzso of the mature part of zzso are appended at the zzso end of the signal zzso Our results show that artificial zzso are recognized by the zzso zzso machinery, and therefore an interference of the zzso with the DNA function can be zzso
