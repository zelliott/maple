zzso evolution is driven by zzso which may affect the fitness of an zzso and are then subject to natural selection or genetic zzso Analysis of primary protein sequences and zzso structures has yielded valuable insights into the evolution of protein function, but little is known about the evolution of functional mechanisms, protein dynamics and zzso plasticity essential for zzso We characterized the zzso motions across divergent members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite structural zzso zzso coli and human zzso use different dynamic mechanisms to perform the same function, and human zzso cannot complement zzso zzso coli zzso Identification of the zzso zzso of flexibility in zzso from several species allowed us to propose a likely scenario for the evolution of functionally important zzso dynamics following a pattern of divergent evolution that is tuned by cellular zzso
