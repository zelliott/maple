zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso are zzso zzso in the cellular DNA damage response and impairment of their function is closely related to zzso Previous studies revealed several zzso proteins of zzso and zzso but identification of additional targets is still important in order to understand their tumor zzso zzso In this study, we screened novel zzso for zzso and zzso using zzso target motifs determined previously by an oriented zzso library zzso The potential candidates were selected by zzso zzso database searches and were examined by in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso G, zzso and zzso were newly identified as in zzso zzso for zzso and/or zzso Among these, zzso and zzso were further analyzed to substantiate the screening zzso zzso zzso zzso of full-length proteins and zzso zzso analysis of the target motifs demonstrated that zzso and zzso were specific targets for zzso and/or zzso at least in zzso
