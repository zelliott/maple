A linkage map consisting of 21 zzso repeat zzso 1 zzso repeat zzso and 3 zzso was constructed for human zzso zzso The map spanned most of the zzso length from near zzso to zzso on the zzso portion of the long zzso The total 186 zzso length of the female map was over two times the 84 zzso length of the male zzso zzso mapping of the zzso using a panel of hybrids containing rearranged zzso was completely consistent with the linkage zzso Special effort was made to remove as many zzso zzso including parental phase zzso as zzso zzso of zzso in agreement with recent theoretical predictions, led to reduction of the total length of the zzso map by zzso from 145 to 130 zzso
