We report display of the complete zzso inhibitor zzso domain, zzso on the surface of zzso zzso as a fusion to the gene III zzso zzso that display zzso bind specifically to zzso zzso zzso and zzso A point zzso of zzso zzso alters the binding specificity of fusion zzso such that a human zzso zzso zzso is zzso while a zzso zzso is zzso zzso were zzso from an immobilized zzso with step zzso of decreasing zzso zzso that display zzso zzso having higher affinity for the immobilized zzso exhibit characteristic pH zzso zzso indicating that bound display zzso can be selectively recovered from an affinity zzso zzso of this technology should enable the selection of remodeled zzso zzso exhibiting novel binding zzso
