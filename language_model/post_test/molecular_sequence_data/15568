The zzso zzso zzso complex zzso the repositioning and association of actively zzso genes with nuclear pores zzso zzso is central to zzso transcription, processing, and zzso nuclear zzso We present here the crystal structure of zzso and zzso bound to a central region of zzso (the zzso zzso that is crucial for its zzso zzso forms a long, gently undulating alpha zzso around which one zzso and two zzso chains are zzso zzso has an articulated zzso hairpin fold that zzso its wrapping around zzso In zzso studies using engineered zzso that selectively disrupted binding of individual chains to zzso indicated that zzso and zzso function zzso to promote zzso association of zzso and zzso nuclear zzso These data indicate zzso provides a scaffold within zzso to integrate interactions between protein complexes to facilitate the zzso of zzso and zzso export during gene zzso
