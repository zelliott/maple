zzso zzso zzso zzso comprise an zzso phase containing all zzso nutrients necessary for microbial growth and a zzso phase containing high zzso of zzso or toxic zzso that partition at zzso levels to the zzso phase in response to cellular zzso This work aimed at eliminating the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso hence enabling their use as zzso delivery zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in the isolation of a zzso zzso unable to zzso these zzso The zzso which also eliminated growth on zzso and ethanol, was identified to be within a zzso of the P zzso zzso zzso which encodes a response zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso cell extracts revealed a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso zzso A knockout in a gene zzso zzso a zzso alcohol zzso slowed but did not eliminate growth on zzso alcohols or ethanol, suggesting zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence data indicated the presence of two zzso alcohol zzso zzso The successful elimination of alcohol zzso in the zzso zzso indicates control by zzso on multiple pathways and presents a useful strain for zzso applications requiring alcohol zzso microbial zzso
