We have previously shown that the membrane protein M of zzso is involved in efficient induction of alpha zzso zzso zzso synthesis by zzso peripheral blood zzso cells incubated with zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso In order to determine whether M protein is able to induce zzso in the absence of other viral factors, we expressed the protein either zzso in the zzso ST cells or zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Although showing no obvious difference in zzso zzso or zzso compared to its viral counterpart, the zzso zzso failed to induce significant zzso zzso
