The first crystal structures of a zzso zzso zzso were determined to high resolution from the zzso species zzso zzso with and without zzso The zzso domain has 18 zzso strands arranged in zzso of a zzso The zzso domain is an zzso barrel, lacking the peripheral zzso of zzso zzso zzso contacts are common to all zzso Family zzso zzso zzso similar to those of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest evolution from a common zzso zzso zzso may have evolved from zzso zzso by the substitution of the zzso domain with the peripheral zzso and by the addition of a zzso zzso
