Safe zzso vaccines, based on a small number of zzso zzso are emerging as the most attractive, cost-effective solution against infectious zzso In the present work, we confirmed previous data from our laboratory showing that whole viable bacterial cell treatment with zzso followed by the identification of released peptides by mass zzso is the method of choice for the rapid and reliable identification of vaccine candidates in zzso zzso When applied to the Group B zzso zzso strain, 43 zzso proteins were identified, including all the protective zzso described in the literature as well as a new protective zzso the cell zzso protein zzso belonging to the zzso repeat protein zzso This strategy overcomes the difficulties so far encountered in the identification of novel vaccine candidates and speeds up the entire vaccine discovery process by reducing the number of zzso proteins to be tested in the animal zzso
