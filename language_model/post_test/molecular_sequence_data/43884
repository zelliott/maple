The tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso consists of approximately 10 characterized members of human zzso We have identified a new member of the zzso zzso zzso from a search of an expressed sequence tag data zzso zzso cloning and Northern zzso zzso demonstrated multiple zzso species, of which a zzso form was most zzso However, zzso is zzso by a single gene which, maps to zzso zzso in the same region as several other members of the zzso zzso The most abundant zzso open reading frame encodes a zzso acid single zzso protein with a zzso signal zzso two perfect and two imperfect zzso zzso zzso and a short zzso tail with some similarity to zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed in multiple human zzso and cell lines and shows a zzso and relatively high expression in peripheral blood T cells, B cells, and zzso A zzso fusion protein inhibited a mixed zzso zzso proliferation suggesting that the zzso and/or its zzso play a role in T cell zzso
