We examined whether the zzso of zzso zzso channels zzso possesses an zzso zzso zzso domain, which, similar to the one of zzso mediates zzso of the open zzso We found that zzso zzso channels, where the zzso zzso zzso had been replaced by corresponding zzso zzso zzso relatively fast, with a mean time constant of 120 zzso as compared to zzso s in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed features typically observed for Shaker zzso zzso fast zzso of zzso channels was slowed by zzso zzso and removed by zzso zzso zzso zzso channels reopened during recovery from zzso and recovery was accelerated in high external zzso Moreover, the application of synthetic zzso zzso and zzso peptides to zzso patches containing slowly zzso zzso channels zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, after fractional zzso zzso tail currents with zzso zzso indicative of passage through the open state during recovery from zzso zzso tail current zzso were less prominent in zzso channel complexes and virtually absent in zzso zzso zzso zzso features of zzso zzso zzso which may be suppressed by zzso association, were also revealed by the finding that application of zzso zzso zzso accelerated the zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso patch zzso However, double zzso cycle analysis of zzso zzso and pore zzso indicated differences in the zzso and structural zzso between zzso and Shaker zzso zzso
