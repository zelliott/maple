We describe a quantitative zzso based on the unique zzso 1 restriction site generated by the zzso zzso zzso to T substitution at position 2007 of zzso to zzso the percentage of zzso of zzso stem cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso specifically amplify zzso sequences from either zzso DNA or zzso After zzso 1 zzso zzso products were identified by zzso as a single zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso band whereas zzso products migrated as two zzso the zzso band zzso to the W zzso and the zzso band zzso to the zzso zzso The relationship between the zzso zzso product versus the ratio zzso zzso cells obtained in zzso amplification of artificial cell zzso was expressed by a statistically significant linear zzso This indicated that the zzso zzso ratio depends mainly upon the ratio between the two cell types in the preparation to be zzso Therefore it is possible to determine the percentage of donor cells in zzso of zzso transplanted with normal stem cells by comparing the amplification ratio obtained with DNA extracted from the zzso with the ratio obtained in standard zzso zzso As applications of the technique, we determined the percentage of zzso cells in zzso blood zzso in preparations of zzso B, T and zzso cells and in zzso colonies cultured from the zzso of zzso mice transplanted with zzso stem zzso
