It is generally accepted that zzso zzso zzso are derived from red zzso but whether they are secondary zzso equivalent to zzso of zzso zzso or zzso or are zzso zzso derived from one of the other secondary zzso has not yet been completely zzso As secondary zzso zzso gene zzso should mirror that of nuclear zzso while zzso in the two zzso should be anticipated if their origin was as zzso zzso We have analyzed the zzso of zzso genes from zzso as well as that of zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes zzso in all other zzso zzso zzso Our analyses place the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso firmly in the red zzso zzso and in particular, the close relationship between zzso zzso genes and their zzso zzso zzso is consistent with the hypothesis that red zzso zzso have arisen only once in zzso
