A previously established method for the identification of promoters recognized by a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a particular zzso factor was used to identify promoters dependent upon a zzso specific zzso factor, zzso of zzso zzso Three new positive DNA fragments were identified, and these putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contained sequences similar to the consensus sequence of zzso and zzso zzso However, only zzso was active in zzso zzso The promoter was induced at the time of aerial zzso formation, and was inactive in an zzso zzso strain with an zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso promoter is recognized by an zzso zzso zzso containing zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis of the region directed by zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with an Mr zzso The deduced protein product showed zzso sequence similarity to the zzso compound zzso of zzso zzso
