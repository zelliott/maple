zzso of zzso including the zzso zzso result in the brain zzso zzso which is characterized by reduced zzso and cortical zzso however, the zzso can vary from isolated zzso sequence zzso to zzso syndrome zzso At the clinical level, these two zzso can be differentiated by the presence of significant zzso facial features and a more severe grade of zzso in zzso Previous work has suggested that children with zzso have a larger deletion than those with zzso but the precise boundaries of the zzso critical region and zzso genes other than zzso have never been fully zzso We have completed a physical and zzso map of the zzso region from zzso to the zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso we have mapped the deletion size in 19 children with zzso 11 children with zzso and 4 children with zzso deletions not involving zzso We show that the critical region that zzso zzso from zzso at the molecular level can be reduced to 400 zzso Using zzso cell hybrids from selected patients, we have identified eight genes that are consistently deleted in patients classified as having zzso In addition, deletion of the genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso patients with the most severe zzso zzso On the basis of recent functional data and the creation of a mouse model suggesting a role for zzso zzso in cortical development, we suggest that deletion of one or both of these genes in combination with deletion of zzso may contribute to the more severe form of zzso seen only in patients with zzso
