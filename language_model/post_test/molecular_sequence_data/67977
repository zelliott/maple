The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso mosaic virus zzso was partially zzso from infected leaves of zzso zzso The membrane fraction of crude plant extracts contained most of the zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso was obtained by zzso of the zzso using zzso and zzso and by zzso through a zzso zzso The zzso template zzso to zzso preparations could be removed using zzso zzso but the resulting fraction was unable to copy added template zzso from zzso zzso However, supplementation of zzso containing zzso activity with zzso zzso resulted in a significant decrease in the level of zzso zzso This effect was specific to zzso zzso since a similar interference was also observed with zzso yellow mosaic virus zzso but not with zzso mosaic virus zzso or zzso zzso zzso transcripts corresponding to various regions of the zzso zzso were tested for their ability to inhibit zzso synthesis on zzso zzso The simultaneous presence of both zzso and 3' terminal regions of the viral zzso was necessary to interfere with zzso synthesis suggesting that this zzso resulted from competition for the binding of zzso of the zzso zzso
