zzso and zzso members of the large zzso family of zzso regulate diverse aspects of both normal and zzso growth and specific gene zzso These two proteins differ at 9 of the 14 zzso acids that comprise the basic zzso necessary for DNA binding and zzso zzso Individual zzso acids in the zzso basic domain were zzso to those found at the analogous positions in zzso Four classes of zzso were zzso zzso those with no effects on zzso binding or zzso of zzso zzso zzso those with no effect on zzso binding but with a loss of zzso potential, zzso those with a loss of both DNA binding and zzso potential, and zzso one zzso zzso 9, zzso that left zzso binding unaffected but imparted a new zzso binding zzso zzso 9 zzso with zzso protein for the zzso of zzso reporter genes but could, like zzso also suppress the zzso zzso promoter, which contains a zzso binding zzso Our studies thus identify specific zzso acid zzso in the zzso basic domain that are important for its activity as a zzso zzso zzso Most significantly, our results with zzso 9 indicate that zzso of zzso is a critical zzso of specific DNA binding and that zzso at this zzso can alter this zzso
