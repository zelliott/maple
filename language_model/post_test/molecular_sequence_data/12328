There is now firm evidence that water transporting proteins are expressed in zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso and collecting duct zzso water channels have been zzso We have cloned three kidney zzso with zzso to the water channel zzso family, including a zzso water channel zzso and a zzso protein zzso in collecting duct zzso zzso To zzso water transporting mechanisms, a series of molecular and zzso studies were carried out on zzso zzso protein and expressed zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso water zzso that zzso zzso are assembled in zzso as zzso but that individual zzso function zzso zzso contain multiple zzso zzso zzso Based on these data and recent electron zzso results, a model for water transport is proposed in which water moves through narrow pores located within individual zzso zzso
