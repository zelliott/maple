zzso oxide is a short-lived zzso zzso for diverse cell zzso zzso of an zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso in zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso In human zzso zzso activity is induced by treatment with a combination of tumor necrosis factor, zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso We now report the molecular cloning and expression of an zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso acid sequence zzso to zzso zzso zzso Like other zzso zzso recognition sites for zzso zzso and zzso are present, as well as a consensus zzso binding zzso zzso activity in human zzso kidney cells zzso with zzso zzso is diminished by zzso zzso and a zzso zzso reflecting a zzso dependence not evident for zzso Northern zzso analysis with zzso zzso reveals a zzso zzso in both human zzso and zzso smooth muscle cells following stimulation with zzso and zzso Human zzso Southern blots zzso with human zzso and human zzso zzso zzso clones display different zzso restriction zzso fragments, suggesting distinct gene products for these zzso zzso zzso appears to be an zzso form of zzso that is distinct from zzso as well as brain and zzso zzso zzso
