A range of bacteria and zzso produce zzso zzso zzso structures that function as zzso devices in order to maintain a suitable depth in the zzso zzso The wall of these gas zzso is freely permeable to gas molecules and is composed of a small zzso zzso zzso which forms a zzso zzso In addition, several minor zzso accessory or regulatory proteins are required for gas zzso zzso In different organisms, zzso genes zzso gas zzso proteins have been identified, and their expression has been shown to be regulated by environmental zzso In this Review, I describe the basic properties of gas zzso the genes that zzso them and how their production is zzso I also discuss the function of these zzso and the initial attempts to exploit them for zzso zzso
