We have generated zzso of bovine zzso type 1 E6 zzso that are defective for zzso zzso and have analyzed these zzso for transformation of zzso cells and association with the zzso protein zzso These zzso zzso demonstrate that transformation by zzso does not require zzso zzso and that association of zzso with zzso is a function zzso from zzso zzso by zzso Association of zzso with zzso appears to be necessary but not sufficient for transformation by zzso In addition, the zzso analysis of zzso demonstrates that zzso zzso and association with zzso all require sequences throughout the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso E6 proteins do not have a simple domain zzso
