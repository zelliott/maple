We have developed a simple and renewable zzso zzso based on carbon paste zzso zzso for the detection of DNA synthesis and zzso zzso was modified with gold zzso zzso which are helpful for zzso of zzso zzso zzso were characterized by scanning electron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso of the zzso gene was formed on zzso The zzso of the probe and its zzso with the target DNA was zzso using different experimental zzso The modified zzso was characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso response of zzso zzso and DNA synthesis was measured using differential pulse zzso zzso with zzso blue zzso as an zzso zzso The new zzso can distinguish between complementary and zzso strands of zzso zzso zzso DNA was extracted from blood and was detected based on changes in the zzso reduction zzso These results demonstrated that the new zzso could be used for sex zzso The proposed zzso in this study could be used for detection and discrimination of zzso chain reaction zzso products of zzso zzso
