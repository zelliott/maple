zzso are zzso modified during zzso zzso as specific zzso patterns are established, and during zzso and zzso zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but the biological significance of each of these is not well zzso For example, distinct zzso patterns correlate with zzso formation and with zzso activated or silenced zzso yet zzso in genes zzso several zzso zzso zzso zzso activities result in either no cellular zzso or only modest growth zzso Here we report characterization of zzso an essential gene that is a member of the zzso family that includes two zzso zzso zzso human genes associated with leukemia and with the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso a gene essential for male dosage zzso zzso zzso zzso in a pattern distinct from those of other zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso abolish zzso activity in zzso and result in partial loss of an zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso carrying these zzso are also blocked in the cell cycle such that at restrictive temperatures, zzso zzso succeed in replicating their DNA but fail to proceed normally through zzso and zzso Recent studies show that zzso enhances zzso in zzso and thus may zzso expression of genes important for cell cycle zzso These observations therefore link an essential zzso activity to cell cycle zzso potentially through discrete zzso regulatory zzso
