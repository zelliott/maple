Five zzso of zzso zzso were identified from zzso in zzso dog, cat, zzso and zzso feces using zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso A was present in cattle and zzso feces, zzso C and D were present in dog feces, zzso E was present in cattle and sheep feces, and zzso F was present in cat zzso zzso virus, originally referred to as zzso zzso virus zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso designed for the zzso zzso protein gene identified zzso sequences in zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso and from a dog zzso zzso Two distinct zzso sequences were identified in the dog zzso and 1 sequence was identified in the zzso zzso None of these zzso sequences was identical with previously published zzso zzso It appears that zzso are genetically diverse and that more than 1 zzso can be present in a single zzso Because many of the specimens that contained zzso were found to be negative for zzso it appears that this test for zzso protein is of limited value for the purposes of detecting zzso zzso
