We report here the isolation and zzso organization of the zzso mouse zzso zzso named zzso It is a single copy gene located in zzso 1 in a region zzso to the human zzso gene zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso consists of two zzso zzso 1 of 55 zzso which encodes 7 zzso acid zzso and zzso 2 of zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso The single zzso consists of zzso zzso The zzso promoter region contains motifs involved in zzso development in addition to potential binding sites of factors for zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso shows zzso zzso with the human zzso zzso However, mouse zzso are zzso zzso and mouse zzso membrane proteins do not zzso with two zzso rabbit zzso zzso The deduced protein predicts a zzso of zzso and carries three potential zzso sites to zzso zzso zzso analysis predicts an zzso zzso domain of 57 zzso seven zzso zzso and an zzso zzso domain of 29 zzso In bone zzso and zzso zzso expresses a major zzso and a minor zzso zzso zzso to humans, zzso is expressed in liver, zzso a zzso zzso and is zzso in zzso zzso is highly expressed in mouse brain and produces a major zzso and a minor zzso zzso The human zzso zzso cells, zzso with zzso zzso the mouse zzso protein and mouse zzso have the same zzso binding profiles indicating that they contain the same zzso
