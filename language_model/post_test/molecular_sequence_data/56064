zzso T zzso zzso recognize peptides in association with major zzso complex zzso class I zzso but how peptides bind to class I is not well zzso We used a zzso technique to measure zzso zzso binding to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso heavy chain was connected by a zzso link to beta zzso zzso were zzso labeled at their N zzso with zzso and binding of zzso zzso peptides to zzso resulted in significant zzso enhancement, which could be inhibited by unmodified zzso zzso zzso binding of a zzso zzso could be followed by monitoring the zzso at zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso with an association rate constant of zzso zzso and the subsequent spontaneous zzso of the zzso complex was zzso The zzso increased dramatically after addition of excess zzso zzso zzso zzso but with a slower association constant for zzso zzso 77 zzso Thus, the zzso complex on the surface of zzso cells should be stable, but high zzso of peptides in the zzso zzso zzso zzso would allow for zzso exchange on zzso before export to the zzso The apparent zzso energy for zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to values previously reported for zzso zzso
