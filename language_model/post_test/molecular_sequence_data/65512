zzso is a zzso zzso that adds zzso DNA repeat sequences to the ends of linear zzso The zzso plays pivotal roles in cellular zzso and aging, and because it provides a zzso maintenance mechanism for approximately zzso of human zzso it is a promising target for cancer zzso Despite its importance, a high-resolution structure of the zzso zzso has been zzso although a crystal structure of an zzso domain zzso of the zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso from zzso has been zzso In this study, we used a comparative strategy, in which zzso machine learning approaches were integrated with zzso structural zzso to explore the potential conservation of structural and functional features of zzso in zzso diverse zzso We generated structural models of the zzso zzso from human and zzso zzso using a combination of zzso and zzso modeling with the zzso zzso structure as a zzso Comparative analysis of predicted and zzso verified DNA and zzso binding zzso in the context of these structures, revealed significant similarities in zzso acid binding surfaces of zzso and human zzso zzso In addition, the combined evidence from machine learning and structural modeling identified several specific zzso acids that are likely to play a role in binding DNA or zzso but for which no experimental evidence is currently zzso
