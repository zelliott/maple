Nuclear factors zzso and zzso form a complex involved in a variety of cellular processes and are thought to affect gene expression both at the zzso and zzso zzso In addition, this complex affects the replication of several viruses through direct interactions with viral zzso zzso and zzso zzso through their common zzso domain zzso associated with zinc zzso zzso has additional zzso zzso zzso that likely mediate its association with target zzso We present the crystal structure of the zzso zzso complex at zzso zzso The zzso domain shows structural similarity to the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso However, both zzso and zzso have lost critical zzso zzso during evolution and are therefore not functional zzso zzso on zzso that make up its interface with zzso are zzso in two related zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Using a zzso zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso is also able to recognize zzso and zzso through the same binding zzso revealing that zzso is able to form a variety of cellular complexes with other zzso zzso
