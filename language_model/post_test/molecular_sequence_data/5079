zzso is a zzso zzso expressed in several zzso steroid target zzso including the human zzso where it zzso zzso steroids such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To determine if zzso is regulated by zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso were demonstrated to specifically zzso the zzso levels of zzso transcript and protein in zzso cells zzso et zzso zzso These results zzso regulation of zzso at the level of gene transcription, therefore, a zzso artificial zzso zzso clone of 120 zzso containing the entire zzso gene was zzso The gene is comprised of six zzso spanning approximately 30 zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso clone to normal human zzso zzso mapped the gene to zzso zzso To determine if the zzso DNA of the zzso gene is sufficient to zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso was zzso into a zzso reporter zzso and yielded an activity of zzso over background when zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso of the construct into zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells yielded only a moderate activity of two- to zzso over zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells with 10 zzso zzso a zzso analog of zzso and 10 zzso zzso decreased the zzso activity by zzso This suggests that at least part, if not all, of the zzso effect of zzso and zzso on zzso is at the level of zzso Progressive zzso deletions of the zzso zzso region in the zzso zzso alleviated the zzso by zzso and zzso and revealed several potential responsive elements that may zzso the observed regulation of the zzso zzso This study demonstrates regulation of the zzso gene by zzso zzso of the human prostate and supports the hypothesis that zzso zzso are involved in steroid metabolism in zzso zzso
