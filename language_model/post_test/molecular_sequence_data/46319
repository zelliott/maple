In this study, we evaluated the possible zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso We determined that expression of zzso zzso protein was reduced when zzso activity was zzso and this effect was not partially due to altered zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso this reduction in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso protects zzso from zzso We hypothesized that the zzso protection of zzso could be due to zzso zzso As a putative small zzso modifier zzso site was identified in the zzso zzso we assessed whether zzso zzso with zzso We identified a zzso protein that was compatible with the size of a zzso complex and was recognized by the zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the specific zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso with zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso both in zzso and in zzso and this interaction depended on zzso zzso This requirement for zzso was further evaluated in zzso zzso and zzso in which zzso expression was zzso In zzso our results suggest that zzso zzso protects zzso from zzso degradation and zzso its binding to zzso in zzso zzso
