The zzso and complete gene zzso mouse acid zzso zzso has been isolated using a zzso screening zzso zzso with the human sequence shows zzso sequence identity at zzso level and zzso at the protein zzso zzso is markedly reduced in the zzso region, especially in the presumed signal zzso The zzso gene structure is similar to the human one, except for the position of zzso zzso The alternatively used zzso site 40 zzso downstream of the human zzso 2 is not zzso in the mouse gene and accordingly no such alternative zzso was found in zzso
