A zzso regulated zzso activity is present on the surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso stages display no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of transferring zzso acids from a variety of zzso into new zzso linkages without requirement for zzso The zzso is linked to the zzso via a zzso zzso The comparison of zzso and structural features of zzso and zzso suggests that the two activities may be zzso by the same zzso since highly enriched zzso zzso display zzso zzso zzso acid is only a poor inhibitor for the two zzso zzso zzso acids are transferred to alpha zzso of terminal zzso zzso of zzso and zzso at various zzso zzso is the best zzso donor zzso Lewis is a poor zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso human and bovine zzso as zzso acid donors, and zzso zzso zzso The zzso transfers zzso acids from the zzso of zzso zzso repetitive protein zzso onto zzso and vice zzso Also structures within a zzso surface zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso
