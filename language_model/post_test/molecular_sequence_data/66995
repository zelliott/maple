The best known property of plant zzso inhibitor II zzso genes is their zzso expression in leaves and zzso expression in zzso Here we show by promoter analysis in transgenic plants and in zzso reverse zzso zzso analysis that zzso a member of the zzso gene family of zzso zzso zzso is also zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso promoter and its deletions were cloned and fused upstream of zzso zzso to transform the zzso and tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso was expressed zzso in zzso zzso predominantly in the zzso cells, of both transgenic zzso and tobacco zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso was further confirmed by liquid phase in zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso analysis from the zzso end of the zzso promoter revealed that separate regulatory elements control zzso expression in zzso cells and stalk cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso expression was significantly increased in transgenic plant leaves after mechanical wounding or zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter sequence contains six zzso motifs and an zzso box that are involved in zzso differentiation and zzso zzso of zzso in tobacco resulted in a significant increase in zzso zzso density and promotion of zzso zzso These results suggest that, as well as being an induced defensive protein of the well-known zzso family, zzso could also play roles in zzso defense by functioning as a zzso component of zzso chemical defense and/or by regulating the development of zzso zzso
