zzso coli has eight genes predicted to zzso zzso having the active site consensus sequence zzso One of these zzso zzso is frequently found within bacterial zzso that contain zzso the zzso zzso zzso suggesting a role in zzso zzso We show that zzso is required in zzso for the specific substitution of zzso for sulfur in zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso This modified zzso zzso zzso zzso is located at the zzso position of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso strains revealed that production of zzso is lost in the zzso zzso but that zzso the zzso zzso is unaffected by deletion of zzso Thus, zzso is not required for the initial zzso reaction but rather encodes a zzso zzso that replaces a sulfur atom in zzso in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso tag exhibited spectral properties consistent with zzso bound to the zzso In zzso zzso synthesis is shown to be dependent on zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso (but not zzso in the zzso sequence motif zzso is required for zzso zzso in zzso zzso These data are consistent with the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso and identifies a new role for the zzso zzso domain in zzso
