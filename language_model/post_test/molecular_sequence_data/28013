A unique reaction for type II DNA zzso is its zzso of a pair of DNA strands in zzso We show however, that in a reaction mixture containing a zzso excess of zzso over zzso or when zzso is zzso by zzso zzso or zzso the zzso zzso only one rather than both zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso may play an important role in zzso the two zzso of DNA zzso II during the strand zzso zzso The single strand and the double strand zzso reactions are similar in the following aspects: both require the addition of a protein zzso can be reversed by low temperature or high salt, and a zzso II zzso is attached zzso to the zzso zzso end of each broken DNA zzso Furthermore, the single strand zzso sites share a similar sequence preference with double strand zzso zzso There is, however, a strand bias for the single strand zzso zzso We show also that under single strand zzso conditions, zzso II still possesses a low level of double strand passage activity: it can introduce zzso knots into both zzso closed or zzso DNA rings, and change the linking number of a zzso DNA by steps of zzso The implication of this observation on the sequential zzso of the two strands of the DNA duplex during the normal DNA double strand passage process zzso by type II DNA zzso is zzso
