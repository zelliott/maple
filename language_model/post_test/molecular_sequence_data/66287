zzso parameters of peptides and proteins in zzso can be directly measured by solid state zzso of selectively labeled zzso zzso The zzso nucleus is a promising label to overcome the low sensitivity of zzso zzso or zzso and to serve as a zzso reporter group in biological zzso To make the advantages of solid state zzso zzso fully available for structural studies of zzso we have systematically measured the chemical shift zzso and relaxation properties of the most relevant aromatic and zzso zzso zzso zzso In this first part of two consecutive contributions, six different zzso on representative aromatic side chains were characterized as zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The data are also compared with results on the same zzso acids incorporated in synthetic zzso The zzso show a wide variety of zzso from which the principal values of the zzso zzso were zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso relaxation times were determined by zzso zzso in the solid state, and zzso chemical shifts and zzso zzso were obtained in zzso
