zzso is a re-emerging zzso produced by liver zzso of the zzso zzso In this study we used protein zzso zzso and zzso analysis to investigate the zzso zzso zzso that are recognized by zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso binds to several zzso zzso zzso and zzso but also zzso a zzso protein previously described in zzso zzso which appears to bind to zzso zzso zzso After identifying the target zzso for zzso zzso we cloned and expressed a zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso which after zzso exhibited the zzso zzso and displayed zzso zzso zzso Using native, zzso and zzso zzso zzso L as targets, we demonstrated that during zzso zzso infections in zzso zzso responses to linear and zzso zzso present on zzso L are zzso However, the zzso response to linear zzso was only detected in significant amounts in animals suffering from repeated zzso A different zzso response to linear and zzso zzso also appears to occur in rabbits zzso with native or zzso unfolded zzso as zzso from animals zzso with the latter did not react with native zzso and vice zzso In addition, the zzso inhibitions showed that the zzso zzso is not recognized by zzso which explains the usefulness of these species for producing capture zzso for use in zzso zzso
