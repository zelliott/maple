The interplay of zzso zzso and zzso changes in the zzso Mountains region zzso have had a key role in zzso and population zzso To gain further insight into these zzso we investigated their effects on zzso zzso by combining molecular zzso and species distribution zzso zzso data were obtained from 43 populations of zzso zzso zzso zzso variables were analyzed alongside genetic zzso Species distribution modeling was carried out to predict potential past distribution zzso Two distinct lineages were identified, which zzso zzso zzso zzso million years ago zzso a zzso that zzso well with the recent zzso of the zzso zzso and subsequent zzso changes of the zzso zzso with zzso variables also suggest that ecological factors may have further reinforced the separation of the two zzso Both lineages experienced population expansion during the last zzso The high genetic zzso long-term isolation and ecological differentiation suggest a scenario of cryptic zzso in zzso zzso associated with geological and zzso changes in the zzso Our findings also challenge the notion of general population zzso during the last zzso in the zzso
