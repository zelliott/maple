The human zzso virus zzso protein binds specifically to an zzso zzso structure zzso that contains two zzso stem regions separated by a zzso zzso A single zzso within the basic region of zzso mediates specific binding to zzso and zzso as the free zzso acid also binds specifically to zzso We have previously proposed a model in which interaction of the zzso zzso group with zzso zzso and with a pair of zzso is stabilized by formation of a base triple between zzso in the zzso and zzso in the upper zzso Here we show by zzso zzso that formation of the base triple is critical for zzso binding to zzso zzso of zzso that cannot form the base triple or that remove the zzso contact do not bind zzso zzso These zzso also showed reduced zzso by zzso A triple zzso designed to form an zzso base triple between zzso and zzso binds zzso and adopts the same zzso as zzso zzso These results demonstrate the importance of zzso structure for zzso binding and further demonstrate the direct correspondence between zzso and zzso zzso
