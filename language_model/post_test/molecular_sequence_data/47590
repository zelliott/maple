The gene zzso an zzso zzso was cloned from an zzso zzso strain zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family and composed of 317 zzso acid zzso with a molecular weight of zzso The zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso protein was zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence analysis indicated that the zzso zzso was removed from its zzso The good agreement of the molecular weights estimated by zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso suggests that it acts in a zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activity towards zzso zzso of fatty acids with an zzso chain length of 2 to 14 and zzso whereas it showed little zzso activity towards zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the kinetic parameters for the zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso to zzso indicated that zzso shows a relatively broad zzso zzso However, comparison of the zzso values indicated that the zzso zzso are the most preferred zzso Such a preference for zzso with long zzso chains may be a characteristic of zzso
