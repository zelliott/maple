zzso cells and some T cells express members of a zzso family of killer cell zzso receptors zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso family that recognize zzso class I zzso molecules on target cells and transmit an zzso signal to prevent killer zzso zzso The zzso sequences of zzso zzso family members reported so far suggest that the zzso zzso gene consists of a zzso complex and that each gene may exhibit certain degrees of zzso However, it is not clear how diverse the repertoire of the zzso zzso family is, particularly in a single zzso To address this question in more detail and to determine some indication as to the origin of the diversity, we cloned zzso zzso zzso from a single zzso We identified nine new zzso that are different from the previously reported zzso A comparison of the zzso acid sequences with published sequences of zzso zzso showed that two clones belonged to the zzso family, five clones belonged to the zzso family, one clone belonged to the zzso family, and one clone appeared to be an alternatively spliced form of zzso zzso These results suggested that the repertoire of zzso zzso family members in a single individual is highly zzso It is not clear how the diverse receptors are generated in a single individual, but a comparison of zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso family members suggested that some of them may be zzso by distinct genes or their zzso while others may be generated by a zzso mechanism and/or an alternative zzso mechanism at the maturation of the zzso zzso
