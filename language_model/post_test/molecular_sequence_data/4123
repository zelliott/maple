The zzso zzso zzso in human acute zzso leukemia results in the fusion of the zzso and zzso zzso The latter codes for a novel zzso zzso zzso one of many zzso fusion partners of unknown zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso zzso of an zzso complementary DNA into primary zzso zzso zzso enhanced their zzso potential in serial zzso zzso and led to their efficient zzso at a primitive stage of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells rapidly induced acute zzso leukemia in zzso or severe combined zzso recipient zzso zzso analysis showed that a highly zzso zzso acid portion of zzso zzso 2 adjacent zzso zzso was sufficient for zzso activity when fused to zzso Neither zzso domain alone zzso zzso and deletion of the zzso acid zzso zzso within this region completely zzso transforming zzso Similarly, the minimal zzso domain of zzso exhibited zzso zzso properties when fused to the zzso or zzso zzso zzso while neither zzso domain alone zzso However, zzso zzso per zzso was not sufficient because a second zzso domain of zzso was neither required nor competent for zzso The requirement for zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar to the zzso contributions of unrelated zzso partners zzso and zzso suggesting a general mechanism of zzso zzso by a subset of zzso fusion zzso possibly through specific recruitment of the zzso zzso
