We analyzed the distribution of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in 48 zzso arthritis zzso patients, compared with 109 Italian random controls, using zzso amplification and zzso with specific zzso We confirm the previously reported increase of zzso zzso in comparison with healthy Italian zzso In particular, we find a statistically significant positive association of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso However, when we compare the zzso groups, none of the zzso zzso is increased in the zzso zzso By sequence analysis, performed on 10 patients, we demonstrate that the zzso genes of zzso show no difference from the zzso sequences previously zzso From the molecular analysis of the other zzso zzso zzso we find a trend of positive association of zzso in zzso patients versus zzso healthy controls and, in the group of zzso and/or zzso patients, a similar increase of zzso Also, we observe in zzso patients a statistically significant increase of zzso and zzso accompanied by a significant decrease of zzso zzso and zzso Finally, from the analysis of zzso zzso it can be assessed that the distribution of zzso zzso does not differ significantly between zzso patients and healthy zzso
