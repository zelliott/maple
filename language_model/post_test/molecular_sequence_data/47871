zzso a 47 zzso zzso protein of zzso strains of zzso is a human zzso zzso and contains three structural zzso linked by flexible zzso We describe here the crystal structure of the isolated zzso middle zzso domain determined at zzso A zzso Among the functionally important structural features is a putative binding site for a zzso domain of zzso located at the tip of a fully exposed hairpin zzso The distribution of genetically zzso zzso of zzso is strongly correlated with their zzso The extensive interface of the zzso zzso suggests that such zzso may also exist in solution for free zzso
