The zzso zzso zzso gene expression site of zzso zzso was cloned from zzso libraries of the 200 zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso it contains seven putative coding regions zzso for expression zzso zzso as well as a zzso zzso The zzso zzso by zzso 4 shows zzso to zzso zzso zzso and possesses structural features of a zzso zzso The expression site is transcribed by a pol zzso zzso in the zzso zzso form only, but sequences similar to zzso 5, 4, and 2 are also transcribed zzso elsewhere, by a zzso sensitive to zzso zzso zzso which seems to block zzso processing, allows the tentative mapping of a zzso promoter about 45 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso
