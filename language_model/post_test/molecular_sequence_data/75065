Several clones zzso with a bovine zzso zzso zzso were isolated from an adult human liver zzso library in the zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that these clones zzso two distinct forms of zzso In particular, two clones specifying the zzso zzso of the protein exhibit a zzso zzso acid sequence divergence and totally dissimilar 3' untranslated zzso One of these zzso is nearly identical in sequence to an zzso zzso clone zzso recently isolated from a human zzso zzso library zzso zzso Ferrari, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with three zzso acid changes and a few differences in the 3' untranslated zzso Another clone isolated from the zzso library contains a reading frame zzso the remaining, zzso 37 zzso acids of the zzso This sequence differs significantly zzso zzso acid sequence zzso from the corresponding segment of zzso and the zzso untranslated regions of the two clones are totally zzso zzso transfer zzso experiments utilizing the clones isolated from the zzso library revealed the presence in zzso cells of three distinct zzso zzso The pattern of zzso and the sizes of these zzso suggest a greater complexity of organization and expression of the zzso zzso genes in human cells than indicated by the analysis of the zzso zzso
