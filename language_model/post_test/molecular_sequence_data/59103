zzso of zzso zzso zzso the first zzso in the zzso branch of the zzso zzso zzso in plants, is induced by zzso cues and environmental zzso We used plant transformation technology to delineate the functional structure of the French bean zzso gene promoter during plant zzso In the absence of an efficient transformation procedure for zzso zzso zzso was used as the model zzso zzso promoter activity, evaluated by zzso of zzso zzso activity, revealed a zzso pattern of expression similar to that reported for zzso genes in zzso zzso activity was observed in flowers and root zzso Floral expression was confined to the pigmented part of petals and was induced in a transient zzso Fine mapping of promoter zzso was accomplished using a set of promoter zzso generated by zzso deletions or by zzso zzso zzso floral and zzso expression was found to require sequence elements located on both sides of the zzso Two adjacent sequence zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso located near the zzso were both essential for floral zzso and were also found to be important for zzso zzso The zzso promoter is regulated by a complex interplay between different zzso and their zzso zzso The conservation of both the zzso and zzso in different zzso promoters emphasizes their importance as regulatory zzso
