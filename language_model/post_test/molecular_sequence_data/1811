Type 1 diabetes zzso at the zzso locus was previously mapped to a variable number tandem repeat zzso zzso of the insulin gene zzso However, the observation of associated markers outside a zzso zzso previously considered to define the limits of zzso association, raised the possibility that the zzso association might result from linkage zzso zzso with an unknown zzso We therefore identified a total of 177 zzso and obtained zzso for 75 of these in up to 434 zzso We found that, whereas disease zzso did map to within the zzso region, there were two equally likely candidates for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition to the zzso Further analyses in zzso zzso did not support the difference in association between zzso lineages that had previously enabled the exclusion of these two zzso zzso we were unable to rule out zzso and zzso having an zzso zzso Our mapping results using robust zzso methods show how precisely a zzso for a common disease can be zzso even within a region of strong zzso and specifically that zzso maps to one or more of three common zzso in a approximately zzso region of zzso zzso
