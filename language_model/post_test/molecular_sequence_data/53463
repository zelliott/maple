zzso I is a critical component of the synaptic machinery that senses calcium influx and triggers synaptic zzso fusion and neurotransmitter zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies conducted on zzso demonstrate that calcium zzso required for fusion induce a zzso change zzso approximately 3 zzso that brings the two zzso C2 zzso in zzso closer zzso zzso zzso studies reveal that zzso is zzso under these conditions, indicating that this zzso association between the C2 zzso is zzso rather than zzso These results suggest a mechanism for zzso function at the zzso plasma membrane that involves the zzso of C2 zzso
