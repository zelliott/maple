We have previously demonstrated that the zzso zzso is a potent and specific zzso of zzso acid zzso in both the rat and the zzso Using conventional solution phase methodology, the analogue zzso was prepared in reasonable yield and purity and applied to zzso sections of rat zzso and other zzso The sections were exposed to zzso zzso of zzso and the bound analogue was zzso using zzso The binding of the analogue was demonstrated in sections from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the analogue failed to bind to tissue from the zzso heart, zzso or zzso The binding of the probe was greatly reduced or completely inhibited by zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso The distribution of the cells zzso by the probe was consistent with the distribution of zzso zzso zzso The results of this study may have some bearing on current theories of the mechanism of zzso acid zzso
