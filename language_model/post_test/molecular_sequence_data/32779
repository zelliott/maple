The primary function of the zzso C virus zzso core protein is zzso zzso Core protein is also subject to zzso modifications that can impact on the assembly zzso In this report, we have studied the effect of zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso on its assembly and stability in a zzso zzso zzso expression zzso We have recently shown that zzso of the human signal zzso zzso and core protein zzso acids zzso in zzso leads to the formation of zzso particles zzso that are zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso In this system, we expressed zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso to abolish or mimic zzso zzso zzso None of these zzso affected zzso zzso but zzso led to the degradation of core zzso We also showed that zzso zzso were zzso in zzso by zzso suggesting that the zzso sites are available at the surface of the zzso The zzso of human zzso with core and human signal zzso zzso in zzso did not produce zzso zzso and led to a decreased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso restored the core protein zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso can zzso zzso core levels in infected zzso
