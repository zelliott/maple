zzso zzso complexes were formed with zzso zzso zzso I using a zzso zzso primer zzso to initiate zzso on short synthetic zzso DNA zzso The templates were designed to limit the incorporation of a zzso zzso zzso to a single unique position at the 3' zzso of the product zzso zzso 12, 13, 14, or zzso The resulting zzso complexes were zzso to zzso the bound transcript zzso with zzso to the protein with the probe located at the zzso zzso zzso of the protein zzso components by zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and analysis by zzso and silver zzso revealed that the two largest zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The ratio of zzso labeling zzso decreased as the zzso transcript increased from 12 to 15 zzso in zzso This decrease in ratio resulted from a progressive reduction of zzso zzso labeling while the zzso zzso zzso remained essentially zzso It was also observed that the DNA template was zzso
