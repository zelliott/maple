A double stranded zzso containing a single zzso in a defined location was used to investigate DNA strand breakage resulting from zzso zzso zzso of a 41 zzso zzso were incubated in 20 zzso zzso buffer zzso or zzso plus 2 M zzso zzso at 4 degrees C during zzso zzso The zzso zzso DNA fragments produced by zzso zzso were separated on zzso zzso gels, and the zzso activity in each zzso was determined by zzso counting after zzso of fragments from zzso Most of the breaks, around zzso occurred within 4-5 zzso of the zzso but DNA breaks were detected up to 16 zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso was located at the 21st zzso from the zzso label, and since zzso was not detected in fragments longer than 20 zzso it was assumed that all zzso zzso events produce at least one break in the zzso DNA zzso The results show a considerable protection effect of zzso on DNA breaks at sites zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The probability of breaks in this region was decreased with zzso by a factor of 2 to zzso suggesting significant role for zzso DNA breaks at the more distant zzso However, the total protection effect of zzso is rather zzso zzso because of the small contribution of breakage at distant sites to the total zzso
