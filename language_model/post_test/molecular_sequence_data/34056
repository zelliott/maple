The zzso and zzso strains of zzso zzso each produce family 98 zzso zzso called zzso and zzso respectively, which have different modular zzso and zzso zzso zzso degrades the zzso zzso and possesses three zzso family 47 zzso zzso zzso that bind to this zzso zzso degrades the blood group zzso zzso and has two zzso family 51 zzso that are of unknown zzso Here, we examine the complex zzso specificity of the family 51 zzso from zzso zzso to as zzso and zzso the structural basis of this interaction, and the overall solution zzso of both zzso and zzso which are shown to be fully zzso zzso Through zzso zzso binding analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso is found to bind specifically to the blood group zzso zzso However, due to a series of relatively small structural zzso that were revealed in structures determined by X-ray zzso zzso appears to be incapable of binding zzso Analysis of zzso X-ray scattering data in combination with the available high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and their zzso yielded models of the biological solution structures of the full-length zzso These studies reveal the complex zzso of the two zzso and suggest that zzso recognition by the zzso and the activity of the zzso zzso are not directly zzso
