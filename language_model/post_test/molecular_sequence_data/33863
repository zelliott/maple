In zzso accurate zzso segregation during zzso and zzso is coordinated by zzso which are unique zzso sites for zzso zzso zzso specify the zzso formation sites on individual zzso and are zzso marked by the assembly of zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the underlying mechanism is zzso zzso inheritance is probably dictated by the architecture of the zzso zzso Here we report the crystal structure of the human zzso zzso containing zzso and its zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso base zzso In the human zzso zzso the DNA is wrapped around the zzso zzso consisting of two each of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a left-handed zzso However, unlike the zzso zzso zzso only the central 121 base pairs of the DNA are zzso The thirteen base pairs from both ends of the DNA are invisible in the crystal structure, and the zzso zzso of zzso is shorter than that of zzso which is known to be important for the orientation of the DNA ends in the zzso zzso zzso A structural comparison of the zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso contains two extra zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso in the loop 1 region, which is completely exposed to the zzso zzso of the zzso loop 1 zzso reduced zzso retention at the zzso in human zzso zzso the zzso loop 1 may function in stabilizing the zzso zzso containing zzso possibly by providing a binding site for zzso zzso The structure provides the first zzso picture of the zzso zzso
