The zzso system is one of 13 zzso zzso systems of the human pathogen zzso zzso zzso in the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso increased resistance to zzso antibiotics and interfere with the development of genetic zzso In order to identify the genes controlled by the zzso system, the zzso zzso DNA fragments targeted by the response regulator zzso were isolated from restricted zzso DNA using the zzso DNA binding zzso and analyzed by zzso to an zzso zzso representing the zzso zzso zzso A set of 18 zzso regions containing 26 zzso target sites were detected and proposed to represent the minimal zzso zzso The putative zzso target zzso included genes important for the synthesis and modification of cell wall zzso zzso zzso and zzso production, and the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso profile of zzso zzso zzso and those with an apparent activated zzso system representing the off and on states of the regulatory system were zzso The transcript analysis confirmed the zzso expression of seven putative target zzso and revealed three additional zzso zzso Five putative target regions were silent under all conditions, and for the remaining three regions, no zzso expression could be zzso Furthermore, the competence zzso including the zzso zzso required for induction of zzso was completely zzso by the zzso zzso
