zzso zzso bacteria zzso are zzso bacteria that are commonly found attached to the zzso walls of many zzso Until now, these bacteria have not been cultured in zzso Recently, a zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that zzso isolated from mice represent a distinct zzso within the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Since zzso isolated from mice, rats, and chickens are known to be host specific, we investigated the zzso relationships among zzso obtained from these three zzso Total zzso from the zzso zzso of chickens and rats were used as templates for zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso products were cloned and screened by a dot zzso zzso procedure to identify zzso sequences that zzso with mouse zzso zzso zzso A zzso analysis of these zzso zzso DNA sequences revealed that zzso isolated from these three hosts form a natural group, which is peripherally related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso The zzso obtained from zzso rats, and mice had closely zzso albeit different, zzso zzso gene zzso The observed levels of zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso to zzso together with host zzso suggest that zzso isolated from mice, rats, and chickens represent different species and that zzso of the zzso and their hosts zzso zzso zzso is proposed as the provisional generic name for this group of zzso
