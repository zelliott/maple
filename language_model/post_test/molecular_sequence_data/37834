zzso radiation and zzso zzso agents induce clustered DNA damage, which are thought to reflect the biological zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso and nuclear extracts from zzso a Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell line, have been used to study the influence on their zzso recognition by the presence of a neighboring damage or an zzso site on the opposite zzso as models of clustered DNA zzso These proteins were tested for their efficiency to induce a zzso break on a zzso zzso containing either an zzso (AP) site, zzso zzso zzso or 7, zzso at positions 1, 3, or 5 base pairs zzso or 3' to either an zzso site or zzso on the labeled zzso zzso zzso is much more affected than zzso of an zzso site by the presence of other zzso The effect on zzso zzso is greatest with a neighboring zzso site, with the effect being zzso with zzso and zzso zzso this large zzso of the zzso of zzso by the presence of an opposite zzso site may minimize the formation of zzso breaks in the processing of DNA clustered zzso
