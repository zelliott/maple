The zzso zzso protein is the product of the human zzso zzso a member of a ubiquitous zzso gene family which is highly zzso in zzso These proteins play an important role in the control of cellular zzso We report here the sequential assignment of the backbone zzso in a truncated form of the zzso gene product, using our recently proposed zzso zzso strategy zzso et zzso zzso These assignments are the first step towards a full investigation of the structure, dynamics and interactions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso Some of the data were presented at the 33rd zzso held at zzso California, zzso in April zzso
