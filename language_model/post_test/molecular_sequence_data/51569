Plasma membrane with its associated zzso proteins was isolated from normal and zzso rat zzso by zzso of the total water zzso fraction from zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso which we call zzso zzso was recovered mainly from the zzso zzso zzso Development of the experimental zzso cataract resulted in plasma membrane shifting to higher density (the zzso zzso zzso and great increases in the zzso soluble protein content of the zzso At early stages of cataract development, most of the increased zzso soluble protein was membrane zzso presumably as zzso zzso With advancing zzso most of the zzso soluble protein appeared in an essentially zzso zzso zzso The zzso soluble protein associated with the cataract membrane was shown by combined zzso zzso Western zzso zzso acid compositional analysis and protein sequence zzso to be mainly composed of modified zzso and zzso Alpha zzso truncated by not more than 27 zzso from the zzso zzso plus beta zzso zzso truncated by 49 zzso from the zzso zzso were zzso zzso In addition to beta zzso a population of six zzso derived zzso were specifically enriched in the cataract membrane zzso Four of these six zzso appear to be truncated from their zzso zzso a modification which should have increased their zzso The zzso zzso which accumulated in the lens nucleus as the cataract advanced, was enriched in zzso soluble zzso derived zzso We suggest that protein zzso in this experimental cataract involves the selective and tight association of principally modified zzso to the fiber cell plasma zzso
