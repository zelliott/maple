During zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity zzso zzso zzso measured as a decrease in zzso of zzso acid, reached a high when the zzso process in the seeded zzso was triggered and the valves had lost more than zzso of their moisture zzso zzso The PG activity was not detected in any zzso of developing zzso This work also characterizes a zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso and that codes for a putative PG called zzso This falls into the category of zzso which includes PG related to shattering and zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence predicted a zzso precursor protein zzso with a transit zzso sequence 23 zzso acids zzso A molecular mass of zzso zzso was calculated for the mature form of zzso which showed high sequence similarity to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso acids at the zzso site of zzso belonging to zzso were preserved on zzso This zzso gene was specifically expressed in the zzso valves of zzso and was temporally expressed at the beginning of its zzso
