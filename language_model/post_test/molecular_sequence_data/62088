Comparative analysis between zzso zzso and other zzso species offers a powerful approach to study gene zzso zzso zzso also has great potential as a surrogate expression system to study the function of genes from zzso zzso species where transgenic zzso are zzso However there is little information on the extent to which the biology of zzso zzso is zzso with other zzso species and very few zzso zzso genes have yet been functionally expressed in zzso zzso We have identified and zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso a central regulator of zzso development, from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso zzso throughout embryonic and zzso development, except for in the zzso zzso stage, and our experiments reveal that the development of the zzso zzso zzso lineage is zzso similar to that of zzso zzso zzso conservation between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso broadly reflects function since the major region of sequence identity zzso to the DNA binding zzso However, the overall level of sequence identity is remarkably low with the only other major region of identity corresponding to an unusual zinc finger zzso In spite of this, zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene in transgenic zzso zzso is sufficient to activate a zzso of zzso differentiation demonstrating that function is highly zzso This approach of zzso expression using an zzso promoter provides an effective way in which to use zzso zzso for the in zzso functional analysis of zzso zzso zzso
