We zzso the complementary DNA zzso zzso guinea pig zzso from an expression library derived from the zzso zzso zzso Data from in zzso zzso and zzso protection zzso verified that the cloned zzso was complementary to guinea pig zzso zzso zzso The architecture of the deduced precursor resembles that of zzso precursors identified in other zzso In contrast, the predicted sequence of the zzso differs from zzso zzso by two zzso acid zzso in positions 2 and zzso This is a novel finding, because the zzso acid sequence that comprises zzso zzso is identical in all zzso studied to zzso Moreover, the predicted substitution in zzso acid position 2 is unique among zzso A second observation of potential significance is the existence of two subspecies of zzso zzso zzso differing only in the length of their 3' untranslated zzso These two transcripts were verified by sequence analysis of positive clones from the zzso library and by zzso protection analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and their presence is consistent with the two zzso signals identified in the untranslated regions of the zzso zzso Future studies will examine zzso gene expression in guinea zzso which like primates but unlike rats, have a true zzso phase as a component of their zzso zzso
