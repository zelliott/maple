To establish a model zzso to study the impact of cornmeal on the appearance and persistence of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

After the model zzso was established, the system was divided into six dose groups, with the addition of 8, 4, 1, zzso zzso and 0 g zzso zzso zzso System mud samples were collected at 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, 40, 61, and 130 zzso and zzso present in the mud samples were evaluated for their sensitivities to zzso and zzso zzso was employed to detect genes such as zzso and zzso The zzso gene was zzso and zzso 83 and 87 were analyzed for zzso 

zzso The addition of zzso g zzso cornmeal had an impact on zzso zzso The higher the dose of cornmeal added, the larger the impact it zzso Furthermore, the earlier the emergence of zzso zzso the greater the zzso of drug zzso The impact of cornmeal on resistance to zzso was less consistent, and the degree of the impact was not in proportion to the dose of cornmeal zzso zzso There were no zzso at zzso 83 and 87 in the zzso genes from 102 strains isolated from the model zzso The zzso of zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso of zzso strains of zzso zzso (16 zzso was zzso 

zzso Adding different doses of cornmeal can facilitate resistance to zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In this study, the degree of resistance was related to the cornmeal zzso zzso In the model ecosystem, zzso zzso resistance was not caused by a zzso gene zzso however, in the vast majority of cases, resistance to zzso was related to the zzso resistance zzso
