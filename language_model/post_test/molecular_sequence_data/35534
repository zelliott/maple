zzso is the most common zzso zzso disease in the world zzso and little is still known about the genetic factors influencing zzso Our previous zzso linkage scan has identified five zzso related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the present study, we fine mapped the zzso locus to identify genetic contributors to zzso zzso Four hundred zzso subjects from 72 zzso with similar cultural and behavioral habits and limited access to dental care living in the Philippines were zzso An additional zzso DNA samples from unrelated individuals were used to determine zzso zzso For replication purposes, a total of zzso independent subjects from four different populations were analyzed based on their zzso experience zzso versus zzso Forty-eight markers in zzso were zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso test was used to detect over transmission of zzso in the Filipino families, and zzso zzso exact and zzso zzso were used to test for association between low zzso experience and zzso zzso in the replication data zzso We finally assessed the zzso expression of zzso in the saliva of 143 study zzso In the Filipino families, statistically significant associations were found between low zzso experience and markers in zzso We were able to replicate these results in the populations studied that were characteristically from underserved zzso zzso sequencing of 22 subjects carrying the associated zzso detects one zzso zzso zzso that is predicted to be probably zzso Finally, we observed higher expression in children and teenagers with low zzso experience, zzso with specific zzso in zzso Our results suggest that zzso may have a role in protecting against zzso
