A zzso zzso heavy chain zzso from zzso zzso zzso E zzso is proposed as a vaccine against the zzso E zzso This fragment, zzso was produced zzso in zzso zzso zzso by a three-step zzso process, zzso zzso batch phase and a zzso zzso phase to achieve high cell zzso followed by a methanol zzso induction zzso The zzso protein was zzso from the soluble fraction of cell zzso using three zzso zzso steps zzso zzso Fast zzso Q zzso Fast zzso zzso zzso High zzso and polished with a zzso charge induction zzso step zzso zzso zzso development at the bench scale was achieved using zzso zzso columns and the process was performed at the pilot scale using zzso L columns in preparation for technology transfer to zzso zzso The zzso process resulted in greater than zzso pure zzso based on zzso and yielded up to zzso of zzso cells at the bench scale and zzso zzso cells at the pilot zzso zzso sequencing showed that the zzso zzso zzso is intact and was found to protect mice against a challenge of 1000 mouse zzso zzso of zzso
