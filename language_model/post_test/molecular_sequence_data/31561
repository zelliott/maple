zzso zzso zzso expressed by activated T cells is shown to induce maturation of immature zzso cells zzso and this maturation is a vital part in DC based tumor zzso We constructed an expression zzso by cloning the zzso domain of canine zzso fused to the signal sequence of canine zzso When zzso were incubated with canine zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso was significantly zzso but the majority of cells displayed the zzso of immature zzso Following addition of the expressed canine soluble zzso zzso to the zzso culture, the cell zzso shifted to that of mature zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso class II and zzso was significantly zzso This zzso change and enhancement of expression was observed even when the zzso was present only in the second half period of the zzso Furthermore, the zzso caused a significant increase in zzso production from zzso These results show that the zzso significantly promotes the maturation and zzso of canine zzso derived zzso
