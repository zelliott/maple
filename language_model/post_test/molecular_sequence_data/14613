zzso is one of the most common zzso zzso agents in the world and is a known zzso We studied zzso in people, zzso and zzso primates in the region of zzso National Park, zzso Land use change near the park has resulted in fragmented forest patches containing small, remnant populations of wild primates that interact zzso with local people and zzso Our goal was to investigate risk factors for zzso infection and to assess zzso transmission using molecular zzso 

zzso zzso revealed a prevalence of zzso of zzso in humans, zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso In the case of humans, residence in one particular community was associated with increased risk of infection, as was fetching water from an open water zzso Although zzso of infected people reported gastrointestinal symptoms, this frequency was not significantly different in people who tested negative zzso for zzso nor was zzso with zzso zzso associated with increased reporting of gastrointestinal zzso zzso consistency was no different in infected versus zzso people or zzso DNA sequences of the zzso zzso wall protein gene placed all infections within a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the only two sequences recovered from primates in the core of the park's protected area fell into a divergent zzso and were identical to published sequences from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the possibility of a separate zzso transmission zzso 

zzso may be transmitted frequently among species in western Uganda where people, zzso and wildlife interact zzso as a result of anthropogenic changes to forests, but the zzso may undergo more zzso transmission where such interactions do not zzso The zzso does not appear to have strong effects on human or animal health, perhaps because of persistent low-level shedding and zzso
