zzso zzso often requires the replacement of key zzso in the framework regions with corresponding zzso from the parent zzso zzso These changes are in addition to zzso of the zzso zzso Although guided by molecular zzso assessment of which framework changes are beneficial to zzso binding usually requires the analysis of many different zzso zzso Here we describe a zzso display method for zzso the framework of humanized zzso by random zzso of important framework zzso We have applied this method to zzso of the zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso panning of a library of humanized zzso zzso zzso led to the selection of one zzso with greater than zzso enhanced affinity for zzso relative to the initial humanized zzso with no framework zzso A single additional zzso gave a further zzso improvement in zzso The affinity of this zzso zzso zzso was only zzso weaker than that of a zzso zzso of zzso This method provides a general means of rapidly selecting framework zzso that improve the binding of humanized zzso to their zzso zzso and may prove an attractive alternative to current methods of framework zzso based on cycles of zzso zzso
