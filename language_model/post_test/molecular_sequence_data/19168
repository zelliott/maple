zzso zzso tissue zzso is implicated in the development of vascular diseases; however, the roles of zzso on zzso expression in diabetic zzso remain to be zzso This study investigated the role of zzso derived from diabetic zzso in regulating the vascular expression of zzso and explored the mechanisms zzso zzso sections of zzso and high-fat diet zzso obese zzso mice showed an increased expression of zzso which was paralleled by increased amounts of zzso characterized by enlargement of zzso In the earlier phase of zzso zzso zzso zzso was mainly localized to the area of zzso at which zzso were zzso suggesting a potential link of activated zzso to zzso zzso zzso sections of zzso and zzso mice revealed a significantly greater number of zzso with increased expression of zzso including zzso and zzso The distribution of zzso in zzso mostly zzso with zzso while zzso was expressed in zzso and other zzso In in zzso studies, zzso expression in vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso with zzso of zzso mice was significantly increased, which was attenuated by a zzso zzso Likewise, zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and protein in cultured zzso and the pivotal role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso produced by zzso plays a pivotal role in the zzso expression of zzso in the diabetic zzso via a zzso zzso that involves zzso of zzso
