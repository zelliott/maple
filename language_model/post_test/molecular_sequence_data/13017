zzso manipulation has proven valuable in identifying the role of specific genes in cellular zzso zzso disruption of genes that are expressed during embryonic development or in multiple tissue types, however, zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that targeted expression of an inhibitor zzso derived from zzso light chain zzso can neutralize the function of zzso We have shown that elimination of the nuclear function of zzso causes disruption of the nuclear zzso zzso expression of this zzso inhibitor gene in the lung zzso of transgenic mice leads to cellular death and dysfunctional lung zzso This approach is a strategy to modify the activity of a targeted protein within a specific zzso in order to evaluate its role in cellular and tissue zzso
