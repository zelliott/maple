The immunity region of the zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso zzso zzso its zzso operators and zzso and several early zzso genes can be zzso The overall design of the immunity region resembles that of other zzso zzso The location of the zzso zzso zzso whose product excludes zzso zzso by terminating zzso at (or zzso the zzso nut sites, is analogous to that of gene N in zzso zzso is preceded by sequences similar to the zzso nut sites and the zzso zzso promoter and is followed by several zzso termination zzso Despite these similarities, zzso is required neither for the zzso nor the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Again, unlike zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso perhaps from a promoter other than zzso We suggest that zzso and N have zzso in evolution and now perform different functions for their respective zzso Although zzso and N compete at the zzso nut sites and interact with the same host zzso zzso they are only zzso related in predicted zzso acid zzso The presence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso suggests that the expression of the zzso early functions, like those of zzso zzso an zzso zzso However, zzso does not appear to be an essential component of this zzso Our most economic model is that the zzso zzso sequence suppresses zzso zzso zzso in the absence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso zzso sequence and related sequences in the zzso coli zzso zzso support this zzso zzso a zzso zzso gene may be located outside the zzso zzso
