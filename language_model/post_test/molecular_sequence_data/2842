While zzso of the zzso zzso is observed regularly in acute zzso zzso amplification of zzso in zzso cells or derived lines is zzso In particular, concurrent zzso zzso which has been shown to be critical in several elegant models of zzso has been demonstrated in a very small number of human tumors or zzso cell zzso A cell line, zzso is described which was derived from cells of a patient with aggressive acute leukemia which exhibits many markers of lineage zzso DNA from this cell line contains an zzso point zzso of zzso as well as zzso amplification of zzso After zzso this is the second example of zzso zzso in zzso derived cells and demonstrates that this zzso is not unique to zzso Rather, it may be important in zzso in a small proportion of zzso zzso
