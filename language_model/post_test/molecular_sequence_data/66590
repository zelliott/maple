zzso virus zzso is a remarkably stable virus that until recently was thought to exhibit zzso genetic zzso among circulating zzso zzso In recent years, the expanding knowledge of zzso zzso has led to a number of groups proposing zzso typing schemes, but no study has yet examined the relationships between zzso zzso at a zzso zzso A central hypothesis of this study is that zzso has zzso with zzso In this study, 11 additional full zzso zzso sequences are zzso bringing the current number of complete zzso sequences publicly available to zzso The zzso alignment contained strains representing four distinct zzso but the possibility exists that a fifth zzso comprised of African and zzso zzso was not zzso A consolidated zzso zzso scheme employing the zzso region between zzso region zzso and open reading frames zzso 63 and 70 is zzso one which accurately zzso strains into one of four zzso related to the geographic origin of the zzso The zzso alignment also provided evidence for zzso having occurred between the major circulating zzso zzso One Canadian clinical isolate was primarily zzso in origin, with most of the zzso showing strong sequence identity to the zzso zzso B, with the exceptions being two putative zzso regions, located in zzso 14 to 17 and zzso 22 to 26, which showed clear similarity to the zzso American zzso zzso The very low rate of zzso zzso scattered across the zzso made zzso sequencing the only definitive method for identifying specific zzso zzso zzso
