zzso and zzso genes are transcribed at a discrete time in the zzso cell zzso We demonstrate here that the expression of the zzso coli zzso gene zzso with zzso zzso of its upstream zzso is temporally controlled in zzso zzso The zzso gene was placed on the zzso in single copy or on a zzso zzso It was found that the zzso protein appeared at the same point in the cell cycle as an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping experiments showed that the zzso transcript was also controlled by the cell cycle, suggesting that the zzso coli zzso gene is regulated by zzso zzso factors that mediate the timing of zzso zzso The apparent zzso start site of the zzso coli zzso gene was determined in both zzso coli and zzso zzso and we found that in both backgrounds the promoter used zzso to the consensus sequence for the promoters of the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The use of this promoter suggests that zzso zzso has a zzso zzso factor and predicts that other zzso zzso genes are expressed from this consensus zzso
