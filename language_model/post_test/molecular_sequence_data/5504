zzso of zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso cells were investigated using a zzso zzso specific to zzso zzso After zzso treatment at zzso degrees C for 30 zzso the level of zzso proteins increased within the first 2 h at 37 degrees C and returned to the initial level within the following 2 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was elevated by increasing the temperature, while the opposite was the case for the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the amount of zzso zzso rapidly increased in the zzso and zzso decreased in the nucleus under zzso zzso The zzso treatment zzso little apparent change in the activity of the zzso zzso but it did induce a gradual increase in activity of the zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the level of zzso zzso proteins and that of nuclear zzso zzso zzso increases and zzso respectively, in response to heat shock and that the zzso zzso of zzso proteins is caused by zzso of the zzso zzso system rather than zzso of the zzso zzso
