zzso zzso a very common cause of zzso zzso was previously classified with the zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso distinct from that of other zzso The zzso zzso zzso by passage through zzso zzso zzso and zzso 6 zzso zzso was found to have a native molecular size of zzso zzso and was composed of three distinct zzso with apparent molecular sizes of 63, 15, and 6 zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed a high degree of conservation of zzso acid sequence between jack bean and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared against zzso zzso inhibited activity by zzso at a zzso dilution after 1 h of zzso All zzso activity was zzso from zzso by a zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso of other species except for one zzso zzso strain but did recognize the large zzso of zzso of zzso and zzso species on Western blots zzso Thirteen zzso zzso clones of zzso zzso DNA shared a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences were localized to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that between zzso and zzso zzso of DNA were necessary for zzso zzso A zzso zzso DNA probe did not zzso with gene sequences of other species zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized identical zzso zzso on Western blots of zzso from the zzso strain and zzso coli bearing the zzso clone which corresponded to those seen in zzso zzso Although the zzso strain and zzso clone produced equal amounts of zzso zzso the clone produced less than zzso of the zzso activity of the zzso zzso
