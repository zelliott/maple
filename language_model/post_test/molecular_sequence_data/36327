We used zzso rabbit zzso directed against synthetic peptides predicted from the gene sequence of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to study the zzso zzso on human helper zzso leukemia lines and on normal mouse zzso zzso were raised to peptides corresponding to joining segment zzso zzso and to a zzso stretch of sequence around the first zzso in the constant region zzso zzso These peptides were selected on the basis of zzso with corresponding segments of zzso light zzso The specificity of the zzso was established using synthetic overlapping peptides that zzso the complete zzso zzso Western zzso analysis was performed against zzso zzso of T zzso Both of the zzso reacted strongly with 2-3 zzso in the mass range zzso zzso in mouse and human zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso and against human zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso to the zzso zzso complex established that these components represented the zzso zzso An additional component around 31 zzso was detected by zzso beta zzso in zzso zzso zzso The use of the zzso zzso zzso in two-dimensional Western zzso analyses allows the clear discrimination between the characteristic individual receptors of zzso zzso T cells and the zzso patterns representative of zzso normal zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso of man and mouse observed with zzso zzso and rabbit zzso to peptides are consistent with the zzso in gene sequence between the two zzso
