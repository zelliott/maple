A central goal of zzso is to identify and characterize the processes underlying zzso One of the biggest impediments currently faced is how to capture the zzso dynamic under which a species zzso Here, we described an approach that couples species distribution models zzso demographic and genetic models in a zzso explicit zzso zzso of American zzso zzso zzso from the sky islands of the central Rocky Mountains of North America are used to provide insights into key questions about zzso approaches in landscape zzso population zzso and zzso This includes zzso general issues surrounding the conversion of zzso zzso into simple zzso dynamic landscapes from past to zzso zzso the utility of zzso to inform demographic models with zzso carrying capacities and migration zzso as well as zzso the contribution of the zzso dynamic of colonization history in shaping genetic patterns of contemporary zzso Our results support that the inclusion of a zzso dynamic is an important factor when studying the impact of zzso shifts on patterns of genetic zzso Our results also demonstrate the utility of zzso to generate zzso predictions about patterns of genetic variation that account for varying degrees of habitat specialization and life history characteristics of zzso Nevertheless, the results highlight some key issues when converting zzso for use in demographic zzso Because the transformations have direct effects on the genetic consequence of population expansion by prescribing how habitat zzso and zzso variation is related to the zzso demographic model, it is important to consider alternative transformations when studying the genetic consequences of zzso zzso
