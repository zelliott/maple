zzso zzso zzso protein 35 zzso that binds to zzso contains a zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso Several known zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso are structurally zzso and are able to interact with molecular zzso such as zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of zzso and demonstrate its interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso by surface zzso resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso binding zzso Our sequence and structural analyses reveal that zzso is similar to zzso and zzso in possessing all the zzso zzso which are important for zzso clamping with zzso zzso studies were carried out on positively charged clamp zzso that are crucial for binding to zzso groups of zzso showing that all the zzso zzso are important for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso calculations demonstrated that the zzso zzso of zzso can form zzso clamp unlike zzso Our results provide zzso information and structural basis about the molecular interaction between zzso and zzso
