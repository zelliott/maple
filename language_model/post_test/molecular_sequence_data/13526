Given the central role zzso plays in growth control, differentiation and zzso understanding how zzso functions will increase our understanding about normal cell development, and how zzso in these processes can lead to zzso zzso is a negative regulator of terminal zzso zzso therefore, it was of interest to determine what effect blocking zzso expression would have on proliferation and zzso In this work we showed that blocking expression of either zzso or Max, its molecular partner, in zzso leukemia zzso cells activated the differentiation program in the absence of an zzso source of differentiation zzso the cells assumed an intermediate stage zzso zzso Moreover, when both zzso and Max expression was zzso zzso many of the cells underwent terminal zzso Finally, extending these studies to zzso enriched normal bone zzso zzso cell has shown that blocking expression of either zzso or Max accelerated zzso differentiation along both the zzso and zzso zzso Thus, it can be concluded that blocking either zzso or Max expression in zzso cells at specific stages of development activates and zzso the terminal differentiation zzso
