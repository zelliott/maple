zzso and zzso zzso produce a wide range of secondary zzso So far, type I zzso zzso zzso are the suggested zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso We were interested whether zzso zzso also contain type III zzso representing a class that was only recently discovered in zzso With an alignment of known type III zzso genes we applied the zzso strategy to design zzso zzso zzso We further screened available zzso zzso for type III zzso genes and aligned these sequences for a zzso zzso Type zzso genes from zzso zzso are closely related to those known from zzso zzso but not to those of bacteria and/or zzso We conclude that type III zzso genes are ubiquitous in zzso They are present in diverse unrelated zzso zzso but their function in zzso is so far zzso
