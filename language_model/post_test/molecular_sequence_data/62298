A zzso zzso gene zzso zzso an orphan zzso zzso is regulated during zzso zzso zzso To zzso the mechanisms that mediate its regulation, we isolated and characterized the mouse gene zzso and promoter zzso zzso spans about 18 zzso containing four zzso separated by three zzso and maps to mouse zzso 6 near zzso A functional analysis of the zzso gene promoter revealed that the zzso region harbors most of the elements necessary for its regulation, including zzso boxes and zzso zzso and zzso zzso A functional zzso acid response element direct repeat of two novel motifs separated by a zzso zzso zzso was identified at zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start site using the methods of promoter zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso These findings provide strong evidence that zzso is regulated directly by zzso acid via its zzso
