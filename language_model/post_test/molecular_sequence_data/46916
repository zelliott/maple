zzso (also known as zzso or zzso is an zzso zzso zzso involved in regulating cell zzso Although this makes it a promising target for the discovery of drugs to treat human cancer, a complicating factor may be the role played by zzso in insulin zzso Two human zzso zzso and zzso have been described previously and a third zzso has been identified in rats (here termed zzso but also called zzso or zzso We describe the identification of the corresponding human zzso of zzso The gene zzso human zzso was localized to zzso zzso The predicted protein sequence is zzso identical to human zzso and zzso identical to human zzso and contains a zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso In contrast to the published rat zzso zzso human and mouse zzso also possess a zzso zzso that contains a zzso site zzso thought to be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso In addition to zzso of zzso zzso of zzso also appears to contribute to the zzso of zzso because zzso of both these zzso to zzso increased the zzso activity of zzso whereas zzso to zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity could be inhibited by the broad spectrum zzso inhibitor zzso and by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso but not by other zzso or zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is expressed widely, it is not highly expressed in liver or skeletal muscle, suggesting that its principle function may not be in regulating insulin zzso These observations suggest that zzso is a promising target for the discovery of novel zzso agents which do not interfere with insulin zzso
