We developed a mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso to human zzso zzso zzso that recognizes its zzso binding site zzso zzso through zzso of zzso The corresponding zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso was recently shown to retain native zzso zzso binding zzso The same zzso bound factor zzso also, although less zzso Our zzso recognizes zzso zzso zzso IV, and the light chain zzso of zzso (where the zzso IV zzso as shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso The apparent zzso constant for the zzso and zzso zzso interaction was zzso zzso It does not recognize zzso zzso zzso with which zzso shares its heavy chain zzso or any zzso in human plasma zzso deficient in zzso The binding of zzso zzso to zzso light chain of zzso was competitively inhibited by zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of normal human plasma and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in plasma and zzso zzso of zzso in normal plasma after contact zzso with zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso fragments of zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso Since the zzso for zzso zzso interaction is ten times lower than that of zzso our data suggest that binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso IV site increases the free zzso concentration in plasma and thus results in the decreased efficiency of factor zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels of zzso thus formed may be responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso activity and the decrease in rate and extent of zzso zzso in normal plasma on contact zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso may thus prove very useful, especially with its high affinity for zzso in further zzso of the role of zzso and zzso in contact zzso and zzso human zzso
