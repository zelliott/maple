In the zzso zzso zzso various zzso at the zzso locus provide zzso zzso These resistance zzso display a zzso geographical distribution, particularly in China, where they are highly zzso A new resistance zzso zzso coding for the zzso zzso A9 and zzso is characterized and compared to the known resistant zzso zzso isolated from the same southern China sample (from zzso Both zzso provide low but significant resistance to zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso zzso zzso which is consistent with the low level of gene amplification they display (15 copies for zzso and 4 copies for zzso The full zzso sequence of the zzso coding A8 and A9 is zzso which allowed us to set up a zzso chain reaction zzso to specifically identify these zzso The peculiar situation in southern China, where numerous resistance zzso zzso is discussed in comparison with the Mediterranean situation, the only one with a similar diversity of zzso zzso
