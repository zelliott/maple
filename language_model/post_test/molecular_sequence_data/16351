In order to examine the number and organization of the zzso zzso light chain genes of the zzso we have used mouse zzso chain zzso zzso to isolate zzso fragments from a partial zzso rat liver DNA zzso We have determined the partial zzso sequence of two such zzso One zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso insert which zzso to both mouse C zzso 1 and C zzso 2 zzso includes an apparently zzso C zzso zzso gene as well as a C zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso arranged similarly to the mouse C zzso gene zzso zzso analysis of a second cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso revealed part of a second C zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso the coding regions of both zzso being interrupted by multiple zzso size zzso In the case of zzso C zzso zzso the degree of sequence identity with mouse C zzso 1 drops abruptly immediately following the termination zzso suggesting that zzso events have played a role in its zzso These two rat zzso and the mouse C zzso 4 zzso clearly have been rendered zzso by separate evolutionary zzso Comparisons between C zzso coding and zzso regions of rats and mice indicate that some of the unusual patterns of divergence we have observed in recently zzso zzso genes may exist in C zzso genes as zzso
