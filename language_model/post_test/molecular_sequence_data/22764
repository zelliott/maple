zzso transfer proteins zzso are highly zzso zzso that bind zzso or zzso zzso zzso their transfer from one membrane compartment to another zzso Although zzso have been implicated in a variety of cellular functions, including zzso signaling and membrane trafficking, the precise biological roles of most zzso remain to be zzso zzso Here we show for the first time that a class I zzso is involved in zzso We found that zzso zzso a zzso gene that encodes a class I zzso serves an essential function required for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso both assemble regular zzso zzso However, these rings fail to zzso to zzso leading to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cause an abnormal zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is implicated in zzso zzso zzso with these results, we found that zzso is enriched at the zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso We propose that zzso mediates transfer of zzso zzso from the zzso to the equatorial zzso causing a specific local enrichment in zzso This change in membrane composition would ultimately facilitate zzso fusion, allowing membrane addition to the zzso and/or targeted delivery of proteins required for zzso
