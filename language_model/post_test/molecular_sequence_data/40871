The zzso zzso fold is a versatile protein scaffold consisting of a zzso zzso surrounded by three zzso Various insertions are possible on this structural theme originating different zzso which show a variety of functions and zzso During evolution, the assembly of different zzso fold zzso has been used many times to build new zzso proteins able to perform a large number of zzso zzso To clarify the interaction mode of the different zzso zzso within a zzso structure and how their combination can affect zzso performances, in this review, we report on a structural and functional analysis of the most representative proteins containing more than one zzso active zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and the hybrid zzso zzso
