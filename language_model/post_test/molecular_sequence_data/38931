The zzso alpha zzso zzso has served as a paradigm for studying how enhancers organize zzso into zzso complexes thought to recruit and zzso stimulate the zzso zzso Little is known, however, of either the extent or dynamics of zzso occupancy by nuclear factors during T cell zzso Using zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso we demonstrate extensive zzso occupancy, encompassing both previously identified and novel sites, not only in T cells representing a zzso stage where zzso is known to be active zzso zzso but surprisingly, also in cells at an earlier zzso stage where zzso is not active zzso zzso zzso occupancy was also established in zzso but not zzso zzso In zzso zzso I zzso however, implied zzso induced changes in zzso complex zzso zzso differences in factor composition at zzso sequences were also suggested by zzso zzso These results, which indicate that zzso in the structure of a zzso zzso complex correlate with the onset of zzso activity, may exemplify one mechanism by which enhancers can rapidly respond to incoming zzso
