The crystal structure analysis of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso revealed the unique structure of the zzso composed of the zzso and zzso and the unprecedented structure of the zzso iron active center zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5, zzso A number of zzso water molecules were identified both in the interior and at the exterior of the zzso The study presented here investigated the roles of the zzso water molecules in stabilizing the zzso and the zzso structures of the zzso based on the crystal structure and the results from a laser light scattering experiment for the zzso in zzso zzso zzso water molecules between the two zzso significantly contribute to the zzso zzso formation by making up the surface shape, forming extensive networks of hydrogen bonds, and zzso the surface charge of the zzso In particular, 20 zzso water molecules form the extensive networks of hydrogen bonds stabilizing the unique structure of the active zzso The zzso acid zzso zzso to those zzso water molecules are highly zzso among all known zzso zzso and even in the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting the structural conservation of the water molecules in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso unit contained two zzso connected by 50 zzso water zzso The zzso formation in zzso was clearly explained by the zzso zzso state of zzso found in the light scattering zzso The measurement proved that the zzso equilibrium shifted toward the zzso dominant state in the concentration range of zzso zzso In the zzso dominant state, 50 water molecules likely glue the two zzso together as observed in the crystal zzso Because zzso exhibits a high abundance in bacterial cells, the result suggests that the zzso is zzso zzso In addition, it was revealed that the zzso specificity of this zzso recognizing small zzso zzso rather than aromatic ones, came from the narrowness of the entrance channel from the bulk zzso to the active zzso This finding may give a clue for changing the zzso specificity of the zzso Under the zzso condition described here, one zzso zzso plugged the zzso Through zzso and zzso experiments, we found that the zzso prevented the zzso of the zzso NO zzso from the active center even when the crystal was exposed to zzso
