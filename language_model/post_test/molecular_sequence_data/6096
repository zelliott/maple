This study aimed to investigate the zzso between the zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression in rat zzso To this end, zzso zzso levels and zzso levels for zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso protection in the zzso of normal rats, in animals treated with the zzso zzso zzso and in rats bearing zzso left zzso artery clips for 2 zzso In normal rats, we found a negative correlation between zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to a fourfold increase in zzso zzso levels without changing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso artery clipping increased zzso zzso levels fourfold in the clipped kidney and suppressed zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were not changed in the zzso intact zzso but were significantly decreased by zzso in the clipped zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso correlated to zzso zzso levels in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the systemic activity of the zzso zzso system has no regulatory influence on zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso levels in normal and in clipped zzso appear to be zzso determined by the level of zzso zzso gene zzso Thus zzso of zzso zzso gene expression could be a zzso for indirect zzso of zzso gene expression by zzso zzso This conclusion is in agreement with the observation that zzso zzso zzso are powerful zzso of the zzso zzso
