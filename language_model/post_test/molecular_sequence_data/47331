The zzso zzso channel gene is zzso expressed in the zzso and its expression level is especially high in zzso that are able to follow synaptic zzso at high zzso To understand the zzso mechanisms controlling zzso zzso we have conducted a functional analysis of the zzso promoter in various cell lines of different tissue origins and in transgenic zzso Our results suggest that an upstream regulatory zzso coupled with the zzso untranslated region zzso is able to zzso zzso expression in both cell lines and in transgenic zzso zzso analysis of the regulatory region carried out in cell lines reveals that a strong zzso acting element, uniquely residing in the zzso zzso zzso to zzso appears able to zzso cell type specificity on both the zzso promoter and the zzso zzso promoter in transient zzso zzso A weak cell zzso zzso in the zzso region of the promoter zzso to zzso also contributes to cell zzso expression of the zzso zzso
