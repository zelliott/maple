zzso sequencing of human zzso type 11 zzso strain zzso isolated in China, was conducted, and its sequence was compared with the sequences of strains within the species of zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso Similar to the other zzso zzso B zzso the zzso zzso zzso coded 37 functional proteins and could be divided into four early, two zzso and five late zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the fiber and the zzso regions zzso within the zzso gene of zzso zzso were identical to the corresponding sequences of the zzso zzso further analyses that compared those zzso acid sequences with the zzso acid sequences of the zzso species zzso zzso strains revealed that the highest degree of zzso zzso existed between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso strain, except for a few coding sequences of zzso within the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso This indicate that zzso strain zzso isolated in China, is a zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso analyses also confirmed this zzso It is difficult to clarify the time and manner of the zzso and further investigations are required to determine whether the emergence of zzso between zzso and zzso might increase zzso thereby posing a new global challenge with regard to acute respiratory diseases in the near zzso
