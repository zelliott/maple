zzso in the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso have been linked to zzso dominant zzso zzso Three zzso were identified that alter strictly zzso zzso within the zzso zzso domain, a region predicted to form an zzso zzso zzso Here we report on a zzso characterization of one of the zzso a substitution of zzso for zzso at zzso zzso We generated this zzso in zzso and measured its zzso activity and sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso The zzso substitution has several zzso It reduces the overall zzso ability of zzso and dramatically reduces stimulation by zzso although zzso still appears to interact with the zzso The zzso substitution also increases the apparent affinity of zzso for zzso and alters the zzso sensitivity of the zzso response, allowing the zzso to be zzso by zzso at higher zzso zzso than wild zzso The diminished response to zzso which we propose is not likely the cause of zzso zzso in these patients, is interesting mechanistically because it separates the ability to bind a specific zzso from the ability to be zzso by it, and it also discriminates between the mechanisms of zzso of zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso by zzso which are dominant in zzso and may cause an abnormal increase in zzso synthesis in zzso zzso may be the cause of the zzso zzso
