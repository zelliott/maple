zzso and molecular genetic studies have implicated many zzso aberrations in the zzso of lung zzso zzso on zzso and zzso are presently the primary target for zzso cloning of putative tumor zzso zzso We have recently reported frequent loss of zzso in three separate regions zzso zzso zzso on zzso in freshly zzso lung cancer zzso Here we report zzso and molecular genetic analyses of 26 permanently growing human lung cancer cell zzso zzso indicating regions which may harbor potential tumor zzso genes were found in zzso cell lines on zzso zzso on zzso zzso on zzso zzso on zzso zzso on zzso zzso on zzso zzso on zzso and zzso on zzso Reduction to zzso or a statistically significant increase in the frequency of zzso on zzso was found for all markers investigated except for zzso zzso Eight of zzso zzso cell lines were zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell lines were zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso These results confirm the notion that zzso harbors several putative tumor zzso genes which may become zzso at different stages of tumor development and zzso They also provide a basis for selecting cell lines for genetic zzso specifically targeted at the regions zzso
