To speed drug discovery, we developed an approach for identification of individual peptides with a desired biological activity from a library containing millions of zzso The approach uses sequential zzso release of chemically zzso peptides from zzso zzso followed by testing in zzso In this system, each zzso within a library of beads has one zzso zzso but zzso molecules are attached to the zzso with three types of chemical zzso including two zzso zzso at different pH zzso An zzso zzso keeps some zzso attached to the zzso for sequencing zzso from the solution zzso zzso of this discovery technique was documented by identifying zzso for a zzso zzso and for the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
