The zzso coli species contains a variety of zzso and zzso zzso and its zzso diversity is extraordinarily zzso With the availability of an increasing number of zzso coli strain zzso a more comprehensive concept of their evolutionary history and ecological adaptation can be developed using zzso zzso In this study, we constructed two types of zzso zzso based on 34 zzso coli strains using zzso zzso zzso The first zzso was based on the zzso zzso regions shared by all of the studied zzso and the second zzso was based on the variable zzso regions that are absent from at least one zzso zzso the first zzso is likely to reveal the zzso evolutionary history among these strains zzso an evolutionary zzso whereas the latter zzso is likely to reflect the zzso similarities of extant strains zzso a similarity zzso 

Within the evolutionary zzso the strains were clustered in accordance with known zzso groups and zzso When comparing evolutionary and similarity zzso a concept emerges that zzso may have originated from at least three distinct ancestors and evolved into a single zzso By zzso the properties that are shared amongst zzso strains but missing in other zzso coli zzso we found that the common regions of the zzso zzso were mainly influenced by mobile genetic zzso zzso that they may have experienced zzso evolution via horizontal gene zzso Based on an inspection of certain key branches of interest, we identified several zzso regions that may be associated with the zzso of specific zzso Moreover, by examining the zzso genes within these regions, further detailed evidence associated with zzso was zzso 

zzso regions are reliable zzso features used for zzso analysis among closely related zzso while linking the zzso diversity with zzso differences in a meaningful zzso The zzso of a strain may be associated with both the arrival of zzso factors and the modification of zzso via zzso Such zzso studies that compare zzso regions of whole zzso will help to better understand the evolution and adaptation of closely related microbes and zzso coli in zzso
