zzso zzso expression is associated with the development of zzso human zzso and for this reason it is considered a good target for zzso zzso To define methods to circumvent zzso tolerance and to elicit immunity against the zzso zzso zzso in a suitable animal model, we have isolated the zzso zzso the zzso monkey zzso of human zzso zzso to construct DNA plasmids and zzso zzso for the development of a cancer vaccine against this zzso To further increase the zzso potency of these zzso a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed and zzso zzso vaccination of zzso monkeys was effective in inducing a response against zzso in zzso zzso importantly, the zzso immunity was associated with natural zzso zzso thus distinguishing responses against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In particular, the zzso response recognized mainly zzso zzso whereas the zzso response zzso with self zzso Our findings are particularly relevant in the investigation of the impact of zzso zzso on the efficacy of a cancer vaccine zzso
