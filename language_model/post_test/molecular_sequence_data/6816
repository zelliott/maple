zzso is a zzso borne zzso which belongs to the Uganda S zzso No zzso sequence data have previously been reported from any virus of this zzso We have determined the zzso sequence of the zzso gene from zzso virus and the predicted zzso acid sequence was zzso Previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid motifs were present in the zzso virus zzso zzso These data add to the evidence for the functional importance of the zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence was compared with the predicted zzso acid sequence of other zzso zzso zzso Analysis of these sequences suggested that zzso virus is most closely related to the zzso zzso and, in particular, yellow fever zzso This pattern of similarity is in accordance with the previously suggested zzso zzso of zzso
