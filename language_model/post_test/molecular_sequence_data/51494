Among the zzso active genes of zzso cactus is the only one whose loss of function zzso specifically produce zzso zzso Its product zzso nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso Here we report the cloning of cactus and the sequencing of its maternal zzso The identity of our clones was verified by induction of zzso with zzso zzso and rescue of the zzso zzso with sense zzso cactus is predicted to zzso an zzso zzso protein with seven zzso zzso The sequence has similarity to the I zzso B proteins that inhibit the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso In zzso to results obtained with I zzso B and zzso B, zzso expressed cactus protein can inhibit DNA binding of zzso protein in zzso
