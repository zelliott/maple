Group B zzso zzso zzso zzso are the leading cause of zzso invasive diseases and are also important pathogens for zzso zzso are the drugs of first choice for the treatment of zzso infections, since zzso have been regarded to be zzso susceptible to zzso so zzso Here we characterize the first strains of zzso with reduced zzso zzso zzso identified in zzso Fourteen zzso strains were clinically isolated from the zzso of elderly patients from 1995 to 2005; and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso ranged from zzso to 1 zzso 2 to 8 zzso and 4 to 128 zzso zzso Moreover, some strains were also zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso All the zzso zzso tested possessed a few zzso acid zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso and zzso motifs zzso acids 402 to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso acid zzso could be classified into two types, zzso and zzso Western zzso analysis of the 14 clinical zzso with zzso zzso serum suggested that the amount of zzso zzso among the 14 zzso zzso was reduced, although the 2 zzso strains produced a significant amount of zzso zzso The introduction of zzso zzso zzso genes into zzso strains through zzso exchange elevated their zzso zzso suggesting that these altered zzso zzso genes are responsible for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we characterized for the first time zzso strains on a molecular basis, although several reports have so far mentioned the existence of zzso zzso from a zzso zzso
