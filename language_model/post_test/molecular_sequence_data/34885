The partial zzso of the neutral zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso designed according to the sequences of the zzso in zzso The amplified zzso was cloned and zzso Based on the known sequence of zzso zzso the zzso and 3' rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso were used to amplify the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso then the whole zzso sequence of zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso was obtained by combining the above sequences and its whole zzso DNA was amplified by zzso In order to obtain more regulatory information of the zzso zzso zzso chain reaction strategy was used to amplify the zzso zzso sequences adjacent to the known sequence of the neutral zzso zzso The sequence analysis shows that the DNA sequence is zzso in size, includes three zzso and the zzso sequence is zzso zzso in size, encodes a protein of 737 zzso acid zzso with a calculated Mr of zzso in which there is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consensus site and a putative calcium binding site, which is consistent with a regulatory zzso zzso of this sequence with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso zzso is as high as zzso and the zzso acid zzso comes up to zzso Southern analysis indicated that zzso gene was present as a single copy in this zzso zzso zzso A single transcript of approximately zzso zzso was detected by Northern zzso zzso The zzso zzso was present throughout spore zzso in rich zzso but accumulated to its highest level at the early stage of exponential zzso zzso the zzso level declined at the late stage of exponential growth, but began to show an increase during the stationary phase of zzso A zzso upstream sequence of zzso was amplified using zzso zzso method, which contains one stress response element zzso The zzso zzso sequence and its zzso acid sequence have been zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso
