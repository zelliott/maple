The zzso protein performs similar roles in all zzso initially directing membrane zzso of the assembling viral particle and subsequently forming a stable structural shell associated with the inner surface of the mature viral zzso Although zzso structural elements are likely to perform these functions in all zzso zzso zzso zzso motifs are not evident at the primary sequence level and three-dimensional structures have been available for only the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have therefore used zzso zzso to determine the structure of the zzso protein from human zzso leukemia virus type II zzso a member of the human zzso zzso of zzso A total of 577 distance restraints were used to build 20 refined models that zzso with an zzso of zzso A for the backbone atoms of the structured zzso The zzso zzso zzso structure is composed of four zzso and a zzso zzso zzso basic zzso near the C zzso of zzso II form a putative membrane binding surface which could act in concert with the zzso zzso group to anchor the protein on the viral membrane zzso Clear structural similarities between the zzso and zzso zzso proteins suggest that the zzso and exposed zzso membrane binding surface are likely to be zzso features of zzso zzso zzso
