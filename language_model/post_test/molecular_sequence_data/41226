To establish a stable and large-scale zzso sequencing platform for zzso zzso gene zzso 2 to 4, and to analyze single zzso zzso of the zzso 

zzso for particular zzso of zzso gene zzso 2 to 5 were zzso zzso conditions for zzso amplification and sequencing reaction were zzso A zzso one-way sequencing kit for zzso zzso was used as a parallel zzso Four samples carrying a zzso zzso zzso were subjected to cloning and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso typing of 100 samples for a parallel control group were confirmed by the establish zzso Twenty-two zzso in zzso gene zzso 2 to 4 were detected in Chinese zzso Two novel zzso sequences were accepted by zzso and zzso database and officially named as zzso and zzso by the WHO zzso zzso A novel zzso in zzso gene zzso 3 was discovered, with zzso sequence submitted to zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso sequencing zzso platform may be applied for large-scale study of zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso organ transplantation and disease zzso
