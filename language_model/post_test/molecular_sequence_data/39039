Many zzso cell surface proteins are anchored to the membrane via zzso zzso The zzso is attached to proteins that have a zzso attachment signal zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso attachment signal zzso is replaced by a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso by a zzso reaction through the formation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso of this zzso zzso Here we report that zzso and zzso are components of a zzso zzso To determine a role of zzso we disrupted a zzso gene in mouse zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso knockout cells were defective in the formation of zzso zzso between precursor proteins and zzso as determined by an in zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso and zzso zzso of zzso which are zzso in members of a zzso zzso family, are essential for generation of a zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso is a zzso component that zzso the zzso attachment signal zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso are associated with each zzso zzso zzso and zzso constitute a zzso zzso and cooperate in generating a zzso zzso a prerequisite for zzso zzso
