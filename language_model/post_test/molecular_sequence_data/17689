We developed a new strategy to prepare zzso zzso containing recognition sites for specific binding proteins to examine zzso interactions in various zzso zzso mobility shift, zzso and affinity zzso The advantages of our procedures are as zzso Only one strand needs to be zzso using a commercial zzso zzso The zzso can be labeled to a high specific activity and the exact position of labeling can be zzso which is necessary for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso binding sites for efficient DNA affinity zzso can easily be zzso It is also possible to precisely place modified bases without the need for chemical zzso Using this zzso more detailed information about the binding protein factors and their behavior in interaction with recognition sites can be zzso
