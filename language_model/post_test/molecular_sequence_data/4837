The human major zzso complex zzso is located within a 4 zzso segment on zzso zzso Recently, a highly divergent zzso class I zzso gene family, zzso was identified within the class I zzso The zzso and zzso genes in this family have unique patterns of tissue zzso The zzso gene is highly zzso with more than 20 zzso identified to zzso To zzso the extent of zzso zzso variations, we zzso zzso 2 zzso 1), 3 zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso and 5 zzso as well as zzso 2 and 4 of this gene in 46 zzso zzso zzso zzso We report the identification of zzso zzso based on seven zzso two zzso and four zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, one zzso has a nonsense zzso resulting in a premature termination zzso in the alpha 2 zzso Thus, zzso appears to have fewer zzso than zzso not unlike the zzso ratio between the zzso and zzso zzso A preliminary linkage analysis of the zzso zzso with those of the closely located zzso and zzso genes revealed no conspicuous linkage zzso between them, zzso the presence of a potential zzso hotspot between the zzso and zzso zzso
