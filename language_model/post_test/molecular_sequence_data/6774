We obtained two zzso clones zzso corn seed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso consists of 371 zzso acid zzso in a zzso form, with two unique short insertions in the mature protein region that are not found in zzso or other common zzso zzso consists of 360 zzso acid zzso with a zzso sorting signal in the zzso zzso An zzso acid sequence similarity of zzso was found between the mature protein region of zzso and that of zzso Although zzso is highly zzso to pea zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 19 zzso zzso both of which are known to be induced only when the plant is exposed to a dehydrated environment, it showed very low zzso to other known zzso zzso zzso zzso showed as much as zzso and zzso identity to rice zzso gamma and barley zzso zzso We also observed that the zzso zzso is expressed in zzso corn seeds, although its expression reaches a maximum 5 days after the onset of zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso is expressed only during zzso with maximum expression at the zzso zzso These results suggest the presence of at least two zzso zzso playing differential roles in the corn zzso
