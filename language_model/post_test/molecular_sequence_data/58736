Single strand zzso analysis zzso is a technique that has been used to detect point zzso We explored its usefulness in the analysis of four different members of the zzso zzso zzso beta gene family and its suitability for detection of zzso in different zzso zzso The availability of zzso covering a zzso sequence at the zzso end of the genes allowed assessment of the effect of a single base zzso while the analysis of a 321 zzso long sequence permitted the evaluation of sequences differing in several zzso zzso products were zzso under four different zzso conditions: with or without the addition of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso gel run at room temperature or at 4 degrees zzso Shifts in mobility were radically dependent on the migration zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were best resolved at 4 degrees C, without zzso zzso products derived from total zzso DNA showed a pattern that resembled closely a combination of the products derived from the cloned zzso The results zzso demonstrate the usefulness of zzso to differentiate forms of a complex zzso gene family, and to scan its zzso zzso Furthermore, due to the remarkable sensitivity of the technique it can generate zzso zzso such as zzso zzso Sites zzso of great need in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
