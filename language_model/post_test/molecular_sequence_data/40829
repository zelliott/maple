zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso genes zzso and zzso are zzso factors with therapeutic potential that are involved in cone zzso zzso zzso how their expression is regulated in the zzso has implications for understanding both their activity and the mechanisms determining zzso specificity within the zzso 

In order to define and characterize their zzso a series of zzso reporter zzso that contain various fragments of the zzso region of each zzso both zzso and human, were tested in zzso and zzso cell lines and also in a biologically more relevant mouse retinal zzso zzso For zzso zzso analysis identified the human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regions as having promoter zzso Moreover, in the retinal zzso these zzso drove expression specifically to zzso zzso For zzso the human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regions were found to be sufficient for promoter zzso However, despite the fact that zzso zzso expression is zzso within the zzso neither of these DNA sequences nor larger upstream regions demonstrated zzso zzso Further analysis showed that a 79 zzso zzso positive regulatory sequence zzso to 315 zzso combined with a zzso zzso inactive minimal zzso promoter zzso zzso to zzso zzso was able to drive zzso zzso suggesting that the minimal zzso zzso contains zzso elements that zzso zzso zzso Finally, based on zzso analysis that suggested the importance of a zzso binding site within the minimal zzso fragment, we found by zzso analysis that, depending on the context, the zzso site can play a dual zzso 

The regulation of the zzso genes involves a zzso responsive element that can act as both as a positive regulator of promoter activity and as a zzso of zzso zzso
