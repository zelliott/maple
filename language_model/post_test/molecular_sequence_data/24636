zzso and zzso are two members of the zzso family that differ structurally and zzso While zzso is regulated through its zzso zzso by inhibitor proteins or zzso and not through zzso mechanisms, the regulation of zzso is poorly zzso In this study we demonstrate that stimuli zzso or zzso lead within minutes to the nuclear zzso of zzso but require hours to result in the nuclear zzso of zzso The delayed nuclear zzso of zzso zzso with increases in its protein synthesis which are secondary to increases in zzso gene zzso zzso is alone sufficient to induce zzso gene zzso and to mediate the zzso increase in zzso zzso Cloning and characterization of the zzso zzso untranslated gene region indicates that zzso zzso is dependent on a zzso promoter containing two zzso binding zzso One of the zzso sites is primarily involved in the binding of zzso while the other one in the binding and zzso by zzso and also zzso Lastly, it is observed that zzso a protein involved in cell cycle control and zzso known to be regulated by zzso is zzso at the zzso level by zzso Thus, zzso is regulated at least at the level of zzso in a zzso and zzso dependent manner and may exert an important role in zzso zzso
