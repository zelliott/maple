zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso that serves as the prime zzso of blood zzso and plays a critical role in zzso and zzso In addition, a variety of tumor cells zzso zzso zzso which appears to be important for tumor zzso and zzso To zzso the mechanism involved in the zzso of zzso in human tumor cells, a comprehensive analysis of zzso zzso from various normal and tumor cells was zzso The results of these studies indicate that, in addition to possessing a normal full-length zzso transcript and minor levels of an alternatively spliced transcript known as zzso tissue factor zzso human tumor cells express additional full-length zzso transcripts that are also generated by alternative zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso based analyses of zzso zzso from normal and tumor cells revealed that there is alternative zzso of the first zzso between zzso I and zzso II resulting in 2 additional zzso zzso One of the transcripts has an extended zzso I with inclusion of most of the first zzso zzso zzso zzso while the second transcript is formed by the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso derived from an internal sequence of the first zzso The full length zzso transcript with alternatively spliced novel zzso zzso referred to as alternative zzso zzso factor zzso represented approximately zzso of the total zzso transcripts in normal cells, but constituted zzso of the total zzso transcript in tumor zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis indicated that cultured human tumor cells contain zzso more copy numbers of zzso in comparison to normal, zzso zzso We propose that high-level expression of the novel zzso transcript, zzso in tumor cells, may have utility in the diagnosis and staging of a variety of solid zzso
