We have isolated a zzso clone zzso a human inward zzso zzso channel zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the coding region is zzso similar to the mouse clone with only seven zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso initially expressed low levels of protein in a wheat germ system and in zzso zzso The addition of a zzso site 3' to the zzso tail increased the expression at least zzso zzso zzso injected with the zzso zzso developed resting zzso that averaged zzso zzso and a large inward current that was blocked by zzso or zzso The zzso zzso shifted zzso zzso per decade change in zzso and its channel zzso increased with zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Above zzso the zzso zzso relation has a distinct zzso zzso single-channel zzso in 140 zzso zzso zzso solution averaged 29 zzso The negative resting potential and the zzso zzso relation of zzso closely resemble that of the native cardiac inward zzso zzso
