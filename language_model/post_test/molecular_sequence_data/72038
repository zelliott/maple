zzso zzso was used to generate a series of zzso harboring point or multiple zzso within the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso by zzso zzso which was previously identified as a site of interaction with zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was expressed in a human zzso leukemia cell line in which the zzso zzso gene was disrupted by gene zzso zzso zzso activity was measured in a zzso c reduction zzso following zzso differentiation of cells that expressed zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in which zzso acids zzso were replaced with nine alternate zzso acids abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not significantly affect zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of individual or paired zzso zzso at positions 91 and 92 had substantial effects on zzso zzso The zzso zzso completely abolished both zzso zzso activity and zzso of the zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso rate of zzso production was reduced by approximately zzso in cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso zzso along with an increased lag time to the zzso rates of zzso production relative to cells expressing zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso and zzso of zzso are essential for zzso zzso function in zzso and suggest that these zzso participate in the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso
