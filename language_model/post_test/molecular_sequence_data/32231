Compared with the zzso of typical zzso the chicken zzso zzso zzso of the B12 zzso is smaller, zzso and zzso with two classical class I genes of which only one is highly zzso In this study, we describe the development of long-distance zzso to amplify some or all of each class I gene zzso allowing us to make the following zzso First, six other zzso have the same zzso organization as zzso with a poorly expressed zzso zzso gene between zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso gene between zzso and zzso Second, the expression of the zzso gene is crippled in three different ways in these zzso zzso A deletion zzso zzso zzso A divergence and zzso start site deletion zzso zzso zzso and zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso Third, the three kinds of zzso in the zzso gene zzso to zzso of the zzso and poorly expressed class II B zzso genes reflecting mostly neutral changes, while the zzso of the zzso and zzso class II zzso genes each have completely different zzso reflecting zzso The common pattern for the poorly expressed genes reflects the fact the zzso region zzso little zzso and allows us to propose a pattern of descent for these chicken zzso zzso from a common zzso Taken together, these data explain how stable zzso zzso predominantly express a single class I zzso which in turn leads to striking associations of the chicken zzso with resistance to infectious pathogens and response to zzso
