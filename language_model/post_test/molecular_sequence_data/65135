A close inspection of the crystal structure of the zzso 20 S zzso revealed that a prominent connection between the two zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso Its zzso extension zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso on the opposite zzso We show that the interactions promoted by the zzso tail are important to facilitate the formation of 20 S particles from two zzso precursor complexes and/or to stabilize mature 20 S zzso The deletion of 19 zzso from the zzso C zzso leads to an zzso of zzso precursor complexes containing the maturation factor zzso The zzso extension of zzso which forms several hydrogen bonds with zzso is in addition required for the zzso activity zzso by the latter zzso zzso of the zzso tail of zzso results in an zzso of zzso zzso processing and zzso of zzso zzso Our data obtained with zzso strains that expressed the mature form of zzso lacking its zzso suggest that interactions between the zzso C zzso and zzso stabilize a zzso of its active site, which is essential for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso extension of zzso which wraps around zzso within the same zzso is zzso indicating that this extension serves an essential function in zzso assembly or zzso
