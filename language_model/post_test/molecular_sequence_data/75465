The gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned in zzso zzso zzso zzso The selection for the cloned gene was based upon the inability of zzso zzso to grow on zzso as sole carbon source by virtue of the absence of zzso zzso in its zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA obtained by zzso of zzso DNA with zzso were zzso into the zzso site of the zzso zzso zzso and transformed into the zzso zzso zzso A zzso able to zzso zzso as sole carbon source was zzso and the zzso was found to contain approximately five zzso pairs of zzso zzso zzso zzso of this DNA revealed the position of the gene for the zzso within the cloned DNA from zzso zzso The zzso sequencing procedure was used to determine the sequence of the gene and its translated zzso The zzso acid sequence and molecular weight for zzso zzso deduced from the gene sequence zzso zzso are in excellent agreement with zzso acid composition and molecular weight data for the zzso recently determined with zzso isolated from zzso zzso these recent zzso of the zzso molecular weight differ significantly from the originally reported value of zzso zzso Judith zzso zzso zzso & Kenyon, zzso (1974) zzso zzso which was used to demonstrate that zzso an active site directed irreversible zzso binds to the zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
