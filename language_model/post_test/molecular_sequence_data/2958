The effects of poor zzso bias and secondary structure formation upon the translation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been investigated in zzso zzso Following zzso zzso at the zzso of the zzso coding region, the gene was transformed into zzso and translation assessed directly in zzso by determining the distribution of the modified zzso zzso across zzso zzso by zzso density zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to control for minor differences between zzso zzso An zzso containing 13 zzso zzso at the zzso of the coding region was found to have no significant effect upon zzso zzso zzso In contrast, translation was inhibited by an zzso which increased the formation of secondary structures at the zzso of the zzso zzso delta G zzso zzso zzso Control insertions were also zzso to exclude the possibility that zzso to the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso affect the translation of its zzso These zzso which introduced preferred zzso or restored zzso levels of secondary structure formation, did not significantly influence zzso zzso zzso
