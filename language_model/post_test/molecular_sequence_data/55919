The zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is highly specific for a 17 base promoter zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and its promoter DNA have been zzso using modified zzso and a zzso kinetic zzso The incorporation of zzso in place of zzso at individual sites in the promoter sequence results in the replacement of an zzso zzso group by hydrogen zzso removing the zzso zzso This substitution has been placed individually at each of the zzso in the zzso consensus zzso Many of these zzso do not affect binding or zzso however, the zzso zzso group at zzso is critical to zzso The kinetic zzso zzso increases approximately zzso while zzso is only slightly affected, suggesting that this zzso zzso is critical to binding zzso but not to the zzso of zzso Two zzso groups near the start site on the template strand (at positions zzso and zzso also contribute to promoter zzso while nearby zzso groups on the zzso strand do zzso The implications of these results are discussed with respect to recent models for promoter zzso
