We determined zzso zzso of the zzso sequence located in an zzso zzso zzso zzso in the unique long zzso zzso region of zzso disease virus zzso 2 zzso and identified zzso and zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso The zzso and zzso zzso genes of zzso are arranged zzso with the zzso sequence of zzso In addition, an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso which has been identified within the zzso zzso gene of zzso has no apparent relation to any other known zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction confirmed the zzso of zzso transcripts related to the zzso and zzso 273 genes in zzso cells, except no transcript related to the zzso gene being zzso The putative protein product of the zzso zzso gene had a relatively low zzso but that of the zzso zzso gene had a moderate zzso among zzso Further, the possible functions and features of the predicted proteins zzso within the zzso region are zzso
