The zzso leader of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso harbors an internal zzso entry site zzso that is functional during the zzso phase of the cell zzso Here we show that translation initiation zzso by the zzso zzso requires the participation of zzso cellular factors other than the zzso zzso zzso We used zzso chemical and zzso zzso and an zzso zzso analysis to model the structure of the zzso zzso leader and we show, by means of a zzso zzso that zzso extracts provide protections to regions previously identified as crucial for zzso zzso zzso We also assessed the impact of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso did not significantly affect zzso activity suggesting that the requirement for zzso stable secondary or zzso structure within the zzso zzso may not be as strict as has been described for other viral zzso Finally, we used a zzso approach to identify cellular proteins within the zzso extracts that interact with the zzso zzso zzso Together, data show that zzso zzso translation initiation is modulated by cellular zzso
