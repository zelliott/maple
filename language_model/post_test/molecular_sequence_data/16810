Changes of serum zzso zzso chain structure have been found in B cell lineage tumors and zzso zzso Currently, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are used as serum tumor zzso In the present study, we analyzed the structure of serum zzso zzso chains in prostate cancer zzso patients using the simple new method of zzso zzso zzso zzso We also evaluated the relationship between changes of serum zzso zzso chain structure and serum concentration of zzso zzso zzso 

The structure of serum zzso zzso chains from 12 zzso patients (6 localized cancer, 6 zzso zzso and 10 healthy controls was evaluated by zzso zzso levels in serum were determined by zzso zzso 

zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso zzso decreased significantly zzso while zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso increased with zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso ratio in zzso zzso patients was significantly higher than in healthy controls zzso and there was a significant correlation zzso zzso between serum zzso levels and the zzso zzso zzso ratio in all patients with zzso 

The changes of serum zzso zzso chain structure with zzso progression are based on the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso the analysis of serum zzso zzso chain structure by zzso may be an auxiliary indicator of zzso for monitoring zzso zzso
