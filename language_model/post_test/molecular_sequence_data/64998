The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes an zzso recognition motif zzso protein that stimulates zzso upon binding a specific zzso zzso and subsequent zzso in a zzso in the zzso We present here the first systematic characterization of the family of proteins with characteristic zzso zzso acid zzso zzso proteins are an ancient zzso protein family with three identifiable zzso The zzso zzso zzso is unique to zzso proteins and is the most highly zzso of the three zzso zzso also contains zzso sequence elements at its zzso not found in other zzso zzso Single copy zzso genes are present in some zzso in zzso such as zzso and in the early branching zzso zzso zzso while plants contain small families of zzso zzso While the zzso zzso is highly zzso between plants and zzso indicating conservation of molecular mechanisms, plant zzso genes have changed biological context to regulate various aspects of zzso pattern zzso
