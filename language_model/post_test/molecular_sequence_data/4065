zzso a zzso zzso that is expressed on a number of zzso cell types in zzso is zzso in zzso and thought to play a significant role in zzso progression and zzso zzso zzso of the mechanisms of regulation of zzso gene expression is of considerable biological zzso Our aim was to evaluate regulation of zzso expression in zzso 

zzso I hypersensitive sites zzso were mapped in zzso from human cell lines and human zzso transgenic zzso zzso expression was evaluated by zzso and Northern zzso 

We identified two novel zzso in the zzso promoter at zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso start zzso These zzso were detected in human cell lines and in a human zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso was apparent in many cell types irrespective of the level of zzso expression but the zzso zzso was only evident in cells that express zzso and its intensity correlated with the abundance of zzso zzso The zzso zzso became zzso in cell lines representing a transition from colon zzso to zzso commensurate with a significant reduction in zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso regions are zzso between the human zzso and mouse zzso genes and may be associated with functionally important genetic zzso The zzso at zzso is in the vicinity of previously defined zzso mirror repeat elements that may form zzso zzso structures, which can alter the accessibility of zzso to regulatory zzso
