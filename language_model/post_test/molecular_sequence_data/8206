A zzso zzso of zzso zzso was identified on Western blots of all life cycle stages zzso with zzso zzso The smallest zzso has a relative zzso of about 15 zzso and larger zzso represent size increments of zzso zzso An zzso zzso clone zzso this zzso was characterized further by restriction zzso Southern zzso analysis, and zzso zzso The zzso is zzso by multiple copies of a zzso linked in tandem repeats of zzso zzso each of which encodes 132 zzso zzso These repeats have zzso sufficiently to produce distinct restriction zzso sites and Southern zzso zzso zzso The zzso insert contains no zzso and encodes 588 zzso zzso representing one incomplete and four complete zzso At the 3' end of three repeats, there are consensus zzso zzso zzso one repeat has no zzso zzso Two perfect repeats show a zzso zzso acid identity with one zzso the rest of the repeats, despite being adjacent to one another, show only zzso identical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sites are expressed by only two of the zzso Despite this structural diversity, each zzso zzso repeat showed zzso to zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein described in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
