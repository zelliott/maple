Rapid zzso adherence to donor organ zzso is a hallmark of zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular interactions required for zzso binding to vascular zzso have not been zzso 

zzso zzso performed between human zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso after exposure to human complement demonstrated that zzso was zzso by both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was blocked by zzso treatment of the zzso suggesting that this binding was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso primary sequence contained an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso acids with zzso identity to human zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso specifically bound to human zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with the full-length zzso zzso zzso resulted in surface expression of the protein and markedly increased the binding of human zzso to these zzso The binding of both soluble and zzso zzso zzso to human zzso was blocked by zzso of the zzso with zzso or the addition of zzso Finally, treatment of zzso with human zzso or normal human serum but not zzso human zzso or zzso human serum resulted in the rapid expression of zzso zzso on the cell zzso 

This report establishes that zzso zzso supports the binding of human zzso to zzso in zzso Further, these data suggest that zzso deposition of zzso during zzso rejection results in the expression of zzso zzso which may contribute to the rapid zzso of zzso to zzso zzso
