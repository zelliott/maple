zzso T zzso zzso detect and destroy cells displaying class I molecules of the major zzso complex zzso that present zzso derived from zzso self or foreign zzso Most class I zzso zzso are created from proteins that are zzso by zzso and zzso by the zzso associated with zzso processing, from the zzso into the zzso zzso where peptides bind zzso class I molecules and are conveyed to the cell zzso C2 zzso cloned from human zzso zzso a zzso cell zzso kill cancer cells zzso zzso growth zzso zzso Here we show that C2 cells recognize human zzso zzso zzso class I molecules presenting a zzso zzso zzso generated by protein zzso This process, previously described strictly in plants and zzso organisms, zzso zzso zzso of a zzso segment followed by zzso of the newly liberated zzso and zzso zzso The occurrence of protein zzso in zzso has important implications for the complexity of the zzso zzso and for the immune recognition of self and foreign zzso
