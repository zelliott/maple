zzso a zzso zzso antibiotic, is zzso in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Initially, zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso which is oxidized to the final zzso by zzso zzso zzso Additionally, this zzso is a zzso zzso being able to also generate zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso active site zzso on the zzso zzso To explore the functionality of this zzso in other zzso we have examined culture extracts by zzso and established the presence of zzso in five zzso zzso zzso examination of the predicted zzso primary zzso acid sequences revealed zzso in the zzso zzso zzso active zzso To examine whether the zzso zzso site was zzso active in another zzso we characterized the least related zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Following expression and zzso zzso showed a normal reduced CO difference spectrum at 450 zzso in contrast to the unusual zzso peak observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can catalyze the conversion of zzso to zzso but was unable to catalyze the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso zzso modeling with our crystal structure of zzso suggests that the absence of key zzso acids for binding the essential zzso zzso zzso zzso may be the explanation for the loss of zzso zzso
