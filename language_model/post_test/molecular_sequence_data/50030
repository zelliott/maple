A central question in protein folding is the relative importance of locally zzso structure and cooperative interactions among zzso distant in zzso We have been exploring this question in a predominantly zzso zzso since zzso formation clearly relies on both local and global sequence zzso We present evidence that a zzso zzso corresponding to two linked zzso of cellular zzso zzso protein I zzso I) adopts significant native structure in zzso zzso Prior work from our laboratory showed that the two turns contained in this zzso zzso III and zzso had the highest tendency of any of the eight turns in this zzso zzso to fold into native zzso In addition, the primary sequence of these two turns is well zzso throughout the structural family to which zzso I belongs, and zzso in the turns and their associated zzso participate in a network of zzso long-range zzso We propose that the strong zzso biases within the chain segment zzso turns III and IV favor zzso interactions that are crucial to the folding and zzso stability of zzso I, and may play a similar role in related zzso zzso proteins zzso
