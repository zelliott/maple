A theoretical method for the rational design of a zzso scorpion toxin with a wider spectrum of specificity for zzso channels and a more stable zzso than in its natural zzso is zzso On the basis of the analysis of molecular zzso zzso zzso of the protein spatial structures, structural features for a family of five short scorpion toxins were zzso The analysis of the maps of two-dimensional zzso zzso contacts allowed the identification of zzso acid zzso responsible for the folding of the protein and/or for the manifestation of its specific zzso The theoretically predicted zzso roles of the zzso were compared with experimental data on the zzso of zzso Based on the results of zzso calculations and with the theory of protein molecular evolution used as an additional criterion for the selection of zzso the zzso acid sequence and the spatial structure of a zzso scorpion toxin were zzso
