A zzso of bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso distant from zzso zzso was recently shown to be specifically zzso by zzso We establish here that a set of randomly selected representatives from this zzso zzso protect zzso coli from zzso zzso and that the zzso proteins catalyze transport of zzso in zzso zzso alignments and membrane transport experiments using zzso zzso zzso response zzso and zzso zzso zzso recordings reveal four zzso traits that set zzso proteins apart from all other known zzso First, zzso lack zzso zzso that form the zzso binding site in zzso zzso Second, zzso exhibit high zzso selectivity for zzso over zzso Third, at a zzso thought to distinguish zzso channels and zzso zzso bear a zzso zzso rather than a zzso zzso and yet are zzso zzso Finally, zzso exchange occurs with zzso zzso in contrast to the usual value of zzso
