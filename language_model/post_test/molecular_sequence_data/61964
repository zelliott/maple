We have studied the functional steps by which zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso took place via a mechanism that is consistent with the existence of (at least zzso carrier zzso zzso was zzso inside zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and it was exported into the zzso via an export system that was inhibited by zzso and which was different from the zzso zzso zzso To understand the role of the putative zzso zzso carrier, zzso in this pathway, an zzso zzso strain was zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso cells were compared with zzso zzso with respect to the capability to take up zzso to zzso zzso from it, and to export zzso into the zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso cells specifically lost the ability to export zzso but did not lose the ability to take up zzso zzso or zzso and to zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is proposed to be the zzso zzso export zzso Moreover, deletion of the zzso gene resulted in a specific reduction of the activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso zzso For the zzso zzso of zzso zzso we could demonstrate that this was not due to a changed level of zzso zzso or to a change in the degree of zzso of the zzso Instead, the amount of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was strongly reduced, indicating an additional regulatory role for zzso in protein synthesis or zzso
