Our knowledge of the gene coding for zzso the major zzso zzso is mainly based on zzso zzso Only two sequences are available in zzso To know whether the snake sequence is representative of the zzso condition in zzso we have studied zzso in two zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses numerous zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso regions, but its central region is highly zzso even when compared with the snake zzso This rapid evolution rate indicates that a single zzso sequence was not zzso and that comparative studies of zzso zzso might be useful to detect the zzso which are really important for zzso structure and zzso zzso and zzso zzso structure is roughly similar, but no data support zzso being similarly expressed during zzso By performing in zzso zzso using a specific probe, we showed that zzso zzso express zzso as described during zzso zzso However, we have not found zzso transcripts in zzso This indicates that full-length zzso is specific to zzso zzso at least in this zzso
