zzso is a key zzso in zzso zzso generating the precursor zzso zzso by zzso the zzso embedded in the primary transcripts zzso The specificity for the zzso and determination of the zzso site are provided by its binding partner zzso which is necessary for efficient zzso The crucial zzso zzso for zzso zzso are the middle part, the two zzso zzso III zzso zzso and the zzso binding domain zzso in the zzso Here, we identify alternatively spliced transcripts in human melanoma and zzso cell lines, zzso zzso truncated zzso proteins lacking part of the zzso and the entire zzso zzso generated from these alternative zzso zzso fail to bind to zzso but still interact with Ewing zzso protein zzso In zzso as well as in zzso the zzso zzso zzso are deficient in zzso zzso However, the zzso transcripts in melanoma cells do not consistently reduce mature zzso levels compared with melanoma cell lines lacking those zzso zzso possibly zzso to their limited zzso Our findings show that alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso exist in melanoma zzso In elevated zzso these alternatively spliced transcripts could provide one potential mechanism accounting for the deregulation of zzso in cancer zzso On the basis of our results, the search for alternative inactive zzso zzso might be fruitful in different tumor entities to unravel the molecular basis of the previously observed decreased zzso processing efficiency in zzso
