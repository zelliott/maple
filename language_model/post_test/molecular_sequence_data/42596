A full-length zzso zzso clone was isolated from a sheep liver zzso zzso The zzso sequence consisted of zzso zzso and contained the coding region of zzso zzso The deduced sequence of the mature protein was zzso zzso acids zzso The similarity of the sheep zzso zzso zzso acid sequence with those of human and rat were zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene was investigated by Northern zzso The gene was not expressed in zzso zzso nor at other zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso gene was also studied during sheep zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was already detected in zzso of 1 zzso long zzso and levels similar to those found in liver from adult sheep were reached half way through zzso
