The zzso conversion of peptides and proteins produced by zzso DNA technology is a promising method for large-scale production of peptides including those with zzso structural zzso As a model system we have investigated the zzso modification of a chemically zzso substance zzso In the precursor zzso the zzso of substance zzso were flanked by zzso zzso on both zzso In the first step the zzso zzso zzso was replaced by the authentic zzso zzso zzso of substance P via zzso zzso The zzso simultaneously attacks two zzso bonds in the precursor zzso leading to the formation of several zzso The desired zzso was obtained with zzso zzso In the second step the other zzso zzso was selectively and almost zzso removed from the zzso of the precursor via zzso zzso This study demonstrates that substance P can be obtained from an engineered protein by zzso zzso
