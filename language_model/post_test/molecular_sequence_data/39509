Two zzso zzso zzso strains were enriched from permanently cold, shallow zzso marine sediments in zzso Bay, zzso One strain, zzso oxidized zzso zzso and was isolated in defined zzso with a zzso zzso or in a zzso zzso that also contained an zzso zzso The other enrichment culture zzso oxidized zzso The growth of these zzso cultures was very zzso approximately 1 year for zzso of strain zzso to form colonies and zzso year for the zzso enrichment to form zzso Neither culture grew zzso when supplied with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso plus zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso but did not zzso zzso or zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso gene sequence suggested that strain zzso was only zzso related to cultivated zzso bacteria, and that this strain represented a new zzso We propose zzso zzso with strain zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso This report is the first description of zzso as well as marine zzso zzso zzso zzso
