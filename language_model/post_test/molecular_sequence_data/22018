zzso zzso was isolated from biological soil zzso in the Colorado zzso zzso The isolate was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the presence of zzso but did not contain zzso zzso The strain tested positive for zzso zzso and zzso and was negative for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso The major fatty acids present were zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso It had a high DNA zzso content of 75 zzso Comparisons of zzso zzso gene sequences identified zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as the bacteria most closely related to strain zzso zzso zzso was placed roughly zzso from the above zzso Based on its zzso placement and zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso is assigned to a new zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed as the type strain of the type species of this zzso with the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
