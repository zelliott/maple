Human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso is a member of the zzso growth factor zzso family of zzso zzso zzso that play important roles in all processes of cell zzso Their zzso is related to many zzso including examples in the breast, zzso and zzso zzso therapies targeting the zzso zzso have shown promise, and zzso zzso against zzso II and IV of the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso are currently used in treatments for some types of breast zzso Since anti zzso zzso targeting distinct zzso have different biological effects on cancer zzso in this research linear and zzso B cell zzso of zzso zzso zzso III, were identified by zzso analyses using a combination of linear B cell zzso prediction web servers such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Then, zzso zzso and zzso software tools were employed for zzso B cell zzso zzso In contrast to previously reported zzso of zzso zzso we predicted zzso B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by the integrated strategy and and zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso zzso zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso These zzso could be further used as zzso zzso to actively immune mice for development of new zzso zzso and zzso cancer vaccines that target different zzso or structural zzso of zzso zzso
