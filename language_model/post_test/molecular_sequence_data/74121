Based on pioneering work of Hardy and zzso zzso has become one of the best studied zzso zzso in zzso zzso both from a zzso and evolutionary zzso zzso is a zzso protein that zzso to the zzso head of zzso In zzso zzso rabbit and zzso zzso precursor essentially consists of two or three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one zzso domain, one incomplete and four complete D zzso zzso to zzso Mouse zzso is distinguished from this general pattern by 20 extra partial D3 zzso While concerted evolution drives the divergence of the zzso domain in the zzso comparison, zzso and D zzso mainly diverge under the influence of drift and positive selection, both in the zzso and zzso zzso As can be seen particularly well within a putative binding region in the most zzso zzso domain, positive selection not only causes zzso acid exchanges, but also promotes changes in the pattern of predicted zzso zzso Moving window and correlation analyses of sequence evolution and sexual body zzso further suggest that sexual selection, especially zzso competition, drives zzso zzso However, considering its zzso zzso zzso female cryptic choice might as well contribute to zzso zzso Despite the general tendency for divergence of zzso conservation by negative selection dominates the evolution of most zzso zzso In zzso the distribution of zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso single zzso and zzso motifs suggests a wide conservation of processing, folding and zzso of zzso in zzso rabbit and zzso
