zzso zzso binds 3 zzso of zzso per zzso of zzso To determine which of six zzso structures in the protein are responsible for zzso zzso we constructed three zzso forms of this zzso one lacking zzso 2 zzso delta zzso the other lacking zzso 2 and 6 zzso delta zzso and the third containing only zzso 3 and 4 zzso delta zzso and examined their binding properties by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso delta 2 and zzso delta zzso bound 3 zzso of zzso per zzso of protein with high zzso Thus, zzso zzso 2 and 6 are not essential for calcium binding to the zzso and an absence of zzso 2 and/or 6 does not alter the pattern of zzso binding to the zzso Using resonance energy transfer from zzso zzso one of the high affinity zzso sites zzso zzso had a greater affinity than the other two sites zzso B and zzso of each zzso Site A was filled before the other two zzso zzso competition experiments showed that a greater amount of calcium was required to zzso zzso from site A than from sites B or zzso Energy transfer experiments from zzso to zzso showed that two of the zzso sites are in close proximity while the third site is distant from the other two zzso To determine whether zzso 3 or 4 was responsible for binding of zzso we examined the zzso binding properties of a delta zzso zzso zzso The truncated protein zzso delta zzso contained a single zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso binding to zzso delta zzso construct showed that site 4 bound zzso whereas site 3 did zzso Analysis of the zzso binding characteristics of the proteins suggests that zzso 1, 4, and 5 of rat brain zzso zzso are responsible for zzso zzso
