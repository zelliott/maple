The introduction by zzso of a method which uses zzso zzso DNA as a template for zzso zzso has greatly simplified the procedure for introducing point zzso into DNA in a zzso zzso We have extended the use of this method to introduce block zzso into specific regions of DNA, using zzso zzso containing multiple zzso zzso which contain new restriction zzso The zzso with up to 15 zzso can specifically and zzso bind to the predicted target zzso Because of the high zzso rate and convenient selection by restriction zzso zzso this method of introducing zzso block zzso into DNA is very easy and zzso We have constructed a series of block zzso in the promoter of the gene for the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by this method showing that a block zzso in the zzso responsive element zzso completely zzso protein binding to zzso in zzso and causes a dramatic decrease in the zzso zzso from the zzso promoter in zzso
