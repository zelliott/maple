Human zzso viruses zzso and zzso zzso a zzso protein that activates zzso from the long terminal zzso The target for zzso is termed the zzso responsive zzso zzso zzso has an extensively folded zzso secondary structure and is present at the zzso end of all viral zzso zzso similarities exist between both zzso and zzso of the two zzso The zzso element of zzso zzso resembles a tandem zzso of the zzso hairpin zzso zzso zzso many of the protein zzso in zzso although it is slightly larger than its zzso Given the similarity between the two zzso zzso it is somewhat unexpected that zzso zzso zzso only poorly activates the zzso zzso zzso Here, we tested whether the duplicated structure of zzso is required for full zzso zzso We show that the addition of a second zzso hairpin to zzso increased its zzso responsiveness by zzso
