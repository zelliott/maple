Using the zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso gene zzso were examined in 24 cases of zzso tumor including 14 zzso zzso and 2 borderline cases of common zzso type, 7 germ cell tumors, and one zzso zzso zzso bands indicating zzso were detected in 12 zzso of the cases zzso being present most frequently in common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One case each of zzso cell zzso originating in a zzso zzso and zzso zzso were positive for zzso zzso sequencing confirmed 12 zzso and revealed zzso and zzso zzso changes in 5 and 3 cases zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was localized at the zzso site of the gene in 3 zzso zzso examination of zzso protein in 21 cases and DNA zzso analysis in 17 cases were also zzso Nuclear zzso of the zzso protein and DNA zzso pattern were detected in 11 zzso and 9 zzso cases, zzso These were significantly correlated with zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso exact zzso Neither zzso of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso of zzso protein nor DNA zzso was detected in borderline cases of common zzso type, typical zzso and immature zzso These results suggest that zzso gene zzso nuclear zzso of the protein and the DNA zzso pattern are events occurring almost simultaneously in the progression of zzso tumors, and that zzso abnormalities seem to be correlated with a high grade of zzso
