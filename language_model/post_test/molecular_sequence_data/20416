Recently, the zzso event of zzso zzso has been reported with high frequency, suggesting that zzso zzso is a major driving force in zzso zzso To assess the zzso of zzso zzso in a residential area, we conducted a molecular biological survey of zzso existing in sewage water in zzso zzso zzso Although zzso was predominantly detected in sewage water that was associated with a high frequency of outbreaks caused by this zzso other zzso including two types of zzso strain, were identified during the survey zzso One of the zzso is the zzso type, which was first detected in zzso zzso in zzso The other zzso is a novel type derived from two parent strains of zzso II, zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso This suggests that certain zzso circulating in the area are occasionally changing their genetic properties by zzso zzso
