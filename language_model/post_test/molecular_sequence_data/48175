zzso of the zzso coli zzso carrier was replaced by zzso zzso zzso zzso or Val zzso While the level of carrier in the membrane for each zzso remained similar to that for the wild type, analysis of zzso transport showed an zzso of zzso zzso and a drastic reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected on zzso plates containing zzso and zzso were found at nine distinct locations in the zzso Eight zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two zzso were also isolated from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso strain yielded an zzso substitution and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso strain had transport properties similar to those of the wild zzso Analysis of zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was still defective in the zzso zzso zzso and only the zzso zzso and zzso zzso regained significant zzso zzso In general, downhill zzso transport in the presence of zzso was better in the zzso strains than in the parental zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso required a high zzso concentration zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso and zzso zzso lowered the zzso for zzso while other zzso restored transport zzso We suggest that the zzso of positive charges on membrane zzso is zzso for the loss of zzso and that zzso II is close to zzso IV and zzso We also suggest that zzso is salt bridged to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
