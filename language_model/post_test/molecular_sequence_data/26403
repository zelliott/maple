zzso hormones are responsible for the specific zzso and structural changes that occur during zzso zzso In this study we screened a series of zzso from a library constructed from zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso in order to identify a clone that could be used to study the influence of zzso on zzso gene expression during zzso zzso zzso The zzso from one clone exhibited a greater degree of zzso to liver zzso from zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso and no zzso to zzso from tail fins of zzso of either zzso On Northern zzso the zzso to which the zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso The pattern of zzso to zzso DNA zzso by various restriction zzso was consistent with the presence of a single zzso Using slot zzso analysis we found that the zzso levels first rose above zzso levels only after 5 days of immersion of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso levels increased approximately zzso after 7 and 9 days of zzso zzso zzso had zzso levels that were intermediate between those in zzso zzso and zzso immersed in zzso for 7 zzso zzso analysis revealed a significant degree of zzso to serum zzso and zzso While it is known that serum zzso levels rise dramatically during metamorphosis in zzso species, presumably playing a critical role in maintaining water and zzso balance during the zzso zzso phase, the molecular basis of the induction has not been fully zzso
