During the course of characterizing fragments bound to an zzso floral protein zzso in zzso a gene zzso a putative zzso protein zzso was found on one of the zzso The deduced zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso named zzso are zzso identical to a previously reported zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The gene is composed of 6 zzso and maps at 10 zzso from the upper end of zzso zzso Northern zzso experiments indicated that the gene is strongly expressed in leaves, moderately in roots, and very zzso in zzso Further in zzso analysis of the expression in floral buds showed that the zzso gene is expressed at zzso is not expressed at the floral organ zzso of wild type floral zzso but is moderately expressed in the floral organ zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso binding zzso suggest that the zzso protein binds to a sequence similar to, but different from, the known zzso consensus zzso the zzso box, located 3' downstream of the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso expression is zzso regulated by the AG zzso A close zzso of the zzso zzso named zzso was also isolated from the zzso zzso zzso The expression pattern of the zzso gene differs from that of zzso It is strongly expressed in leaves, moderately in flowers, and zzso in zzso
