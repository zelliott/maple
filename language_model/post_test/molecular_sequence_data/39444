zzso of zzso signaling zzso proteins are indispensable negative regulators of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso consist of a variable zzso region, a central zzso zzso zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso region in zzso and zzso includes the so-called zzso zzso region that has been shown to inhibit the zzso activity of zzso Here, we present a crystal structure at zzso A resolution of the zzso extended zzso domain of zzso in complex with its zzso target on the zzso zzso zzso The structure reveals that major insertions in the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain are responsible for binding to zzso with high affinity and zzso In addition, the structure provides insights into the possible mechanisms by which zzso and zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso
