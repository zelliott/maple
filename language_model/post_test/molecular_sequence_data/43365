The zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso activated by the zzso domain zzso zzso found in the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is predicted to allow zzso hydrogen bonding and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso has assumed greater relevance with the recent observation that zzso the most common genetic form of human zzso is caused by a similar zzso domain zzso that activates zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso We have isolated novel transforming derivatives of zzso using a large pool of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Several of the transforming zzso identified were unusual in that they lacked a zzso at zzso zzso and others were unique in that they contained multiple zzso zzso within the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the transforming zzso often exhibited a spacing of seven zzso or occurred in positions likely to represent the zzso zzso However, the distinction between the sequences of the transforming clones and the zzso clones did not suggest clear rules for predicting which specific sequences would result in zzso zzso and zzso To investigate these requirements further, entirely novel zzso sequences were constructed based on tandem repeats of simple zzso zzso zzso was achieved by zzso sequences such as zzso or zzso whereas zzso was not achieved by a zzso domain consisting only of Val zzso In the context of these zzso zzso zzso or zzso were equally zzso while zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Using zzso zzso with two zzso zzso the spacing between these was systematically varied from two to eight zzso with only the zzso spacing resulting in zzso zzso These results are discussed in the context of zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso that are responsible for the human zzso syndromes zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso
