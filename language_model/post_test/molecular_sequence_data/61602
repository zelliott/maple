Through a process of protein zzso and vaccination we previously identified four native zzso that zzso a degree of protection against challenge with zzso zzso One of these, Ana 29 has been successfully cloned and zzso using zzso zzso designed to zzso and internal zzso zzso The full-length gene codes for a protein with a theoretical molecular weight of 27 zzso and zzso zzso The sequence is highly zzso showing zzso identity between two Australian and an American isolate of zzso zzso The gene sequences from these zzso also share zzso identity with the strain of zzso zzso used in the commercial Australian zzso zzso prediction zzso suggest the native protein is an integral membrane zzso This protein has been zzso and zzso from zzso coli and used in vaccination trials in cattle using two zzso The initial results from the trial show a significant level of protection was obtained with one zzso in comparison, the second zzso slightly aggravated the zzso zzso data suggests a good correlation between the induction of an zzso response and zzso
