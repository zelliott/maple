A method for the stabilization of transient folding zzso is zzso zzso folds and unfolds via such an zzso zzso that destabilize the folded state relative to the folding intermediate had been previously identified from the free energy profiles for the unfolding of zzso zzso It is predicted that the zzso of such zzso should lead to the intermediate being the most stable species at certain zzso of zzso zzso were prepared that contained combinations of such zzso The behavior of these zzso on zzso zzso was studied by zzso for zzso structure zzso zzso zzso secondary structure zzso zzso and zzso volume zzso zzso Whereas zzso shows a two-state transition in all cases, with the same zzso values being found by all zzso some of the zzso show different transitions with different structural zzso On increasing concentration of zzso the zzso structure of these zzso is lost before all the secondary structure and before the protein shows the maximum expanded volume that is characteristic of the unfolded zzso These zzso thus accumulate an intermediate state at equilibrium under certain zzso zzso The intermediate state retains some degree of secondary structure but has a disrupted zzso structure, and its degree of zzso is intermediate between the folded and the unfolded forms, probably expanding with increasing concentration of zzso The zzso of the intermediate should allow its direct characterization by zzso especially zzso
