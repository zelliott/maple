We have characterized a zzso zzso named zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments interact with an average of zzso zzso 20,000 sites on resting zzso with a zzso value of zzso zzso This value decreased to zzso zzso in the presence of 1 zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso increases the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fragments exhibit a similar potency and induce binding of zzso and zzso at levels comparable to those obtained with zzso zzso zzso zzso however, was not inhibited by 1 zzso zzso and was not associated with a significant zzso release, suggesting differences with zzso in the mechanism of zzso Among a large series of synthetic peptides corresponding to potential zzso sequences within the structure of zzso one zzso with the sequence zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso This zzso zzso to a putative zzso site whose sequence is highly zzso to similar sequences present in the alpha zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso Despite this zzso zzso interacts only with zzso zzso suggesting that the identified zzso may be differently exposed at the surface of the zzso This zzso may prove to be a valuable tool to study the induction reaction on zzso zzso expressed in cells that lack the appropriate signal zzso zzso
