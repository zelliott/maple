A zzso based on the zzso element zzso from zzso zzso was introduced into the zzso of zzso zzso using transformation zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso carries a zzso version of the white gene zzso of zzso inserted into the second zzso of zzso Transformation was obtained by injecting the zzso into zzso zzso that were expressing zzso either from a zzso fusion inserted into the zzso via zzso transformation or from a zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso Between zzso and zzso of the fertile injected individuals gave transformed zzso Four of the insertions were cloned and the DNA sequences zzso the zzso ends were zzso The zzso sites corresponding to three of the insertions were amplified from the recipient strain by zzso zzso and zzso In all cases, the zzso has inserted into a zzso zzso and has created the characteristic zzso target site zzso In the absence of zzso the insertions were stable in the zzso and the germ zzso However, in the presence of the zzso gene the zzso zzso zzso resulting in mosaic eyes and zzso zzso to the white zzso zzso could be zzso as an alternative to existing systems for zzso tagging and zzso zzso in zzso it might also be of use as a zzso transformation zzso for zzso zzso
