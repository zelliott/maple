DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso is a multiple zzso complex consisting of at least four zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Pol zzso has been shown to play essential roles in zzso DNA zzso Here, we report zzso of the zzso pol zzso complex, which was expressed and zzso from zzso insect zzso During the zzso we were able to resolve the pol zzso complex and truncated zzso zzso zzso as was observed initially with the pol zzso zzso from zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso salt sensitivity, zzso and stimulation by zzso cell nuclear zzso indicates that the zzso pol zzso is functionally identical to native pol zzso zzso from zzso and is therefore useful for zzso characterization of the interactions of pol zzso with other zzso zzso and repair zzso Identification and characterization of a zzso cell nuclear zzso consensus interaction domain on zzso indicates that the motif is zzso for DNA replication but is important for zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso Analysis of the putative zinc finger domain of zzso for zinc binding capacity demonstrates that it binds zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the putative zinc finger domain reduced zinc zzso indicating that zzso zzso are directly involved in binding zzso
