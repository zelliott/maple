We have isolated one full-length zzso zzso termed zzso and a number of clones of shorter insert zzso tentatively called zzso zzso zzso all zzso zzso zzso zzso forms of rabbit liver zzso zzso zzso and determined their zzso zzso The zzso zzso by these zzso can be classified into five types, represented by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the deduced zzso acid sequences of which are more than zzso similar to one zzso zzso acid differences among them total 24 positions, which are distributed over the entire zzso in contrast to the zzso observed in two zzso rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The primary structure deduced for the zzso protein is zzso similar to that determined for rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been zzso by zzso and co-workers zzso der zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1974) zzso zzso zzso zzso 60, zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1976) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the major zzso form of rabbit liver zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso which we have zzso as the major zzso rabbit liver zzso zzso was partially determined with the sequence reported for zzso zzso as a zzso The two sequences are closely similar to each other, but at least two zzso acid differences can be detected between zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
