zzso sequences that uniquely zzso zzso zzso of each group of zzso were zzso and used as zzso zzso for the identification of zzso bacteria possessing the zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways for zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso followed by zzso The washing temperature was determined zzso to be 50 and 52 degrees C for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso bound to probe zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso bound to probe zzso zzso zzso zzso did not bind to either zzso The zzso were also labeled with fluorescent zzso zzso fixed to microscope slides were zzso with these zzso washed, and examined in a zzso microscope equipped with appropriate filter zzso zzso of zzso bacteria possessing the zzso or zzso zzso specifically bind zzso designed for each zzso zzso with a mixture of cells of type I and II zzso were detected and differentiated with single zzso or mixed zzso labeled with different fluorescent zzso which enabled the detection of both types of cells in the same microscopic zzso
