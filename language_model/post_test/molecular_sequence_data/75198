Recently, we have reported on the presence of two forms of zzso zzso in rat liver and zzso zzso referred to as zzso and zzso zzso zzso Maines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Maines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the two forms differed in several zzso properties, we could not ascertain whether they represented two zzso or whether they were zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, we provide evidence suggesting that the two forms are zzso and represent different gene zzso We also provide data suggesting that zzso is the commonly known zzso zzso zzso The molecular weight and zzso properties of zzso and zzso did not vary depending on the tissue source zzso zzso liver and zzso Major differences, however, were noted in the zzso acid composition of the two forms including the presence of 3 zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso to zzso four zzso clones and two liver clones were isolated, and one liver and one zzso clone were zzso Both clones revealed a zzso zzso and the sequence of both zzso was the zzso The zzso of assignment was confirmed by matching a zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was detected between the zzso insert and the published zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso However, zzso acid zzso search revealed the presence of two regions of zzso one zzso sequence with only one zzso zzso acid, and one zzso sequence with one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to be the zzso form, an assignment based on its zzso acid sequence matching the sequence of 2 peptides obtained from zzso zzso and the zzso properties of the zzso zzso and zzso rat liver zzso The secondary structure prediction analysis revealed an area of zzso structural zzso with only zzso sequence zzso We predict this region may represent the zzso site of the zzso
