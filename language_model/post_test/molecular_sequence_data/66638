DNA zzso of the zzso is essential for zzso development and plays crucial roles in a variety of biological processes including zzso zzso Although the DNA zzso zzso zzso protein lacks DNA zzso activity, it is thought to establish the maternal imprint in combination with the functional DNA zzso zzso apparently proceeds normally in female mice zzso for a targeted deletion of zzso but their zzso offspring zzso die before zzso due to an zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso is required for the establishment of maternal zzso imprints both in the zzso and the zzso and that the zzso of these zzso develop zzso There is a zzso in the formation of the zzso reduced formation of the zzso layer, excess zzso giant cells and insufficient attachment between the zzso layer and the zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate arrest of proliferation of the zzso tissue without zzso in zzso and a zzso of the cell fate of zzso zzso stem cells in zzso Furthermore, we report that DNA zzso during zzso is essential for the establishment of zzso zzso These findings provide evidence that not only is DNA zzso required for the appropriate maternal imprint in the zzso but that the appropriate imprint is absolutely required for zzso zzso
