zzso dominant zzso inflammatory zzso zzso is an zzso condition of the eye that zzso mimics zzso zzso zzso and zzso diabetic zzso as it zzso to complete zzso We identified two different zzso zzso in the zzso gene in three zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso a zzso zzso zzso that is expressed in retinal zzso zzso Both zzso cause zzso from the cell membrane to the zzso and structural modeling reveals that both zzso lie within a zzso domain near the active zzso zzso is only the second member of the large zzso gene family to cause a human zzso disorder, and this is the first report of a specific molecular cause for zzso eye zzso Further investigation of these zzso is likely to provide insight into the zzso mechanisms of common diseases ranging from zzso disorders to diabetic zzso
