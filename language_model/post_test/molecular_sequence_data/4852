We have zzso cloned and characterized the genes coding for the zzso system of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of this zzso zzso previously identified as an zzso zzso shows a modular organization similar to that described for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso The construction of zzso zzso between zzso and bacteria (or zzso that belong to different zzso families has shown that the interchange of functional zzso switches zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso appears to be a natural zzso zzso of zzso origin, that is the zzso domain was highly similar to that of the zzso zzso coded by a gene found in the zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso domain was zzso to those found in the zzso zzso of the zzso system that is responsible for the binding to the zzso zzso present in the cell wall zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed that this zzso shares important properties with those of the major zzso zzso found in an zzso clinical zzso zzso These peculiar characteristics have been ascribed to a modified zzso zzso The natural zzso zzso described here provides further support for the theory of modular evolution of proteins and its characteristics also furnish interesting clues on the molecular mechanisms involved in the more invasive types of zzso zzso
