The zzso zzso growth factor is a member of the zzso family which is efficiently zzso and contains a single zzso zzso zzso To study the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso we zzso the human zzso zzso to eliminate the zzso signal and the zzso zzso was cloned into a zzso expression zzso Studies of zzso from the zzso medium of cells expressing this zzso revealed that the lack of zzso did not impair zzso however the zzso protein was immediately zzso into two zzso truncated peptides of 13 and 15 zzso which appeared to be more biologically active than the zzso zzso These two proteins also showed higher zzso binding affinity than that of zzso zzso We have expressed in bacteria the larger of these two proteins zzso in which the zzso 36 zzso acids present in the mature form of zzso have been zzso zzso zzso on several cell lines showed that zzso zzso zzso had approximately five times higher biological activity than zzso zzso zzso Studies of zzso binding showed that zzso had higher affinity than zzso zzso for two of the four members of zzso zzso family, specifically for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also had increased zzso binding ability, but this property does not appear to be responsible for the increased affinity for zzso zzso Thus removal of the zzso 36 zzso acids from the mature zzso produces growth factor molecules with an altered zzso resulting in higher zzso zzso and more efficient binding to zzso zzso Although it is not clear whether zzso of zzso to generate zzso occurs in zzso this could represent a novel mechanism of zzso of growth factor zzso
