To investigate the meaning of the zzso in the zzso zzso promoter zzso region of zzso B virus zzso during the chronic zzso infection, zzso were examined in the zzso zzso region zzso half of X zzso and their correlation with zzso in the zzso and core regions in relation to the presence of chronic liver zzso The entire zzso sequences of the zzso region were determined by direct sequencing of the amplified products derived from 30 cases with chronic zzso zzso The results were compared to the zzso in the zzso and core zzso In the zzso region, 91 generally scattered zzso zzso were zzso There were 11 zzso in the 10 zzso healthy carriers zzso zzso and 80 in the 20 chronic liver disease patients zzso The most frequent zzso from A to T at zzso zzso and from G to A at zzso zzso were seen in none of the 10 zzso carriers and in 14 zzso of the 20 chronic liver disease zzso Comparisons of zzso in the zzso and core regions revealed that 14 of 16 patients with zzso in the core region had the zzso in the zzso region and/or a zzso stop zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso in the zzso and zzso regions may affect the expression of the core and zzso peptides and might be involved in the zzso of chronic liver zzso
