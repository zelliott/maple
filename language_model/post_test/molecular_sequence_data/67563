About zzso of the proteins zzso in the zzso are expressed as membrane proteins but these represent zzso of all the structures solved zzso In view of the zzso and pharmaceutical significance of membrane proteins it is clear that a better and more comprehensive understanding of their three-dimensional zzso structures at atomic resolution is zzso zzso integral membrane proteins are generally more difficult to work with than zzso proteins and this has particularly been true for the zzso members such as the large family of zzso zzso In this chapter we describe the practical aspects of the zzso zzso zzso structure determination of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso sensory zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This is the first time that a three-dimensional structure of a zzso protein has been determined by zzso
