In zzso four zzso zzso with a relatively restricted zzso catalyze the zzso of the four natural zzso When cultured zzso cells, originating from the malaria zzso zzso zzso were examined for zzso zzso activities, only a single zzso was zzso zzso the corresponding gene was cloned and zzso While the zzso zzso zzso zzso all four natural zzso it displayed an unexpectedly higher relative efficiency for the zzso of zzso versus zzso zzso than the fruit fly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso could also zzso some medically interesting zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the biological significance of zzso zzso zzso and their diversity among insects remains zzso the observed variation provides a whole range of applications, as species specific and highly selective targets for zzso they have a potential to be used in the zzso production of various zzso zzso and as suicide genes in gene zzso
