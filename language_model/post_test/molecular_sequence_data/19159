Many zzso zzso have evolved tactics to zzso host cell death or survival pathways for establishing zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso which triggers zzso in zzso In this article, we show that zzso zzso of human zzso involves zzso zzso of the zzso adapter protein zzso zzso was also zzso when zzso was zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso adapter inducing zzso in zzso zzso The zzso site was mapped to zzso in the central region of zzso zzso is consequently split by zzso in two fragments, one harboring the death domain and the other the zzso zzso zzso was identified as the zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso in in zzso zzso zzso In line with a broad role of zzso in the execution of zzso the processing of zzso was not restricted to zzso infection and to zzso zzso zzso adapter inducing zzso zzso but was also triggered by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso therefore seems to be a common event in the advanced stages of zzso when zzso is zzso We propose that the processing of zzso zzso its scaffolding function and zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso from the initiation of zzso signaling zzso The disruption of zzso may consequently render dying cells less sensitive to zzso stimuli in the execution phase of zzso The zzso of zzso could therefore be a means of zzso zzso tolerance to zzso cells to ensure silent, zzso cell zzso
