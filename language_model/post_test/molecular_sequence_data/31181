A zzso zzso zzso of both zzso operators in the zzso regulatory sequence was performed yielding zzso with four identical base pair exchanges at equivalent positions in the four zzso operator half zzso The zzso were cloned between bipolar zzso and zzso indicator genes on a zzso zzso allowing the quantitative analysis of their effects in zzso In the absence of zzso zzso the zzso lead to considerably different expression levels of both zzso They are discussed with respect to the promoter consensus zzso In particular, the zzso region of the in zzso active zzso promoter is zzso defined by these zzso In the presence of zzso zzso most of the zzso exhibit a lower affinity for that protein as determined zzso by their reduced expression zzso In general, zzso operator recognition is most strongly affected by zzso of base pairs near the center of the zzso zzso The most important position is the third base pair, followed by base pairs two, four, five and six, the latter showing similar effects as base pair zzso At each position, the four possible base pairs show different affinities for zzso zzso They are discussed according to their exposure of zzso donors and zzso in the major and minor grooves of the zzso The results are in agreement with major groove contacts at positions two, three and zzso At position four a low potential correlation of efficiencies with the zzso in the minor groove is found, while zzso at position six seem to influence zzso binding by other zzso
