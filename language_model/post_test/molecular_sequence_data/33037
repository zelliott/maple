The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains 58 membrane proteins belonging to the zzso carrier zzso Two zzso carrier family members, here named zzso and zzso exhibit high structural similarities to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrier zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso restores zzso zzso transport activity in a zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso studies with green fluorescent protein fusion proteins provided evidence that zzso resides in zzso whereas only zzso locates to zzso zzso expression in zzso coli followed by zzso zzso in zzso and zzso experiments revealed that both carriers exhibit a zzso affinity for zzso and transport this compound in a zzso zzso Among various zzso zzso and zzso are the most efficient zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso plants demonstrate that both genes are strongly expressed in developing zzso and in particular in highly metabolically active zzso The presence of both carriers is discussed with respect to the zzso zzso of de zzso zzso zzso in plants and with respect to both the zzso zzso pathways and the zzso balance of zzso and zzso
