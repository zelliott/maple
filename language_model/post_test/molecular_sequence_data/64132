Historically, canine rabies in Colombia has been caused by two geographically distinct canine zzso of rabies virus zzso which between 1992 and 2002 accounted for approximately zzso of Colombian rabies zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso has been isolated up until 1997 in the Central Region and the Department of zzso and is now considered extinct through a successful vaccination zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso has been isolated from the northern Caribbean Region and continues to circulate at zzso Here we have analyzed two sets of sequence data based upon either a 147 zzso region of the zzso zzso gene or a 258 zzso region that combines a zzso of the zzso zzso region and a zzso of the zzso zzso Using both maximum likelihood zzso and zzso chain zzso Carlo zzso methods we have estimated the time of the most recent common zzso zzso of the two zzso to be between 1983 and zzso zzso of the population history suggest that zzso has been circulating in Colombia since the 1960s and that zzso evolved as a separate lineage from zzso zzso of the effective population size at present show the zzso outbreak to be approximately 20 times greater than that of zzso zzso reconstructions were unable to detect a decrease in population size concurrent with the elimination of zzso We find a raised rate of zzso substitution for zzso gene sequences when compared to that of zzso although all estimates have wide confidence zzso We demonstrate that zzso reconstructions and sequence analysis can be used to support zzso data from the field in the assessment of RV zzso
