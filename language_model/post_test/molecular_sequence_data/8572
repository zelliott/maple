zzso zzso is a South American zzso zzso widespread in Argentina that shows a high frequency of zzso zzso zzso DNA restriction with zzso produced a zzso repeated family zzso specific for the zzso Southern zzso and sequencing analysis indicate that the zzso family is heterogeneous, zzso at least two zzso In zzso zzso zzso probe showed a zzso location in almost all zzso In all zzso zzso was negative, but restriction zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso showed zzso blocks in the zzso that will generate zzso zzso Thus, we found three groups of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso positive and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso We consider that group zzso is more the result of zzso zzso state than that of the frequency of recognition sites for the zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks would appear in regions with zzso zzso zzso while lack of zzso would be due to zzso zzso zzso becoming an easier target for zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso zzso DNA provides a zzso molecular environment for zzso fusion zzso
