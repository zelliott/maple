A zzso affinity zzso approach combined with mass zzso was used in order to identify novel zzso and zzso binding proteins from zzso zzso suspension cell zzso Most of the zzso interacting candidates identified from this differential screening are characterized by zzso rich zzso zzso zzso binding was identified for important membrane trafficking regulators as well as protein quality control proteins such as the zzso zzso involved in zzso formation and the zzso zzso like transfer zzso A zzso repeat zzso containing protein was shown to directly bind to zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso performed using extracts obtained from high salt zzso and zzso zzso zzso suspensions showed that the association of an zzso zzso zzso protein with both zzso and zzso was abolished under salt stress whereas zzso stress induced an increase in the zzso association of the zzso domain containing protein zzso associated with zzso zzso Additional interacting candidates were zzso with the zzso bound zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the heat shock zzso and the identified zzso zzso zzso is suggested as an indirect effect of their interaction with other proteins directly bound to the zzso and the zzso zzso 

zzso is of special interest because of its low zzso Furthermore, no zzso levels have yet been detected in zzso zzso (although there is evidence for its existence in zzso Therefore the isolation of novel interacting candidates in zzso would be of a particular importance since the future study and zzso of the respective zzso proteins may indicate possible targeted compartments or zzso where zzso could be enriched and thereafter zzso In addition, zzso is a zzso extensively studied in zzso and zzso zzso However, our knowledge of its role in plants as well as a list of its zzso from plants is very zzso
