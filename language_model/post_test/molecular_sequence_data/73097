A new Korean isolate of zzso mosaic virus zzso as zzso a member of zzso was identified and isolated from a Korean zzso of zzso species When the zzso sequence of the zzso region of the viral zzso was compared with those of the corresponding regions of two zzso zzso zzso as zzso and zzso and a Korean isolate zzso as zzso the zzso sequence of the coat protein gene of zzso was highly zzso to other zzso zzso viruses zzso zzso The coat protein of zzso and zzso consists of 223 zzso zzso while the coat protein of zzso and zzso consists of 220 zzso zzso This difference was caused by deletions of 5 zzso in the coat protein open reading frame zzso of zzso and zzso when compared with zzso and zzso These deletions result in changes of the deduced zzso acid sequence and the length of the coat zzso The zzso region of the zzso which contains sequences involved in the replication and zzso of viral zzso was compared with those of other zzso mosaic zzso No zzso zzso signal was found in the zzso region of zzso whereas in other zzso zzso boxes, are present at the end of zzso with their AAA portions as the first A zzso of the zzso zzso
