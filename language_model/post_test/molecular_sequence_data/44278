From zzso zzso we identified zzso a protein complex that interacts with zzso DNA and exhibits novel zzso It binds specifically to the zzso zzso repeats zzso and more tightly to the zzso zzso pair elements that separate the zzso repeats from their zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso showed still greater affinity for the zzso strand of the zzso present either as an zzso or in a zzso form, but it exhibited the highest affinity for the zzso strand of the zzso zzso The binding characteristics of zzso are complementary to those of zzso a zzso zzso we previously identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso that binds zzso to the zzso strands of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed five zzso of zzso that bind directly to the zzso strand of the DNA, one of which is zzso Furthermore, the presence of zzso is critical for zzso complex binding both to the zzso strand and to the duplex DNA, evidently as part of the zzso zzso This indicates that when binding to the duplex zzso and zzso repeats, zzso may act as a protein bridge with its zzso zzso binding to the zzso strand and its five other zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso Such an association could serve to hold the zzso zzso and zzso sequences in a partially zzso zzso to facilitate the zzso events in this region that are crucial to the zzso
