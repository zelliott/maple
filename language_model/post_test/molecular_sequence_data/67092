zzso structural insights into the folding energy landscape of the zzso zzso domain of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained from a combined experimental and theoretical analysis of its equilibrium folding zzso Previous studies have shown that the three intertwined zzso in zzso zzso are sufficient to drive the formation of a stable zzso for the full-length zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso folding zzso that appear during the folding reactions of zzso zzso have counterparts in the folding mechanism of the full-length zzso The equilibrium unfolding energy surface on which the folding and zzso reactions occur for zzso zzso was examined with a combination of zzso hydrogen exchange analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso performed at several zzso of protein and zzso zzso corresponding to all three zzso in zzso zzso show zzso protection patterns consistent with the relative zzso of the zzso and zzso folding zzso The observation of protection exceeding that offered by the zzso intermediate in segments from all three zzso implies that a zzso mechanism may be operative in the zzso zzso Protection greater than that expected from the global stability for a single zzso hydrogen in a zzso from the zzso possibly and another from the zzso may reflect zzso structure, possibly a precursor for segment zzso in the zzso zzso Native zzso model simulations that zzso to a funnel energy landscape capture both the zzso and zzso zzso suggested by the zzso zzso data and provide a rationale for the progressive acquisition of secondary structure in their zzso zzso
