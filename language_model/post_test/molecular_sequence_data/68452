The regulatory gene zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso controls expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso degradation zzso and is oriented in a direction opposite to that of the zzso zzso In this study, we examined expression of the zzso gene by monitoring the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that the zzso gene was zzso regulated by its own product, zzso To search for an operator site of the zzso zzso a cam zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed by placing the zzso gene under the control of a zzso zzso The zzso initiation zzso of zzso was changed by zzso zzso from zzso to zzso to improve translation zzso Judging from sodium zzso zzso gel zzso analysis, the zzso protein was expressed up to about zzso of the soluble protein of zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso of zzso I zzso zzso using the cell zzso indicated that the zzso zzso covered a single region between the zzso gene and the zzso zzso Our findings also suggest that the zzso gene zzso regulates its own expression by binding of the gene product, zzso to the operator, which also serves as an operator of the zzso zzso
