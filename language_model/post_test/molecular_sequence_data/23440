The general stress response in zzso zzso was zzso zzso analyses of the genes zzso the molecular zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggested that they are transcribed from zzso zzso promoters upon exposure to zzso This was confirmed by zzso analysis of the zzso promoter of zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso factor appears to be essential, as we could not isolate viable zzso zzso of an unusually long zzso leader sequence resulted in elevated levels of transcription, suggesting that this region is involved in negative regulation of zzso expression during normal zzso zzso analyses and protein studies determined that regulation of the zzso stress response is different from that observed in most other species, in which regulation occurs predominantly at the zzso and zzso zzso We suggest that an increase in the activity of zzso zzso is primarily responsible for induction of the stress response in zzso zzso
