The function of a zzso truncated version of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by a previously isolated gene zzso was investigated in early zzso The transcript corresponding to the truncated zzso gene was detected throughout embryonic development although the zzso expression pattern was different from that of an intact zzso zzso of zzso zzso into early zzso resulted in the formation of a duplicated body zzso zzso induction as evaluated by the zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso was significantly enhanced by the injection of zzso zzso These results suggest that the truncated zzso is capable of zzso the zzso signal to the same extent as the native zzso
