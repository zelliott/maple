We have isolated a novel member of the zzso family, designated zzso that is highly expressed during embryonic zzso zzso possesses a unique zzso domain with no sequence zzso to the previously characterized members of the zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso family members and activates the zzso zzso when zzso in zzso zzso Although it lacks a death domain, zzso is capable of inducing zzso by a zzso zzso Based on its unique expression profile and signaling properties, zzso may play an essential role in embryonic zzso
