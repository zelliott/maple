The human zzso zzso gene DNA has been cloned from overlapping human zzso zzso and zzso zzso The entire zzso zzso zzso is zzso by 32 zzso that range in size from 49 to zzso zzso The zzso junctions have been identified and the zzso zzso There is no correlation between zzso positions and the repeat units of 106 zzso acids within domain II of the zzso zzso The scatter of the zzso over the 17 repeats argues against the zzso unit representing a zzso that underwent repeated zzso resulting in the present zzso zzso In fact, the two largest zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso and 16 zzso zzso extend over 4 and 3 repeat units of 106 zzso zzso respectively, while repeat beta 10 is zzso by 4 zzso No single position of an zzso in the zzso gene is zzso between any of the 17 zzso and 22 zzso repeat zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso boundaries conform to the consensus zzso site sequences except for zzso 20, whose zzso donor zzso sequence begins with zzso The zzso zzso present in the human brain, the skeletal muscle, and the cardiac muscle is an alternatively spliced product of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso site is located within the coding sequences of zzso 32 and its zzso in zzso zzso leads to the use of 4 additional downstream zzso with a size range of 44 to zzso zzso
