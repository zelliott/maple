zzso zzso zzso is an zzso with zzso zzso activity that is a member of a group of proteins collectively known as zzso or blue copper, zzso zzso is hypothesized to play an important role in insect zzso zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso to their corresponding zzso which then catalyze protein zzso zzso To facilitate studies of the structure, function and regulation of insect zzso we have cloned two zzso for zzso from the tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one from the malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and 2 zzso zzso proteins of 801 zzso acids zzso and 760 zzso respectively, while the zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso All three zzso contain putative zzso signal zzso and the 10 zzso and one zzso that form the zzso centers, as well as a zzso in the zzso copper zzso Novel to the insect zzso relative to both zzso and plant zzso is a longer zzso sequence characterized by a unique domain consisting of several zzso zzso aromatic, and charged zzso Northern zzso analyses identified single transcripts of approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and also showed that zzso was expressed in all life stages of the zzso zzso revealed that the zzso transcript was most abundant in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the zzso transcript was most abundant in the zzso zzso showed strong expression in the zzso zzso and reduced expression in the early zzso zzso consistent with the zzso presumed role in zzso zzso
