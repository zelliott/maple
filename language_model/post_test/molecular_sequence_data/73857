Based on the hypothesis that zzso are potent zzso and that immature zzso zzso cells zzso and even mature peripheral B cells, may be effective zzso for tolerance zzso we designed an zzso fusion protein zzso expression zzso to test the role of B cells in a novel gene therapy strategy for the transfer of immune zzso 

An zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was fused in frame to an zzso heavy chain in a zzso zzso which was used to zzso either bone zzso cells or activated peripheral B zzso These cells were transferred into zzso recipients, who were subsequently challenged with the zzso zzso in zzso 

Bone zzso zzso zzso generated with zzso zzso bone zzso were shown to be profoundly unresponsive to the zzso zzso at both the zzso and cellular levels, but were competent to respond to an unrelated protein zzso or zzso zzso we also show that zzso adult recipients infused with zzso mature, activated B zzso are rendered unresponsive by this zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso donors could also be zzso to produce zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that activated B cells are sufficient to be effective zzso zzso in zzso adult mice, but that zzso cells may also induce tolerance in zzso zzso This approach for zzso zzso has the potential to be maintained indefinitely, and it requires only knowledge of zzso sequences of target zzso
