We have previously isolated from a human brain zzso library, a new protein having two zzso zzso which interact with zzso and zzso and named zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in brain, where it is highly concentrated on the synaptic zzso zzso and is implicated in zzso zzso We have isolated here a mouse zzso zzso and determined the zzso of its zzso in adult mouse zzso The zzso acid sequence of the mouse zzso zzso is zzso identical with that of the human zzso Northern zzso analysis and in zzso zzso on adult mouse brain sections have revealed that zzso is predominantly expressed in mouse brain, where it is expressed in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in the zzso bulb, cerebral cortex, zzso zzso complex, and zzso zzso nucleus, but not in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is expressed zzso in mouse brain, where it is predominantly expressed in zzso cells, and suggest that zzso plays a specific role in the area where it is zzso
