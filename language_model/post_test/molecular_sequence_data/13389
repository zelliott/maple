zzso zzso from zzso sequence data may be thought of as a problem of choosing between different evolutionary models that vary with the branching pattern of the zzso and with the zzso process of zzso sequence change occurring on the branches of the zzso zzso Thus, each evolutionary model consists of both a particular zzso process and a particular zzso Such models produce zzso zzso of zzso character zzso As first suggested by zzso and Edwards zzso zzso zzso zzso the distribution of patterns expected under each model can be compared to the actual observed distribution of patterns by a goodness of fit statistic such as the zzso ratio zzso or zzso zzso after the zzso parameters for the model have been chosen to minimize the respective zzso For each evolutionary model, the probability P of getting a value of the goodness of fit statistic greater than the observed value is zzso A very small P value means that either a rare event has occurred or that the model is zzso zzso for each of 16 models a zzso process which has 12 parameters to describe the mode of zzso change on each branch of each putative zzso tree, we examined all 15 zzso zzso branching arrangements of zzso zzso sequences from the gamma zzso zzso region of the five zzso zzso orangutan, gorilla, zzso and zzso plus the branching arrangement with a zzso separation of gorilla, zzso and zzso Of these 16 models, all had P values less than zzso except for the arrangement of human joined by zzso in turn joined by gorilla, and then orangutan and zzso This analysis allows convincing claims to be made about zzso zzso relationships by testing the zzso of the assumed zzso process for zzso sequence evolution at the same time as testing the zzso zzso branching zzso
