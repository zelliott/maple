A zzso chain reaction zzso method was used to detect zzso transcripts in rat zzso both in zzso and in zzso Only very low levels of transcripts were detected in preparations from adult rat zzso zzso but fairly large amounts were detected in zzso preparations from cultures of newborn rat zzso The transcript level was reduced significantly if the cells had been cultured in the presence of 10 zzso zzso zzso This concentration of zzso had previously been shown to abolish almost completely the zzso zzso normally seen in such zzso The present work indicates that part, but not all, of the effect of zzso is probably at the level of zzso
