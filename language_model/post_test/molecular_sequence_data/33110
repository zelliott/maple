Severe malaria pathology is directly associated with zzso of infected red blood cells zzso to healthy zzso and/or zzso cells occurring during the zzso development of zzso zzso We zzso as zzso long zzso the members of the ring exported zzso protein family zzso in zzso 9, as well as the early transcribed membrane proteins zzso zzso and 4, to identify specific zzso binding regions in these zzso Twelve binding peptides were identified zzso as zzso three were identified in zzso two in zzso one in zzso two in zzso and four in zzso zzso The majority of these zzso was zzso among different zzso zzso zzso according to sequence zzso No zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso and sensitive to the zzso treatment of zzso and zzso had different structural features, according to circular zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso and zzso families participate in relevant interactions with zzso membrane zzso which highlight these proteins as potential targets for the development of fully effective zzso zzso
