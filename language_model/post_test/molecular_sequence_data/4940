zzso zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss of function zzso in the zzso zzso In order to unravel zzso function we developed zzso zzso raised against different regions of the zzso These zzso detect a processed 18 zzso protein in various human and mouse zzso and cell lines that is severely reduced in zzso zzso zzso By zzso and zzso zzso we show that zzso is located in zzso associated with the zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of cellular zzso of various truncated forms of zzso expressed in cultured cells and evidence of removal of an zzso zzso during protein maturation demonstrated that the zzso zzso sequence is zzso by the first 20 zzso zzso Given the shared clinical features between zzso zzso vitamin E zzso and some zzso our data suggest that a reduction in zzso results in zzso zzso
