Using zzso from a zzso region of the zzso human zzso zzso zzso family, four pol fragments originating from new members of the family were amplified from human zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis demonstrated similar zzso patterns in human, zzso and orangutan and distinct zzso to zzso zzso The zzso also exhibited weaker zzso to zzso monkey zzso Using large zzso zzso two full-length zzso zzso have been zzso One of the zzso is located downstream of a human zzso zinc finger protein zzso zzso Both of the newly identified long terminal repeats have potential zzso boxes, zzso signals and zzso zzso sites but they differ to a high degree, especially in the zzso zzso The zzso sites were found to be zzso to zzso zzso and therefore these new zzso have been given the name zzso The closest relatives to the zzso are the zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso Pol and zzso regions are zzso Both of the newly identified zzso were shown to contain zzso reverse zzso zzso and zzso regions and had characteristic deletions in the zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso protein gene of gag and two zzso zzso motifs that are characteristic of a potential zzso zzso protein were also zzso Apart from an zzso spanning the zzso of one zzso no other longer zzso were zzso
