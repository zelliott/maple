The zzso tumor zzso protein plays a crucial role in zzso by controlling zzso progression and zzso We have previously described a transcript designated tumor zzso activated zzso zzso that is zzso in the zzso cell line, zzso Cloning of the zzso and human full-length zzso zzso revealed that it encodes a zzso protein with five to six zzso zzso This gene is the zzso and human zzso of the recently published rat zzso zzso raised against zzso and human zzso recognize a 50- to zzso band induced by zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter identified a functional zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso diminished levels of the 50- to zzso protein and decreased significantly the levels of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso small interfering zzso inhibited zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis followed by zzso zzso pull-down zzso and in zzso zzso revealed that zzso associated with zzso a zzso zzso protein and the zzso zzso a negative regulator of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso enhanced the zzso of cells to zzso and cooperated with zzso to exacerbate this zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso could augment zzso zzso Overall, these data suggest that zzso may act downstream to zzso to interface zzso and zzso zzso
