To characterize important steps of DNA zzso by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso sharing the specificity of zzso zzso zzso ten zzso zzso selected on the basis of sequence alignments and a zzso model, were subjected to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were studied to determine zzso activity, DNA binding zzso capacity to induce base zzso and ability to form zzso complex with a DNA zzso containing the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso induced strong zzso when bound to zzso DNA containing zzso in place of the target zzso indicating flipping of the target zzso zzso fluorescence, moderate, or drastic loss of zzso activity and reduced DNA binding suggest the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso VIII, zzso and zzso zzso region, zzso zzso as well as of the zzso zzso in base zzso Replacement of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso VIII, zzso with zzso resulted in loss of zzso activity without zzso DNA binding zzso These data are consistent with the zzso role of zzso and zzso and zzso for the first time, experimental support for the essential function of the zzso not investigated zzso zzso of motif VIII in zzso
