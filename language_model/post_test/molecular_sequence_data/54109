A novel zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from farm soil collected from the zzso region of zzso Pradesh, southern zzso The strain was found to have zzso and zzso characteristics typical of species of the zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and was related most closely to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be distinguished from the type strains of its closest zzso relatives based on levels of zzso zzso and comparison of zzso and zzso zzso It is therefore concluded that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso AA zzso zzso zzso
