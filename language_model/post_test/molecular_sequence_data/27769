A zzso expression library was constructed in the zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso carrying a zzso insert contains an open reading frame beginning with the first zzso zzso and ending with the stop zzso zzso at zzso position zzso Two potential translation start zzso zzso are present in the zzso region of this zzso zzso initiation could occur at the zzso zzso zzso at zzso position zzso The zzso sequence around this zzso zzso resembles the optimum sequence context for translation initiation by the zzso zzso as defined by zzso analysis zzso Cell 44 zzso zzso with its substitution of the A at zzso of the consensus sequence by a T zzso in this zzso zzso initiated at this zzso could potentially code for the entire zzso zzso zzso The zzso region is 154 zzso long and contains a zzso signal zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence agrees in totality with the published zzso acid sequence of the mature zzso The present study reports on the zzso sequence of zzso zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence in the signal zzso of the zzso
