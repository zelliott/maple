zzso and induced zzso responses present a major zzso barrier to the use of pig zzso for human zzso We generated zzso and zzso gene libraries established from zzso of patients treated with a zzso liver zzso containing pig zzso and used these libraries to identify zzso genes that zzso human zzso responses to pig zzso Genes zzso by the zzso family are increased in expression in patients following zzso zzso zzso libraries representing the zzso gene family were generated, and the relative frequency of expression of genes used to zzso the zzso response was determined at days 0, 10, and zzso zzso genes derived from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso increase in frequency zzso The zzso gene encodes zzso of zzso zzso clones expressed as zzso zzso at day 0 and zzso of zzso clones zzso zzso zzso in two patients at day zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso in these patients are expressed without evidence of zzso zzso By day 21, an zzso switch occurs and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that demonstrate zzso zzso We cloned these genes into a zzso zzso expressed these clones as zzso zzso and demonstrated that the zzso gene encodes zzso with the ability to bind to the gal alpha zzso gal zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso response in humans is zzso by zzso genes restricted to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate zzso zzso by day zzso
