The human family of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso comprises four related proteins derived from two genes by alternative zzso The zzso gene gives rise to two zzso zzso and zzso which possess distinct zzso and zzso Despite lacking the zzso zzso site, zzso shows higher zzso activity than zzso In contrast, the activity of zzso is tightly regulated by zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that the short zzso of zzso zzso on it a zzso zzso of substantial, but zzso zzso In contrast, the longer zzso of zzso zzso the zzso activity and T zzso zzso of this zzso while allowing both properties to be zzso by upstream zzso zzso Two features of the zzso of zzso appear to account for this zzso the known zzso site and a region zzso to be zzso which zzso access to the zzso domain and the zzso The zzso of zzso results in a marked zzso change leading to a more zzso zzso We also identified a zzso zzso zzso in an zzso insert as playing a key role in governing the ease with which zzso can be zzso These studies help to identify the features that give rise to the diverse properties of human zzso zzso
