zzso free light chains zzso in zzso disorders are frequently involved in zzso zzso including a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The latter is characterized in most cases by zzso zzso including a zzso zzso zzso which resists zzso zzso zzso protein zzso DEL was isolated from a patient with zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of this human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined using molecular replacement with the structure of zzso zzso as the variable domain, and that of zzso zzso as the constant zzso To our knowledge, DEL is the first complete zzso zzso structure described to zzso The zzso is zzso at zzso A zzso The zzso DEL zzso was compared with other zzso zzso and with zzso fragments with a zzso light zzso Although the zzso pattern was similar, the relative positions of the constant zzso zzso zzso DEL showed a zzso zzso structural arrangement which may be attributable to the poor zzso affinity and lack of an zzso zzso bridge, combined with the zzso editing effect of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that, in the absence of a zzso bridge, most zzso zzso are probably mobile in zzso This may explain their high zzso to zzso and the absence of naturally occurring zzso for these zzso Furthermore, these findings of an unusual zzso structure of an zzso zzso association extend our knowledge about the large and highly diverse structures of the zzso zzso
