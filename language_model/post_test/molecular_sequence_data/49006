We have zzso the function of two zzso zzso miniature and zzso that are required for the zzso zzso of the zzso membrane during wing zzso zzso These genes zzso zzso proteins containing a zzso zzso zzso domain and are zzso to several zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso miniature and zzso are only expressed in zzso zzso a zzso and the zzso protein zzso to the zzso membrane during the early stages of zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso form a novel zzso within the zzso domain proteins and are specifically involved in the interactions between the zzso zzso the zzso and the forming zzso
