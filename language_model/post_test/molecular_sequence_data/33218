zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly adhesive to zzso cells and expresses zzso zzso In this study, zzso genes were zzso and expressed in zzso coli to characterize the function of zzso proteins with this particular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso genes zzso and zzso and only zzso gene was expressed in the zzso as revealed by zzso and zzso The mature zzso showed zzso zzso acid sequence identity to zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso were highly zzso at the zzso region to other zzso zzso zzso but were substantially variable at zzso and middle zzso zzso microscopic analysis indicated that zzso expressed in zzso coli was able to form a zzso structure similar to the natural zzso but zzso formed as zzso zzso In the cell binding experiments, zzso cells were able to bind to both zzso zzso and zzso proteins to the extent similar to the natural zzso The cell binding zzso remain mostly in the zzso regions in zzso and zzso as shown by high binding of truncated peptides zzso and zzso Our results indicated that zzso was active and high binding to zzso cells, and that the zzso gene could be targeted to display foreign proteins on the bacterial surface of zzso as a potential zzso vaccine zzso
