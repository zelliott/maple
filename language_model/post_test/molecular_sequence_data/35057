zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the production of steroid hormones during zzso maturation in zzso The comparative expression pattern of zzso gene during the zzso development stages will provide important insights into its function of zzso zzso In addition, zzso modification especially DNA zzso plays a vital role in regulation of gene zzso The adult female Japanese zzso at different zzso development stage (from stages II to zzso was obtained in this zzso The expression of zzso gene in the zzso of Japanese zzso during the zzso development stages was measured by quantitative zzso zzso traits included zzso index zzso plasma zzso zzso and testosterone zzso were also zzso Moreover, whole zzso zzso zzso status of the two zzso rich regions in zzso coding region was detected by zzso zzso In the zzso the zzso gene had the lowest zzso expression at the early zzso development stage, but then increased zzso The variation trends of T and zzso level were consistent with the zzso expression pattern in zzso In contrast, the whole zzso levels of each zzso rich region zzso 4 and 6) in zzso coding region were declined from stages II to IV, then increased at stage zzso The zzso levels of whole zzso sites in each zzso rich region were zzso correlated with the values of zzso zzso gene zzso T and zzso level, and zzso Based on the present study, we proposed that zzso may regulate the level of steroid hormone, and then stimulate the zzso growth and zzso The zzso gene zzso activity was possibly affected by the zzso level of zzso rich regions in coding zzso These findings will help in the study of the molecular mechanism of fish reproduction and zzso zzso
