The zzso in zzso zzso coli zzso zzso toxin zzso gene were detected by temperature zzso gel zzso zzso 15 clinical strains isolated from patients and a wild type strain zzso were analyzed after the conventional zzso Although all zzso products zzso corresponded to zzso of zzso three strains were the different zzso patterns after silver zzso as compared to the wild zzso For further zzso zzso the zzso region was divided into 4 zzso The different ones were localized in the downstream part zzso but each those DNA bands was not so clear than DNA bands in zzso The clearer patterns were obtained by using a primer attached zzso The zzso zzso in zzso were proceeded by a series of procedures in mixing with the equal quantity of zzso products derived from a zzso and a wild type, zzso and then zzso zzso of those mixed samples had 4 bands that were 2 front bands as zzso and 2 slower migration bands as zzso To zzso the site of the zzso the zzso sequences in each zzso zzso products were decided by zzso dye zzso Indeed, two zzso were recognized four zzso zzso without deletions and the one was zzso Thus, the difference of migration in zzso depended on the number and the zzso in zzso zzso
