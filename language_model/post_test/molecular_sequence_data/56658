The interaction of zzso with zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso complex is inhibited by the zzso peptides and the peptides corresponding to a sequence unique to zzso in the zzso domain of the gamma zzso The present study was designed to examine the effects of these synthetic peptides on zzso binding to zzso zzso The order of potency of these peptides was as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso had no zzso zzso The zzso effects of the peptides were synergistic when zzso binding was measured in the mixture of the zzso zzso and the gamma chain zzso By contrast, the zzso effect was additive when the binding was measured in the presence of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also inhibited by these synthetic zzso The order of potency was the same as that of the zzso binding zzso These results provide evidence that the zzso sequences present at two different sites in the alpha chain and the gamma chain sequence inhibit zzso binding to the zzso complex, are mutually zzso and are in close spatial proximity in the folded zzso We conclude that the presence of the zzso sequence and the gamma chain sequence involved in zzso binding zzso increases the affinity of zzso to activated zzso
