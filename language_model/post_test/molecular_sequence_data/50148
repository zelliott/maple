zzso zzso resistance in zzso zzso has been found to be associated with zzso in zzso a gene zzso an zzso zzso zzso and enhanced by zzso in zzso a gene zzso a zzso zzso The roles of these two genes in zzso resistance in zzso zzso were examined in this zzso The zzso and zzso genes were zzso in nine pairs of strains isolated from zzso obtained from patients before and after failed zzso treatments which included zzso and resulted in the appearance of resistant zzso zzso resistance could be explained in seven of these pairs of strains by zzso in zzso and zzso However, in one pair of zzso zzso was identical in the susceptible and resistant zzso and only changes in zzso were zzso and in another pair, neither zzso nor zzso were different in the susceptible and resistant zzso zzso of the upstream region of zzso and of the zzso gene in the latter pair of strains did not reveal any zzso To establish whether zzso in zzso alone could be involved in zzso resistance, a resistant zzso coli strain transformed with the zzso of a zzso susceptible zzso zzso strain was rendered zzso and transformation with a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene under the same conditions did not change the resistant zzso coli zzso The results suggested that a zzso resistance zzso may arise in zzso zzso without zzso in zzso or zzso or with zzso only in zzso
