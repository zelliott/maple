The spore zzso and molecular systematic of a new zzso which was isolated from the common sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the Red Sea, Egypt have been zzso zzso out of 300 zzso of this fish were infected with zzso zzso The infection was appeared as zzso zzso round, or zzso zzso embedded in the zzso lining of the zzso and also in the zzso zzso Light microscopic study revealed that zzso were zzso by a zzso layer zzso numerous mature spores measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of spores was characteristic for the zzso zzso zzso zzso spores (each spore possesses three to five polar filament zzso and a zzso zzso Also, the early recognizable stages of the zzso within zzso include zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by detachment of the zzso of the zzso producing zzso which mature to spores that consist of a spore coat and spore zzso Also, we analyzed the small zzso zzso gene zzso using zzso and sequencing specimens from the marine populations of zzso zzso fish from the Red zzso From blast searches, sequence analysis, and zzso analysis, we did not find corresponding zzso entries to our zzso zzso of the zzso sequences showed that the sequence of our zzso was most similar to five zzso species with degrees of identity zzso It was most similar zzso zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differing in 19 zzso positions and with lower divergence value, zzso zzso zzso identity, account zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identity, account zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identity, account zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso identity, account zzso zzso So, they likely represent new species named zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso number zzso and a zzso content of zzso
