A zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso chain of zzso magna was cloned and its zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso sequence contained 74 zzso of the leader zzso zzso zzso of an open reading frame zzso and 119 zzso of the zzso region zzso excluding the zzso zzso A zzso zzso located 24 zzso upstream from the zzso sequence was considered to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso sequence revealed that zzso magna zzso chain is zzso as a zzso precursor with a signal zzso of 18 zzso zzso zzso magna zzso chain consists of zzso zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso which is composed of two large repeated zzso domain 1 and zzso Several key zzso that are zzso in all or most of other zzso and required for functional zzso are zzso in each of the two zzso The zzso extension zzso zzso of domain 1 was unusually long and contained an unusual zzso zzso The zzso between the zzso sequences of the two zzso zzso zzso was much lower than that observed in other zzso zzso chains from clams or zzso zzso zzso level in zzso magna reared under low oxygen concentration was more than 12 times higher than that in zzso magna reared with sufficient zzso indicating that the expression of zzso gene is regulated by zzso zzso
