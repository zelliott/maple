A detailed description is given of the structure of the small protein mating zzso zzso at atomic zzso zzso is placed on the locations of charges and hydrogen zzso The model includes all the protein zzso zzso displacement zzso four zzso side zzso 22 water zzso a zzso ethanol, and zzso hydrogen zzso Analysis of the model revealed that this dense crystal is zzso by zzso networks of zzso and protein zzso The zzso of zzso are capped by hydrogen bonding to zzso and protein zzso and to zzso zzso An examination of the zzso and charges of the zzso groups suggests that three of the zzso molecules capping the C zzso of two zzso and one other, may instead be zzso zzso Water molecules mediate all but one of the zzso hydrogen bonds, and many of the lattice zzso zzso of the zzso where the atomic zzso zzso from zzso are zzso There is almost no overall zzso of the zzso allowed by the zzso but the zzso zzso relative to the zzso Four zzso display alternate zzso zzso evidence is presented that the switches between their zzso are correlated and driven by zzso of zzso zzso These structural features are discussed in the context of function and zzso zzso with the analysis of the model, we review the course and results of the refinement of the model against 1 A X-ray zzso data to a zzso zzso of zzso
