zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso to form zzso and zzso and thereby has a key role in the zzso metabolism of zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso are known to exist, but only one zzso gene has been zzso zzso In this study, we cloned a zzso of zzso and named it zzso and the corresponding protein zzso zzso shares zzso identity and zzso similarity at the protein level to the previously cloned zzso The human gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso consists of 12 zzso spanning approximately 50 zzso of the zzso and maps to zzso zzso zzso and zzso differ in zzso expression in that zzso is highly expressed in muscle, fat, and zzso whereas zzso is mainly expressed in zzso liver, and zzso In addition, zzso seems to be the zzso form of zzso at the zzso level in these zzso zzso of zzso protein in zzso coli produced a functional zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso confirming that the zzso is an zzso The more abundant expression of zzso than zzso especially in muscle and fat, suggests a unique and previously zzso role of this gene product in zzso zzso acid, and fatty acid metabolism and zzso
