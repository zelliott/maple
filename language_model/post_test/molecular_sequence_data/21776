zzso entry occurs by concerted zzso changes in the envelope protein complex on the surface of the zzso This complex is made up of a zzso of zzso of two zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in the envelope complex allow zzso to mediate membrane fusion leading to exposure of two zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso and zzso repeat zzso zzso from the zzso or the zzso have been found to inhibit zzso zzso zzso we show that we can zzso inhibit zzso viral entry by permanently zzso the zzso intermediate on the virus surface using a zzso zzso group on zzso zzso This is evidence showing that vulnerable zzso zzso exist zzso during zzso viral entry, and the details presented zzso will facilitate development of envelope as a target for zzso and potential zzso agents that could zzso the virus before contact with the host zzso
