zzso zzso is an zzso bundling protein found in the zzso process of zzso zzso zzso We have cloned and zzso a second zzso zzso from zzso zzso that is zzso identical to zzso Northern and Southern analyses confirm that zzso and zzso are zzso by distinct zzso The sequence of zzso like zzso is organized into zzso and zzso zzso zzso that are characterized by a zzso repeat of a 50 zzso zzso Western analysis using rabbit zzso zzso specific for zzso and zzso indicate that zzso like zzso is found in zzso zzso but not blood or zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso at the anterior of zzso but not in the zzso zzso The function of zzso in this zzso compartment that is devoid of zzso is zzso However, the location of zzso together with the fact that it contains two putative zzso structural zzso which are known to be zzso zzso in a number of zzso suggests it may have a possible zzso zzso
