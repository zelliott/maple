To examine whether human zzso 5 zzso infection is associated with zzso rheumatic zzso 

DNA from patients with various disorders including inflammatory diseases and from normal subjects was tested by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso for zzso zzso zzso Positive results were confirmed by DNA zzso 

zzso zzso DNA was detected in zzso of zzso samples from zzso zzso in zzso of blood samples from patients with zzso arthritis zzso and in zzso of blood samples from patients with systemic lupus zzso In contrast, it was not zzso by zzso of affected zzso from patients with several other zzso diseases and was found in only 1 of zzso tissue specimens obtained at autopsy from zzso zzso zzso analysis of the amplified viral segment showed genetic variation between samples with maintenance of the open reading frame, typical of a replicating infectious zzso 

This is the first report of the frequent detection of zzso in any zzso We propose that the possible involvement of zzso in zzso and rheumatic disease should be investigated zzso
