The use of zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated to generate structural information on zzso zzso which represent an important class of compounds as zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and as key zzso for protein zzso By studying five zzso zzso of different zzso and their zzso zzso counterparts, mass to charge zzso dependency of zzso fragmentation was established for peptides that differ only by their zzso zzso zzso fragmentation of zzso zzso and zzso leads to the same final zzso probably via a similar zzso Moreover, the zzso information obtained here reflects the equilibrium occurring in solution between the zzso zzso and its hydrated form, which was retained during the zzso zzso The equilibrium constant was determined to be close to zzso Disturbance of this equilibrium should enable the stability of zzso zzso of a given series of zzso to be zzso
