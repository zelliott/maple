The zzso zzso and zzso magnetic zzso of the zzso zzso have been assigned almost completely, mainly through the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were distinguished by means of zzso spectral editing technique zzso double half filter zzso Based on the distance and zzso angle constraints derived from the zzso data, the three-dimensional solution structure of the zzso zzso in the zzso form has been calculated by the simulated zzso zzso The input for the structure calculations consisted of zzso distance constraints, of which zzso were zzso and 40 were zzso and zzso angle, zzso constraints, which numbered zzso The average zzso zzso zzso for all backbone zzso atoms of the 20 calculated structures for zzso 3 to 59 of the total of 66 zzso acid zzso in both zzso was zzso zzso while the average zzso for each zzso in the same zzso range was zzso zzso The zzso is composed of three zzso zzso 7 to 13, 16 to 23 and 27 to 36, and a zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso 3 to 6, 40 to 44 and 50 to zzso The solution structure of the zzso is essentially the same as that in the zzso form, but the structure of the zzso form in solution differs from that of the zzso unit in the zzso zzso It is suggested that the solution zzso structure is distorted to fit the recognition zzso in the major grooves of DNA on complex zzso
