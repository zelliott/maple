A detailed structural analysis of interactions between zzso proteins and zzso is essential for an understanding of its zzso zzso constitute an excellent paradigm for obtaining high-resolution structural information about the binding site and zzso of zzso bound to zzso and are particularly suitable for zzso zzso Here, we used transferred nuclear zzso effects to study the interaction in solution between zzso zzso and a synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso 11 to zzso of the zzso zzso a protein whose in zzso zzso is zzso by zzso Using a 60 zzso zzso protein zzso fusion protein to increase the sensitivity of the transferred zzso we observed characteristic sequential and zzso transferred nuclear zzso zzso The zzso adopts an zzso zzso upon binding to the zzso Thus the binding site of zzso is compatible with binding of zzso as well as extended zzso To locate the zzso site on zzso we zzso changes in its chemical shifts on adding an excess of zzso zzso All zzso with significant chemical shift differences are zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso interactions were not zzso This indicates that the zzso zzso binds specifically to zzso zzso The binding region identified by zzso in solution agrees with zzso studies with small peptides and with zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso
