zzso with zzso inherited zzso bacteria may have dramatic influences on zzso traits and zzso patterns of their zzso We here show that in the zzso zzso zzso infection has influenced zzso patterns of the zzso zzso and different strains led to repeated selective zzso By comparing a zzso zzso of the hosts with a zzso of the bacteria based on zzso we show that zzso is rare and restricted to few recently zzso zzso While in general each species apparently zzso a single zzso strain, zzso zzso presents a zzso different zzso in the zzso species, three highly divergent zzso zzso zzso zzso are coupled with three different zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso These zzso and zzso strains are widely distributed and mostly found in zzso A zzso based on zzso data supports the zzso of zzso The zzso between zzso and nuclear zzso may best be explained by zzso zzso that led to zzso of zzso coupled with a different zzso zzso Selective sweeps apparently drove the zzso zzso to widespread zzso As for effects of zzso on zzso infection with zzso appears to be correlated with a substantial sex ratio zzso which was most prominent in zzso
