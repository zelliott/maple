The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with a broad specificity for different zzso zzso Furthermore, it regulates the function of other zzso like zzso zzso and zzso In a zzso two hybrid screen of a human zzso zzso library, we identified zzso coding for four different proteins that strongly interact with the zzso region of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso for zzso exchange factor zzso and the putative zzso zzso protein zzso two novel zzso were zzso Association analysis with different zzso zzso revealed them as zzso that zzso binding proteins which react with a broad spectrum of alpha zzso The zzso membrane zzso region of the zzso chain was identified as the binding site for all four zzso They, therefore, may be involved in the regulation of general functions of zzso
