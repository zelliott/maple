DNA sequences of an zzso zzso zzso and parts of genes in the zzso cluster were amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso using two zzso derived from zzso and zzso zzso The zzso products were zzso by ten zzso cutting restriction zzso and the restriction patterns were used as fingerprints to type zzso zzso The zzso of this zzso method for typing zzso strains was investigated on zzso reference strains belonging mainly to the zzso zzso group but also on new zzso zzso and on other zzso zzso By modulating the stringency of the zzso we showed the method allowed to target either zzso strains or the whole zzso microbial zzso DNA zzso patterns were used to estimate the sequence divergence between the zzso zzso zzso The estimated relationships deduced from these zzso data correlated well with established zzso zzso zzso
