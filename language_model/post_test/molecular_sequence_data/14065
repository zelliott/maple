zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso membrane of respiratory zzso cells are essential for zzso and water transport in the zzso Apart from the well described zzso in zzso 3' : zzso zzso zzso dependent zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso an increased zzso zzso has also been reported from zzso zzso In the present experiments we tried to identify these zzso in zzso zzso cells using zzso and zzso zzso With these methods we found identical and relatively low membrane zzso of about zzso zzso in both freshly isolated and primary cultured normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso could be activated by zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso currents activated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present in both types of zzso zzso membrane patches from zzso cells did not reveal discernible single-channel events when activated with any of the zzso A zzso zzso was also detected in freshly isolated zzso respiratory cells in zzso studies, as evidenced by the zzso induced by 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and when zzso was replaced in the bath by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments, the zzso zzso was significantly larger in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared to normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in short-term zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of normal respiratory cells identified zzso zzso of both the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso as well as the human zzso zzso channel zzso The present experiments confirm the absence of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso respiratory zzso cells and support previous findings obtained in zzso and zzso studies which indicate an increased zzso zzso in respiratory zzso cells from zzso zzso
