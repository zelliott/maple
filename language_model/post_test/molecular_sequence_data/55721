A model of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was constructed on the basis of the structure of zzso c zzso zzso Because of the low percentage of zzso acid identity between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso alignment of the sequences was based on the generation of a template from a knowledge of the 3-D structure of zzso and consensus sequences of zzso zzso This approach gave an alignment in which all the insertions in the zzso zzso were placed at loop regions of zzso with a zzso identity for these two zzso The model was constructed using this alignment and the computer program zzso which assembles the model as a series of rigid fragments derived from zzso and other zzso Manual intervention was required for some of the longer loop zzso The zzso forming the structural zzso and especially the zzso environment of zzso are zzso in the zzso model and the core is close packed without zzso A possible site of the zzso zzso at the zzso edge of zzso is zzso
