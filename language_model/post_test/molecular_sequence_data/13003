The translation zzso factors G zzso Tu zzso and zzso zzso from the extreme zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene coding for zzso and the zzso gene coding for zzso were expressed under the control of a zzso promoter, whereas zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso A detailed description for the zzso of the three zzso factors from zzso coli is zzso zzso and zzso are isolated by zzso zzso zzso heat treatment at 65 or 60 degrees C, respectively, and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso For the zzso of zzso a heat zzso step is followed by zzso zzso and a zzso exchange zzso 650 zzso The zzso factors show the same properties as those zzso from zzso zzso As the crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been solved recently, many questions concerning the function of particular zzso or zzso zzso which may be best addressed by studying the in zzso behavior and structure of altered zzso zzso The methods presented here should facilitate such zzso
