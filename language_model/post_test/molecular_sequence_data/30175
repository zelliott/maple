Using extracts of zzso cell zzso protein binding sites on the zzso gene zzso region were examined with an zzso protection zzso One such binding site, located from zzso to zzso zzso upstream from the mouse zzso gene zzso initiation site, which exhibited a close zzso to the zzso zzso zzso site zzso A zzso zzso containing this site was subsequently used in gel shift zzso to demonstrate zzso consensus sequence binding activity in extracts of zzso cell zzso zzso shift competition experiments using both zzso and zzso competitor DNA sequences revealed that the zzso like zzso exhibited specific binding to the mouse zzso consensus zzso Furthermore, zzso factor binding was also modulated by a zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell nuclear extracts with alkaline zzso prior to inclusion in gel shift zzso led to a reduction in the zzso of zzso zzso bands, indicating a potential involvement of protein zzso in zzso factor binding in zzso zzso
