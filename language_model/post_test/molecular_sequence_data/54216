Plants in the family zzso are used as model systems in comparative and evolutionary zzso The complete zzso zzso of seven zzso species have been zzso including zzso potato and tomato, but not zzso We analyzed the complete zzso zzso sequence of the hot pepper, zzso zzso The pepper zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso including a pair of zzso repeats zzso of zzso zzso The content and the order of 133 genes in the pepper zzso zzso were identical to those of other zzso zzso To characterize pepper zzso zzso we performed comparative analysis using complete zzso sequences of pepper and seven zzso zzso zzso and contents of large zzso and tandem repeat sequences and distribution pattern of zzso sequence variations were zzso In addition, a zzso analysis using zzso alignments of coding sequences was performed to determine evolutionary position of pepper in zzso Our results revealed two distinct features of pepper zzso compared to other zzso zzso zzso large zzso including insertions on zzso and zzso gene zzso were predominantly detected in the pepper zzso compared to other zzso zzso zzso tandem repeat sequences were particularly frequent in the pepper zzso Taken together, our study represents unique features of evolution of pepper zzso among zzso zzso
