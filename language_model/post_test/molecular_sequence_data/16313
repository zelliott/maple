This paper describes a method for the positive selection of signal sequence zzso that result in enhanced production of zzso human zzso by zzso zzso zzso sequences for the structural portion of zzso zzso zzso were zzso for those of the C zzso of zzso in a zzso that normally directs the synthesis and zzso of zzso The resulting zzso directed the synthesis of a zzso fusion protein that was zzso into the zzso space and zzso resistance to low levels of zzso zzso zzso changes to the signal sequence were selected by the zzso ability to grow on high levels of zzso The zzso coding sequences were then replaced with those of human zzso resulting in plasmids which directed enhanced production of zzso zzso
