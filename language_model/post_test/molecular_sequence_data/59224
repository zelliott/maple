Specialized zzso play many fascinating roles, including mechanical integrity and zzso in zzso cells, cell polarity in simple zzso contraction in muscle cells, hearing and balance in the inner ear cells, zzso transport in zzso and zzso junction formation between muscle cells and motor zzso These varied functions are dependent upon zzso networks of zzso zzso (6 zzso intermediate filaments (10 zzso and zzso zzso zzso and their many associated zzso In this chapter, I review what is known about the zzso of intermediate filaments and their associated zzso I focus largely on zzso cells, which devote most of their zzso machinery to producing an extensive intermediate filament network composed of zzso Recent studies have shown that many of the devastating human disorders that arise from zzso of this cell type have as their underlying basis either defects in the genes zzso zzso or abnormalities in zzso IF zzso I discuss what we know about the functions of zzso and how the link to genetic disease has enhanced this zzso
