The surface zzso zzso zzso helps the influenza A virus to evade the host immune system by zzso variation and is a major driving force for viral zzso In this study, the selection pressure on zzso of H5N1 influenza A virus was analyzed using zzso zzso Most of the identified positive selection zzso sites were found to be within or adjacent to zzso zzso Some of the identified zzso sites are consistent with previous experimental studies, providing further support to the biological significance of our zzso The highest frequency of zzso sites was observed in recent strains isolated during zzso zzso analysis was also conducted on zzso sequences from various zzso zzso drift is almost similar in both avian and human species with a progressive trend over the zzso Our study reports new zzso in functional regions of zzso that might provide markers for vaccine design or can be used to predict zzso of pandemic zzso
