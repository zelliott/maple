zzso scaffolding complexes help organize specialized membrane zzso with unique functions on the surface of zzso In this study, we define the scaffolding potential of the zzso cell zzso zzso complex zzso by establishing the presence of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of two separate zzso in zzso cells that divide the zzso membrane into zzso distinct zzso the zzso rich plaques and the zzso bands that contain zzso zzso zzso and four zzso zzso Finally, we show that the two different zzso can scaffold unique accessory molecules in distinct areas of the zzso cell zzso Specifically, the cholesterol zzso zzso associates with the zzso complex in zzso bands and is excluded from the zzso rich zzso
