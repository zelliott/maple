The interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso supports zzso The zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso characterized by four zzso zzso and a zzso domain in the zzso portion of the zzso To zzso zzso zzso of the zzso near the zzso domain, we tested the zzso ability of the zzso human zzso zzso domain zzso two truncated and three zzso zzso with the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli as zzso fusion proteins linked to a zzso support and zzso for binding to zzso zzso As previously zzso zzso bound specifically to the expressed zzso domain, zzso zzso did not bind to truncated receptors lacking either the entire fifth zzso or the zzso zzso zzso also did not bind to zzso receptors that had the zzso acids zzso by the fifth zzso replaced by zzso beta or that had the zzso acids subsequent to zzso zzso 209 replaced by zzso zzso zzso binding was demonstrated for a construct in which the zzso was replaced by that of zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso acids zzso by this zzso portion of zzso 5 of the zzso are necessary for zzso binding and that the zzso domain is necessary for zzso binding but is not involved in zzso zzso We also speculate that if the putative soluble form of the zzso is expressed zzso to lack zzso zzso it does not bind zzso and therefore may serve a zzso purpose other than zzso zzso
