We isolated a full-length zzso clone of zzso zzso an zzso gene similar in sequence to zzso zzso cardiac zzso suggesting a potentially similar function to zzso zzso and to zzso zzso cardiac genes during heart zzso During the zzso stage of zzso zzso is expressed first within the zzso zzso then zzso in muscle precursor cells in the zzso and finally in some zzso cells of the visceral zzso arranged in an approximately zzso row running beneath the zzso and zzso The zzso cells that express zzso are evidently precursors of the zzso of the heart, which subsequently becomes zzso zzso zzso to the zzso The zzso heart is a zzso extended tube consisting entirely of zzso cells (at both the zzso and adult zzso there are no chambers, valves, zzso zzso or other differentiated features of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso sequence documents its close relationship to zzso zzso class cardiac zzso and ancillary evidence suggests a relationship with the zzso zzso gene zzso Apparently, an zzso heart, and the zzso program directing its development, was the foundation upon which the zzso heart evolved by progressive modular innovations at the genetic and zzso levels of zzso
