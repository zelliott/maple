zzso zzso inhibit zzso replication in zzso but their activity is limited by their sensitivity to zzso and low cellular zzso To see whether these problems could be zzso we compared effects of zzso rev and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso either free in solution or zzso in zzso zzso zzso on acutely or chronically infected zzso zzso zzso zzso were inactive in their free form in acutely and chronically infected cells (up to a concentration of 50 zzso When zzso in zzso directed to zzso class I molecules expressed by targeted cells, they inhibited viral replication (at a concentration of zzso zzso in acutely infected cells in a zzso zzso The same zzso zzso zzso in zzso had no zzso activity in chronically infected zzso In acutely infected cells, zzso zzso free in solution inhibited the replication of zzso without sequence specificity and had slightly greater activity, also zzso when zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically blocked zzso replication in chronically infected zzso When zzso in targeted zzso the efficiency of zzso for these cells was increased by at least zzso relative to the same zzso free in zzso
