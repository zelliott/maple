zzso zzso of a zzso DNA junction have been examined by zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso A series of zzso junctions were zzso with donor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the duplex arms in all six zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the donor in each junction was measured by zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso distances present between each pair of arms were recovered from the donor zzso using a continuous zzso distribution zzso The overall geometry of the zzso junction defined by the six mean zzso distances was consistent with a zzso structure, wherein pairs of duplex arms associate to form two continuous zzso Large differences were observed in the zzso of the zzso distance zzso depending on which pair of arms were labeled with the donor and zzso zzso zzso measured along the stacking zzso were characterized by relatively narrow zzso indicating that these zzso were zzso whereas distances between stacking zzso had broader zzso reflecting zzso in the angle between the two zzso The distances described by broad zzso were overestimated by zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that an ensemble of zzso structures are present in solution, characterized by differences in the small angle between the stacking zzso zzso and zzso effects on the recovered distribution zzso provide an indication of flexibility in the zzso zzso
