zzso zzso is a freshwater zzso fish with the smallest known zzso zzso Here, we report a draft zzso sequence with long-range linkage and substantial zzso to the 21 zzso zzso Genome analysis provides a greatly improved fish gene zzso including identifying key genes previously thought to be absent in zzso zzso with other zzso and a zzso indicates that fish proteins have zzso markedly faster than their zzso zzso zzso with the human zzso suggests approximately 900 previously zzso human zzso Analysis of the zzso and human zzso shows that zzso zzso occurred in the zzso fish zzso subsequent to its divergence from zzso The analysis also makes it possible to zzso the basic structure of the ancestral zzso zzso zzso which was composed of 12 zzso and to reconstruct much of the evolutionary history of ancient and recent zzso zzso leading to the modern human zzso
