zzso of individual zzso zzso using laser optical zzso has made it possible to zzso the major features of their energy zzso zzso mechanical unfolding zzso measured at a constant stretching force zzso of simple zzso structures zzso and zzso zzso sandwiched between zzso hybrid handles show that they unfold in a zzso zzso zzso To provide a molecular interpretation of the experiments we use a general zzso zzso zzso model, in which each zzso is represented using three interaction zzso Using the zzso model we have explored zzso of zzso hairpin as a function of zzso and the loading rate zzso The simulations and theoretical analysis have been done both with and without the handles that are explicitly modeled by zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms and zzso for zzso by temperature jump and mechanical unfolding are vastly zzso The directed zzso of the native state by zzso results in a sequential unfolding of the hairpin starting from their ends, whereas zzso zzso occurs zzso From the dependence of the unfolding rates on zzso and zzso we show that the position of the unfolding transition state is not a constant but moves dramatically as either zzso or zzso is zzso The zzso movements are interpreted by adopting the Hammond zzso for zzso zzso simulations of zzso with handles attached to the two ends, show that the value of the unfolding force increases (especially at high pulling zzso as the length of the handles zzso The pathways for zzso of zzso from stretched initial zzso upon zzso zzso to the zzso force zzso are highly zzso The zzso times, upon zzso are at least an zzso greater than those obtained by zzso The long zzso zzso times starting from fully stretched states are analyzed using a model that accounts for the microscopic steps in the zzso step, which involves the trans to zzso transitions of the zzso angles in the zzso zzso The simulations with explicit molecular model for the handles show that the dynamics of zzso zzso is strongly dependent on the interplay of their zzso length and persistence length and the zzso persistence zzso Using the zzso of our results, we also make a number of precise zzso testable zzso
