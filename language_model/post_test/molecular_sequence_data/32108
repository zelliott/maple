The A form zzso double zzso can be transformed to a left-handed zzso called zzso Currently, little is known about the detailed structural features of zzso or its involvement in cellular zzso The discovery that certain zzso proteins have zzso that can stabilize zzso as well as zzso opens the way for the study of zzso Here, we present the zzso A crystal structure of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to a zzso duplex zzso The zzso zzso is associated with a unique zzso pattern that zzso it from the otherwise similar zzso of zzso Based on the structure, we propose a model suggesting how differences in zzso lead to two types of zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso demonstrates how the zzso zzso of zzso could be targeted toward selected zzso containing zzso repeats, possibly of viral zzso
