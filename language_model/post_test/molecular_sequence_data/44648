Using amplified restriction zzso length zzso zzso technology, we have developed a new protocol for the zzso of zzso that allows systematic comparison of the differential expression of genes between zzso zzso The major advantage of our protocol is the use of only a single restriction zzso that recognizes a zzso sequence but allows screening of large numbers of different zzso Using this new zzso we compared zzso samples obtained from the flower buds of two lines of the common morning glory zzso zzso with red and white flowers, zzso zzso 50 bands were observed in each lane of a zzso zzso gel and the results were highly zzso as indicated by the results of analysis of two sets of independent zzso zzso Two zzso fragments, which were zzso amplified in the samples from the two lines, were shown to have been derived from a single gene that was actively expressed in the buds of red flowers but not in those of white zzso A full-length zzso of this gene was cloned from a bud zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that this zzso carries a sequence highly zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the key zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
