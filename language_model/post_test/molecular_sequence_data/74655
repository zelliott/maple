zzso zzso zzso zzso are modular zzso zzso that act as an assembly line to catalyze the zzso of complex natural zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso termination module zzso was solved at zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso associate closely to form a zzso platform, with their active sites on the same side of the zzso The zzso carrier protein domain is zzso zzso to this platform and thus can move with its zzso zzso arm between the active site of the zzso domain and the donor side of the zzso zzso The zzso crystal structure has implications for the rational redesign of zzso as a means of producing novel zzso zzso
