The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been constructed and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso affects zzso folding and zzso The optimum composition of the zzso medium requires the presence of ammonium zzso The yield of zzso is zzso 8000 U per liter of the zzso zzso medium with the specific activity of zzso zzso zzso to 25, zzso U per liter and 2000 zzso for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is more stable in acid media, in the reaction course and toward zzso The effect of hydrogen zzso zzso on zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso indirectly indicates participation of zzso in electron transfer pathways through the zzso zzso This is in agreement with the zzso kinetic data interpreted in terms of zzso participation in electron transfer within the zzso zzso
