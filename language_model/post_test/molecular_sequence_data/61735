zzso can be formed by single or multiple zzso The process of zzso at the molecular level has generated a wide variety of zzso proteins with specific domain organization to cater to the functional requirements of an zzso The functional and structural costs of inserting a domain into another means that zzso proteins are usually formed by zzso linking the zzso of one domain to the zzso of the preceding zzso While this is true in a large proportion of zzso zzso we find a significant fraction of proteins that are the result of domain zzso The inserted domain breaks the sequence zzso of the domain into which it is inserted leading to a novel domain zzso This web resource aims to document domain insertions in known protein structures that are classified in the zzso zzso The web server can be zzso from zzso zzso
