zzso zzso contains the largest numbers of zzso zzso identified to zzso Of these, zzso zzso V shows significant sequence zzso with zzso zzso 5, which is reported to be a potent zzso zzso To determine the effects of zzso zzso V on zzso it was expressed as a soluble protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso and its in zzso and in zzso zzso properties were zzso zzso inhibited the migration of human zzso vein zzso cells in zzso in a zzso zzso This function was associated with the zzso of the zzso of focal zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso formation of zzso stress zzso zzso zzso also inhibited new zzso formation in zzso as assessed by the chick zzso membrane zzso and the zzso plug zzso These results indicate that zzso may be an effective zzso inhibitor both in zzso and in zzso
