A zzso protein zzso has been zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The native zzso was found to be an zzso of zzso 250 zzso consisting of 11 zzso zzso The zzso bound saturated and zzso fatty zzso but not their zzso zzso with zzso values in the range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also bound, but zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Evidence suggests that there are two binding sites per zzso each with different zzso The fluorescent fatty acid zzso acid zzso and zzso both showed an additional zzso binding site with a density of approximately zzso per zzso suggesting specific binding to the zzso The zzso acid composition of zzso zzso was distinct from that of previously characterized fatty zzso proteins zzso The protein was not zzso blocked and yielded a unique zzso acid zzso unrelated to that of any known zzso there was also evidence of zzso zzso zzso raised to the zzso protein did not zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso The Gibbs free energy for protein folding zzso zzso zzso zzso determined by zzso zzso was identical for both the native and zzso zzso zzso CD zzso showed that the zzso protein contained zzso zzso and that the secondary structure underwent only minor changes on zzso zzso zzso zzso binds a range of zzso with zzso values again in the range zzso zzso It is possible that, in zzso binding proteins may play a role in determining the specificity and site of action of zzso
