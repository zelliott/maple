zzso Growth Factor zzso was recently discovered as a zzso growth factor for vascular zzso cells and based on its zzso to vascular zzso growth factor zzso can be classified as a new member of this growth factor zzso We have carried out zzso chain amplification zzso of zzso from human zzso vein zzso cells and zzso tissue and discovered a second species of zzso zzso zzso has a zzso acid zzso not present in zzso coding for a highly basic region near the zzso This is similar to zzso Northern analysis has zzso that the zzso gene is expressed only in a limited number of cell types and zzso zzso human zzso vein zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso of zzso insect cells with zzso zzso specific for the two forms zzso that both, zzso and zzso are zzso efficiently into the zzso and zzso can bind with high affinity to zzso Both zzso forms had a similar zzso potency for bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso that zzso of zzso expressing insect cells can compete for zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso can exist in different forms which are probably generated by differential zzso The occurrence of two molecular forms of this zzso specific growth factor suggests different zzso roles of the two forms during zzso development and zzso
