The previous report from our laboratory has recently identified a new zzso gene zzso zzso which exists independently in zzso zzso zzso In this study, amplification of zzso zzso zzso here) confirmed that there are two copies of zzso zzso one zzso being fused into zzso while the other zzso existed zzso This is the first report to suggest that two copies of the zzso gene exist in this zzso zzso of the zzso sequence demonstrated that putative leader zzso zzso and zzso were found upstream of zzso while these sequence features did not exist in front of zzso The zzso activity of an zzso zzso strain carrying a zzso fusion remained constant at different zzso zzso but the zzso activity of the same strain carrying a zzso fusion decreased as the zzso concentration zzso These data suggest that the expression of zzso is regulated at the zzso level by zzso while zzso is constantly zzso The zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso fusion protein is feedback inhibited by zzso while zzso protein is zzso We also found that both zzso and zzso gene products were involved in zzso zzso
