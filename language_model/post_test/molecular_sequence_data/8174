In this paper we describe a fast and mild method based on the use of a unique zzso zzso and buffers containing zzso zzso and salt for the zzso of the zzso basic protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso activity zzso not only the zzso of zzso but also indicates that probably it is in its native state, zzso there is a good chance that the zzso molecules are structurally and chemically zzso This is a prerequisite to obtain zzso appropriate for zzso zzso and other zzso
