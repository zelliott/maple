A small, new species of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from the southwestern dunes of the zzso Desert in northern Chile is zzso the zzso had not been reported for this western zzso zzso Our description is based on zzso and molecular data, as well as zzso and external zzso In order to support this hypothesis, we studied 27 specimens captured in zzso Los zzso zzso and zzso zzso comparing them with samples of all the extant species of the zzso zzso individuals consistently showed zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso identical to those of the geographically northeastern zzso zzso these two groups were geographically separated by zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis of 56 zzso zzso gene sequences yielded a zzso zzso tree where the new species formed a divergent and zzso zzso within the zzso which was also confirmed by zzso zzso minimum evolution, and zzso zzso The new species has zzso genetic distances of zzso from the geographically distant zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 of Principal zzso Analysis based on 12 body and skull zzso clearly separated the new species, the latter having a smaller zzso length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17) and lower weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We provide strong evidence to recognize a distinct new western lineage within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for which we give a complete zzso description and a hypothetical zzso zzso The new species should be considered zzso due to its level of zzso its low population numbers (which can be occasionally increased after a blooming zzso and its fragile dry habitat zzso distributed near the zzso zzso
