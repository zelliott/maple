The complement zzso system is a potent innate immune zzso system against zzso We have recently zzso and expressed zzso a 16 zzso protein derived from the soft tick zzso zzso that specifically binds zzso thereby preventing C zzso The structure of zzso zzso determined at zzso A resolution confirms a zzso fold and reveals that the protein binds a fatty acid zzso that we have identified by mass zzso as zzso zzso We propose that zzso could zzso one of the fatty zzso inflammatory zzso from the host zzso thereby interfering with the host inflammatory response to the tick zzso zzso of sequence differences between zzso and other tick zzso with different functions, combined with zzso investigations of zzso activity, supports the hypothesis that zzso acts by preventing interaction with the zzso zzso rather than by blocking the zzso zzso zzso
