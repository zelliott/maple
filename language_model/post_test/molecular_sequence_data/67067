zzso zzso translation is a hallmark of zzso and early zzso of which zzso zzso is a major zzso This process involves multiple protein zzso including the zzso zzso and zzso specificity zzso which is also required for nuclear zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso is required for the zzso zzso before nuclear zzso However, some evidence suggests that the zzso zzso might have a function independent of nuclear zzso which could be related to the cell zzso As such, we addressed the question whether zzso might have a role in zzso zzso We investigated the function of the zzso protein in zzso zzso and show that zzso has indeed a role in the zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso mainly to the nucleus, but also in punctuate zzso zzso We show that zzso resides in a zzso complex with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but is not required for zzso zzso per zzso zzso of zzso function in zzso leads to an acceleration of the zzso transition, with a premature synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso However, the kinetic of zzso zzso zzso is not zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso translation in zzso These results suggest that zzso could be involved in masking of zzso prior to zzso
