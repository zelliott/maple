The zzso sequence of two repeated sequences zzso in opposite zzso zzso the zzso toxin gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1988) is reported in this zzso The analysis of these sequences indicates that these two zzso display characteristic features of bacterial zzso sequences zzso and are therefore referred to as zzso zzso B is zzso zzso long and has two perfect zzso repeats of 16 zzso zzso A is zzso identical to zzso zzso A long open reading frame zzso a zzso of 235 zzso acids spans almost the entire sequence of both zzso zzso Both the sequence of the zzso repeats and the putative zzso are zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
