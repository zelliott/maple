We have studied the zzso induced in zzso zzso by zzso bound zzso zzso and by zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso three zzso are zzso as detected by the chemical zzso zzso and zzso zzso These two zzso reveal that the bases adjacent to the zzso site are zzso In both the modified zzso zzso the backbone on the zzso side of the modification is more zzso with zzso copper than the backbone on the 3' zzso On zzso gels, the zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso migrate slower than the zzso of the unmodified zzso It is suggested that the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso sites behave more as hinge zzso than as the zzso of directed zzso
