zzso was isolated in a screen for proteins interacting with zzso a key factor in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and form a complex with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso increases zzso and zzso in this complex, resulting in decreased soluble zzso and decreased zzso of zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a component of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activates both zzso genes and an zzso promoter, demonstrating that zzso is a general zzso zzso zzso of maternal zzso zzso from zzso zzso results in loss of zzso and head structures, demonstrating that zzso is required for normal zzso zzso
