A database search of the sequences zzso a member of rice zzso zzso revealed that a zzso sequence in the region downstream of the member is a repetitive sequence zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Most of the repetitive sequences were flanked by a direct repeat of a zzso zzso about 14 zzso in zzso The consensus zzso zzso zzso in zzso had no regions zzso any proteins but had sequence motifs of an internal promoter of zzso zzso zzso These indicate that the sequence is a zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a new rice zzso because it has no zzso with any of the three zzso families previously identified from rice, and because it has a stretch of A at the 3' end, unlike zzso and any other zzso zzso which have a stretch of T at the 3' zzso The zzso zzso was found to have many members related to zzso forming two additional new zzso families zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso to the 3' and zzso regions of zzso zzso This suggests that zzso has a mosaic structure, which is generated by sequence exchange (or zzso between ancestral zzso and zzso Despite the absence of zzso in the 3' regions between zzso (or zzso and zzso a zzso zzso is commonly present in the region preceding the A stretch at the 3' zzso This sequence together with the A stretch and a zzso structure found in the region near the A stretch are assumed to be important for zzso zzso members were present in strains of zzso species, as were zzso zzso Some of the members showed zzso zzso at the respective zzso among the rice zzso zzso had such zzso members, which are useful for zzso and zzso analysis of various strains of zzso zzso The zzso members of zzso were more frequently found than those of zzso and therefore, such members are likely to be useful for extensive zzso and zzso studies on various rice zzso
