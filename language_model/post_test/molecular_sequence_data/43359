The zzso zzso virus zzso immediate early protein zzso zzso the zzso associated with zzso processing zzso zzso zzso As a consequence, empty major zzso complex zzso class I molecules are retained in the zzso zzso and recognition of zzso cells by zzso T zzso is zzso We chemically zzso full-length zzso zzso and show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso Its biological activity is indistinguishable from that of zzso zzso zzso By using synthetic zzso we mapped the core sequence of zzso minimally required for TAP zzso to zzso zzso This segment is located within the region of the zzso zzso between zzso from zzso and zzso Through zzso scanning substitution we identified three segments within this region that are critical for the ability to inhibit TAP zzso The interaction of zzso with TAP is unlikely to mimic precisely that of the transported zzso as deduced from differential labeling of the zzso and zzso zzso using zzso fragments with chemical zzso
