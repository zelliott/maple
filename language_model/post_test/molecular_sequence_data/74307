zzso zzso silk is a unique zzso protein with combination of zzso strength and zzso but the isolation of large amount of silk from zzso is not zzso In this paper, we used a newly established zzso zzso expression system to express the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso silk protein zzso fused zzso in zzso cells and larvae of zzso A 70 zzso fusion protein was zzso after zzso infection by zzso and zzso zzso Fusion protein expressed in the zzso cells probably occupied five percent of the cell total zzso In a zzso zzso approximately 6 zzso fusion proteins were zzso zzso analysis of the expressed zzso zzso silk protein indicated that zzso fusion protein is zzso zzso zzso showed that fusion protein is tend to form zzso by self zzso The results indicated the zzso is the primary limit for zzso zzso proteins zzso It also suggested that directly produce zzso zzso silk in the zzso zzso of the transgenic zzso larvae might be a better zzso
