zzso zzso gene patterns, randomly amplified zzso zzso DNA zzso profiles and zzso profiles were used to discriminate between 28 strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most zzso were zzso I zzso The strains were representative zzso from a UK school outbreak of zzso (7 zzso and from 21 sporadic human cases of zzso in 4 zzso The molecular techniques zzso to various degrees between strains in each of the zzso The outbreak strains were homogeneous in most molecular features but a variety of types was detected amongst the zzso from the sporadic zzso Five groups of two or more strains with identical zzso were identified and within each, strains from different patients were zzso with respect to zzso zzso profile typing based on zzso analysis generally matched zzso zzso profiling overall gave least discrimination but was useful in separating some strains similar in other zzso We concluded that optimal discrimination of zzso zzso could best be achieved using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso III zzso was the single most zzso and zzso technique zzso Several strains of zzso zzso from sporadic infections had similar molecular profiles which have potential for general typing zzso
