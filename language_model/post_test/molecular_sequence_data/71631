The zzso relationships among the main evolutionary lines of the zzso order zzso were investigated by means of molecular zzso zzso zzso and the D3 region of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso data zzso Equally and zzso weighted zzso analyses of independent and combined data sets provide evidence for the zzso of the zzso In all the zzso the internal relationships of the group coincide in the zzso of the following main groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso are zzso and sister to a zzso that includes all the remaining zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso the most supported hypothesis suggests that zzso are zzso as zzso zzso zzso + zzso but the alternative hypothesis zzso zzso + zzso is more zzso in some molecular data zzso zzso within the four main zzso are also zzso Evolution of some zzso characters is discussed, and zzso states of these characters are evaluated using molecular data zzso zzso Finally, zzso hypothesis of zzso evolution is assessed in relation to our zzso
