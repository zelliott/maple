zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown previously to interact with zzso in the zzso complex of skeletal zzso In the present study, we have examined whether zzso also interacts with zzso in skeletal zzso zzso and zzso are zzso from rat skeletal muscle zzso by zzso directed against either of the two zzso zzso peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibit the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also binds to a zzso zzso fusion protein in in zzso binding zzso In zzso binding is completely abolished by zzso of zzso with either of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso therefore, appear to be direct and to involve two distinct zzso zzso zzso Other zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are also zzso inhibited by each of the four zzso zzso zzso interactions zzso by two different zzso zzso may thus be a general feature of zzso zzso to zzso proteins in zzso zzso
