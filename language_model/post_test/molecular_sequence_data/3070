zzso receptors or zzso are crucial components of the zzso membrane system of zzso The zzso family of zzso have been shown to have roles in zzso zzso zzso membrane fusion and even internal membrane compartment zzso While zzso and zzso in general have been well characterized in zzso and zzso models, little is known about their overall distribution across zzso diversity or about the evolution of the zzso gene zzso By combining zzso molecular biological and zzso approaches, we demonstrate that various zzso zzso are not only present in zzso crown zzso but across a wide range of zzso zzso The alignment of zzso diverse zzso zzso shows that an zzso zzso critical to zzso complex formation and the characteristic zzso zzso zzso are nearly universally zzso zzso a general functional importance for these zzso Other identified functional zzso involved in zzso toxicity and zzso interactions are also zzso The presence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso provides further evidence for a cryptic zzso in this zzso zzso and another likely case of secondary reduction in this zzso The zzso of zzso shows a number of zzso zzso including a case of parallel evolution in the plasma zzso zzso and ancestral zzso in the other zzso zzso These speak to ancient events in the evolution of the zzso system and emphasize the universal role of the zzso in the zzso zzso compartment zzso
