Identification of a selective inhibitor for a particular protein zzso without zzso of other zzso is critical for use as a biological tool or zzso However, this is very difficult because there are hundreds of zzso zzso and their zzso zzso including the zzso binding pocket have a common folding zzso To address this issue, we applied the following zzso approach for designing selective zzso zzso zzso identification of specifically altered zzso acid zzso around the zzso binding pocket in zzso by comparison of 390 representative zzso zzso prediction of appropriate positions to introduce zzso in lead compounds based on the locations of the altered zzso acid zzso and the binding modes of lead compounds, and zzso library design to interact with the altered zzso acid zzso supported by de zzso design zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso which are located in the zzso binding region, were selected as first target zzso for specific interactions with zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso ring in the zzso class of lead compound zzso was predicted to be a suitable position to introduce zzso We then designed a chemical library of zzso zzso with zzso groups based on the output structures of de zzso design zzso Thus we identified a highly selective and potent zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed higher selectivity on zzso over those on not only zzso zzso but also many other zzso zzso that have been tested thus zzso The structural basis for zzso selective zzso by zzso was analyzed by combining molecular modeling and the X-ray analysis of the zzso mimic zzso zzso The results suggest that the hydrogen bond with the zzso group of zzso and zzso van der zzso contact with the side chains of zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso was found to cause cell cycle arrest of the zzso cancer cell line in the zzso phase, indicating that it is a good biological zzso
