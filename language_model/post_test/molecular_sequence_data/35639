The zzso zzso gene zzso when present in high copy number, stimulates the expression of several zzso protein genes during the onset of stationary phase, zzso zzso A novel integration zzso zzso was constructed for zzso expression zzso it employed a unique method of promoter insert production for fusion with the zzso reporter zzso zzso were made of the zzso zzso region of the zzso promoter to zzso the site responsible for zzso enhancement zzso zzso was used zzso fuse zzso promoter deletion fragments with the zzso reporter zzso A site between zzso and zzso with respect to the zzso start site of zzso was found to be required for the zzso zzso zzso increase from the zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing the zzso coding region without its native negative regulation was highly unstable in zzso zzso this was due to the expressed zzso zzso
