A mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to a surface zzso zzso zzso on multiple myeloma zzso cells, and exhibits potent zzso cell activity against zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso To develop an zzso zzso against zzso a humanized zzso zzso in which all zzso zzso to naturally processed human zzso has been successfully constructed with the aid of both the hybrid variable region and zzso design zzso This humanized zzso zzso zzso is able to effectively induce zzso against human myeloma zzso and zzso cells in the presence of human zzso as effectively as a zzso zzso zzso The humanized zzso zzso therefore, could be expected as a potent zzso agent for zzso zzso
