zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the mouse is controlled by at least two zzso The downstream promoter zzso is zzso zzso whereas expression of the upstream promoter zzso is largely restricted to zzso These observations may provide a genetic basis for a human zzso resistance syndrome, zzso type zzso zzso in which zzso but not zzso signaling by zzso is zzso zzso therefore, cloned and characterized the zzso of the human zzso gene and found that its organization is very similar to that of the zzso zzso initiation sites of human zzso and zzso promoters are in similar, but not zzso positions to those of the mouse zzso The identification of a human zzso promoter is significant because no zzso human zzso complementary zzso have been isolated to zzso Southern analysis of zzso DNA from seven zzso patients did not reveal any zzso in zzso promoter regions or zzso zzso zzso region zzso No significant sequence differences were found in clones of normal and patient zzso encompassing zzso promoter zzso and untranslated region and signal sequence zzso Thus, in the seven zzso patients zzso no defects were identified that would influence initiation site selection, stability, or zzso of zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that the genetic zzso in zzso in these patients lies in zzso zzso elements of the zzso in an essential zzso regulator, or in some as yet unidentified zzso required for zzso zzso zzso
