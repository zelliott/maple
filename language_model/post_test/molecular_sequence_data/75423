The last two steps in the de zzso zzso of UMP are zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso these two activities are found in a single, zzso protein called UMP zzso A human zzso cell zzso library constructed in zzso zzso was screened with a UMP zzso rat zzso zzso Human UMP zzso zzso were isolated and then used to select UMP zzso gene zzso The complete coding sequence of the zzso for UMP zzso was determined by analysis of overlapping zzso and zzso zzso One of the zzso appears to have been zzso from an incompletely or alternatively processed form of the UMP zzso zzso This zzso lacks a zzso tail and has an extended zzso region that zzso with larger forms of the UMP zzso zzso The UMP zzso protein is composed of zzso zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso The two activities of UMP zzso reside in distinct zzso zzso by the 3' and zzso halves of the zzso The zzso 258 zzso acids of the human UMP zzso protein contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso This region is highly zzso to the mouse zzso zzso zzso The zzso 214 zzso acids contain the zzso zzso There is zzso acid zzso between this protein domain and specific regions of the zzso coli zzso The human zzso domain also contains the putative zzso site common to other human zzso
