Both deterministic and zzso forces determine the representation and frequency of floral zzso in zzso plant zzso zzso analysis of molecular variation can provide information on the role of historical factors, including founder events, in affecting population zzso zzso Here, we investigate geographical patterns of floral zzso variation in a zzso shrub zzso zzso zzso by examining the relations between floral zzso and molecular zzso and zzso variation in 25 populations sampled throughout the distribution of the species in southwest China and adjacent zzso In 19 of the 25 zzso the frequency of floral zzso was not significantly different from the expected zzso zzso The remaining populations were either zzso biased zzso or zzso zzso for this form and were zzso differentiated from the remaining populations in several floral traits, that is, zzso tube zzso sex organ position and zzso zzso zzso analysis supports the hypothesis that zzso zzso was initially split into west-central and eastern lineages in the Early zzso zzso zzso A centrally located lineage composed of zzso and zzso populations appears to have been subsequently derived from the west-central zzso perhaps by a founder event after the last glacial zzso zzso to explain why these populations have not returned to equilibrium zzso zzso are zzso
