zzso proteins belonging to the zzso family have an zzso structure composed of repetitive zzso The three-dimensional solution structure of the 16th repeat from chicken brain zzso zzso has been determined by zzso zzso and distance zzso zzso zzso We used a total of zzso distance zzso which included zzso zzso values obtained by applying the ambiguous restraints for zzso assignment zzso zzso In addition, we performed a direct refinement against zzso zzso The final ensemble of 20 structures shows an average zzso of zzso A from the mean for the backbone zzso excluding zzso and N and C zzso zzso is made up of three zzso zzso separated by two zzso and folds into a left-handed zzso The basic unit of zzso is an zzso zzso composed of two zzso zzso beta and zzso These assemble a zzso via a mechanism that relies on the completion of a single repeat by association of the partial repeats located at the C zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and at the N zzso of the zzso (one zzso This zzso is the zzso able to zzso zzso zzso Model building by zzso of the zzso repeat from human zzso zzso illuminates the possible role of point zzso which cause zzso zzso
