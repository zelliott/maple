zzso zzso a zzso green zzso grows zzso at very low zzso of zzso carbon due to the presence of an zzso zzso zzso During the induction of the zzso mechanism at zzso growth conditions, at least five zzso that are either absent or present in low amounts in cells grown on zzso zzso are zzso One of these induced zzso with a molecular mass of 36 zzso zzso has been localized to the zzso zzso The protein was zzso and the partial internal zzso acid sequences were obtained through zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso have been cloned using zzso zzso based on the zzso acid zzso The two genes zzso zzso are highly zzso in the coding region but are completely different in the zzso and zzso untranslated zzso The deduced protein sequences show strong zzso to the zzso carrier protein zzso suggesting that zzso is a zzso carrier zzso The regulation of the expression of these two genes at zzso and zzso growth conditions is also zzso Both genes were highly expressed under zzso growth conditions, with the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso more zzso However, neither gene was expressed at zzso growth zzso The gene products of both clones expressed in zzso coli were recognized by an zzso raised against zzso confirming that the two zzso indeed zzso the zzso zzso zzso envelope carrier protein zzso
