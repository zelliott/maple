zzso zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently identified as the defective gene in zzso disease zzso an zzso dominant skin disorder characterized by abnormal zzso zzso in the zzso layers of the zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso liquid zzso to screen all 28 zzso and zzso zzso boundaries of zzso for zzso in 9 zzso zzso Nine different zzso were zzso Five of these zzso including one nonsense, one zzso two zzso and one zzso zzso have not been previously zzso Recently, functional analysis of a series of zzso zzso designed to mimic zzso zzso found in zzso uncovered specific defects in zzso and/or zzso transport and protein expression in zzso zzso zzso In order to investigate the molecular and zzso basis of zzso in the patient carrying zzso zzso zzso located in the putative zzso binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso was employed to introduce this zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso demonstrated a low level of protein zzso despite normal levels of zzso and correct targeting to the zzso suggesting instability or abnormal folding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to conclusions drawn from our previous studies, these results further support the theory of zzso as a prevalent mechanism for the dominant inheritance of zzso by suggesting that the level of zzso in zzso cells is zzso
