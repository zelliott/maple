zzso zzso is a linear charged zzso whose structure is made up of repeating zzso zzso Apparently conflicting reports have been published about the nature of the zzso structure of zzso in the solid zzso Recent developments in the field of molecular modeling of zzso offer new opportunities to zzso the structural basis underlying the formation and stabilization of ordered structures and their interactions with zzso The zzso spaces available and the low energy zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso segments of zzso were investigated via molecular mechanics calculations using the zzso force zzso First, the results were used to access the zzso statistics of the corresponding zzso A zzso chain having a persistence length of 75 A at 25 degrees C is zzso Then, the exploration of the stable ordered forms of zzso led to numerous zzso zzso both zzso and zzso having comparable zzso Several of these zzso zzso to the zzso observed ones and illustrate the versatility of the zzso The double stranded zzso forms have also been explored and theoretical structures have been compared to zzso derived zzso
