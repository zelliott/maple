During zzso early development, the length of the zzso tail of maternal zzso is a key element of zzso zzso Several sequence elements zzso zzso zzso localized in 3' untranslated regions have been shown to be responsible for the zzso zzso of certain maternal zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso 2A is zzso after zzso of zzso zzso This zzso is zzso by the additive effects of two zzso zzso one being similar to already described zzso zzso elements and the other consisting of a zzso zzso Finally, a candidate specificity factor for zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and identified as the zzso zzso of human zzso
