Identification and zzso of an zzso zzso promoter element of zzso skin disease virus zzso is zzso The 56 zzso element shows substantial structural similarities with other zzso zzso providing further evidence that zzso elements are zzso within the zzso The relative strengths of the zzso early and late promoters were compared to the zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso promoters in transient expression zzso These transient zzso also verified the temporally regulated nature of the zzso zzso expression levels suggest that the identified zzso promoters could be used for expressing foreign genes in a zzso zzso zzso
