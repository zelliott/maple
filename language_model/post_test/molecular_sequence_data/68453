zzso a zzso gene product required for zzso replication in zzso coli, is shown here to inhibit the replication of zzso in zzso when zzso zzso to zzso in zzso Unlike plasmids whose replication is prevented by zzso in the zzso zzso plasmids prevented from replicating by overproduction of the zzso protein were lost rapidly from the cell population instead of being zzso evenly between daughter zzso zzso of the partition zzso locus increased the zzso effect of excess zzso on zzso while host and zzso zzso that compensate for the absence of zzso or overproduction of the zzso coli zzso zzso diminished zzso A zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso copy number almost entirely eliminated the zzso effect of zzso at high concentration and zzso replication when the protein was moderately zzso As the zzso protein can exist in both zzso and zzso forms, we suggest that overproduction promotes zzso zzso reducing the formation of replication initiation complexes that require the zzso zzso and zzso we propose that the zzso zzso alters the ability of the zzso protein to zzso Our discovery that an elevated zzso concentration of zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso implies that the zzso complexes initiating zzso DNA replication participate also in the distribution of plasmids at cell zzso
