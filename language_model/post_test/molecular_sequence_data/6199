We have designed a novel strategy for the isolation of the rearranged zzso fragments zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso regions of mouse zzso zzso This strategy is based on the zzso amplification of zzso DNA from mouse zzso using multiple specific zzso chosen in the zzso region and in the zzso downstream of the rearranged zzso zzso zzso zzso regions with intact coding zzso including full-length leader peptides zzso can be obtained without previous DNA zzso Our strategy is based on a zzso template that produces fragments that do not need to be adapted for zzso zzso zzso thus zzso the generation of zzso and zzso zzso
