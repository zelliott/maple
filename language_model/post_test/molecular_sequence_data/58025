The zzso initiation factor 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso protects zzso zzso from zzso zzso by zzso zzso such as zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso zzso This promotes protein synthesis in the presence of zzso zzso present in animal cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 89, zzso In this study, the primary structure of rat zzso is determined by zzso zzso Based on the partial zzso acid sequences of overlapping zzso and zzso zzso zzso fragments, zzso zzso were zzso and used as zzso for the zzso chain reaction to amplify the corresponding zzso zzso zzso from rat liver first strand zzso The amplified DNA was then used as a probe to screen a rat tumor zzso zzso zzso library, and a positive clone covering the entire coding region was zzso From the zzso zzso an open reading frame that encodes zzso as a zzso acid protein with a molecular mass of 53 zzso was predicted for the zzso zzso The cloned zzso was further characterized by in zzso zzso translation in zzso zzso zzso zzso The translated product migrated similarly to zzso in zzso gel zzso and was zzso with zzso against zzso Northern zzso analysis of rat liver zzso zzso showed a single size class zzso 2 zzso of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the protein showed a highly charged zzso region composed of two basic zzso blocks and an zzso zzso acid zzso The protein also exhibits significant sequence identity in the zzso region with human zzso zzso
