zzso zzso stress has been linked to degenerative modifications in different zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso analysis and illustrative tandem mass zzso zzso we demonstrate zzso zzso modifications in structural proteins of zzso discs zzso isolated from aging zzso Increased protein zzso was associated with protein fragmentation and zzso zzso these findings, a significant loss of elasticity and increased zzso was measured in zzso from aging zzso Studies using circular zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso revealed zzso loss of secondary zzso structures of zzso zzso following zzso zzso unfolding and zzso promoted both zzso and zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso modification in healthy zzso zzso the zzso and zzso modifications observed in the aging zzso Together, these results suggest that protein zzso zzso and zzso could zzso events in promoting zzso degenerative zzso
