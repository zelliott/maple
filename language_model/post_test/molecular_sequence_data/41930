zzso zzso have been suggested to be involved in the zzso decrease of the activity of spinach zzso zzso zzso zzso and the binding of zzso zzso to its regulatory sites zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This work identifies the zzso zzso and investigates the effects of their chemical modification on the course of zzso zzso The zzso form of zzso reacted with zzso zzso in three zzso an initial zzso second slow, and final zzso zzso zzso in loop 6, zzso and zzso all from the large zzso were zzso in the first zzso zzso zzso of the large zzso was labeled in the next zzso The modification of these zzso was strongly suppressed in the zzso form that had undergone zzso zzso change after binding zzso zzso at its zzso zzso Instead, zzso of the large zzso and zzso from the small zzso were newly modified in the zzso zzso A higher concentration of zzso zzso reduced the zzso of the two zzso to zzso The modification of the zzso form of the zzso for 30 zzso was expected to zzso zzso zzso and zzso at random, and the course of the reaction of the partially modified zzso was expected to zzso from that of the unmodified zzso Experimental results showed that this was the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
