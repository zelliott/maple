zzso pathogens are increasing in prevalence due to an increase in resistant strains and the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of these zzso and approximately zzso of strains contain a group I zzso zzso which is a potential zzso drug target, in their large zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso and derivatives zzso are selective zzso of zzso zzso group I zzso zzso with an zzso of 17 zzso in 2 zzso zzso Chemical probing of the zzso in the presence of zzso zzso reveals that the folding of several zzso in the zzso region of the zzso is zzso A zzso near the zzso region is protected from chemical modification in the presence of zzso zzso and several nearby are more zzso this suggests that this region is the zzso binding zzso These results expand the available information on zzso targeting of zzso and suggest that the zzso scaffold provided by zzso may prove valuable in designing compounds that inhibit the functions of zzso
