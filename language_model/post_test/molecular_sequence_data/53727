zzso zzso controls growth, differentiation and patterning during normal animal zzso in humans, zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in cancer and zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso is thought to require zzso of the zzso in response to zzso zzso movement of the zzso zzso domain to the nucleus, and binding of that zzso domain to a zzso (for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Here we identify zzso a zzso protein that forms a zzso complex together with the zzso zzso protein and the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso repeats that abrogate signal zzso are incapable of complex formation both in zzso and in zzso Using zzso zzso we find that zzso activity is crucial in zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso in zzso and a zzso zzso is predominantly nuclear in zzso zzso We propose that zzso and zzso promote zzso by recruiting zzso to target zzso where it functions as a zzso zzso
