zzso zzso cassette transport systems for zzso zzso of zinc and zzso use a cluster 9 zzso zzso zzso of four cluster 9 transport proteins have been determined zzso However, the structural zzso for discrimination between zinc and zzso remain under zzso To further investigate the zzso of metal binding sites in bacterial zzso we have determined the structure of the zzso transport protein zzso from zzso coli to zzso A zzso The overall structure of zzso is similar to other zzso zzso A scaffolding zzso forms the backbone for two structurally related zzso zzso The zzso site is located at the domain zzso The bound zinc zzso is coordinated by three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso The functional role of zzso for metal binding is unexpected, because this zzso is not zzso in previously determined structures of zinc and zzso transport zzso The observed metal coordination by four protein zzso differs significantly from the zzso site in the zzso zzso from zzso zzso which binds zinc via three zzso zzso In addition, the zzso coli zzso structure reveals the presence of a zzso bond in the zzso zzso domain that is not present in previously determined cluster 9 transport protein zzso
