zzso is an zzso protein of differentiated zzso that also occurs as part of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and associated zzso spines in a zzso of exclusively zzso zzso zzso acid sequences determined in zzso rat kidney and zzso zzso and derived from human and mouse brain zzso clones show no significant zzso to any known zzso In particular, zzso does not contain functional zzso found in zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame of zzso encodes a zzso with a calculated Mr of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso zzso 27 zzso zzso contains a high amount of zzso ( approximately zzso equally distributed along the zzso thus virtually excluding the formation of any zzso zzso zzso comparison between human and mouse zzso revealed zzso identity at the protein zzso In both brain and zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso gene expression is differentiation zzso During zzso maturation of rat brain, zzso is first detected by Western zzso analysis at day 15 and reaches maximum expression in the adult zzso The exclusive zzso synthesis in the zzso has been confirmed by in zzso zzso where zzso zzso is only found in zzso of the zzso bulb, cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso zzso the expression is restricted to areas of high synaptic zzso From these results and experiments with cultured cells we conclude that zzso represents a novel kind of zzso zzso protein that may play a role in modulating zzso shape and zzso of zzso spines and zzso foot zzso
