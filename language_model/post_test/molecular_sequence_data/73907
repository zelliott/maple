In the present study, we have isolated zzso zzso that recognize an zzso from zzso nuclear zzso 2 in association with two different zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso displayed a similar efficiency in the zzso and zzso presentation of this zzso Since earlier studies have shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso escapes class zzso immune recognition by zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso we have explored the possibility that these tumor cells can process class zzso zzso zzso The data presented in this study clearly demonstrate that zzso cells were recognized efficiently by zzso zzso class zzso zzso zzso following infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso Analysis of surface zzso class II expression on zzso cells revealed high levels of zzso and zzso zzso and most of these molecules were negative for the zzso chain zzso referred to as zzso Moreover, these tumor cells also showed normal levels of zzso gene zzso which has been shown previously to be an essential component of the class II processing zzso The present finding of efficient processing function through the class II zzso in zzso cells provides a novel mechanism for immune targeting of zzso zzso
