A single zzso zzso zzso on linkage group zzso zzso controls bacterial zzso resistance in zzso We identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso composed of five bacterial artificial zzso zzso during the selection of zzso clones around zzso zzso With the zzso zzso line population from the cross of zzso and zzso 2, zzso zzso and simple sequence repeat marker zzso were able to locate zzso on LG zzso On the basis of information in the zzso zzso zzso and our results, parts of LG A1 and LG zzso share duplicated zzso zzso and zzso revealed that many zzso regions contained zzso and proteins related to signal zzso zzso Interestingly, inserted sequences from zzso and zzso had zzso with zzso and zzso zzso of evolutionary events revealed that zzso of soybean from zzso and the recent divergence of two soybean zzso regions occurred at 60 and 12 million years ago, zzso Distribution of synonymous substitution patterns, zzso yielded a first secondary peak zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by two smaller zzso were displayed between soybean zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of soybean zzso was again supported by our zzso
