A zzso zzso approach was used to identify zzso at the zzso interface of the zzso coli zzso zzso This transport protein comprises two zzso zzso and one zzso C domain per zzso of which the latter provides the zzso zzso A series of zzso zzso C zzso present in the native membrane were subjected to zzso zzso formation or zzso zzso with zzso of different zzso The engineered zzso were at the borders of the predicted zzso zzso Two zzso were found to be located in close proximity of each other and capable of forming a zzso while four other locations formed zzso with the longer zzso zzso of the zzso did only influence the zzso behavior at one position zzso zzso binding only zzso the zzso of a zzso at the border of the third zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso binding does not lead to large zzso in the zzso packing or to zzso of the zzso Upon zzso zzso the zzso becomes more exposed but the zzso is no longer capable of forming a stable zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In combination with the recently obtained projection structure of the zzso domain in two-dimensional zzso a first proposal is made for zzso packing in the zzso zzso
