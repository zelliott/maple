Human zzso type 9 zzso elicits exclusively zzso zzso tumors in rats, and an essential zzso zzso for this virus is zzso zzso open reading frame 1 zzso which encodes a zzso zzso protein with cellular zzso activity in zzso In this study, we engineered 48 different zzso zzso genes in an attempt to identify regions of this viral protein essential for transformation of the established rat zzso zzso cell line zzso In initial zzso with zzso cells, 17 of the 48 zzso zzso genes proved to be severely defective for generating transformed zzso but only 7 of these defective genes expressed zzso amounts of zzso To further examine the defects of the seven zzso zzso we selected individual cell pools of stable zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Compared to cell pools expressing the zzso zzso zzso most cell pools expressing zzso proteins displayed decreased growth in soft zzso and all generated significantly smaller tumors in zzso zzso The altered zzso acid zzso of the seven zzso zzso zzso clustered within three separate regions referred to as region I zzso 34 to zzso region II zzso 89 to zzso and zzso region III zzso 122 to zzso By using indirect zzso we also assessed whether the zzso proteins localized properly to the zzso of zzso The region I and region II zzso displayed approximately zzso zzso zzso whereas most region III zzso zzso accumulated within the nucleus of zzso In zzso we have identified three zzso protein regions necessary for cellular transformation and have demonstrated that zzso region III sequences significantly influence the proper zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso
