The abundant zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso binds to the upstream region of several zzso including some zzso protein genes like the one zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso sequence lowers the zzso of these genes three- to more than zzso We have isolated the zzso genes of two related zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of these zzso genes with their counterpart from zzso zzso shows a strong sequence similarity covering the whole of the coding zzso In contrast, little or no sequence similarity is found in the zzso regions of the three zzso Also the trailer regions differ considerably in both length and sequence from one species to zzso An zzso site is present in the upstream region of the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that this sequence is able to bind a protein present in zzso cells with a molecular mass somewhat lower than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso reporter system, showed that the zzso site is indeed involved in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso probe showed only weak zzso with zzso DNA and Northern blots did not show a zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso contain functionally related but structurally dissimilar zzso zzso
