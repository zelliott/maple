The zzso gene product zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso resistance of cancer zzso zzso is an zzso zzso pump that zzso a variety of dissimilar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in zzso resistance zzso of tumor cell lines in zzso as well as in cancer zzso To selectively target and eliminate zzso tumor cells, we have isolated a zzso zzso that specifically zzso with the first zzso loop of the human zzso We have cloned the variable domain genes of this zzso and assembled a functional zzso zzso zzso capable of specifically targeting various zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and specific elimination of zzso zzso human cancer cells was achieved by constructing a zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso was fused to a truncated form of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso or other zzso molecules armed with potent zzso represent an effective tool in targeted cancer therapy aimed at specific elimination of zzso tumor cell zzso zzso zzso fragments targeting zzso proteins such as zzso may be also used for zzso expression and zzso zzso knockout of zzso
