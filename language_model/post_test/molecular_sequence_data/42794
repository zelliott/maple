Three zzso bacteria, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to be able to convert zzso acid to zzso through a zzso synthetic zzso identical to that from zzso coli zzso et zzso DNA zzso in press, zzso We report in this paper the cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso genes zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso of zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso genes from zzso zzso were located on a zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso sequence analysis of this zzso revealed that these genes consist of a zzso zzso and a 675 zzso open reading frame, zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso acid zzso zzso is zzso and zzso identical to that of the zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso gene products, zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso identical to that of the zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso gene products, zzso In addition, the zzso organization of the zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso has been shown to be different from that in zzso coli and zzso zzso
