zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained for 33 strains representing the major zzso lineages of zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso relationships of the strains based on variation in zzso are generally similar to those previously obtained for several other zzso and for invasion zzso but the sequences of zzso zzso subspecies V strains are unusual in being almost intermediate between those of the other zzso zzso subspecies and zzso zzso For zzso zzso the ratio of synonymous zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso between pairs of strains was larger than comparable values for 12 other zzso and invasion zzso reflecting unusually strong zzso selection against zzso acid replacement in the zzso zzso All zzso acids involved in the zzso activity and zzso changes of zzso are strictly zzso within and between zzso In zzso coli, the level of variation at the 3' end of the gene is elevated by the presence in some strains of a zzso replacement sequence supplied by the integration of either zzso zzso 21 or defective zzso element zzso The 72 members of the zzso coli zzso Collection zzso and five additional zzso coli strains were surveyed for the presence of zzso 21 (as zzso by zzso amplification of a zzso zzso zzso in and adjacent to the host zzso and the sequence of the zzso 21 segment extending from the 3' end of zzso through the zzso gene zzso was determined in nine strains of zzso zzso zzso 21 was found in zzso of zzso coli zzso and its distribution among the zzso strains is zzso In two zzso zzso the zzso 21 zzso gene is interrupted by a zzso zzso element that has zzso zzso sequence identity with zzso of zzso zzso The zzso relationships of zzso 21 strains derived from sequences of two different zzso regions were strongly zzso providing evidence of frequent zzso
