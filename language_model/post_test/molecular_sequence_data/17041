zzso of zzso peptides via infrared zzso zzso zzso provides more extensive sequence information than is obtained with zzso activated zzso zzso in a zzso zzso trap due to the lack of the zzso low zzso zzso and the ability to form secondary and higher order fragments with the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso is shown to be useful for the selective zzso of zzso over those which are not zzso because the greater zzso zzso efficiency of the zzso peptides leads to their more rapid zzso Finally, the selectivity of the zzso technique for zzso species in complex zzso is confirmed with the analysis of a mock zzso mixture and a zzso digest of zzso
