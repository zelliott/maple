zzso zzso provides an increasingly important source of medically and industrially useful zzso We have isolated 14 zzso species from a collection of approximately 300 plant stem samples from the upper zzso rainforest in zzso All of the cultured zzso produce substances with zzso activity directed at a range of potential zzso and bacterial zzso For some organisms, this activity is very broad in spectrum while other organisms show specific activity against a limited number of zzso Two of these organisms zzso inhibit bacterial test organisms over zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis indicates that these organisms are not equivalent to any other cultured deposits in zzso Our results provide evidence of the untapped zzso in the form of biologically active microbes present within the zzso of higher zzso
