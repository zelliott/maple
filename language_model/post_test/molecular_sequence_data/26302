We developed a quantitative zzso for human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso DNA sequences using the zzso chain reaction zzso The relative copy numbers of zzso zzso DNA molecules were determined by zzso of an zzso gag sequence and a portion of the zzso alpha locus of the zzso zzso zzso Because of the disparity in the copy number of cellular and zzso templates, an zzso in the efficiency of the zzso amplification was required to achieve simultaneous amplification and zzso of both target zzso The zzso and zzso amplified products were detected by zzso with zzso labeled zzso and the amount of probe bound to each product was determined with a zzso zzso Standard zzso were generated by plotting the zzso and zzso signals made against known copies of each target present prior to zzso The copies of zzso target relative to the number of cells in a given sample were determined by zzso from standard zzso The procedure described here is generally zzso to the zzso of other zzso
