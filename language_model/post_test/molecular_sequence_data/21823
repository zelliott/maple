zzso zzso is a major zzso controlling zzso levels that plays a central role in zzso affective mood and pain zzso There are three common zzso zzso in the human population reported to have functional effects, divergent in two synonymous and one zzso zzso We demonstrate that one of the zzso carrying the zzso variation known to code for a less stable zzso exhibits increased protein expression in zzso This increased protein zzso which would compensate for lower protein stability, is solely produced by a synonymous variation zzso situated within the zzso and located in the zzso region of the zzso zzso Based on zzso secondary structure predictions, we suggest that structural zzso near the start zzso caused by the T zzso could be related to the observed increase in zzso zzso Our folding simulations of the zzso zzso structures demonstrate that zzso by the T zzso lowers the folding transition barrier, thus decreasing the probability of occupying its native zzso These data suggest a novel structural mechanism zzso functional synonymous variations near the translation initiation zzso affect the translation efficiency via zzso changes in zzso dynamics and present another example of stable zzso genetic variations in the human zzso
