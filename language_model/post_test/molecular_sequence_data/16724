The heat shock zzso factor zzso family consists of three members in zzso and regulates expression of heat shock genes via a heat shock zzso zzso and zzso are required for some zzso zzso but it is unclear how they regulate these zzso To zzso the mechanisms of zzso regulation by zzso we generated mice in which the zzso gene is zzso zzso mice had cataract with abnormal lens fiber cells containing zzso structures, probably due to decreased expression of zzso which maintains protein zzso Furthermore, we found increased proliferation and premature differentiation of the zzso lens zzso cells, which is associated with increased expression of growth factors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso for the expression of zzso not only in the lens but also in other zzso These findings reveal the zzso role of zzso which activates zzso zzso and also indicate that zzso and zzso are involved in regulating expression of growth factor zzso which are essential for cell growth and zzso
