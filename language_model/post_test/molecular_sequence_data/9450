The zzso zzso zzso is a bottleneck component in the provision of zzso energy by zzso zzso The expression of its zzso zzso zzso is zzso controlled at zzso levels during zzso the cell cycle and in zzso Here we show that zzso targets the zzso of zzso zzso zzso significantly reducing its zzso efficiency without affecting zzso zzso Despite the reduced expression of zzso in most human zzso we observed no expression of zzso in different human cancer cell lines, minimizing the potential role of zzso as a regulator of the zzso activity of zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso is highly zzso in the human fetal zzso zzso with previous findings in the zzso the expression of zzso in the human liver also seems to be controlled at zzso levels during development, what might suggest a role for zzso in controlling zzso translation and thus in defining the zzso activity of human liver zzso Moreover, zzso techniques and zzso zzso experiments using different zzso against zzso reveal that the zzso expression of zzso at the cell surface of the zzso and zzso cells is negligible or stands for zzso
