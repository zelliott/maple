Proper zzso function is essential for the accurate segregation of zzso during zzso zzso provide the attachment sites for zzso zzso and are required for the alignment of zzso at the zzso plate zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex are required for zzso zzso and their disruption results in zzso arrest accompanied by multiple zzso zzso To better understand the function of the zzso complex, we have identified two novel zzso of the human zzso complex, termed human zzso zzso and human zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso throughout the cell cycle and localized to zzso during zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso in zzso cells caused zzso zzso followed by cell death, a zzso similar to that of cells depleted of zzso Loss of zzso also caused multiple zzso zzso including zzso zzso and fractured zzso In the absence of zzso zzso and zzso failed to zzso to zzso during zzso whereas the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was largely zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso of zzso in cells with a compromised zzso function was restored upon zzso zzso Thus, zzso is an essential zzso component that plays a significant role in proper execution of zzso zzso
