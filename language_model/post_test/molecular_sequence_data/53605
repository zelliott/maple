Renal zzso play a major role in zzso of plasma zzso Final products of this zzso include zzso and zzso that must be exported to the zzso for zzso The aim of the present study was to determine whether an zzso zzso is present in the zzso zzso membrane that could mediate this zzso The existence of an zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso by membrane zzso prepared from zzso zzso zzso analysis showed the presence of a single zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso was energized by the imposition of an inwardly directed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and membrane potential (outside zzso zzso resulting in zzso The zzso zzso was inhibited by the presence of zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso membrane proteins with zzso (an zzso zzso zzso as the probe showed the presence of an zzso zzso This zzso was abolished when the zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the present data show the existence of a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso membrane that appears to belong to the zzso family of zzso The function of this zzso appears to be to prevent zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
