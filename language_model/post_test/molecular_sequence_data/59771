zzso unfolding of the small zzso zzso protein zzso was studied by circular zzso zzso and differential scanning zzso The unfolding transition can be described by a zzso two state zzso zzso stability was observed in the region between pH zzso and zzso where zzso unfolds with a melting temperature between zzso to zzso K and an unfolding zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The heat capacity differences between the native and the heat zzso states obtained by differential scanning zzso zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in comparable zzso The zzso reason for the high melting temperature of zzso is the shallow stability curve with a broad free energy zzso corresponding to the relatively small heat capacity change which was zzso The calculated stability curve shows that zzso has, despite of its high melting temperature, an only moderate intrinsic stability, which reaches its maximum zzso 7 zzso at 282 zzso zzso is particularly poorly stabilized zzso 1 zzso at the maximum zzso growth temperature of zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso low specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso values at convergence zzso No significant differences in zzso stability of the partially zzso zzso from zzso zzso and the cloned zzso form of the protein expressed in zzso coli were zzso
