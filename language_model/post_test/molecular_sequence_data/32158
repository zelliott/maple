To characterize the zzso zzso zzso as well as their genetic environment in different zzso of zzso from a patient with repeated urinary tract zzso 

Two zzso of zzso coli and one zzso zzso all with zzso zzso were zzso zzso experiments and restriction zzso length zzso zzso were zzso Cloning of the zzso genes was by zzso restriction and fragments zzso zzso zzso testing was by zzso The genetic environment was zzso by direct sequencing of the DNA surrounding the zzso zzso zzso was performed to study the differences in the zzso gene zzso 

The zzso gene was transferred by zzso from the three clinical zzso which by zzso showed the same zzso The zzso gene and surrounding sequences were zzso an approximately 9 zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso gene was zzso The zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso bearing the zzso gene were lower than those previously zzso Analysis of the DNA surrounding the zzso gene revealed a new genetic structure with two zzso zzso zzso and zzso located immediately upstream of the zzso zzso zzso was located between the zzso gene and zzso and within the zzso and zzso promoter boxes of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed lower zzso gene expression in bacterial zzso with zzso between the promoter zzso 

Data suggest putative in zzso horizontal zzso gene transfer between two different zzso of zzso A new complex structure, zzso was detected upstream of the zzso gene and zzso zzso modulated expression of the zzso gene because its location modified the zzso promoter zzso
