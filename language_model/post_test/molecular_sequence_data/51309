Analysis of well resolved zzso crystal structure data of proteins zzso protein data zzso has been combined with molecular mechanics methods using zzso to determine possible zzso zzso for the sequence zzso which is believed to be involved in interactions of adhesive proteins with the zzso complexes on activated zzso In spite of the very flexible nature of this zzso fragment, only three general classes of structures were zzso In one of them, the zzso and zzso zzso are in zzso zzso while in the other they are separated by distances of greater than 8 zzso Recent literature on the binding affinity of some rigid zzso zzso seems to support the latter class of structures to zzso to the zzso zzso
