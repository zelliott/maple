zzso zzso zzso initially identified as a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of a novel zzso zzso The N zzso of the protein contains a zzso and a zzso domain, two motifs known to be involved in zzso zzso By using the zzso zzso approach, we screened for proteins that interact with the N zzso of zzso The light chain 2 of zzso protein 1 zzso was the only protein identified from the screen that does not contain a type I zzso motif at its extreme C zzso zzso where zzso is a zzso zzso zzso However, the C zzso does conform to a type zzso motif zzso We report here that zzso interacts with zzso via the zzso domain, and the interaction is abolished by zzso in the zzso zzso The specificity of the interaction was confirmed using zzso fusion protein pull-down zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso that are unable to interact with proteins via the zzso loop induced changes in cell zzso and zzso zzso These zzso alter the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso prevent the zzso zzso Furthermore, in cells expressing wild type zzso drug-induced zzso zzso produces changes in cell zzso that are similar to those induced by zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso exchange activity of zzso through interaction with zzso protein light chains may coordinate zzso integrity and the reorganization of zzso zzso This coordinated action of the zzso and zzso zzso is essential for the development and maintenance of zzso zzso
