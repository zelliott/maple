Using a DNA zzso we investigated the effects of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso disruption on gene expression profiles in zzso zzso This strain showed a zzso response in gene expression even under zzso sufficient zzso significant zzso of the zzso zzso genes was zzso Further, the production of alkaline zzso a product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased in the zzso zzso under a zzso sufficient zzso Furthermore, production of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso also increased significantly in the zzso zzso We concluded that host modification by the zzso gene disruption has potential benefit in industrial zzso production using zzso zzso
