zzso immunity against zzso tuberculosis requires both zzso and zzso T zzso In contrast with zzso T cells, few zzso are known that elicit zzso T cells during zzso zzso T cells specific for culture zzso zzso zzso are found in zzso protein zzso positive donors, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso T cells in zzso Using T cells from zzso zzso mice, we identified zzso zzso recognized by zzso T cells and zzso T zzso zzso T cells were detected as early as week 3 after infection and at their peak accounted for up to zzso of zzso T cells in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cells recognizing zzso zzso were zzso recruited to the lungs of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso activity of zzso T cells specific for zzso and zzso proteins was detected in the zzso pulmonary zzso zzso and lungs of infected zzso The zzso activity persisted long term and could be detected 260 d after zzso This paper highlights the zzso function of zzso zzso T cells zzso by zzso tuberculosis infection and demonstrates that large numbers of zzso zzso zzso T cells are recruited to the lung after zzso tuberculosis zzso
