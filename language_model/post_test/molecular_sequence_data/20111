A total of ten infectious zzso virus zzso zzso collected from commercial chickens in Italy in 1999 were characterized by zzso and sequencing of the zzso and N zzso zzso analysis based on partial zzso gene sequences showed that five field viruses clustered together with zzso zzso having zzso zzso identity within the group, and one isolate had very close sequence relationship zzso zzso with zzso zzso These two zzso types have been identified in Italy zzso The other three zzso zzso formed novel zzso detected recently in many countries of Western zzso For one of these zzso zzso zzso which afterwards became the zzso strain, the entire zzso gene was zzso to confirm its zzso In contrast, zzso analysis of more zzso partial N gene zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed different zzso Thus, three zzso zzso of novel zzso zzso which had zzso zzso gene zzso identity with each other, belonged to three separate zzso based on N gene zzso zzso isolate zzso together with zzso which was zzso using zzso gene zzso shared zzso and zzso identity, respectively, in N gene region with vaccine strain zzso Only one of the zzso zzso zzso clustered with the zzso strain sharing zzso partial N gene identity, whereas the other four zzso were genetically distant from them zzso zzso zzso and formed separate zzso zzso The results demonstrated that both zzso and zzso events could contribute to the genetic diversity of the Italian zzso
