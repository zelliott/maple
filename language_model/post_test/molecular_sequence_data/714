The zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso that induced naturally occurring zzso zzso in zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso of zzso could serve as a first hit for the zzso expansion of zzso zzso by promoting cell survival and zzso instability, leading to zzso zzso Furthermore, genes that cooperate with zzso to promote zzso transformation may reside at zzso junctions found in spontaneous zzso zzso from transgenic mice expressing zzso active zzso specifically in T zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso tumors from multiple founder lines exhibited either of two zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso array zzso and zzso analysis were used to delineate the zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso involved zzso zzso zzso The zzso results in robust zzso of the zzso factor gene zzso because of its relocation near the zzso zzso The zzso places the zzso zzso in the vicinity of the zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso can act as the initial hit to promote cell survival and zzso instability, whereas the acquisition of zzso zzso of zzso or zzso leads to zzso
