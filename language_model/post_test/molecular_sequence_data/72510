Delayed zzso rejection zzso is characterized by inflammation and vascular zzso zzso of zzso may occur as a result of tissue factor zzso expression on both activated donor zzso cells zzso and recipient zzso zzso zzso In addition, natural zzso associated with zzso zzso cells may not function adequately across zzso 

In the present study, we examined the interaction of the zzso zzso of zzso with the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cultures in zzso and during rejection of zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso of human Mo with pig zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso and zzso higher induction of Mo zzso and Mo zzso zzso zzso respectively, when compared with zzso with human zzso zzso cells zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso factor X was higher on zzso than on zzso Low levels of zzso for tissue factor zzso inhibitor zzso and its zzso zzso in resting zzso were zzso by stimulation with tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso activity of zzso human zzso zzso to activated factor zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, human activated factor X zzso zzso activity was inhibited by human, but not zzso zzso zzso suggesting functional zzso of zzso for human factor zzso zzso zzso was detected in pig control zzso and after zzso zzso but was lost from the zzso during zzso 

Lack of appropriate human factor zzso zzso by zzso zzso during zzso rejection and loss of zzso zzso zzso during zzso could promote the development of a zzso environment leading to zzso zzso
