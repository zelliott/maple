Model transcripts containing zzso zzso sequences were incubated with a zzso cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso or control zzso Two overlapping fragments derived from the 3' domain of human zzso zzso were specifically zzso although transcripts which spanned the zzso initiation site, the zzso processing site, the zzso end of zzso and both zzso of zzso yielded no protected zzso The sequence of these fragments was determined using a novel technique in which the zzso zzso was zzso with zzso total transcript serving as an internal zzso The fragments zzso derive from zzso zzso and zzso of human zzso and are adjacent to the zzso zzso Protection most likely involves the zzso zzso since it is sensitive to zzso of the extract with zzso zzso zzso between zzso and this zzso region is zzso zzso in species ranging from human to zzso zzso The possible significance of this finding is zzso
