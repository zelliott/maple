zzso protein zzso have a central role in cell cycle zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 2 and 3 are required for DNA zzso zzso of the zzso pole body and bud zzso These three independent processes occur simultaneously in late zzso when the cells reach a critical size, an event known as zzso At least one of the three zzso is necessary for zzso zzso is believed to activate zzso and zzso which can then stimulate their own zzso by means of a positive feedback zzso They (or zzso also activate another pair of zzso zzso and 6, involved in initiating S zzso Little is known about the role of zzso in zzso pole body zzso and zzso We report here the isolation of a gene zzso that codes for a zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and is necessary for budding only in zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso and zzso may have a direct role in bud zzso
