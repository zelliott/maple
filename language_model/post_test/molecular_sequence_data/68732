Multiple genes coding for human zzso have been identified zzso zzso and here zzso zzso zzso to a gastrointestinal zzso are zzso The zzso were made to a synthetic zzso representing a single repeat in the core protein of the variable number of tandem repeat zzso Using the zzso overlapping peptides zzso on zzso pins, different binding sites were detected by five zzso 2 zzso These contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (one zzso and zzso The repeat region of zzso essentially is zzso but contain useful zzso zzso This information will be useful for studying the structure and function of zzso
