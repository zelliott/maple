The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of this type of zzso zzso to generate zzso insulin producing cells in zzso All steps of cloning were confirmed using restriction zzso After the zzso zzso stem cells gradually began to change their zzso and showed differentiation into zzso like zzso zzso results confirmed the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in differentiated zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso showed the concentration of zzso in zzso like zzso zzso analysis validated the insulin zzso of zzso like structures which in the zzso medium zzso was zzso fold higher than that zzso in the zzso medium zzso Our results demonstrated that mouse zzso stem cells can be differentiated into effective zzso insulin producing cells through our new zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene in zzso This new zzso zzso could be suggested as an effective candidate for using in gene therapy of zzso zzso
