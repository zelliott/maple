zzso zzso degradation was used to obtain zzso and internal zzso acid sequences from a zzso protein in isolated zzso zzso outer zzso zzso The resulting sequences enabled us to zzso amplify from zzso zzso DNA a zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso The complete zzso sequence of the gene was determined from fragments amplified by long-distance zzso zzso extension verified the assigned zzso start of the open reading frame zzso and putative upstream promoter zzso The zzso zzso a highly basic zzso zzso zzso protein which contained an zzso zzso leader zzso terminated by a signal zzso I zzso zzso The mature protein contained seven zzso spaced copies (as well as an eighth incomplete zzso of a zzso repeat zzso a motif previously identified in a number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso was designated zzso zzso zzso repeat protein zzso Although zzso zzso phase zzso showed that zzso was zzso cell zzso studies showed that most of the zzso was associated with the zzso membrane complex rather than being freely soluble in the zzso zzso zzso studies showed that syphilis patients develop a weak zzso response to the zzso Lastly, the zzso zzso gene was mapped to a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which also contains the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is currently zzso however, zzso and/or zzso interactions zzso by its zzso motifs may facilitate interactions between components of the zzso zzso cell zzso
