zzso zzso and cell cycle are connected in the zzso pathogen zzso zzso Here we report the characterization of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by the gene zzso and the two zzso zzso present in this zzso zzso by the genes zzso and zzso These zzso are not redundant and appears to be essential for cell zzso The analysis of conditional zzso in zzso genes indicates that zzso is required for zzso to S and zzso to M zzso while zzso is specifically required for the onset of zzso Both zzso and zzso carry functional destruction boxes, and expression of derivatives lacking zzso arrested cell cycle at a zzso zzso High levels of zzso generated cells with anomalous DNA content that were hypersensitive to zzso zzso In contrast, high levels of zzso induce premature entry into zzso suggesting that zzso is a zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso affects zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we have found that appropriate levels of zzso zzso are critical for a successful zzso zzso strains with half a dose of zzso or high level of zzso expression are impaired at distinct stages in the infection zzso These data reinforces the connections between cell cycle, zzso and zzso in this zzso zzso
