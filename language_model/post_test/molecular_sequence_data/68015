Two hundred zzso zzso from the zzso gene region of 16 zzso of Japanese encephalitis zzso virus from the southern and northern regions of Vietnam obtained during the period zzso were zzso and compared with each other and with wild zzso virus strains from China and zzso The 16 Vietnamese zzso showed low rates of genetic evolution zzso or zzso zzso and were classified into one zzso with an overall similarity of zzso or zzso zzso including the Japanese zzso strain taken as reference, and earlier isolated strains from Japan zzso 1935) and China zzso 1949 and zzso zzso the zzso strains used to derive zzso zzso The implications of the close genetic relationship among Vietnamese strains of zzso virus analyzed in our study in relation to their epidemiology and evolution are zzso
