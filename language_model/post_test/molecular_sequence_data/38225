The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that dramatically shortens period length of zzso rhythms in Syrian zzso We report the molecular identification of the zzso locus using genetically directed zzso difference analysis to define a region of zzso zzso in zzso with both the mouse and human zzso The zzso locus is zzso by zzso zzso I zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso In zzso expression and functional studies of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that the zzso zzso has a markedly reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, in zzso zzso can interact with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso is deficient in its ability to zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is an zzso of zzso zzso and propose a mechanism by which the zzso leads to the observed zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
