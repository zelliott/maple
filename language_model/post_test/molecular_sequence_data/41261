The zzso of a large number of zzso bacterial pathogens depends on the type III zzso zzso system, which zzso select bacterial proteins into host zzso An essential component of the zzso zzso system is zzso a zzso inner membrane zzso We report here the zzso resolution structure of the zzso domain of zzso called zzso The structure confirms that zzso consists of a zzso zzso fold, which in many but not all cases specifies binding to zzso zzso however, lacks the structural properties associated with zzso binding and thus most likely interacts with partners in a zzso zzso zzso comparison highlighted two loop regions, zzso and zzso as potential sites of zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso had no deleterious effects on protein structure or stability but zzso zzso in a dominant negative zzso To gain insight into the function of zzso and zzso we identified proteins associated with zzso by affinity zzso coupled to mass zzso The zzso zzso was found associated with zzso zzso as was the zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso substitution zzso zzso with more zzso than did zzso zzso These substitution zzso also zzso with zzso (the specific zzso for zzso the putative zzso component zzso and the ruler component zzso whereas zzso zzso did zzso These results suggest that zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso disrupted the zzso of zzso from zzso leading to the zzso of a large protein complex that stalled the zzso zzso
