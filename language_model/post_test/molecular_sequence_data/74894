The zzso zzso factor 4 gene encodes a nuclear protein zzso also known as zzso and zzso that belongs to a family of zzso factors containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso can be detected in embryonic stem cells as well as in adult stem cells, such as bone zzso zzso stem zzso zzso of zzso is zzso zzso with stem cell differentiation and loss of expression leading to zzso A role for maintaining zzso and zzso of embryonic stem cells is ascribed to zzso as a zzso zzso zzso describing zzso expression in differentiated cells, including peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso and adult stem cells, as well as cancer cells, must be interpreted with zzso In several publications, zzso has been ascribed a function in maintaining zzso of adult stem zzso In contrast, other publications reported zzso expression in human tumor zzso Here, we zzso the recent findings on zzso expression and present possibilities and reasons why several false positive results on zzso expression still occur in the recent zzso Also, simple solutions are provided to avoid these positive zzso
