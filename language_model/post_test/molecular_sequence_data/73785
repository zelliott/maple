Mouse zzso zzso protein zzso is a major zzso product of the zzso zzso Although it is a common zzso protein among zzso generally, the function of zzso has yet to be zzso Here we report a comparison of the DNA coding sequences and putative zzso acid sequences they determine for the three common zzso of the Alpha zzso gene zzso zzso that appear to be diagnostic for the three subspecies of zzso zzso Three other unique sequences were found in the species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the six sequences shows that 8 of the 20 base substitution sites produce a high degree of zzso in zzso acids 32, 33, 36, and 39, a zzso that creates unique sequence combinations in each species and zzso We compare the possibilities that selection or genetic drift caused this unusual zzso and argue that selection is the more likely zzso We speculate on the potential significance of this with respect to the proposal that zzso is involved in zzso mate kin zzso
