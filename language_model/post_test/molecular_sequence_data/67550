The zzso interactions of zzso in type 1 copper proteins control the physical characteristics of the zzso We tuned the zzso of a de zzso designed blue copper protein with a zzso bundle zzso The designed protein zzso bound various zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso exhibiting a blue or green zzso The zzso spectral bands were observed at approximately 600 zzso and approximately 450 zzso with the A zzso zzso ratios between zzso and zzso The stronger zzso interaction shifted the geometry of the type 1 copper site from zzso zzso geometry zzso zzso toward a zzso geometry zzso zzso zzso zzso spectral analyses showed that the zzso type had the zzso zzso bond, similar to that of zzso The zzso type exhibited features similar to those of zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso type exhibited features similar to those of zzso zzso zzso
