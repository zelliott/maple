zzso metabolism and the role of zzso zzso were investigated in the fruit zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso during zzso Acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities were monitored and compared with the levels of zzso and reducing zzso Among these zzso zzso zzso showed the highest activities during the last stage of zzso and zzso development and this activity paralleled closely the zzso of zzso in these zzso at this zzso zzso zzso in fruits was studied by zzso experiments with zzso and revealed high rates of zzso turnover in zzso and zzso zzso Additional feeding experiments with zzso showed that leaf photosynthesis contributed more to seed development than the zzso in terms of zzso supply to the zzso Sugar analysis, feeding experiments, and zzso studies indicated that the zzso plays an important role in this downloading zzso It was observed that the zzso presents a transient zzso of starch which is zzso as the seed zzso Two full-length zzso zzso and zzso and the complete gene sequence of the latter were also zzso They zzso zzso zzso zzso that are zzso zzso indicating their involvement in different zzso functions during cherry zzso zzso expression patterns were observed for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulated mainly during the early development of zzso and zzso as well as during zzso growing zzso whereas those of zzso paralleled zzso zzso activity in the last weeks of zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso zzso plays an important role in sugar metabolism during zzso zzso in the coffee zzso
