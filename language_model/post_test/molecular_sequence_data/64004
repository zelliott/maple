A human zzso library constructed by utilizing a zzso display system was used for the isolation of human zzso with zzso activity specific for human zzso In the library, the zzso form of an zzso fused to truncated zzso is expressed on the zzso zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used as zzso Twelve different clones were zzso Based on their zzso acid zzso they were classified into three zzso Three representative zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso particles zzso and zzso and zzso zzso protein produced from zzso zzso indicated that zzso and zzso bind to zzso and that zzso binds to zzso The zzso zzso recognized by each of the three human zzso might be human specific, since all of the zzso zzso resistant to mouse zzso zzso zzso previously prepared were neutralized by the human zzso obtained zzso After conversion from the zzso form of an zzso into zzso zzso the zzso activities of these three clones toward various human zzso strains were zzso The zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity toward human zzso with either the zzso or zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso showed zzso against zzso with the zzso as well as the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso neutralized only human zzso with the zzso zzso The concentration of zzso required for 50% zzso ranged from zzso to 20 zzso zzso
