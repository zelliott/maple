A zzso gene whose product is zzso with zzso and the zzso zzso is then zzso to form zzso (see zzso zzso zzso Trends zzso zzso 10, zzso for zzso has now been shown to form zzso hence the corresponding gene is designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Davis, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso In the present study, we show that the expression of this unique zzso gene is governed by at least three upstream regulatory zzso In initial studies, the relative efficiencies of zzso of the human, zzso chicken, and zzso zzso zzso genes were compared in zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso in zzso cell zzso The zzso gene was zzso more actively zzso both in zzso and in zzso than the human and rabbit zzso whereas the chicken gene was poorly zzso Exchange of the zzso regions of the zzso and chicken zzso which have identical gene zzso reversed their levels of transcription, demonstrating that a regulatory site or sites exist upstream of these zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene and its zzso sequence show in in zzso zzso that 1) the level of zzso is reduced substantially when a zzso stretch that is immediately upstream of a zzso box in the zzso region is zzso 2) the level of zzso is virtually abolished when the zzso box is zzso and 3) deletions up to and further upstream of the zzso region do not affect the level of zzso The same zzso when used in in zzso zzso demonstrate a zzso in expression with the deletion removing the zzso region, a further zzso in expression with the deletion removing the zzso box, but the most pronounced reduction in expression was observed with a deletion removing an zzso region between zzso zzso and zzso Thus, a regulatory site was identified in zzso which was not detected in zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene is determined by multiple upstream regulatory zzso
