zzso zzso comprise zzso agents of debilitating or life-threatening tropical zzso The limited capacity of these zzso to cope with zzso stress has been discussed as a target area for therapeutic approaches but success has been hampered by a lack of comprehension of their peculiar zzso defense system depending on the unique zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso zzso metabolism in zzso zzso is zzso by two distinct proteins working in zzso One is zzso a unique protein which, apart from a zzso sequence that resembles the zzso zzso zzso only shows low similarity to zzso proteins of bacteria and zzso The second component is zzso which can be classified as a member of the zzso family of zzso The two proteins have been zzso to zzso and shown to be essential for the zzso removal of zzso By means of selective zzso of the zzso proteins the flux of reduction zzso from zzso to zzso zzso and finally to the zzso was zzso zzso proved to be a moderately efficient zzso with broad zzso The rate zzso for the reaction of the reduced protein with zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The apparent rate constant for the zzso of reduced zzso by zzso was in the range of zzso zzso zzso zzso This newly discovered zzso zzso adds two further candidates to the list of potential targets for zzso zzso
