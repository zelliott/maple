Channel gating and zzso zzso of the influenza A virus zzso channel result from complex zzso interactions involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the outside of the virus zzso zzso which opens the zzso gate and allows one or more zzso to move into the virus zzso The zzso gate gives rise to a strong asymmetry in the zzso favoring rapid zzso flux only when the outside is at acid zzso Here, we show that the zzso currents recorded for zzso of zzso including zzso found in the zzso strain, lose this zzso Moreover, zzso and MD simulations show that the zzso induce a zzso change similar to that induced by zzso of zzso at low zzso and decrease the structural stability of the zzso seal associated with the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is able to determine two important properties of the zzso zzso zzso
