A synthetic zzso containing zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso promoted zzso of zzso breast zzso cells when immobilized and inhibited zzso of the same cells to zzso when added in zzso zzso to this zzso was enhanced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor I and was inhibited by an zzso zzso zzso zzso The soluble zzso inhibited zzso of cells to the immobilized zzso zzso or spreading on intact zzso but at the same zzso did not inhibit attachment or spreading on type IV collagen or zzso zzso of several zzso in the zzso zzso with Ala zzso abolished or diminished the zzso activity of the zzso in solution, but only substitution of zzso completely zzso the adhesive activity of the immobilized zzso The essential zzso for activity of the zzso as a soluble inhibitor are zzso zzso and zzso but zzso zzso enhance the zzso activity of this core zzso either by altering the zzso of the active sequence or by interacting with the zzso This functional sequence is zzso in all known zzso zzso sequences and in zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso also inhibited zzso of zzso cells to the zzso zzso zzso which contains a potential zzso sequence zzso and is derived from a similar position in a zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso fragments also localized zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of this region, which contain the active zzso
