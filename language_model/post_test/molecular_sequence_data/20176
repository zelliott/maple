Open reading frame 2 proteins zzso from zzso zzso 4, zzso and human zzso 1, zzso zzso E virus zzso having zzso identity at zzso acid level were expressed using zzso expression zzso zzso of zzso based on the two proteins yielded identical results when sequential serum samples from monkeys and pigs zzso infected with zzso 1 and 4 zzso respectively, were zzso zzso from patients zzso zzso zzso suffering from zzso non-B zzso during outbreaks of the disease and 180 zzso from apparently healthy children were screened by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a widely used commercial test for zzso zzso zzso of all three tests in detecting zzso and zzso zzso in healthy children was zzso Excellent correlation was noted in detecting both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso and zzso zzso were zzso When compared with zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso identified 34 and 18 additional zzso respectively, in zzso and zzso zzso tests showing comparatively less sensitivity of the commercial zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in zzso detection was zzso and zzso respectively, with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso between zzso zzso and zzso decreased further to zzso when 129 human samples from recent zzso zzso zzso were tested for zzso Similar results were obtained when sequential samples from 11 zzso E patients were zzso zzso of serum samples from 137 sporadic zzso non-B zzso cases further confirmed the superiority of the zzso and zzso zzso All zzso zzso samples from sporadic cases belonged to zzso 1 confirming zzso of type 4 human zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso for detecting both zzso 1 and 4 zzso zzso
