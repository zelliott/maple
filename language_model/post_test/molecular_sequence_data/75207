DNA fragments of zzso zzso containing the zzso gene were cloned from zzso coli zzso and from four spontaneous zzso zzso which showed various levels of resistance to zzso The zzso gene was situated at about 4 zzso in front of the zzso gene and transcribed zzso on the zzso coli zzso It zzso a zzso of 875 zzso acids with a molecular weight of about zzso The four zzso zzso were located zzso close to one another within a small region near the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso changes from C to zzso from C to G, from G to T and from G to T at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, resulting in zzso acid changes from zzso to zzso from zzso to zzso from zzso to His and from Ala to zzso at zzso acids 83, 83, 106 and 67, zzso These zzso were situated in the relatively zzso regions of the zzso zzso and close to zzso at zzso acid 122 which has been shown to be the site zzso bound to zzso
