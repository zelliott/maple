The zzso zzso coli zzso zzso protein becomes zzso zzso in host cells and displays an increase in apparent molecular zzso The interaction of zzso with the zzso outer membrane zzso zzso triggers zzso nucleation beneath the adherent zzso The zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso is not zzso zzso In this paper, zzso zzso zzso is shown to be essential for zzso nucleation activity, but not for the increase in apparent molecular mass observed in target zzso zzso zzso had no role in zzso molecular mass shift, indicating additional host zzso Analysis of zzso zzso indicates that zzso modification functions to direct zzso correct zzso from the zzso into the host zzso zzso analysis identified zzso zzso participating in zzso association with the host zzso modification and zzso zzso zzso was found to bind a zzso region zzso within zzso that zzso and sequence analysis suggests is located in an zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences exist in zzso which also bind zzso zzso this study provides definitive evidence for the importance of zzso zzso for zzso zzso function and reveals differences in the zzso of zzso and zzso The data also suggest a mechanism for zzso zzso into the host zzso as well as providing clues to the mode of zzso zzso
