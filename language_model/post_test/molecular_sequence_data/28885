zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso bonds in zzso yielding zzso and the respective zzso While zzso zzso activity has not been detected in zzso cells, many zzso zzso rely on zzso zzso activity for salvage of zzso and/or zzso from their zzso In contrast, zzso zzso is the key zzso of zzso salvage in zzso hosts and many other zzso We show here that the open reading frame zzso zzso of zzso zzso carries the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this gene in a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, which is also deficient in zzso zzso zzso leads to the inability of the zzso to zzso zzso as the sole source of zzso zzso extracts of strains zzso zzso show increased zzso activity only with zzso and zzso but no activity with zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to restore growth on zzso Growth can also be restored by expression of a human zzso zzso zzso zzso strains expressing zzso zzso or host zzso could therefore become useful tools in drug screens for specific zzso
