Cellular zzso control is often zzso by zzso and reduction of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso where zzso and zzso zzso play as electron donors for the oxidized zzso Despite the importance of zzso interactions between the electron donor and zzso zzso there has been no structural information for the interaction of zzso or zzso with natural target zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of a novel zzso influenza zzso zzso hybrid zzso determined at zzso zzso The structure reveals that hybrid zzso forms a tightly associated zzso where active sites of zzso and zzso zzso of different zzso interact with each zzso The zzso interface comprises specific charge interactions surrounded by weak zzso providing insight into the target recognition mechanism of zzso The zzso structure also exhibits a flexible active site and alternative zzso zzso which appear to facilitate the electron transfer from zzso to zzso zzso zzso of electron donor binding surfaces in zzso proteins revealed by an analysis based on the structural information explain the electron donor zzso of various zzso zzso
