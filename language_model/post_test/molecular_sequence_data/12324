The zzso protein zzso a major zzso of zzso zzso is present in all zzso zzso strains tested and elicits an zzso response in infected zzso By screening a zzso zzso library of zzso DNA fragments of zzso zzso strain zzso in zzso coli zzso cells with zzso raised against zzso zzso a zzso zzso with a zzso insert expressing an zzso protein of 29 zzso was zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that the insert contains two complete open reading frames zzso and zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso composition and zzso of the zzso mature protein are similar to those determined for zzso zzso The first 21 zzso resemble a signal zzso Gene bank searches indicated zzso identity with protein export protein zzso of zzso zzso and zzso identity with zzso maturation protein precursor zzso of zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso is highly zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso begins 2 zzso after the last zzso of zzso and encodes a putative protein of 353 zzso with zzso identity with zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The sequence arrangement suggests that these two genes form an zzso
