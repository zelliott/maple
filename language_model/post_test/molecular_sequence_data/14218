zzso bonds within zzso proteins play a key role in the zzso performance of wheat zzso In the present study, zzso bonds of wheat zzso proteins were identified by using a new liquid zzso zzso zzso technique with alternating electron transfer zzso zzso zzso zzso Wheat flour was partially zzso with zzso zzso zzso 37 zzso 16 zzso and the digest was subjected to zzso with alternating zzso zzso Whereas zzso provided zzso fragments with intact zzso bonds, zzso of zzso bonds was preferred over zzso backbone zzso in zzso The simultaneous observation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the mass zzso not only provided distinct interpretation with high confidence but also simplified the conventional approach for determination of zzso bonds, which often requires two separate experiments with and without chemical zzso By application of the new method 14 zzso peptides were zzso Eight peptides confirmed previously established zzso bonds within zzso zzso and the other six zzso peptides were identified for the first zzso One of the newly identified zzso peptides represented a zzso zzso between high molecular weight zzso zzso This type of zzso which has been zzso as an integral part of zzso models published zzso has now been proven zzso for the first zzso From the six remaining zzso peptides zzso zzso bonds between zzso zzso and low molecular weight zzso zzso were zzso
