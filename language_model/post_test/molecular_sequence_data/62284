zzso binding is so far the best characterized property of the prion zzso This interaction has been mapped to the zzso domain of the prion protein where multiple His zzso occur largely embedded within the repetitive zzso sequence known as zzso When zzso interaction is studied using a solution of full-length bovine prion protein containing six zzso at protein zzso above 25 zzso a drastic increase in solution zzso is observed due to the formation of zzso zzso complexes that appear as zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso consist of a single layer of protein molecules zzso by zzso zzso zzso formation is a cooperative process that proceeds by nucleation of protein molecules with a zzso site occupancy of above zzso These results support the hypothesis that the zzso domain of prion protein is a zzso binding module that promotes zzso zzso and suggest the existence of zzso zzso zzso
