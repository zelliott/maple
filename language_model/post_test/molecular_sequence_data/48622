zzso S zzso is an zzso plasma protein whose zzso is associated with increased risk of zzso zzso zzso directly zzso zzso generation by the blood zzso pathways by several mechanisms, including by binding zzso factors zzso Va and zzso To identify zzso sequences that mediate zzso of zzso activity, zzso and synthetic peptides based on zzso sequence were prepared and employed in plasma zzso zzso zzso component zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso In the absence of activated protein C, zzso zzso zzso zzso shortened zzso zzso in normal plasma but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso also blocked zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity in zzso component zzso in the absence or presence of zzso and inhibited binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso mapping identified zzso region zzso zzso of zzso as this zzso zzso A zzso representing zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity in a zzso manner, with 50% zzso observed at 11 zzso zzso whereas a zzso with a zzso acid sequence of zzso was zzso zzso but not zzso bound specifically to the zzso zzso representing zzso zzso and the zzso inhibited binding of zzso to zzso zzso These data zzso zzso zzso zzso as a binding site for zzso that zzso at least in part, the direct zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso
