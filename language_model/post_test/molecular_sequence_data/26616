zzso zzso is an emerging pathogen that is increasingly recognized as a relevant cause of human lung infection in zzso zzso zzso This highly zzso zzso is an exception within the rapidly growing zzso which are mainly zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as either a smooth zzso or a rough zzso colony zzso which is of clinical importance as R zzso are associated with more severe and persistent zzso To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind the zzso zzso we zzso S and R zzso of three zzso zzso pairs using an unbiased approach involving zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This revealed different small zzso deletions zzso or single zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster zzso or zzso in the three R zzso consistent with the zzso differences identified within this zzso locus that is implicated in the synthesis and transport of zzso zzso In contrast to previous reports, the identification of clearly defined genetic zzso responsible for the loss of zzso or transport makes a frequent switching back-and-forth between smooth and rough zzso in zzso highly unlikely, which is important for our understanding of persistent zzso zzso
