The zzso region of the human zzso zzso gene contains a zzso sequence that is zzso in the zzso gene from mouse and located within a promoter that is activated under hypoxic conditions such as zzso Using a zzso containing this sequence in DNA mobility shift zzso we found that specific zzso proteins were induced in mouse kidney zzso under anemic zzso Using synthetic zzso zzso that contain this zzso the essential binding site was defined to be the zzso to zzso region upstream of the zzso initiation site in the human zzso zzso By DNA affinity zzso using a column with the immobilized zzso zzso two zzso binding proteins with apparent molecular masses of 55 and 45 zzso were identified in the zzso of mouse kidney and liver under anemic zzso These binding proteins were also induced during zzso zzso
