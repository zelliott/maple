The structural features of zzso binding sites on zzso transport proteins have received limited zzso An zzso that recognizes limited regions of zzso and can zzso in binding zzso certain zzso transport proteins was used as a model to zzso potential zzso acid zzso relationships that might define putative zzso contact zzso Analysis of the structure of this zzso has allowed us to identify sequence relationships among several zzso selective transport zzso A zzso zzso database was employed to re-examine sequence zzso among these zzso transport zzso A search of the protein sequence zzso identified representative zzso acid tracts among zzso sensitive proteins involving zzso zzso that might be involved in interacting with zzso Computer models of sites within zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso reflective of these zzso tracts indicate that zzso probably spans two zzso for interaction with the zzso zzso zzso analysis of this zzso zzso zzso appears to mimic some of the salient features of zzso binding sites on these zzso
