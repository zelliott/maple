In zzso zzso zzso in zzso processing is zzso by a large protein complex zzso which contains independent binding sites for each of the transcribed zzso The zzso complex exhibits no zzso activity but dramatically alters the efficiency and specificity of the zzso zzso leading to the complete removal of the 3' zzso Furthermore, the affinity of zzso protein for zzso 3' zzso zzso closely with in zzso effects on zzso processing, and changes which disrupt zzso protein binding also inhibit zzso zzso zzso at the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso The observations indicate that, in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso complex, zzso by the zzso zzso zzso is not restricted to the known intermediate sites but also is directed at the 3' end of the zzso zzso
