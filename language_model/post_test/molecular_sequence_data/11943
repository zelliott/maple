When zzso zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso P proteins are zzso and the products reacted with zzso the zzso P protein is also selected because this protein is found as an zzso The zzso was determined to be a zzso by zzso studies in which increasing amounts of zzso versus zzso protein were zzso and these findings were extended to zzso virus, a member of the zzso zzso The region of the zzso protein responsible for the zzso was localized to zzso zzso Computer analysis of the 13 zzso P proteins in the database revealed that all but one are predicted to form coiled coils in this region, the first of only two regions that can be aligned throughout the entire virus zzso The predicted zzso region of the zzso virus P zzso when grafted onto the zzso of the normally zzso La zzso led to the efficient zzso of this reporter zzso The predicted zzso region of these P proteins thus appears to be sufficient for zzso
