The zzso family of DNA zzso is zzso from zzso to zzso Although the zzso zzso of family members are well zzso the zzso zzso of these proteins are zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes two zzso family members, zzso and zzso that have very different zzso To determine if the zzso zzso of zzso contributes to its role in promoting fork progression at zzso discrete zzso sites, we constructed a deletion series that lacked portions of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of cells expressing zzso that lacked all or most of the zzso zzso were indistinguishable from those of zzso zzso zzso deletion derivatives that lacked smaller portions of the zzso zzso were also zzso but the extent of replication pausing at zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso was not as great as in zzso zzso zzso only 62 zzso acids from the middle of the zzso zzso affected only zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing a fusion protein consisting of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain displayed defects similar to zzso zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso zzso of zzso is essential for zzso zzso However, the zzso domain of zzso also contributes to its functional zzso
