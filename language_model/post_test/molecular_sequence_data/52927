zzso zzso strain zzso is able to metabolize zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso via a route analogous to the upper zzso of the zzso zzso We report the cloning and characterization of a zzso alcohol zzso gene zzso which encodes the zzso for the zzso of zzso alcohol and zzso alcohol to zzso and zzso zzso The gene is located downstream of the previously reported zzso gene zzso zzso bears no similarity to the analogous zzso zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso protein either in its zzso being zzso independent and requiring zzso via zzso electron transfer, or in its deduced zzso acid zzso It does, however, have significant similarity in its zzso acid sequence to other zzso alcohol zzso and contains signature patterns characteristic of type III zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is transcribed during growth on zzso although apparently not as part of the same transcript as the other zzso zzso The zzso specificity of the zzso expressed from the cloned and zzso gene was similar to the activity expressed from strain zzso grown on zzso providing evidence that zzso is the previously unidentified gene in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region around the zzso genes suggests that one or more zzso events have been involved in the formation of their current zzso
