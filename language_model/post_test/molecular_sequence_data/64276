zzso zzso change is a general strategy for controlling protein zzso In this work, we demonstrate the relationships between zzso binding and zzso stability using a previously designed zzso zzso which zzso a zzso change upon zzso zzso To investigate the effect of stabilization of the zzso structure on the zzso change, we also created a novel zzso zzso into which zzso are introduced to increase its stability over that of zzso The chemical zzso experiments clarified that zzso is more stable than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and that the stability of zzso is almost the same as that of zzso The zzso binding zzso shows that the affinity of zzso for zzso is weaker than that for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A large part of the increased value of free energy in stability zzso to the decreased value of free energy in zzso zzso indicating that the stability of the zzso structure directly affects the zzso zzso The zzso experiments also reveal that zzso zzso the zzso of both zzso From the zzso linkage, zzso is thought to bind to the unfolded state with high zzso These results suggest that the binding of zzso to the unfolded state is an important factor in the zzso change as well as the stability of the zzso and zzso zzso
