The orientation of zzso proteins in the zzso zzso membrane is largely determined by the charged zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain and is influenced by the folding properties of the zzso zzso However, these features are not generally sufficient to ensure a unique zzso The zzso role of the zzso signal domain was studied in zzso by expressing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso By replacing the zzso zzso segment of zzso and zzso zzso by stretches of zzso zzso zzso we found that the length and zzso of the zzso sequence significantly affected protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was favored by long, zzso sequences and zzso of the zzso zzso by short zzso The zzso contributions of the zzso domain, the zzso charges, and a zzso zzso portion were zzso In combination these zzso were sufficient to achieve unique membrane zzso in either zzso
