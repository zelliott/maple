There are major changes in the sensitivity of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso toward the zzso zzso zzso zzso during the female zzso cycle, as revealed by measurement of juvenile hormone zzso zzso in zzso zzso from recently zzso adult females show only zzso zzso at 10 zzso zzso falling to a minimum of less than zzso on day 5 at the peak of spontaneous zzso synthesis in zzso The decline in zzso synthesis observed in zzso females is accompanied by a dramatic increase to zzso zzso zzso sensitivity at 10 zzso by day zzso Then sensitivity slowly wanes during subsequent zzso and pregnancy to the levels typical of zzso and virgin zzso Full zzso studies reveal a second level of response at zzso 1 zzso which resembles the pattern obtained from whole brain zzso We conclude that zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is correlated with the preparation for zzso and we suggest that 1000 times higher doses give a zzso with related zzso zzso that zzso important sensitivity at other development zzso
