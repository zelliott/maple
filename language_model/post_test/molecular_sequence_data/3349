A new zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso 34, was cloned from zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso 6 isolated from zzso contents of cultured zzso zzso zzso The zzso containing cloned zzso 34, could grow in broth containing 25 zzso of drug per zzso with 10 zzso zzso zzso 34 zzso an open reading frame zzso 154 zzso acids zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso was zzso to sequences of several bacterial zzso zzso zzso which act in zzso zzso salvage zzso zzso binding site zzso and the active site were highly zzso in zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso 34 encodes a new zzso zzso zzso
