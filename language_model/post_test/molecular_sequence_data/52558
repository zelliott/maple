zzso cells contain various types of zzso Core 20 S zzso zzso 20 S below) have two binding sites for the regulatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes are known as 26 S zzso and are zzso machines that degrade cell zzso zzso is found both in previously described complexes of the type zzso zzso and in complexes that also contain zzso as zzso zzso We refer to the latter as zzso zzso The relative amounts of the various types of zzso in zzso extracts were determined by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso accounted for about a fourth of all zzso in the zzso Association of zzso and zzso proved to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso without zzso as do 26 S zzso In contrast, the zzso complex zzso zzso was incapable of degrading zzso zzso a major zzso zzso zzso appreciably enhanced the zzso degradation in zzso and zzso cells through induction of the hybrid zzso which may also be responsible for the zzso processing of zzso zzso Taken together, we report here for the first time the existence of two types of zzso zzso the 26 S zzso and the hybrid zzso which appear to share the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
