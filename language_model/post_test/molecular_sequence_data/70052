zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein that is anchored to the zzso zzso by a single zzso zzso zzso located near the zzso zzso of the zzso In zzso zzso zzso provides electrons for fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso High level expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was achieved using the zzso zzso promoter and a synthetic zzso zzso zzso In order to accommodate the markedly increased amount of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso cell proliferated its nuclear zzso As many as 20 pairs of stacked zzso could be observed to partially zzso the zzso This zzso arrangement of membrane around the nucleus is known as a zzso In an effort to understand which part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the membrane anchor or the soluble zzso domain, which is competent in electron transfer, provided the signal for the de zzso membrane zzso a series of studies, including zzso zzso was zzso The results of these experiments demonstrated that the inactive zzso zzso form of the zzso protein stimulates membrane proliferation to the same extent as the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso forms of zzso zzso did not induce membrane zzso These data demonstrate that membrane proliferation is a consequence of the cell's ability to monitor the level of membrane proteins and to compensate for zzso in these levels rather than the result of the ability of the extra zzso zzso to catalyze synthesis of extra zzso that had to be zzso in new zzso zzso zzso studies of the membrane binding domain of zzso zzso provided additional clues about the nature of the signal for membrane zzso Replacement of the membrane anchor by a zzso nonsense sequence of 22 zzso gave rise to a zzso protein that triggered membrane zzso The conclusion from these experiments is clear; the signal for membrane proliferation does not reside in some specific zzso acid sequence but instead in the zzso properties of the zzso Interestingly, these zzso are somewhat diminished in quantity and have a slightly altered zzso compared to those induced by the zzso zzso It was also observed that disruption of the putative alpha zzso of the membrane anchor by an zzso zzso which gives rise to two sequential zzso at positions 115 and 116 results in a protein with diminished capacity to induce membrane zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
