Dock, the zzso zzso of zzso is an zzso protein that is known to function in zzso guidance zzso in the fly including proper development of zzso connections in zzso cells and zzso tracking in zzso zzso To develop a better understanding of zzso guidance at the molecular level, we zzso proteins in a complex with the zzso domain of zzso from fly Schneider 2 zzso A protein designated zzso was identified and shown to be a zzso zzso with sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso can be zzso with zzso and zzso from fly cell zzso The zzso responsible for the in zzso interaction between zzso zzso and zzso were identified, and direct zzso interactions between complex members were zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso for zzso in zzso and in zzso and define one of the major in zzso sites of zzso zzso to be zzso zzso is located within the zzso domain of zzso placing it in an important position for regulating the binding of zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso by zzso diminishes the zzso zzso domain interaction with the zzso zzso protein while enabling zzso to associate with zzso Furthermore, when zzso is zzso to zzso or zzso the binding to zzso zzso protein is zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso by zzso targets this sorting zzso to a protein complex that includes Dock, an zzso protein important for zzso zzso
