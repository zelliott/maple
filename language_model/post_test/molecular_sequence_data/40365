Three zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso of strains belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso or related zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso strains of the 15 species of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso trees generated using these gene sequences confirmed the existence of two zzso groups within the zzso zzso These groups clustered separately in trees constructed using zzso sequences of the three zzso indicating that the zzso zzso should not remain a single zzso and should be split, as suggested zzso zzso sequence analysis zzso of the three zzso genes also proved useful for species differentiation in the family zzso It also suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso better known as the type and only strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a distinct species in the zzso zzso and is not a true zzso zzso zzso In previous studies, this strain showed less than zzso DNA zzso to the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso nearest relatives, and could be distinguished from them zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso DNA zzso data supported its zzso within a distinct zzso The name zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
