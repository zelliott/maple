The first zzso zzso coding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to human receptors zzso 1 zzso and zzso 2 zzso was isolated from zzso of common zzso zzso zzso The analyses showed that the full-length zzso is 1935 zzso long and is predicted to zzso a zzso zzso acid protein (named zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and theoretical zzso point zzso zzso comparisons between zzso and zzso proteins from human or mouse have approximately 38% identity and zzso zzso zzso clusters with zzso zzso proteins and is a first characterization of proteins containing zzso domain in zzso zzso differences were found between the zzso zzso levels in zzso of healthy zzso and those naturally infected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Down regulated expression of the zzso zzso caused by infection illustrates modification of the zzso zzso system and may be attributed to the previously demonstrated greater numbers of zzso zzso in the circulation of infected zzso
