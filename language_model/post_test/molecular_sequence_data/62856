The zzso of nearly 100 bacterial zzso has made it possible to categorize them into two groups, according to the presence or absence of a zzso zzso zzso In the group with the zzso a zzso incorporation system like that of zzso coli would be zzso However, for the other group, the following question has been left zzso Is it reasonable to assume that bacteria without the zzso lack the entire zzso system, and do such bacteria exist zzso To explore it zzso we chose zzso zzso a representative zzso for which a zzso zzso has not been zzso First, we reviewed the zzso to search for the zzso zzso Second, we examined the possible expression of an unknown zzso Third, we examined zzso zzso and proteins in zzso zzso cell zzso Fourth, the zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso were zzso and the specificity was zzso zzso all of the data showed negative results about the existence of the zzso system in zzso zzso Additionally, we discuss the possibility of predicting the existence or absence of the system in each bacterial zzso by using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso
