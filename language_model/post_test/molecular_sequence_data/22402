zzso evidence suggests that zzso regulations play important roles in a broad spectrum of biological zzso Recently, zzso et zzso developed a zzso zzso technique that zzso zzso zzso change in zzso In this paper, using the zzso zzso we examined rice zzso and identified fragments of zzso protein and zzso zzso as putative targets of zzso Also, monitoring of the zzso and zzso effects of zzso on rice zzso proteins and supporting in zzso observations propose a mechanism of zzso regulation in seed zzso in which zzso activates zzso zzso with a concurrent unfolding of its zzso the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso controls the lifetime of specific proteins effectively by regulating the zzso reactions zzso The model study demonstrates that the zzso zzso technique is useful not only for identifying targets of zzso but also for clarify the detailed mechanism of zzso zzso
