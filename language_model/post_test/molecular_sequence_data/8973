zzso A virus zzso zzso zzso binds to host cell surface zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso to initiate viral zzso It is thought that avian influenza viruses zzso bind to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso while human influenza viruses exhibit a preference for zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso is one of the zzso in viral host zzso The zzso binding pocket of the zzso zzso has been extensively zzso and a number of zzso important for zzso binding have been zzso In this study, we examined the potential roles of seven highly zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso binding and viral entry using an zzso zzso Among them, zzso zzso showed zzso viral entry without obvious defects in zzso protein expression or viral zzso This zzso also displayed dramatically different ability in zzso different animal zzso zzso binding analysis showed that substituting zzso at zzso of zzso changed the zzso binding preference from zzso to zzso acid zzso Rescued zzso zzso viruses demonstrated a zzso to zzso growth zzso but they were robust in viral replication and plaque forming zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is a critical zzso involved in recognition of different zzso zzso This zzso may play a role in determining influenza virus host zzso
