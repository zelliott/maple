The zzso zzso is a complex zzso and is zzso by at least nine zzso which appear to be scattered throughout the zzso We have examined the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso present in multiple copies within the zzso zzso zzso zzso We wished to see if the expression of these genes is zzso regulated and if these genes contain similar promoter zzso A region was zzso of approximately 1 zzso located upstream of the protein coding region for each zzso Several sequence elements were found in similar positions in each of the three zzso Each of the genes had several strong zzso initiation sites, clustered within zzso zzso and located zzso zzso upstream of the translation start zzso The size and abundance of the zzso transcripts was also zzso the amount of zzso transcribed from each gene was roughly zzso to the numbers of each zzso present in the zzso A series of plasmids was constructed containing parts of the putative promoter region fused to zzso Analysis of these plasmids indicated that the essential region of the zzso promoters lies within 370 zzso of the protein coding zzso Overall, the zzso genes appear to have similar characteristics to zzso genes described in other zzso
