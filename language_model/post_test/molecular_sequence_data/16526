Group A zzso zzso is an important human pathogen that causes many types of infections, including zzso and severe invasive zzso We recently zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso strain and identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso To study zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso were constructed by zzso zzso and zzso to apparent zzso zzso activity was greatly reduced by zzso replacement of zzso acid zzso previously described as crucial in the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso Similarly, substitution of five zzso in an zzso zzso loop and three zzso in the zzso active site region resulted in loss of activity of zzso or greater relative to the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso specificity confirmed zzso as a zzso zzso with activity against multiple zzso head groups and zzso chains located at the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso strains representing 48 M protein zzso commonly causing human infections identified the zzso gene in 129 strains of nine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by strains of these zzso was confirmed by Western zzso zzso production increased rapidly and substantially on zzso with Detroit zzso human zzso zzso zzso Together, these data provide new information about a novel zzso zzso that zzso in zzso zzso
