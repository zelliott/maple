zzso zzso zzso produces a blend of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso random zzso consisting of zzso units of 4-12 carbon atoms from zzso The zzso gene zzso zzso carrier protein zzso A zzso was cloned from this strain, and zzso expression of this gene under the control of the zzso or the native promoter was zzso Additional copies of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso led to an increase in both the zzso zzso content in the cells and the fraction of zzso zzso units in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene resulted in an increase in the fraction of the zzso unit in zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso gene was carried out to investigate the role of a zzso motif which has been proposed to be related to zzso zzso
