The zzso virus nuclear zzso 2 zzso 2) shows zzso variation and two zzso distinct groups of viruses have been zzso These zzso to the two zzso groups of viruses (A and zzso that are distinguished by a highly zzso zzso acid sequence in the middle of the open reading frame of the zzso 2 zzso An zzso survey of the zzso zzso region was carried out using a new zzso expression zzso tailored to express DNA fragments from the zzso sequencing libraries of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso Short overlapping stretches of zzso 2 sequence were expressed as fusion proteins and used in Western zzso with human zzso that contained zzso zzso The type zzso zzso was located between zzso zzso and 435 of the zzso zzso 2 zzso and the type zzso zzso mapped between zzso 390 and zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso All of the zzso zzso 2 zzso tested reacted with fusion proteins containing one or other of these zzso Despite the direct correlation between the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso appear to lie in the relatively zzso zzso region of zzso zzso There was no indication that the zzso of the zzso region contributed to the formation of zzso zzso
