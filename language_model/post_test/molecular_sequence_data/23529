zzso clock protein zzso has a zzso zzso structure composed of six identical zzso zzso Each zzso has duplicated zzso and each domain has a set of zzso zzso The two zzso regions of the zzso are likely to zzso to two zzso We examined the role of the two sets of zzso motifs by analyzing the in zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and by in zzso rhythm zzso both in wild type zzso zzso and zzso carrying zzso in either Walker motif A or deduced zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that 1) the zzso zzso had two types of zzso sites, a high affinity site in zzso zzso motifs and a low affinity site in zzso zzso zzso 2) the zzso motifs were responsible for zzso and 3) the zzso motifs were responsible for both stabilization and zzso of the zzso zzso We proposed the following reaction zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso high affinity site, inducing the zzso of zzso Additional zzso then binds to the zzso low affinity site, stabilizing and zzso the zzso We discussed the effect of these zzso zzso on zzso zzso rhythm in cells of zzso
