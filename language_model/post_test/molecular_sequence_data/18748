Two marine bacteria, designated strains zzso and zzso were isolated from a piece of sunken bamboo in the marine environment in zzso Both of these strains were zzso but had different cell zzso zzso was zzso whereas zzso was zzso The temperature, pH and salt concentration ranges for growth of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso at 32 zzso pH zzso zzso at pH zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso whereas those of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso at 30 zzso pH zzso zzso at pH zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso analysis based on partial zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that both strains belong to the zzso zzso within the class zzso zzso between the zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso and those of the type strains of species of the zzso zzso was zzso and that of strain zzso was zzso these two zzso were most closely related to zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso values between zzso zzso zzso and strain zzso or zzso were only zzso and zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso and that of strain zzso was zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the two strains was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids of strain zzso were zzso zzso summed feature 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso those of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of these results, strain zzso and strain zzso are considered to represent novel species of the zzso zzso for which names zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The type strains are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso
