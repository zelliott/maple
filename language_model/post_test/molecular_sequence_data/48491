The zzso zzso channel is expressed in sensory zzso and is responsible for sensing environmental cues, such as cold temperatures and chemical compounds, including zzso and zzso The channel functional activity is regulated by various physical and chemical factors and is likely to be zzso by its molecular zzso Our studies indicate that the zzso channel forms a zzso complex with the zzso zzso zzso We identified by mass zzso a number of zzso peptides in the zzso of the zzso protein and in its zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of both the zzso zzso that serve as zzso anchors for zzso and adjacent zzso zzso that interact with the zzso groups of the zzso resulted in significant zzso of zzso channel zzso zzso that the zzso channel zzso zzso modification by zzso and that this modification is required for its normal zzso
