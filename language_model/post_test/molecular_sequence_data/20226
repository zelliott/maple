From the culture zzso of the fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso exchange and zzso interaction zzso The zzso zzso showed a molecular mass of approximately 30 zzso and displayed an optimal activity at pH 8 and zzso degrees C (more than 20 zzso This zzso could degrade a broad range of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso and zzso zzso However, its zzso activity was highly sensitive to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (1 zzso indicating that it belongs to the zzso zzso zzso This zzso could zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggesting it may play a role in infection against zzso The zzso gene of zzso and its promoter sequence were cloned using zzso zzso and the DNA walking zzso Its zzso frame contains zzso base pairs and without any zzso The deduced zzso sequence shared low identity to zzso zzso from other zzso zzso Our report identified a novel zzso zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso and the three-dimensional structure of this zzso was predicted using the zzso zzso
