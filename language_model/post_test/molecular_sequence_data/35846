We report the sequence of a zzso zzso DNA zzso from the left arm of zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is located between the genetic zzso zzso and zzso We have detected five new open reading frames zzso longer than 300 zzso zzso called zzso to zzso One of them, zzso encodes a zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso The product of zzso contains the consensus for zinc binding zzso similar to those of a number of zzso zzso zzso The three other zzso do not show significant zzso to known zzso
