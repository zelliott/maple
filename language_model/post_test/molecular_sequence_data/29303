The zzso or zzso gene zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso also called human zzso 8) has properties of a zzso membrane zzso signaling protein with zzso properties that is predicted to play a key role in the biology of the zzso We have examined the expression of zzso zzso and protein in primary zzso zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso disease zzso tumors, zzso zzso zzso and infected zzso cell zzso The zzso gene proved to be expressed in zzso cell lines as a large spliced zzso zzso of zzso zzso that also encompasses the upstream zzso zzso zzso This zzso species was induced strongly by zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso treatment in the zzso cell line, but only zzso in the zzso cell line, and was classified as a relatively late and zzso delayed early class zzso cycle gene zzso A complex zzso upstream zzso cycle promoter for this zzso was nestled within the zzso of the zzso but zzso oriented zzso zzso unit for zzso and responded strongly to both zzso induction and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso in transient reporter gene zzso A zzso protein product of 45 zzso that readily zzso was detected by Western zzso and in zzso translation and was localized in a zzso and membrane pattern in zzso zzso and zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso as detected by indirect zzso zzso zzso and zzso with a specific rabbit zzso zzso Similarly, a zzso of zzso cultured zzso cells and of zzso zzso persistently infected zzso cells displayed zzso zzso protein zzso but only after zzso or spontaneous zzso cycle zzso zzso The zzso protein was also zzso by zzso zzso in a small fraction zzso to zzso of the cells in zzso and zzso tumor and zzso zzso zzso zzso specimens that were apparently undergoing zzso cycle zzso These properties are difficult to reconcile with the zzso zzso playing a direct role in zzso cell zzso zzso or zzso but could be compatible with proposed contributions to zzso via downstream zzso zzso The ability of zzso to zzso expression of both several zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter genes and an zzso motif containing the zzso zzso zzso reporter gene may also suggest an unexpected regulatory role in viral gene zzso
