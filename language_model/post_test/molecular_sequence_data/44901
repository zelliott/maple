Two families of small peptides that bind to the human zzso zzso and compete with the binding of the natural zzso zzso zzso were identified from zzso zzso zzso The sequences of these peptides were not found in the primary sequence of zzso zzso libraries of zzso of one of these families under zzso conditions yielded a zzso acid zzso zzso with high affinity zzso constant approximately 2 zzso that stimulates the proliferation of a zzso zzso cell line with a median effective concentration zzso of 400 zzso zzso of this zzso by a zzso linkage to a zzso branch produced a compound with an zzso of 100 zzso which was zzso to the zzso acid natural zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso also zzso the in zzso proliferation and maturation of zzso from human bone zzso cells and promoted an increase in zzso count when administered to normal zzso
