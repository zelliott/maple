Five to zzso percent of visceral zzso zzso patients in India develop post zzso zzso zzso zzso usually 1-2 years after apparent clinical zzso There is evidence pointing to a role played by the host immune responses in the disease zzso however, the contribution of changes in zzso gene expression has not been zzso zzso sensitive gene expression zzso technology was employed to identify genes that are zzso expressed in zzso zzso isolated from zzso patients in comparison with those from zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso comprised of unique clones allowed us to identify zzso zzso clones that showed statistically significant zzso changes in expression zzso in zzso of zzso origin compared to those of zzso zzso zzso analysis of six zzso zzso consistently showing approximately zzso higher expression in zzso zzso revealed significant zzso with zzso zzso putative zzso a putative zzso and a possible zzso zzso The gene products showing zzso expression in zzso zzso may be candidates playing a role in the altered clinical manifestation in zzso Such zzso expressed genes hold the key to understanding the zzso genetic factors that contribute to the persistence after clinical cure of zzso
