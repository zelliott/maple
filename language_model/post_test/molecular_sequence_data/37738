Cloning technologies have established zzso that zzso always seem larger in molecular weight zzso by gel zzso zzso than by mass zzso zzso This has caused many problems relating cloned versions of zzso to proteins actually zzso by zzso in zzso In this study, discrete protein zzso at zzso zzso zzso were prepared from zzso rat zzso zzso by techniques zzso for preserving protein zzso zzso sequence and zzso acid compositional analyses indicated that the major protein forming these zzso was zzso As expected, the molecular weights estimated by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly less than their apparent molecular weights estimated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso for all zzso showed high linear correlation zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso data further indicated that the major protein in the zzso fraction corresponded to the zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso whereas some minor proteins in the zzso fraction likely corresponded to a zzso zzso zzso This was in contrast to major proteins forming the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which seemed to represent zzso fragments of zzso progressively altered at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sites, zzso zzso in the zzso fraction zzso most closely matched by zzso fragments of the zzso zzso zzso that were zzso at the equivalent zzso zzso
