In order to sequence the zzso regions of pig gastric zzso zzso we used our previously identified pig gastric zzso clone zzso to screen a pig stomach zzso library and perform rapid amplification of zzso ends to obtain two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has 1071 base pairs zzso zzso zzso zzso acids containing five zzso 16 zzso acid tandem repeats, downstream from a zzso region similar to human and mouse zzso zzso encodes the complete zzso of zzso and is composed of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso acids with four zzso tandem repeats upstream from a zzso region similar to the zzso terminal regions of human and rat zzso and human zzso This region is zzso to von zzso factor C and D zzso involved in acid induced zzso and to the zzso terminal zzso domain of various zzso zzso zzso and zzso which is involved in zzso These newly zzso zzso regions of pig gastric zzso may be critical for its zzso and for its observed increased zzso induced by low zzso
