zzso pathways involving zzso zzso receptors zzso are widely used by zzso and zzso to regulate a large palette of biological zzso In plants, zzso are known to be implicated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this work, a full length zzso named zzso was isolated from the tropical species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It encodes a zzso zzso acid protein that belongs to the hybrid zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows the highest zzso with zzso an zzso zzso in zzso zzso In return, zzso protein shares very low identity with the other 10 zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicates that the zzso corresponding gene is either present in multiple copies or has very close zzso in the zzso of the tropical zzso The gene is widely expressed in the zzso In zzso zzso zzso cell suspension, it is slightly induced after exposure to low temperature, pointing to a putative role in zzso signal zzso
