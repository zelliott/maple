Previously, we have identified two alternate zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso I and zzso II, specified by zzso fragments of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the presence study, a zzso zzso probe was prepared which was confirmed to be included within the zzso zzso The zzso zzso probe zzso with greater intensity to the zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that there is 1 copy of zzso associated with zzso I, whereas there may be zzso copies of the gene associated with the zzso II zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the multiple copies of zzso II are inherited in a zzso zzso These results allow novel approaches to investigating the underlying mechanisms of zzso zzso and gene zzso
