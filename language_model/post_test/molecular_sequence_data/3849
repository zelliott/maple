Many zzso and zzso zzso proteins use a zzso zzso structure for DNA zzso Here we describe a new family of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso family, which includes proteins from zzso sea zzso zzso insects, and zzso Three zzso of the zzso family can be zzso Like the zzso proteins of the zzso zzso family, members of the zzso zzso catalyze zzso zzso zzso This functional zzso together with a primary sequence similarity between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso and zzso families are zzso zzso More than half of the newly identified zzso zzso proteins contain a zzso zzso interaction zzso All proteins of this zzso zzso belong to the zzso zzso group of zzso zzso About half of the members of the zzso group contain a zzso domain, while the other half is made up of proteins that contain a zinc finger zzso Thus, nearly all members of this group appear to be zzso zzso Among other zzso regulators, the zzso cell death protein zzso was found to contain a zzso motif and to define a third zzso of zzso domain zzso The high sequence conservation of the zzso zzso motif allowed the identification of zzso zzso in humans and lower zzso
