zzso techniques were employed to construct a zzso zzso zzso a single functional zzso zzso This zzso of zzso zzso permits replacement of the single remaining zzso zzso with a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso By zzso zzso with the zzso a zzso zzso segment with resistance markers zzso for the corresponding region of the zzso zzso zzso resulting in a homogeneous population of zzso zzso in the zzso As a first result we demonstrate that the single zzso zzso strain allows for isolation of zzso zzso with a drug-resistant zzso zzso the problem of zzso which prohibits the isolation of such zzso in organisms with multiple zzso zzso zzso by zzso exchange experiments, it was demonstrated that the zzso zzso found indeed zzso drug resistance in zzso This system provides intriguing potential for the study of the structure and function of zzso zzso
