The zzso signaling zzso is a promising target for controlling cell fate choices at the zzso zzso Building on our previous work in developing zzso zzso we evaluated various zzso schemes for zzso zzso and their effect on human zzso zzso A zzso sequence derived from the zzso zzso and immobilized to zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso in relation to the zzso zzso The full-length zzso protein immobilized directly to the zzso surface showed activity in signaling the zzso zzso However, an indirect affinity zzso approach yielded a stronger zzso Human zzso zzso on bound zzso showed zzso zzso zzso 10, and zzso protein zzso with this expression being cell zzso zzso a human zzso zzso organ culture model as a bridge between in zzso and in zzso studies, zzso or control zzso rods were implanted in human zzso and cultured at the zzso zzso zzso proliferation was suppressed and zzso differentiation promoted in zzso rods compared with control zzso Thus, zzso zzso provide a robust approach to control zzso differentiation and may find application to other zzso and stem zzso
