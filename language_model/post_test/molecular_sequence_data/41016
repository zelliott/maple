The zzso of zzso are considered zzso undergoing zzso to a stable zzso zzso Given the zzso zzso and extensive biological data available for zzso they are excellent model organisms for studying comparative zzso evolutionary zzso fates of duplicated genes and the genetic and zzso processes associated with complex behavioral zzso The evolution of the zzso zzso genes is well zzso however, little is known about the zzso organization and evolution of zzso zzso zzso particularly those of zzso The Atlantic salmon serves as a representative zzso species for zzso zzso Given the well documented role of zzso in adaptation to varied environmental conditions as well as its use as a model protein for evolutionary zzso an understanding of the zzso structure and organization of the Atlantic salmon zzso and zzso zzso genes is of great zzso 

We identified four bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso two zzso gene clusters spanning the entire zzso and zzso zzso gene repertoire of the Atlantic salmon zzso Their zzso locations were established using zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis and linkage zzso demonstrating that the two clusters are located on separate zzso The zzso were zzso and assembled into zzso which were zzso for zzso functional and zzso zzso zzso This revealed that the zzso organization and alternating pattern of the zzso and zzso zzso genes are well zzso in both zzso as well as that the Atlantic salmon zzso houses substantially more zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso than the zzso of other zzso that have been zzso 

We suggest that the most zzso evolutionary path leading to the present organization of the Atlantic salmon zzso genes involves the loss of a single zzso gene cluster after the whole zzso zzso zzso at the base of the zzso radiation but prior to the zzso zzso which then produced the duplicated copies seen zzso We also propose that the relatively high number of zzso genes as well as the presence of zzso zzso zzso genes may be due to the dynamic life history of salmon and the diverse environmental conditions that the species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
