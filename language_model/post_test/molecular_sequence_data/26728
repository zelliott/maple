The specific status of several pygmy zzso endemic to mountain zzso in the Eastern Arc zzso Tanzania has long been controversial due to their lack of distinctive zzso zzso In this work we extend our previous sampling of zzso and zzso species, especially from the zzso zzso zzso complex, and add data from a new zzso marker to address this zzso Our results show that there is geographical structure between populations of pygmy zzso from different zzso This structure is especially well defined for zzso zzso zzso analyses confirm that both zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1995 and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2002 are distinct zzso the former from the zzso Mountains and the latter from the zzso zzso However, the zzso material used to erect zzso zzso belongs to a separate lineage from the zzso Similarly, a number of additional lineages within the zzso zzso zzso complex recovered in the analysis may deserve specific zzso At present, there is a lack of zzso characters that can be used to distinguish these zzso suggesting that there are multiple cryptic zzso in this zzso
