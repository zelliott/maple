Human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were activated using zzso zzso resulting in degradation of zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha began by 30 zzso and proceeded for at least 5 zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibited zzso alpha degradation in a zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso increased zzso alpha levels compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha was incubated with zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and the degradation products were monitored by zzso and zzso Most of the degradation products were peptides derived from zzso but one was derived from zzso alpha zzso between zzso acids 50 and 51 zzso and zzso zzso The liberated zzso included the entire signal response domain zzso a region containing key zzso and zzso zzso necessary for zzso by the zzso complex and sites required for zzso The results suggest that zzso plays an important role in zzso alpha degradation, a crucial event in T cell zzso
