The breast and zzso cancer predisposition gene product zzso binds to zzso at its N zzso In cells zzso is found as a zzso with zzso and may represent the functionally active form of zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso screens we have identified 16 independent zzso zzso which prevent the ability of the zzso N zzso to zzso with zzso With reference to the recent structure of the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso King, zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2001) zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso we note two classes of zzso those that map to the zzso core forming the zzso interface and are zzso of zzso and those that map to zzso forming zzso contacts either in zzso zzso or in the zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The directed zzso of charged zzso predicted to play a role in the interaction could not alone prevent zzso formation suggesting that, while polar interactions may participate in the specificity of the interaction, they are not zzso Together these data provide functional evidence for the requirement of a zzso interface and illustrate that disruption of the zzso structure by zzso away from the interface itself are able to prevent formation of the zzso
