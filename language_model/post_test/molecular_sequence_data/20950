zzso zzso which convert zzso to zzso are found in almost every zzso and comprise a group of highly divergent proteins in zzso acid zzso zzso properties, and zzso zzso While the zzso zzso are among the most studied zzso very little is known about the structure and function of zzso zzso zzso which include two discrete classes of zzso that are classified based on their ability to transfer electrons and/or zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used a combination of structural and zzso approaches to reveal the likely evolutionary events in the history of the recently described zzso binding zzso type 4 family that led to the evolution of zzso zzso referred as zzso Our zzso reconstructions reveal that zzso genes from zzso form a zzso group with respect to zzso zzso zzso All zzso reconstructions recovered two divergent zzso zzso zzso While the first group zzso showed close zzso relationships with the animal and plant zzso the second zzso group zzso revealed strong zzso and structural similarities to the plant and animal zzso zzso Our data strongly suggest that the functional assignment of the zzso zzso group should be carefully zzso The present study demonstrates that structural zzso approach can be used to resolve important evolutionary events in functionally diverse zzso and to provide reliable functional predictions to poorly characterized zzso
