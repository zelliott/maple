zzso zzso with zzso and zzso have been used to identify a novel zzso instability zzso A zzso zzso sequence containing a repetitive zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso gene was inserted into the 3' untranslated region zzso of the zzso zzso In one orientation, the insert had no effect on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In the other orientation, however, the sequence functioned as a zzso element and was dominant to the zzso zzso and zzso stability zzso The zzso effect of the instability sequence suggests that sequence rather than structure alone is important to the function of the instability zzso In addition, the instability sequence also zzso an zzso fusion construct when fused to its zzso zzso A sensitive zzso zzso amplification technique was developed and used to analyze zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that degradation of the zzso transcript initiated within the zzso inserted zzso
