zzso zzso contain an zzso that incorporates zzso from zzso into zzso adding it zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso closest to the reducing end of the repeating zzso This zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso by affinity zzso on zzso followed by gel zzso By utilizing zzso sequences obtained from the zzso zzso a zzso clone was isolated that encodes a zzso acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 64 zzso and shows zzso identity to its zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso at approximately 63 zzso by zzso gel zzso but zzso from the gel zzso column as an active protein of higher molecular weight ( approximately 250 zzso indicating that the active form is an zzso The zzso is specific for zzso and is inhibited by zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso The zzso has a neutral pH optimum and does not require zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso and zzso associate with the zzso in a random zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso had little effect on activity, although several other zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited zzso
