The four zzso zzso in the zzso A zzso channel zzso channel zzso and their side chain zzso should therefore be important, but the energies of different zzso are zzso A zzso search for the right-handed zzso based on molecular mechanics in zzso yielded 46 zzso within 20 zzso of the lowest energy zzso The two lowest energy zzso zzso to the solid-state and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that interactions within the zzso determine the zzso For representative zzso the zzso potential of the zzso side chains on the channel axis was zzso A novel application of the zzso method zzso zzso zzso zzso was introduced to simulate the polarization of bulk water by the zzso side zzso For the zzso observed structures, the zzso zzso potential energy zzso of a zzso in the channel center is zzso zzso without zzso With images, the zzso is zzso zzso demonstrating that the images further enhance the direct zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded less favorable zzso by zzso zzso
