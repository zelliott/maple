zzso zzso system zzso contributes to intrinsic resistance to various drug classes in zzso zzso By zzso sequencing, we have identified in clinical isolate zzso the zzso zzso located zzso zzso upstream from zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the deletion of zzso 582 zzso in the 3' portion of this gene was responsible for a zzso zzso resulting in the deletion of the seven zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso with a zzso expressing zzso restored zzso zzso to the host associated with the loss of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso led to a diminished zzso to antibiotics that are zzso for zzso and to a zzso increase in zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is zzso expressed in zzso and does not regulate its own zzso zzso of zzso 582 and a zzso deletion of the 3' part of zzso were found in independent zzso zzso zzso selected from clinical zzso zzso and zzso zzso The corresponding zzso were located in the zzso zzso which is known to be involved in zzso a process essential for the activity of zzso zzso The zzso gene was detected in all of the 30 zzso zzso strains tested and in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
