zzso which control zzso human zzso zzso virus type I zzso zzso probably play an important role in initiation and maintenance of virus zzso We have identified and analyzed a zzso sequence zzso regulatory element 1 zzso zzso at the boundary of the zzso region of the long terminal repeat which is required for zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter strength of zzso that contained deletions in the zzso region of the zzso long terminal repeat were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso following zzso of zzso T zzso We consistently observed a zzso decrease in zzso promoter activity when sequences between zzso to zzso were zzso By reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis, we confirmed that the drop in zzso zzso activity was paralleled by a decrease in the level of zzso zzso zzso 1 did not affect the level of zzso zzso Using a gel shift zzso we have zzso a highly enriched fraction that could specifically bind zzso zzso This DNA affinity column fraction contained four zzso proteins on sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The affinity column fraction zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso in zzso No effect was observed with the human zzso virus or zzso major late zzso Following zzso of the proteins isolated from an zzso zzso zzso but not the other protein zzso was able to specifically bind to zzso zzso
