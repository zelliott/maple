It is proposed that the zzso H complex functions in cell cycle zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso Here we report that in zzso zzso of an active zzso H complex requires zzso amounts of a novel 36 zzso assembly factor termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reveals a putative zinc binding motif (a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso however, this domain is not required for zzso complex formation with zzso zzso zzso is associated with nuclear zzso H at all stages of the cell cycle in zzso zzso complexes of zzso zzso H and zzso display zzso activity towards zzso mimicking both the zzso in zzso and the zzso domain of zzso zzso II, regardless of whether they are zzso from zzso cells or zzso in a zzso zzso zzso constitutes the first example of an assembly factor that appears to be essential for the formation of an active zzso zzso
