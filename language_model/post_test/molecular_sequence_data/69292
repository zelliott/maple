The outer surface of the cells of the zzso zzso zzso is covered by zzso zzso zzso zzso From the zzso zzso zzso a zzso was zzso The zzso consists of zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso ratio of zzso corresponding to a relative molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso could be partly replaced by zzso The primary structure of the zzso was revealed by zzso analysis, by plasma zzso mass zzso and by high field zzso zzso The zzso zzso is linked via zzso to an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The following structure is proposed for the zzso zzso zzso - zzso
