Major zzso complex zzso class I molecules bind peptides that are delivered from the zzso into the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso associated with zzso processing zzso zzso capture by immature zzso of class I heavy chains and beta zzso may be facilitated by their physical association with zzso A genetic zzso in a human zzso cell line causes the complete failure of diverse class I zzso to associate with zzso This zzso zzso the ability of the class I zzso to efficiently capture peptides and results from loss of function of an unidentified gene or genes linked to the zzso
