zzso and zzso are small peptides containing two zzso bonds that activate membrane zzso zzso in the zzso kidney and other zzso zzso zzso with a zzso complementary DNA zzso detected zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso but these transcripts are larger than zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso to produce zzso for amplification in the zzso followed by cloning and sequencing revealed a novel zzso zzso containing an open reading frame zzso a zzso acid zzso This protein shares zzso and zzso of its zzso with zzso and zzso zzso A zzso acid, zzso zzso occurs at the zzso of the precursor zzso However, this zzso is unique in having only three zzso zzso We named the gene and its zzso product zzso because the source of the first zzso isolated was zzso and its zzso is expressed in all of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso acid form of zzso containing a single zzso bond was zzso that activates the zzso zzso receptors of human zzso zzso and zzso kidney zzso cells, although with less potency than zzso and zzso Northern and/or zzso zzso detected zzso zzso transcripts in many zzso and zzso of zzso including those within the zzso zzso zzso and central nervous organ zzso zzso joins zzso and zzso in a growing family of zzso zzso that activate zzso zzso zzso zzso thus influencing target cell function via the zzso second messenger, zzso
