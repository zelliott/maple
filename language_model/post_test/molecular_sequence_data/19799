zzso fluorescent zzso with sufficient sensing specificity are useful zzso tools for detection of biologically important substances in complicated biological zzso Here, we present the design of a hybrid zzso specific for a zzso zzso based on a natural zzso binding domain coupled with an artificial fluorescent zzso The hybrid zzso consists of a zzso binding domain, the WW domain, into which has been introduced a fluorescent zzso having zzso zzso as a zzso binding zzso It showed strong binding affinity and high sensing selectivity toward a specific zzso zzso in the presence of various zzso species such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments clearly indicate that the zzso zzso enhancement and the sensing selectivity were achieved by the cooperative action of both binding sites of the hybrid zzso zzso the WW domain and the zzso zzso zzso Thus, it is clear that the zzso zzso unit operated not only as a zzso signal zzso but also as a zzso site in the hybrid zzso Taking advantage of its selective sensing property, the hybrid zzso was successfully applied to real-time and zzso zzso monitoring of a protein zzso zzso
