Previous studies have revealed that transforming growth zzso protein zzso 1 zzso interacts with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we examine the sequence requirements in zzso and zzso that drive their zzso zzso and point zzso in zzso reveal that a zzso zzso in the C zzso of zzso zzso is necessary for its interaction with zzso Furthermore, a cryptic zzso zzso site was identified adjacent to the N zzso of zzso putting zzso in the zzso position of the zzso zzso Through zzso analysis, we found that the previously identified zzso zzso groove in zzso is involved in this interaction, whereas the CD domain and zzso domain are zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis with zzso (which does not bind to zzso revealed a previously unidentified locus of zzso zzso zzso and zzso that is essential for specific binding of zzso to zzso zzso either of these zzso to the corresponding zzso acid of zzso zzso zzso interaction with zzso These zzso zzso still can be fully activated by zzso upstream zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 6, but their zzso activity and zzso in response to some zzso stimuli are zzso zzso to zzso and zzso is a site where large zzso changes occur in the presence of zzso peptides derived from zzso zzso and zzso This suggests that zzso zzso of zzso results from zzso changes that are similar but unique to those seen in zzso interactions with its zzso and zzso zzso
