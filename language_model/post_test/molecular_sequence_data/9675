TRAIL is a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso family of zzso and zzso zzso in a wide variety of zzso Based on zzso searching of a private database, a zzso for TRAIL zzso or zzso was recently zzso Here we report the identification of a distinct zzso for zzso zzso by zzso affinity zzso and subsequent molecular zzso zzso was zzso independently as the only zzso for TRAIL zzso on the surface of two different human cell lines that undergo zzso upon stimulation with zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso repeats, typical for zzso zzso zzso family members, and a zzso death zzso TRAIL binds to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is inhibited by a zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed and the gene zzso zzso is located on human zzso zzso Like zzso zzso engages a zzso zzso zzso but, in contrast to zzso zzso mediates zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso The existence of two distinct receptors for the same zzso suggests an unexpected complexity to TRAIL biology, reminiscent of dual receptors for zzso the zzso member of this zzso
