zzso are cell zzso zzso living as zzso zzso and pathogens of plants and insects, making them attractive subjects for studies to gain a greater understanding of zzso zzso and zzso During a study of two zzso zzso we obtained evidence for previously zzso zzso of zzso zzso mobile genetic zzso zzso repeat units, and repetitive zzso zzso that occur in zzso zzso clusters in some zzso zzso The clusters represent previously zzso zzso possibly assembled through multiple events of targeted mobile element attack, duplication, zzso and zzso Multiple clusters could conceivably afford potential for zzso reduction through zzso zzso zzso in the sizes and zzso of such clusters possibly account for some of the previously reported but unexplained variations in zzso size among closely related zzso zzso
