The genetic map for alfalfa presented here has eight linkage groups representing the zzso zzso set of the zzso zzso The genetic map was constructed by ordering the linkage values of 89 zzso zzso zzso and zzso markers collected from a segregating population of 138 zzso The segregating population is zzso progeny of an F1 hybrid plant zzso from a cross between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The inheritance of many traits displayed distorted zzso indicating the presence of lethal zzso in the zzso parent zzso In spite of the lack of uniform zzso linkage groups could be assigned and the order of the markers spanning zzso zzso zzso could be zzso zzso This value and the calculated zzso zzso size for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gives a ratio of zzso 1500 zzso per zzso
