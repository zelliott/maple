To search for zzso target genes throughout the human zzso we applied a zzso zzso system using zzso transfer of zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso In this manner, we detected dozens of genes that appeared to be regulated by zzso zzso We describe here characterization of one such zzso termed zzso zzso of zzso complex in zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso acid zzso with significant sequence similarity to activity of zzso complex zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso product was located in zzso and zzso zzso with cancer cell lines indicated its ability to suppress cell zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso with zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso response induced by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso zzso through the zzso zzso
