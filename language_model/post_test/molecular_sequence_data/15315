The zzso Negro zzso zzso microbial mats have become one focus for zzso studies of zzso zzso The zzso mats are found beneath several of a series of ponds of increasing zzso that make up a solar zzso fed from Pacific Ocean water pumped from the zzso zzso de zzso near zzso Baja California Sur, zzso zzso surveys of the laminated zzso microbial mat below the fourth pond in the series identified an enormous diversity of bacteria in the zzso but zzso have received little zzso To determine the bulk contribution of zzso zzso to the pond 4 study site, we determined the zzso distribution of zzso zzso gene sequences in zzso libraries based on zzso universal zzso The ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that the zzso contribution to the zzso activities of the mat may be zzso To explore the distribution of zzso in the zzso sequences derived using zzso zzso zzso were surveyed in 10 strata of the zzso zzso The diversity of zzso overall was substantial albeit less than the diversity observed previously for zzso zzso diversity, mainly zzso was highest in the uppermost 2 to 3 zzso of the mat and decreased rapidly with depth, where zzso zzso Only zzso of the sequences were specifically related to known organisms including zzso While some mat zzso zzso corresponded with known chemical zzso others did not, which is likely explained by zzso zzso Some zzso did not segregate by depth in the zzso indicating broad zzso zzso zzso or zzso
