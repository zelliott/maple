Current understanding on the relationships between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reverse zzso zzso gene expression are largely based on in zzso studies in human cancer zzso Although several reports demonstrated zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso gene under zzso conflicting findings have also been zzso Thus far, it remains uncertain whether these findings can be directly zzso to zzso zzso in other whole animal systems in zzso While fish often encounter environmental zzso the in zzso regulation of zzso by zzso in zzso zzso of fish remains virtually zzso 

The adult marine zzso zzso zzso was employed as a model fish in this zzso We have cloned and characterized a zzso full-length zzso zzso zzso which encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso It contains all of the functional motifs that are zzso in other zzso zzso zzso E is the most highly zzso showing zzso overall identity among the fish zzso and zzso overall identity among zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence of the zzso gene identified two zzso zzso zzso zzso - 283 and - zzso zzso zzso of the zzso induced zzso promoter activity as demonstrated using transient zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso expressed in fish under zzso albeit at varying levels, where highest expression was observed in zzso and the lowest in zzso In zzso expression of zzso was significantly zzso in zzso and liver in response to zzso (at 96 h and 48 zzso respectively), where zzso induction of the zzso and zzso zzso genes was also zzso In zzso zzso analysis showed that hypoxic induction of zzso zzso was clearly evident in zzso in the zzso region of liver and in zzso zzso in zzso 

This study demonstrates for the first time, hypoxic regulation of zzso expression in zzso in a whole fish zzso Our findings support the notion that zzso zzso zzso expression via zzso in zzso fish liver and zzso in zzso Overall, the structure and regulation of the zzso gene is highly zzso in zzso from fish to zzso
