A DNA zzso carrying the genes coding for a novel zzso restriction zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which recognize zzso was cloned from the zzso DNA of zzso coli zzso The zzso and zzso genes were in a head-to-head orientation and were separated by a zzso zzso zzso A third zzso the zzso zzso was found in the zzso region, partially overlapping the zzso zzso The gene product, zzso acted as both a positive regulator of zzso gene expression and a negative regulator of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso coli cells was shown to be a zzso protein and to zzso the inner zzso in the recognition zzso zzso was zzso from zzso coli zzso expressing zzso and formed a zzso The zzso restriction zzso zzso system zzso zzso was found to be inserted between the A and Q genes of defective zzso zzso which was zzso in the zzso at zzso one of the zzso zzso attachment sites observed in both zzso coli K-12 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Ten strains of zzso coli zzso were examined for the presence of the zzso zzso gene on the zzso zzso Conventional zzso analysis and zzso of R activity demonstrated that all strains carried a single copy of the zzso zzso gene and expressed R activity but that diversity of zzso in the zzso D, zzso I, and J genes in the defective zzso zzso had zzso
