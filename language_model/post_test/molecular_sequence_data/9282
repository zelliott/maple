Many plants, including zzso zzso retain a substantial portion of their zzso in leaves in the form of zzso which is zzso to support metabolism and growth at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the first committed step in the zzso of starch zzso the production of zzso The zzso is zzso in the light and in response to zzso zzso via zzso breakage of an zzso zzso bridge between the two small zzso zzso The biological function of this regulatory mechanism was investigated by zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso with a series of zzso containing a full-length zzso gene zzso either the zzso zzso protein or zzso forms in which one of the five zzso zzso was replaced by zzso zzso of zzso by zzso prevented zzso zzso whereas zzso of the other zzso had no zzso Thus, zzso is both necessary and sufficient for zzso of zzso Compared to control plants, the zzso lines had higher levels of zzso and zzso and either increased rates of starch synthesis or a zzso zzso depending on the zzso zzso protein levels were five- to tenfold lower in zzso lines than in control zzso These results show that zzso zzso of zzso contributes to the zzso regulation of starch zzso with inappropriate regulation of the zzso having an unexpected impact on starch breakdown, and that zzso may play an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso
