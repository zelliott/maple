The shunt model predicts that small zzso zzso within the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso leader and downstream zzso zzso are translated by different mechanisms, that is, zzso and zzso zzso Wheat germ extract zzso and rabbit zzso zzso zzso in zzso translation systems were used to discriminate between these two processes and to study the mechanism of zzso zzso In both systems, expression downstream of the leader occurred via zzso shunt under the control of a stable stem and a small zzso preceding zzso zzso zzso were also able to initiate quite efficiently at zzso start zzso just downstream of the shunt landing site in zzso but not in zzso The short zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso which zzso suppresses zzso at a downstream ORF, prevented zzso if placed at the position of zzso A, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We have demonstrated directly that zzso A is translated and that proper termination of translation at the zzso zzso is absolutely required for both zzso and linear zzso zzso These findings strongly indicate that zzso is a special case of zzso
