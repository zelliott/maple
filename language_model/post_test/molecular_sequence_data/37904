zzso zzso zzso gene expression is regulated in a complex zzso manner, notably by zzso environmental events that program tissue zzso zzso We have identified and characterized several new rat zzso zzso All zzso a common zzso but differ in their zzso sequences as a consequence of alternate zzso of, zzso 11 different zzso 1 zzso Most are located in a zzso zzso island, upstream of zzso 2, that exhibits substantial promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso protection analysis demonstrated significant levels of six alternate zzso 1 in zzso in zzso with differences between liver, zzso and zzso reflecting zzso differences in promoter zzso Two of the alternate zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in all zzso zzso together present in zzso of total zzso zzso The remaining zzso transcripts contained zzso alternate first zzso zzso zzso first zzso usage was altered by zzso environmental zzso zzso zzso which permanently increases zzso in the zzso causing zzso of stress responses, selectively elevated zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure, which increases zzso zzso expression and produces adult zzso decreased the proportion of zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso suggesting an increase in a minor zzso 1 zzso Such tissue specificity of promoter usage allows differential zzso regulation and zzso
