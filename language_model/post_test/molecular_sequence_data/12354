In this study we investigate the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the restricted expression of zzso during zzso We report that a single zzso binding site, zzso within the zzso zzso contributes to appropriate spatial expression of zzso in the developing nervous zzso This zzso site may be required for zzso zzso expression in the developing zzso since specific zzso of this site result in an extension of the zzso boundary of zzso zzso in transgenic zzso We further demonstrate that a subset of zzso proteins expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso interact specifically with zzso These findings suggest that these (or zzso zzso proteins may regulate expression of zzso during normal brain development by interacting with the zzso site in the zzso zzso
