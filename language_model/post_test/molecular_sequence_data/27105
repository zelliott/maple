Previous reports of zzso deletion analysis on gamma zzso zzso protein zzso have demonstrated that removal of a short zzso acid sequence in the zzso region encompassing a zzso acid motif zzso abrogates its binding activity specific to the cell wall of zzso zzso Whether short synthetic peptides representing zzso acid zzso putative binding motif flanked by surrounding zzso and zzso zzso also selectively bind to the bacterial cell wall has not been zzso If such peptides do demonstrate selective binding to the cell wall, they could serve as zzso towards developing detection technologies for zzso zzso Furthermore, by using zzso zzso zzso zzso an animal vaccine and zzso zzso a zzso susceptible rare strain as surrogates of zzso zzso development of zzso for zzso zzso are zzso 

Using four different methods, we evaluated six synthetic peptides representing the putative binding motif including zzso sequences zzso through zzso for the bacterial cell wall binding zzso Our analysis identified zzso zzso and zzso to have binding capability to both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The peptides however did not bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting their specificity for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in combination with fluorescent light zzso detected even a single zzso in plasma spiked with the zzso 

Overall, these studies illustrate that the short zzso acid sequence zzso in fact is a zzso bacterial cell zzso motif of zzso In principle, synthetic peptides zzso zzso and zzso especially zzso coupled with zzso are useful as zzso zzso in developing detection technologies for zzso zzso
