We have isolated a zzso from human zzso brain zzso library which encodes a putative zzso protein bearing an zzso protein zzso zzso zzso like zzso The zzso like domain contains an zzso to zzso zzso acid change relative to other zzso in the zzso core zzso This zzso acid change is found in only three other known zzso zzso cell zzso human, zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso and its rat zzso zzso which have a similar overall structure to zzso and the recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso clearly represent a new family of zzso proteins for which zzso activity has yet to be zzso An abundant zzso zzso is zzso in the brain and zzso but not in the other normal human zzso zzso We have zzso zzso to human zzso zzso
