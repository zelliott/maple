zzso infecting zzso green algae in the order zzso zzso zzso are commonly found in coastal marine waters where their host species frequently zzso We tested 40 zzso zzso viruses on 13 independently isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D strain, and 1 representative species of each of two other related species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thirty-four out of 40 viruses infected only zzso zzso 5 could zzso one other species of the zzso zzso and 1 infected two other zzso zzso but none of them infected the other zzso We observed that the overall zzso pattern of zzso strains to viruses was related to the size of two host zzso known to show zzso size variations, that genetically related viruses tended to zzso the same host zzso and that viruses carrying zzso were strictly strain zzso zzso of two complete zzso zzso virus zzso revealed at least three predicted proteins to be candidate viral specificity zzso
