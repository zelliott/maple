The zzso sequences of zzso domain of zzso of clinical zzso influenza zzso isolated during recent outbreaks of respiratory problems in pig farms of zzso was zzso The viruses zzso zzso and zzso zzso associated with chronic respiratory disease, showed close similarity for their deduced zzso zzso When compared with the published data of zzso zzso the variations observed included zzso and zzso zzso sites in zzso and zzso and zzso sites in zzso zzso These zzso were zzso related to zzso virus associated with chronic respiratory disease, but differed from the more classical zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso associated with acute respiratory zzso showed maximum number of differences including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The latter, as well as the zzso strain, were zzso distinct from zzso virus on the basis of its zzso to zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso of genetic distances and zzso tree analysis showed that zzso and zzso were closely zzso but these viruses along with zzso were considerably divergent from zzso zzso
