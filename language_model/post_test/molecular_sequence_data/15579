zzso is a zzso zzso produced by zzso and it has been studied for nearly 50 zzso zzso it has become a model in the study of peptides interacting with zzso In this review, we report some recent findings and compare them with previous zzso zzso is a 26 zzso acid zzso somewhat zzso and presenting a zero net zzso Study of its structure has shown that zzso is zzso and zzso such as many zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso had not displayed any reported zzso activity until a recent publication showed its high potency against zzso Its mode of action is based on direct interaction with target zzso In accordance with its zzso zzso may slightly zzso a membrane or lead to cell zzso zzso charge plays an important role in its interaction with zzso as is shown in the study of zzso zzso Some positively charged zzso become highly zzso and even active against zzso coli and zzso zzso Finally, it has recently been demonstrated that zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso It has been zzso that as a result, enrichment in zzso zzso might increase zzso concentration in zzso zzso and thereby improve its zzso
