The zzso sequence of zzso a zzso linear zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso are zzso zzso repeats zzso Each DNA strand contains a long open reading frame zzso which begins within the zzso and extends toward the zzso of the zzso zzso codes for a zzso zzso zzso that is not closely related to that zzso by another zzso zzso zzso The zzso product may be a zzso DNA zzso resembling those zzso by terminal zzso linear genetic zzso including linear zzso plasmids and linear zzso A separate coding sequence for the terminal protein could not be zzso however, the DNA zzso of zzso has an zzso extension with features that are also present in the terminal proteins of linear zzso The zzso extensions of the DNA zzso of other linear zzso plasmids contain similar features, suggesting that the terminal proteins of linear plasmids may be zzso at least in part, of these cryptic zzso The terminal zzso bond of zzso is resistant to mild alkaline zzso indicating that it might involve a zzso or a zzso zzso Although zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are structurally similar, and integrate into zzso DNA by a mechanism thus far unique to these two zzso they are not closely related to each other and they do not have any zzso sequence features, or zzso that distinguish them clearly from zzso plasmids which are not associated with zzso and most of which are apparently zzso
