zzso have generally been neglected in studies of zzso zzso Before this study, only one zzso and two zzso zzso had their complete zzso zzso zzso zzso Tree zzso represent an ancient zzso lineage that first occurred in the Late zzso In recent zzso zzso tree zzso were shown to be the sister group of zzso the most diverse group of living zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequence from a tree zzso will facilitate interpretation of the evolutionary changes of zzso zzso zzso Here we have zzso the complete zzso zzso of a zzso tree zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso is zzso base pairs zzso in size, and has a typical zzso structure with the large zzso zzso zzso and small single copy zzso zzso zzso regions separated by two copies of an zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso contains 117 different genes zzso 85 zzso 4 zzso and 28 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are also detected in this zzso A unique zzso gene zzso from zzso is found between zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso shares some unusual characteristics with the previously zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso including the absence of 5 zzso genes that exist in most other zzso zzso The zzso shows a high degree of zzso with that of zzso but differs considerably from two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso At one zzso of an ancient inversion we detected a highly repeated zzso that is absent from the zzso zzso zzso An additional minor inversion of the zzso which is possibly shared by all zzso was identified by comparison between the zzso and other land plant zzso zzso 

By comparing four zzso zzso zzso sequences it was confirmed that two major zzso distinguish higher zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is very similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso in terms of gene content, gene order and zzso zzso However, there exist some striking differences between them: the zzso gene represents a putative molecular zzso of tree zzso and the repeats observed at one inversion zzso may be a zzso of some unknown zzso This work provided fresh insights into the zzso zzso zzso evolution as well as useful data for future zzso zzso
