A zzso locus was discovered within zzso zzso that contains a novel zzso element designated zzso zzso is bounded by a copy of an zzso sequence designated zzso and a truncated imperfect copy of zzso zzso The truncated copy is immediately adjacent to a second copy of zzso These data are consistent with the locus having evolved by a complex zzso following the zzso of a second copy of zzso Analysis of the organization, orientation, and open reading frames zzso of zzso places it within the zzso zzso Four zzso from zzso were translated in zzso producing a potential zzso with an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso and three zzso with apparent molecular masses of 71 zzso 22 zzso and 14 zzso The central region of zzso encodes the 71 zzso and 14 zzso zzso while the 22 zzso protein is likely an internal translation initiation product of the zzso zzso The 71 zzso protein shares sequence similarity with several bacterial zzso regulatory proteins and may form a zzso structure capable of binding zzso No zzso protein sequences to the 14 zzso zzso were detected in available zzso The zzso zzso zzso and its 22 zzso internal translation product shared significant similarity to several zzso from diverse bacterial zzso Immediately zzso of zzso are genes zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso This region also contains a 90 zzso sequence that shares significant zzso to a repetitive element with zzso repeats from the zzso zzso zzso from zzso is an zzso zzso a protein having significant similarity to a hypothetical protein from zzso The locus is lower in zzso content from that of the zzso These data suggest that lateral transfer of genetic material has zzso
