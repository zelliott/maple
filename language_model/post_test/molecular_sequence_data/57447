A zzso clone for zzso zzso zzso was obtained by screening a zzso zzso expression library with zzso specific for zzso zzso The zzso zzso transcript was derived from a zzso zzso The precursor (41 zzso and mature forms zzso zzso of zzso were identified by western zzso of in zzso translation products and zzso zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence of the mature form was zzso by data from zzso protein sequencing and yielded identity scores from zzso to zzso upon comparison with zzso zzso zzso conservation seemed to be even more pronounced in comparison with zzso from higher plants, but using the neighbor joining method the zzso zzso sequence was clearly positioned between the zzso and zzso zzso The transit zzso of 65 or 66 zzso acids appeared to be totally unrelated to those from spinach, pea and ice plant but showed overall characteristics of zzso zzso
