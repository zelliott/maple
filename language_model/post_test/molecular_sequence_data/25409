zzso length complementary DNA zzso clones zzso turkey growth hormone zzso have been isolated from a zzso zzso The longer of the two turkey zzso zzso clones that were zzso is zzso base pairs zzso in length and contains 41 zzso of the zzso region zzso an open reading frame of zzso zzso that encodes a 25 zzso acid leader zzso segment as well as a 191 zzso acid mature turkey zzso zzso and a zzso that is 92 zzso long followed by a 22 zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the turkey zzso zzso sequence to that of other avian zzso clones shows the coding region to be greater than zzso zzso while the zzso to zzso zzso sequences is between 68 and zzso Northern zzso analysis showed an approximate 800 zzso turkey zzso processed zzso transcript that zzso to the turkey zzso zzso zzso A large zzso of turkey zzso zzso occurred when intact cultured zzso were treated with 1 zzso human growth hormone releasing hormone but only modest changes were observed when cultures were treated with zzso releasing hormone or zzso
