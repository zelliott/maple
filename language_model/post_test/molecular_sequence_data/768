zzso zzso molecules possess simultaneously a zzso and a zzso However, a single zzso zzso has the potential to adopt two or perhaps more distinct zzso as a result of differential folding and/or zzso zzso Such zzso would be particularly significant if the zzso were functionally zzso in a common zzso zzso Here, this phenomenon is demonstrated by the ability of the zzso group I zzso to function when its zzso internal guide sequence zzso has been removed from the zzso end of the zzso and added back zzso in zzso The presence of zzso triplets in zzso fragments of the zzso allow zzso to occur in both a reverse zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso in which the internal guide sequence zzso zzso can put itself together from two of its component zzso Analysis of these reactions indicates that a single zzso zzso can perform up to three distinct roles in a zzso behaving as a portion of a zzso behaving as a zzso and providing an zzso zzso This property of zzso to be zzso in a single reaction zzso bolsters the probability that a system of zzso molecules could have existed in an zzso world during the origins of life on the zzso
