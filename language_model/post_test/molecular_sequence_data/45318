zzso zzso zzso zzso are a family of seven structurally related zzso zzso that are involved in the zzso zzso of zzso In an effort to examine the zzso protein for zzso zzso basic zzso zzso an zzso a potent protein inhibitor of zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso caused zzso of the 48 zzso protein in zzso zzso analysis indicates that the 48 zzso protein is a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso which had previously been predicted by zzso analysis of zzso from the human zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family of multiple zzso zzso proteins localized to the zzso zzso The most interesting feature of the zzso sequence is the presence of five zzso zzso which represents the target sequence of zzso zzso studies showed that zzso is zzso associated with zzso but not with mature zzso zzso of zzso maturation by a zzso zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso complex in zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso of zzso was increased upon zzso with zzso Our findings suggest that selective and transient association of zzso with the precursor of zzso plays an important role in the zzso of zzso
