The zzso family of cold shock genes in zzso coli K-12 includes nine zzso zzso to zzso Some of them have been implicated in cold stress zzso zzso for zzso among common laboratory zzso coli strains showed a high degree of genetic diversity in zzso but not in zzso and zzso This diversity in zzso was due to a wide spectrum of variations including insertions of IS zzso zzso and point zzso Northern analysis of these zzso showed loss of zzso expression in all but one zzso Further analysis of the zzso zzso zzso showed that they have a fitness advantage in broth culture after 24 h over their zzso zzso zzso zzso introduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso a competitive fitness advantage to zzso a commonly used laboratory zzso This provides the evidence that loss of zzso expression is both necessary and sufficient to zzso a gain of fitness as seen in broth culture over 24 zzso Together, these results ascribe a novel role in cellular growth at 37 degrees C for zzso a member of the cold shock zzso protein zzso
