In this study, we report the presence of the zzso element and Class I zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from zzso zzso zzso were resistant to zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso None contained zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and DNA sequencing revealed the presence of zzso resistance gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the Class I zzso and zzso an zzso zzso element containing zzso zzso and zzso in three and six of the zzso zzso zzso experiments, followed by zzso analysis of zzso provided evidence for the zzso nature of zzso and associated zzso resistance gene zzso This is the first report of the occurrence of zzso ICE, zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in environmental zzso zzso zzso zzso strains from zzso India, that had been isolated before zzso
