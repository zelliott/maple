zzso zzso zzso the reaction of zzso zzso and a long chain zzso zzso yielding zzso zzso acid, and zzso zzso The most zzso zzso region of the primary sequence zzso to a zzso zzso loop adjacent to the active center zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Baldwin, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso Fisher, zzso zzso Thompson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Baldwin, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the mobile loop does not alter the chemistry of the reaction but decreases the total quantum yield of zzso by 2 orders of magnitude zzso zzso zzso and Baldwin, zzso zzso (2001) zzso 40, zzso In this study, we attempt to zzso the loss of activity observed in the loop deletion zzso to individual zzso in the mobile zzso Using zzso zzso the effects of substitution at 15 of the 29 mobile loop zzso were zzso Nine of the point zzso had reduced activity in zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso resulted in a loss in quantum yield comparable with that of the loop deletion zzso The zzso zzso spectrum of both zzso was normal, and both yielded the zzso acid chemical product at the same efficiency as the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso resulted in zzso of intermediate II, whereas zzso of zzso had an increase in exposure of reaction zzso to a dynamic zzso Based on a model of the zzso zzso complex, the two critical zzso zzso are adjacent to the zzso edge of the zzso
