zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of Mr zzso It was originally described as a major component of human zzso alpha zzso and is essential for the secondary phase of zzso zzso zzso is also zzso and zzso by a variety of zzso cells where it functions in processes involving growth and zzso of cells to the zzso zzso Many of these processes are zzso and are zzso by a zzso zzso of zzso called the zzso binding domain zzso In order to facilitate the analysis of the structure and zzso of this domain, we have expressed this zzso in zzso zzso A zzso of a zzso zzso that encodes the zzso binding domain was inserted into the zzso expression zzso zzso In bacterial cells grown at 42 degrees C, this zzso directs the synthesis of a zzso zzso zzso quantities of this protein were zzso to zzso from zzso coli zzso The structure of the zzso zzso was confirmed by protein zzso The protein was further characterized by analysis of its zzso and zzso The zzso zzso binds zzso with a zzso of 71 zzso almost identical to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso is able to compete for zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso These studies indicate that the zzso zzso is zzso and zzso in a native zzso and is functionally equivalent to zzso zzso They further indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso is not necessary for its interaction with zzso and that sequences essential to this interaction reside within the first 229 zzso acids of zzso zzso
