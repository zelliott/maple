zzso systems are among the most zzso characteristics of flowering plants, with transitions frequently occurring among populations or in association with zzso The frequency of mating system shifts has made it difficult to reconstruct historical evolutionary dynamics unless transitions have been very zzso Here, we examine molecular and zzso variation to determine the zzso zzso and causes of a transition between zzso and zzso in sister subspecies of zzso zzso zzso analyses and zzso estimates of the time to most recent common zzso indicated that zzso is ancestral to zzso and that there has been a single origin of zzso Estimates of divergence time between zzso and zzso subspecies were 10,000 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso years ago zzso zzso zzso based on two different methods, suggesting a recent and rapid evolutionary zzso zzso genetic data indicated that the transition to zzso was associated with a zzso reduction in molecular diversity, which is much greater than the 50% reduction expected under a shift from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Our data also suggest that this severe loss of diversity was caused by colonization zzso Together with previous studies, evidence for zzso assurance in zzso zzso now connects variation in zzso interactions in the field to zzso and molecular zzso
