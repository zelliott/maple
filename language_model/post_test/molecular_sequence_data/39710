zzso a protein essential for zzso development and survival, is zzso by zzso hormone zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso exclusively in zzso zzso We report that a bacterial artificial zzso zzso reporter construct containing 120 zzso of zzso zzso region was zzso by zzso in zzso cells, but not other cell zzso Full zzso responsiveness was dependent upon a zzso zzso region located 76 zzso upstream from the zzso start site, which we identified by sequential deletion analysis and by comparison of human and mouse zzso sequences in zzso This region contained zzso consensus sequences which bound zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso and when zzso blunted zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso responsiveness of the zzso zzso gene in a zzso zzso Lastly, zzso responsiveness of the zzso zzso gene was zzso in mice from which we deleted this zzso upstream zzso Thus, zzso responsiveness of the zzso gene is determined by a distant regulatory region that responds to zzso in a zzso manner and zzso may contribute to such zzso zzso
