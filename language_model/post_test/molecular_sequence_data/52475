The interaction of different zzso zzso zzso with different cell types was investigated using a unique zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso in zzso equally with zzso zzso and zzso zzso but does not inhibit the binding of zzso to cell zzso zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso and zzso zzso bound to receptors on zzso zzso However, in a zzso zzso developed using zzso cells to measure zzso and zzso activity, zzso neutralized both activities of zzso zzso but neither of zzso zzso Similarly, in studies on the zzso of natural killer zzso cells, zzso neutralized the effect of zzso zzso but not that of zzso zzso In contrast, when cell lines other than zzso were zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso cells, zzso neutralized the zzso activity of both zzso zzso The zzso of one zzso zzso but not another on zzso cells suggests a difference either in the zzso form of the zzso or in subsequent interactions prerequisite for zzso of these zzso Furthermore, the zzso of a particular zzso zzso alpha zzso on zzso but not zzso cells suggests differences in the zzso complex or the mechanisms of cell zzso between these cell zzso An implication from these studies is that some zzso zzso can exert different functions on zzso and zzso zzso
