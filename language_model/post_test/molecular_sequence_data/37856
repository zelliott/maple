The basis for specificity of gene regulation by steroid hormone receptors remains an important problem in the study of steroid hormone zzso One possible mechanism for steroid specificity is the difference in DNA binding characteristics of the zzso although they share a high zzso in their zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso expression of, for example, the zzso zzso gene can be explained by the presence of an zzso response element zzso in its promoter zzso specifically recognized by the zzso and not by the zzso zzso Three zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso were identified as main zzso for its high affinity for the zzso In addition, the direct repeat nature of this ARE seems to prohibit high affinity binding by the zzso zzso This is confirmed by the fact that several imperfect direct repeats of the zzso core recognition sequence are recognized by the zzso zzso and not by the zzso zzso Up to now, only differences between the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso functions were invoked to explain the specificity of their zzso zzso In the present study, we describe the influence of the zzso domain on the specificity of zzso zzso The novelty of our working hypothesis resides in the demonstration of the capacity of the zzso domain to recognize elements with a direct repeat zzso
