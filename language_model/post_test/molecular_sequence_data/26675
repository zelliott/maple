With rates of climate change exceeding the rate at which many species are able to shift their range or adapt, it is important to understand how future changes are likely to affect zzso at all levels of zzso zzso past responses and extent of niche conservatism in zzso tolerance can help predict future zzso We use an integrated approach to determine the genetic consequences of past and future climate changes on a bat species, zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted by zzso match those identified from analyses of extant genetic diversity and zzso zzso of demographic zzso Former zzso populations currently contain disproportionately high genetic diversity, but niche conservatism, shifts in suitable areas and barriers to migration mean that these hotspots of genetic diversity are under threat from future climate zzso Evidence of population decline despite recent zzso migration highlights the need to conserve zzso populations for zzso future range zzso
