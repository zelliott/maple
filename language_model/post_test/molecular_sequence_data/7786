zzso zzso zzso recognized an zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso We isolated zzso and determined its zzso and deduced zzso acid zzso The zzso had an open reading frame of 825 zzso acids and its zzso acid sequence showed no significant zzso to any protein or to any DNA binding motif so far zzso zzso protein had an abundance of basic zzso zzso especially zzso and included a zzso region and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso fusion protein recognized an zzso substance in rat brain sections and a single protein band of about 98 zzso in the brain nuclear extract fraction on zzso zzso column zzso indicated that zzso protein might have zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso protein expressed in zzso is localized in cell zzso These results suggest that zzso protein is a possible zzso protein which is expressed especially in zzso
