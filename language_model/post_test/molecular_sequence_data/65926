zzso are one of the zzso proteins found at tight junctions zzso they constitute the backbone of zzso strands and comprise a zzso zzso zzso share a zzso sequence at the zzso which is considered to be a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso with enhanced green fluorescent protein at the zzso zzso induced zzso strands in zzso II cells, even though zzso has the zzso zzso zzso analysis by zzso electron zzso revealed that the mean number of zzso zzso strands increased by zzso in zzso cells, zzso in zzso cells, and zzso in zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso strands increased remarkably in zzso and zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso When zzso cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso were zzso with parent zzso cells, which express zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso could not be concentrated at the zzso zzso region between the zzso cells, though zzso zzso These results suggest that not only binding to zzso but also head-to-head zzso between zzso species, is involved in organizing zzso proteins at the zzso zzso zzso
