Two zzso genes zzso zzso zzso receptors termed B1 and B2 have been identified by molecular cloning zzso Some pharmacological data suggest the existence of further zzso of the B2 zzso To zzso determine whether additional genes zzso B2 BK receptors might exist in zzso steps have been taken toward the generation of mice with a zzso of the BK B2 zzso A zzso clone of the mouse B2 BK zzso was isolated and its coding sequence determined by DNA sequence zzso A physical map of the DNA zzso this coding sequence was zzso A zzso zzso was constructed for targeted disruption of the mouse B2 zzso zzso This zzso contains 1 zzso zzso of DNA upstream the mouse B2 zzso coding zzso a zzso resistance gene zzso and zzso zzso of DNA downstream of the B2 zzso coding zzso Thus, the correct zzso zzso event will result in a zzso in which the coding sequence for the mouse B2 BK zzso is replaced with the zzso resistance zzso zzso was zzso into embryonic stem cells, and clones containing a targeted disruption of the mouse B2 BK zzso were zzso
