zzso component zzso is a zzso zzso protein required for zzso transmission of zzso In the tobacco vein zzso virus zzso zzso zzso represents a zzso zzso zzso from zzso acid position zzso to zzso Previous sequence comparison studies have suggested that zzso of one or two specific zzso acid zzso in the zzso protein might result in loss of zzso transmission zzso To test this hypothesis, the initial targets were the zzso corresponding to these specific zzso zzso a zzso to zzso change and an zzso to zzso change at zzso acid positions 307 and zzso respectively, of the zzso zzso as well as the combination of the zzso Two additional zzso within the zzso representing zzso changes zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso at zzso acid positions zzso and zzso respectively, were also tested to further define the effects of zzso in this region on helper component zzso The zzso at positions zzso and zzso had no effect on zzso transmission activity, while zzso at position 307 completely abolished the zzso Except for the zzso zzso all the zzso also affected zzso and virus zzso in infected zzso Due to the very low zzso of zzso in plants infected with the zzso zzso the effect of this zzso change on zzso transmission activity could not be zzso The majority of the tested zzso fall within a putative zzso motif zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso The possible role of this motif in the zzso is further discussed in the light of our present results with zzso
