The human zzso zzso zzso represents one of the most thoroughly studied zzso zzso zzso Despite this, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the zzso and zzso of this zzso To assess the role of zzso in zzso function, zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso to express the zzso human zzso Three zzso forms of the zzso lacking specific zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso C zzso were studied with respect to zzso and zzso Replacement of all 11 zzso and zzso zzso within the C zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso capable of zzso binding and G protein zzso similar to the zzso zzso However, whereas the zzso zzso was zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso upon exposure to zzso and displayed a significantly reduced ability to stimulate G zzso zzso zzso upon subsequent exposure to zzso zzso demonstrated a complete lack of zzso and displayed little zzso in its ability to stimulate G zzso zzso zzso upon a subsequent exposure to zzso In addition to zzso of G zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso was zzso to test whether zzso occurred at a site zzso to G protein zzso However, as observed with G protein zzso zzso underwent no zzso of the calcium zzso response upon a second exposure to zzso To define more precisely the role of specific zzso and zzso zzso two additional zzso were zzso Replacement either of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted in functional receptors that exhibited approximately 50% the level of zzso following zzso Whereas zzso A, like zzso could not be significantly zzso by exposure to zzso zzso B exhibited partial zzso These results indicate that zzso of the zzso is a necessary and sufficient step in cellular zzso that multiple zzso sites are involved, and that redundant zzso does not occur downstream of G protein zzso in the signaling zzso
