The zzso zzso gene sine zzso and its zzso zzso zzso have both been shown to have regulatory functions in eye and brain zzso In zzso three zzso genes with zzso expression during early eye and head formation have been zzso One of these, zzso is first expressed at the zzso stage in the zzso zzso zzso and later in the zzso zzso from which the zzso and zzso zzso zzso To zzso the mechanisms regulating zzso zzso we isolated a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Three zzso deleted fragments of this upstream region were used to produce zzso reporter zzso for analysis of zzso expression in zzso zzso The results show that a zzso upstream zzso is sufficient to direct strong expression of the reporter during zzso and early zzso The zzso part of the promoter contains binding sites for various zzso zzso factors and an additional upstream element that was shown to be critical in directing expression to the anterior region of the zzso zzso
