The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a clinical isolate from Italy that was previously shown to produce an zzso related to zzso was isolated by means of a zzso methodology which targets amplification of gene cassette zzso inserted into class 1 zzso zzso revealed that this zzso was an zzso zzso (named zzso of zzso found in Japanese zzso and that it was divergent from the latter by zzso of its zzso zzso which evidently had been acquired zzso Similar to zzso zzso was also carried by an zzso gene zzso However, the zzso element of the zzso cassette was unrelated to those of the zzso zzso found in Japanese zzso indicating a different zzso for the gene zzso carrying the two zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene in zzso coli resulted in a significant decrease in zzso to a broad array of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was zzso from an zzso coli strain carrying the cloned zzso and kinetic parameters were determined with several zzso zzso Compared to zzso the kinetic parameters of zzso were similar overall with some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but remarkably different with others zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealing a functional significance of at least some of the zzso that differentiate the two zzso zzso Present findings suggest that the environmental zzso of zzso zzso could be widespread and raise a question about the global risk of their transfer to clinically relevant zzso
