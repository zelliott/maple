zzso termination is emerging as an important component of gene regulation necessary to partition the zzso and minimize zzso zzso We have discovered a role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso in zzso termination of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directly associates with zzso zzso in the 3' region and promotes zzso of the nascent transcript in a domain downstream of the zzso zzso zzso In a zzso zzso the resulting zzso zzso triggers an zzso zzso gene zzso of a zzso containing the same 3' zzso We conclude that zzso promotes zzso termination of the zzso zzso zzso reducing the amount of zzso zzso produced from the zzso
