Little is known about the signal zzso pathways by which cells respond to zzso zzso s or to zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the genetic and molecular characterization of zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso factor implicated in zzso zzso The zzso protein has eight zinc fingers and is related to a human zzso factor, zzso that binds to nuclear zzso zzso sites and activates zzso from the zzso long terminal repeat zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a dynamic pattern in the zzso that includes most of the known target zzso of zzso including the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso 4 and 7 of the zzso zzso in zzso affect several zzso processes regulated by zzso including induction of visceral zzso cell fate, zzso patterning of the lateral zzso and wing vein zzso zzso of zzso function blocks the expanded expression of the zzso protein zzso in the embryonic zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso illustrating a requirement for zzso function downstream of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso function is critical for cells to respond properly to zzso and propose that zzso protein is the first identified downstream component of the signal zzso zzso used by zzso and its zzso
