A gene cluster which includes genes required for the expression of zzso oxide zzso in zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso zzso analysis indicates that the two zzso genes in the cluster are the Nor structural zzso These two genes and four zzso genes apparently constitute an zzso zzso analysis indicates that the two structural zzso zzso and zzso and the genes immediately zzso zzso and zzso are required for expression of an active Nor zzso The remaining two zzso zzso and zzso are required for expression of both zzso and zzso The products of zzso have significant identity with products from other zzso whereas the predicted zzso and zzso gene products have no similarity with products corresponding to other sequences in the zzso zzso analysis and functional zzso studies indicate that the zzso and zzso genes can be expressed from an internal zzso zzso analysis of the regulatory region upstream of zzso indicated that a sequence motif which has identity to a motif in the gene zzso zzso zzso in strain zzso is critical for nor zzso zzso Regulatory studies demonstrated that the first four zzso zzso are expressed only when the oxygen concentration is low and nitrate is present but that the two zzso zzso zzso are expressed zzso
