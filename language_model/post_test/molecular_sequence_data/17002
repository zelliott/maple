zzso zzso from zzso zzso is known as a useful zzso for the synthesis of zzso due to its zzso zzso We cloned the zzso gene zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso which shows high identity to zzso zzso family 85 zzso The gene zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso with a molecular mass of 85 zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso could liberate both zzso type and zzso complex type zzso from zzso which was same as the native zzso The zzso and zzso values for zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also exhibited zzso activity toward zzso type and zzso complex type zzso which were transferred to zzso zzso zzso and zzso To investigate about the zzso essential zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso was performed, and it was found that zzso zzso and zzso completely abolished the zzso activity and zzso partially abolished the zzso zzso
