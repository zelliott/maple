zzso zzso zzso are found in a large number of proteins with diverse functions involved in zzso DNA repair, and signaling zzso Recent studies have shown that several zzso domain proteins interact with zzso zzso specifically zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso a human zzso zzso repair zzso and zzso another zzso zzso zzso chemical shift mapping reveals that zzso binds specifically but zzso to a zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso and that the zzso zzso bind on the zzso patch on the surface of the zzso zzso of zzso Models of the zzso and zzso complexes obtained from de zzso zzso reveal different zzso of the zzso zzso on the zzso surface compared with those obtained by zzso modeling with the related zzso zzso which also bind zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso may interact with zzso as well as other proteins in more than one way while utilizing the same binding zzso
