Fluorescence imaging provides a powerful technique to zzso zzso dynamics of zzso in living cells, if fluorescent zzso for the relevant zzso become zzso Here I describe a fluorescent zzso for a zzso second messenger, zzso zzso zzso The zzso overcomes limitations of existing methods for the zzso analysis and allows us to pinpoint that the zzso zzso are increasing and/or decreasing not only at the plasma membrane but also at zzso zzso such as the zzso apparatus zzso and zzso zzso zzso The present zzso has also been shown to be zzso to a variety of zzso second zzso including zzso and zzso zzso
