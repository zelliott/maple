zzso of the gene zzso zzso a zzso cellular zzso are found frequently in human tumor cells, suggesting a crucial role for this gene in human zzso To model the zzso zzso or loss of both zzso zzso during zzso a human zzso cell line, zzso was used that completely lacked zzso zzso Single copies of zzso zzso genes were then introduced by infecting cells with zzso zzso containing either zzso or zzso versions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso of zzso cells, whereas expression of zzso zzso zzso a limited growth advantage to cells in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso dominant to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso These results suggest that, as with the zzso zzso zzso of both zzso of the zzso gene is essential for its role in zzso
