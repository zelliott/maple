zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that triggers zzso responses, zzso zzso and zzso opening to maximize the efficiency of photosynthesis in higher zzso zzso is composed of three functional zzso The zzso half folds into two zzso zzso called zzso and zzso each binding a zzso zzso to absorb blue zzso The zzso half is a zzso zzso domain that causes zzso zzso leading to cellular signaling zzso zzso domain is primarily responsible for zzso of the zzso and zzso domain is thought to act as a zzso site and to regulate sensitivity to zzso by blue zzso Here we show the crystal structures of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the dark at resolutions of zzso A and zzso A, zzso Either zzso domain forms a zzso through face-to-face association of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Three types of interactions stabilizing the zzso structures found are as zzso contacts of side chains in their zzso zzso interactions of a short zzso found in the zzso of a zzso with the zzso of both zzso and hydrogen bonds zzso by zzso water molecules filling the zzso zzso The critical zzso for zzso are zzso forming a zzso bridge between zzso in zzso domain, and zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso in zzso associations of the zzso zzso is discussed when referring to those of zzso or zzso of zzso or zzso zzso The present results also provide clues to understanding structural basis in zzso interactions of zzso protein zzso in cellular zzso
