A zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso tumor zzso and Ewing's zzso zzso zzso is the zzso hallmark of zzso small round cell tumor zzso a primitive zzso zzso arising in zzso zzso zzso transcripts generated by this zzso zzso an zzso zzso factor that zzso the zzso region of zzso with a 3' zzso zzso We describe the zzso of a zzso DNA mobile genetic element at the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso DNA segment with zzso to the zzso DNA consensus sequence was located between zzso zzso 8 and zzso zzso 8 in the zzso rearranged zzso zzso zzso corresponded to the zzso zzso which encodes a protein with zzso zzso The zzso inserted zzso was not evident in the zzso of normal tissue from the patient, suggesting that zzso occurred in zzso cells, possibly during the process of zzso zzso This case represents the first example of zzso DNA zzso at the fusion site of a zzso zzso zzso
