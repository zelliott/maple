The focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays important roles in cell zzso in zzso Using zzso chain zzso cloning strategy, we cloned a zzso gene that is zzso to the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso We designated this gene zzso and characterized its gene zzso The overall protein structure and deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso show significant similarity to those of zzso and zzso zzso has in zzso zzso activity at zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the protein was observed in the central nervous system and the zzso attachment site in the zzso where zzso zzso zzso are zzso The results suggest that like zzso in zzso zzso functions downstream of zzso zzso was zzso upon zzso attachment of the cell to the zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso cell zzso signaling and thus is a functional zzso of zzso zzso
