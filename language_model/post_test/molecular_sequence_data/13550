The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso with 4 zinc fingers that is essential for the development of the zzso zzso A considerable body of evidence exists to support the idea that zzso binds DNA and functions as a zzso zzso However, we have shown recently by zzso zzso and zzso studies that a significant proportion of zzso is associated with zzso factors in kidney cell lines, fetal zzso and zzso zzso zzso Different zzso of zzso are produced by an alternative zzso that leads to the presence or absence of a 3 zzso acid zzso zzso between zinc fingers 3 and zzso We have shown that these different forms zzso differently in the zzso The zzso form mainly zzso with zzso factors, the zzso form mainly with zzso zzso Here we propose a model to account for these different zzso Also, we discuss the possible significance of these zzso
