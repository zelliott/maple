Although zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to be an zzso zzso with possible zzso to the zzso zzso V from zzso T4 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Park, zzso and Grossman, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this study describes three independent zzso schemes in which zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso activity was associated with two proteins of apparent molecular masses of 31 and 32 zzso An zzso contaminant zzso with the zzso through many of the zzso steps, but it was determined to be a zzso of zzso coli zzso protein zzso zzso degradation analyses of the active proteins yielded identical zzso zzso acid zzso The corresponding gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The protein bears strong sequence similarities to the zzso coli repair proteins zzso III and zzso Nonetheless, traditionally zzso zzso zzso protein acted exclusively on zzso zzso zzso it was unable to cleave zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso or an zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA in a zzso manner and exhibited linear zzso within that dose zzso zzso activity was inhibited by the presence of zzso or zzso with zzso additionally being able to trap a zzso zzso zzso These last findings confirm that the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso like those of other zzso zzso involves an zzso zzso
