A primary isolate zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso resistant to zzso soluble zzso zzso was isolated from an zzso individual and grown in a T zzso cell zzso zzso isolate zzso on zzso cells zzso was still resistant to zzso The zzso and zzso regions of the viral envelope zzso are thought to be involved in various biological zzso To determine the exact envelope region of the zzso isolate responsible for sensitivity to zzso and cellular zzso we performed sequence analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso isolate showed that the sequence of the zzso region was relatively zzso whereas a considerable zzso of the zzso region was zzso In contrast, the sequences of the zzso to zzso regions were homogeneous in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso viruses with amplified sequences of the zzso to zzso regions from zzso and zzso zzso showed that the zzso region modulated the sensitivity to zzso A change in resistance to zzso by the zzso region was associated with the ability of the isolate to replicate in zzso and efficiently replicate in T zzso cell zzso A change to an isolate sensitive to zzso was associated with reduced replication efficiency in T zzso cell zzso Our results suggest that the zzso region is involved in modulating the sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso and replication efficiency in T zzso cell zzso
