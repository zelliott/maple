The bovine zzso and zzso zzso exhibit large differences in zzso zzso To examine the structural basis for this, the zzso structures of zzso and zzso were investigated by zzso zzso scattering using a recently developed camera zzso This method reports on the average relative disposition in solution of the zzso and zzso fragments in zzso The zzso of zzso zzso were found to be similar at zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso respectively in zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso of zzso zzso were also similar at zzso and zzso zzso Similar values were obtained for zzso zzso Both bovine zzso and zzso possess similar overall solution structures, despite sequence differences at the hinge region at the zzso of their zzso An automated computer survey of possible zzso structures was developed, in which coordinates for the two zzso fragments were displaced in a two-dimensional plane relative to those of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The scattering zzso calculated from these structures were found to be sensitive to relative zzso of the three fragments, but not on their zzso orientation about their longest zzso Good agreement with the solution scattering data was obtained with a zzso zzso model in which the zzso of the zzso domain of zzso was zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso in both zzso and zzso with a precision of zzso zzso Energy refinement showed that this spatial separation is compatible with the hinge sequences of bovine zzso and zzso The results show that zzso protein structures can be zzso using zzso data, and that a long hinge sequence does not necessarily reflect a large distance between zzso and zzso The zzso accessibility of zzso sites for interactions with zzso zzso receptors and zzso of complement is shown to be generally similar for zzso and zzso and the difference in zzso function between zzso and zzso is probably based on deletions in the zzso hinge zzso
