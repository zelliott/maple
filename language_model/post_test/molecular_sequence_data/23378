zzso mediates the nuclear export of proteins bearing a zzso nuclear export signal zzso by forming a cooperative zzso complex with the zzso zzso and the small zzso zzso We present a structural model of human zzso based on a combination of X-ray zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso The architecture of zzso resembles that of the import zzso zzso with 19 zzso repeats and a large loop implicated in Ran zzso zzso critical for zzso recognition are identified adjacent to the zzso zzso targeted by zzso B zzso a specific zzso zzso We present evidence that a zzso change of the Ran binding loop accounts for the zzso of zzso and zzso binding and for the selective enhancement of zzso export by the zzso zzso Our findings indicate that a single architectural and zzso framework can explain the divergent effects of zzso on zzso binding by many import and export zzso
