The zzso and animal zzso and related zzso complexes are thought to play an important role in zzso such as zzso factor binding to regulatory zzso which require zzso zzso in order to relieve the zzso effect of packaging DNA in zzso There are two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of either one of them has been shown to enhance zzso zzso by zzso estrogen, and zzso acid zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso We have investigated here the function of zzso in the zzso zzso X zzso zzso of the zzso signal in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells which differentiate into zzso cells upon zzso zzso The two zzso zzso have been targeted by zzso zzso and subsequently disrupted by using a conditional zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso cells zzso on both zzso zzso are not viable and that zzso zzso cells are affected in proliferation but not in zzso zzso Thus, in zzso zzso cells, zzso appears to play an essential role in zzso processes involved in cell zzso in addition to its putative role in the zzso of zzso zzso by nuclear zzso
