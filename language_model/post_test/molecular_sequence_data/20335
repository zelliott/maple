zzso is a gene expressed in human zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso Here, identification and molecular evolutionary analysis of zzso proteins in various zzso animals including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso A multiple sequence alignment revealed two highly zzso regions in zzso proteins that had no similarity to any other known zzso or zzso zzso sequence analysis showed frequent shifting of the zzso sites of zzso 1 in zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso positions in the coding region showed that the zzso structure of the zzso gene was established in an early zzso zzso and that independent loss of a single zzso occurred in zzso and in zzso The zzso zzso zzso genes are zzso possibly due to replacement of the original gene by a zzso No zzso was detected in birds, insects, zzso and zzso zzso despite the extensive sequence data of these species, zzso that the zzso gene might be lost in these zzso
