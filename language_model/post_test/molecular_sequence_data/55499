zzso is a group of diseases with a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from zzso zzso to visceral zzso which results from the bite of an infected zzso to zzso Attempts to develop an effective vaccine have been shown to be feasible but no vaccine is in active clinical zzso This study adopts a zzso zzso approach to identify common vaccine candidates from both highly zzso species zzso major and zzso zzso Total zzso of both species were compared to identify common zzso which are further taken for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Plasma membrane proteins having only one zzso zzso were first identified and analyzed which are zzso in human and mouse in order to avoid molecular mimicry with other zzso zzso proteins were analyzed for their binding efficiency to both major zzso complex zzso class I and class II zzso As a result, 19 potential zzso are screened in this study using different approaches, which can be further verified through in zzso experiments in zzso compatible animal zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso approach has potential in discovering various zzso zzso from in zzso analysis of zzso zzso or zzso instead of zzso the whole zzso by conventional zzso
