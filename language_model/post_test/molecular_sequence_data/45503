The zzso zzso of G zzso receptors zzso frequently contain binding sites for zzso zzso However, the mechanism of zzso zzso following zzso binding and the influence of the zzso zzso in other aspects of zzso function are poorly zzso Here we report a zzso analysis of the first and third zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso a zzso that binds a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid zzso were randomly incorporated into each loop, and functional receptors were identified in zzso The first zzso loop contains a large number of positions that cannot tolerate zzso acid zzso especially zzso within the zzso motif found in many zzso zzso yet disruption of these zzso does not alter zzso binding zzso These results demonstrate an unanticipated role for the first zzso loop, and the zzso motif in particular, in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This motif likely serves a similar role in other zzso The third zzso loop, in contrast, contains far fewer preserved zzso and appears to play a less essential role in zzso zzso
