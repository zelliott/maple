zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell survival, zzso and zzso The zzso basis by which zzso controls these outcomes is zzso although early events following zzso of the zzso are characterized by zzso zzso of zzso and other cellular zzso We demonstrate that following zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso activity is increased in parallel to zzso of the T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso and zzso zzso activities are not zzso We show that zzso forms an zzso complex with zzso zzso by the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso motifs of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso motif of zzso abrogates the association of zzso with the zzso domain of zzso while zzso within the zzso zzso motif have little zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso motif were more efficient at zzso the interaction between zzso and the zzso domain of zzso than peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso In addition, peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso motif of zzso activated the zzso zzso activity of zzso to levels similar to those observed following zzso zzso of zzso Together, our data show that the zzso domain of zzso binds to a zzso motif within the zzso tail of zzso and define a mechanism by which zzso couples to and activates a downstream zzso zzso
