zzso zzso virus zzso causes one of the most widespread and important virus diseases in zzso Resistance to zzso is controlled by genetic factors that limit plant infection by zzso zzso or virus zzso and zzso zzso trait locus zzso analysis of resistance to virus zzso revealed one major and two minor zzso The major zzso zzso mapped to potato zzso zzso in a resistance hotspot containing several genes for qualitative and quantitative resistance to viruses and other potato zzso This zzso explained between 50 and zzso of the zzso zzso The two minor zzso mapped to zzso V and zzso Genes with sequence similarity to the tobacco N gene for resistance to zzso mosaic virus were tightly linked to zzso The zzso sequence of an zzso gene was used to develop the sequence characterized amplified region zzso marker zzso that can assist in the selection of potatoes with resistance to zzso
