The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expresses a zzso zzso in which zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso function as zzso iron zzso zzso zzso can be displaced by zzso zzso and zzso among others, whereas zzso is not zzso under native zzso The zzso preceding the zzso zzso has been implicated in controlling zzso zzso zzso zzso the details of the zzso however, are not well zzso and little information exists for zzso zzso zzso In many zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso the position is occupied by an zzso zzso in zzso it is a zzso involved in an intricate zzso zzso We examined the role of zzso in zzso zzso through the effects of an Ala zzso zzso zzso The substitution resulted in minor structural zzso but the response of the zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso was measurably zzso zzso zzso behavior was zzso in the decoupling of zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso gel experiments revealed that the stability of the zzso was unchanged by the replacement and that a slight zzso of the folding zzso occurred in the zzso zzso experiments were performed to assess trans zzso The apparent rate constant for association decreased zzso upon zzso zzso This zzso was attributed to a change in the lifetime of a state containing a zzso zzso The results demonstrated that, as in zzso zzso and zzso zzso influences operate to determine fundamental dynamic and zzso properties of the zzso
