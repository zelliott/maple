zzso protein zzso zzso is the only zzso zzso activated by DNA zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso severe combined immune zzso in mice and radiation zzso Both the immune and the radiation defects are due to a failure in zzso break zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso zzso activity is zzso by the presence of the DNA end binding zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in its zzso Based on these studies, zzso is presumed to play a direct and important role in the repair of zzso breaks, but the details of its role are quite zzso We have done zzso analysis of this entire protein to identify other proteins with which it zzso Thus far, extensive analysis has only revealed one strong interaction that zzso both high genetic and zzso zzso The interaction is with a novel human protein that has zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso We discuss the interaction of zzso with this novel zzso protein family member in the context of possible zzso regulation of DNA end zzso
