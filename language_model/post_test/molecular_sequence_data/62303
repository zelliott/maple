The large zzso distances between the three rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggest that the persistence time of the zzso zzso could amount to 50 million years, which is much longer than that of zzso zzso zzso originated in the zzso Peninsula where two subspecies zzso one of which is confined to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We studied the zzso zzso in the original species range to obtain a better understanding of the evolutionary history of this unusual zzso zzso surveys revealed that zzso from the subspecies zzso when tested with zzso zzso zzso showed either zzso zzso zzso or no reaction at all zzso Using zzso we determined 120 sequences of rearranged zzso genes expressed in seven zzso rabbits that were typed as either zzso or zzso The data show that the zzso genes transcribed in zzso rabbits are closely related to the zzso zzso of domestic zzso In contrast, zzso rabbits were found to zzso use zzso genes that, although clearly related to the known zzso zzso define a new major zzso zzso designated zzso The zzso sequences have hallmark rabbit zzso zzso together with a number of unprecedented zzso acid changes in framework region 2 and zzso The net protein distances between the zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso lineages were 20, 29, and zzso zzso We conclude that at least four zzso related lineages of the rabbit zzso locus exist, one of which seems to be endemic in the zzso zzso
