zzso sour cherry zzso zzso exhibits a zzso loss of zzso zzso that is caused by the zzso of zzso zzso with disrupted zzso component zzso and/or zzso component zzso zzso zzso studies using diverse sour cherry zzso identified zzso zzso for which an equivalent zzso zzso was present in sweet cherry zzso zzso a zzso zzso of sour zzso In all cases, the zzso zzso resulted from zzso affecting the zzso component zzso or zzso zzso component zzso zzso protein zzso This study determines the molecular bases of three of these zzso that zzso unilateral zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso Compared to their zzso zzso zzso has a 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso has a 23 zzso deletion and zzso has a 1 zzso substitution that lead to premature stop zzso zzso were identified for these three zzso zzso zzso and zzso however, these transcripts presumably result in altered proteins with a resulting loss of zzso Our characterization of natural zzso and zzso zzso in sour cherry along with other natural zzso zzso identified in zzso supports the view that loss of zzso specificity and zzso rejection evolve independently and are caused by structural zzso affecting the zzso The prevalence of zzso zzso in sour cherry but not in sweet cherry (a zzso suggests that zzso and gene zzso were indirectly responsible for the dysfunction of some zzso and the emergence of zzso in sour zzso This resembles the specific mode of evolution in zzso where accelerated evolution occurred to one member of the duplicated gene zzso
