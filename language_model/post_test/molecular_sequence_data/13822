zzso metabolism in zzso involves the coordinated expression of a large number of zzso concerned with both zzso of zzso nitrogen sources and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The control of this expression is determined by the availability of fixed nitrogen to the cell and is zzso by complex regulatory networks involving regulation at both the zzso and zzso zzso While the most detailed studies to date have been carried out with enteric bacteria, there is a considerable body of evidence to show that the nitrogen regulation zzso systems described in the zzso extend to many other zzso Furthermore, as the range of bacteria in which the phenomenon of nitrogen control is examined is being extended, new regulatory mechanisms are also being zzso In this review, we have attempted to zzso recent research in zzso nitrogen zzso to show the ubiquity of the zzso system, at least in zzso zzso and to identify those areas and groups of organisms about which there is much still to zzso
