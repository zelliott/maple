The zzso zzso complex is required for zzso regulation both in zzso and in zzso and its function is zzso in all zzso zzso interacts with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso II, but little is known about the mechanisms by which it operates at the molecular zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso interacts with, and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso both in zzso and in zzso A point zzso of the single zzso site in zzso results in a strongly reduced expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are all located on the zzso zzso zzso Combined with previous studies on the effects of zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso modifications of zzso zzso are important for regulation of gene zzso
