The major zzso zzso from cod, designated zzso M zzso c 1, has been zzso studied both from the structural and zzso zzso In the present study, transcripts of two zzso zzso genes in Atlantic cod were identified and zzso zzso zzso were inserted into the expression zzso zzso generating plasmids with coding capacity for complete zzso zzso fused to an zzso zzso zzso Most of the zzso products were found in the soluble fraction of the expression host zzso zzso The target proteins showed to react with zzso zzso raised against zzso M and demonstrated binding to specific zzso from 12 zzso of patients allergic to cod in zzso zzso zzso zzso with classes 4 and 5 zzso zzso exhibited also strong binding to zzso zzso in zzso
