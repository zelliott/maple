A zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso initiation zzso gene was isolated in a screen for zzso defective in zzso We have cloned zzso and have found that zzso encodes a previously unknown zzso protein that zzso to the zzso pole body zzso throughout the cell zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso of key regulators of zzso zzso including the zzso zzso the protein zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso An zzso truncated zzso zzso does not zzso to zzso and when zzso acts as a zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso the zzso zzso 153 zzso acids are sufficient for zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso interacts with itself, and zzso zzso analysis shows that its zzso domain lies within the zzso half of the zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso zzso is a prerequisite for the execution of the zzso signaling zzso
