zzso cassette zzso zzso zzso is a mobile genetic element composed of the zzso gene complex, which encodes zzso resistance, and the zzso gene complex, which encodes the zzso responsible for its zzso The zzso gene complex has been classified into four classes, and the zzso gene complex has been classified into three zzso Different combinations of zzso gene complex classes and zzso gene complex types have so far defined four types of zzso zzso Now we introduce the fifth zzso of zzso which was found on the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso isolated in zzso The element shared the same zzso integration site with the four extant types of zzso and the characteristic zzso sequences at the zzso junction zzso The novel zzso carried zzso bracketed by zzso zzso which is designated the class C2 zzso gene complex; and instead of zzso and zzso zzso it carried a single copy of a gene zzso that zzso cassette zzso zzso Since the open reading frame zzso was found to zzso an zzso which zzso the precise zzso as well as zzso and zzso integration of the element, we designated the zzso cassette zzso zzso C zzso and we designated the element type V zzso Type V zzso is a small zzso element zzso zzso and does not carry any zzso resistance genes besides zzso Unlike the extant zzso types, it carries a set of foreign genes zzso a zzso system that might play a role in the stabilization of the element on the zzso
