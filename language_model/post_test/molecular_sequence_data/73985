Several strains of a strictly zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were isolated from deep marine sediments zzso 80 and 500 zzso obtained from the Japan Sea zzso zzso Program zzso zzso site zzso This zzso was identified as a member of the zzso zzso on the basis of the presence of zzso and characteristic zzso fatty acids zzso zzso omega 7 and iso zzso the small number of growth zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso gene sequence analysis zzso Based on data for zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso all of the Japan Sea strains were identical to each other and were most closely related to zzso zzso and less closely related to zzso zzso zzso of zzso 91 and zzso zzso There were, however, considerable zzso differences (in temperatures, pressures, and zzso zzso growth zzso and electron zzso between the Japan Sea zzso and the type strains of previously described zzso as well as important differences among the Japan Sea zzso The Japan Sea zzso were active (with zzso zzso over a wide temperature range (15 to 65 degrees zzso and a wide sodium zzso concentration range zzso to zzso zzso zzso and they were zzso that were active at pressures up to about 40 zzso zzso zzso The optimum pressures for activity corresponded to the calculated pressures at the depths from which the organisms were isolated (for zzso obtained at depths of 80 and 500 m the optimum activities occurred at 10 and 15 zzso respectively zzso and 150 zzso zzso This confirms that the organisms came from deep sediments and indicates that they are zzso for deep zzso conditions, which is consistent with other characteristics zzso of hydrogen, zzso and zzso of zzso iron and organic zzso as electron zzso We propose that Japan Sea isolate zzso is the type strain of a new species, zzso zzso
