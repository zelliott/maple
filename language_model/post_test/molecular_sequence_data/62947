zzso zzso is one of the most valuable medicinal zzso in the zzso It is naturally distributed in the eastern extension area of the zzso zzso at an altitude over zzso m zzso In order to investigate genetic variation and evolutionary relationships of zzso zzso from different geographical regions, 17 zzso of zzso zzso were collected from different provinces and the complete sequences of zzso ITS were zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and ITS region analysis, it was clearly shown that the ITS sequences within zzso zzso are highly zzso regardless of geographical zzso The distance values between the sequences in this study were lower than zzso This implied that zzso zzso from different geographic regions are the same zzso they are not different species or a species zzso The results also showed that distance values between zzso zzso and zzso zzso are of the same order as those within zzso zzso from different geographic zzso This confirmed our previous results that zzso zzso should only have zzso zzso as its asexual stage whatever the geographic region from which the samples were zzso An zzso ITS clone library was established to obtain further evidence for the interpretation of the zzso community structure from zzso zzso and to confirm the accuracy of the zzso identities produced by directly sequencing the zzso ITS zzso The discrimination between zzso of zzso zzso might provide additional data for the zzso of medicinal material at the species or zzso zzso
