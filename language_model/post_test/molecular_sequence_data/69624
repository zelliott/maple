Here a method is described to identify genes zzso proteins that recognize a specific DNA zzso A bank of random protein segments zzso with a zzso zzso domain is screened for proteins that can activate a reporter gene containing the sequence in its zzso This strategy was used to identify an essential protein that interacts in zzso with the zzso origin of DNA zzso zzso between its predicted zzso acid sequence and zzso sequence obtained from the zzso zzso of the zzso origin recognition complex zzso established that the gene isolated here, zzso encodes this zzso These observations provide evidence that zzso recognizes zzso replication origins in zzso
