In this chapter we review the various methods available to the zzso to zzso zzso zzso The initial steps in such an analysis involve the isolation of the zzso for analysis, and we outline the various current methods such as zzso metal affinity zzso zzso acid zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and TLC zzso zzso zzso The isolated peptides can be zzso by chemical modification followed by zzso degradation or by mass zzso zzso We focus on zzso methods and give examples illustrating the selective detection and sequencing of zzso
