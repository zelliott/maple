zzso and productive virus infection often requires viral zzso that block innate zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso L are components of a potent host zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso coronavirus zzso accessory protein zzso a zzso zzso zzso member, is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso thereby preventing zzso of zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso is required for zzso replication in zzso and for zzso Here, we show that group A zzso zzso an important cause of acute zzso in children worldwide, encodes a similar zzso The zzso zzso forms the zzso domain of the minor core protein zzso zzso and shares sequence and predicted structural zzso with zzso including two zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso exhibited zzso activity, which zzso zzso in zzso In addition, zzso expressed zzso in zzso cells depleted zzso levels induced by zzso zzso with zzso preventing zzso L zzso In the context of zzso zzso zzso expressing inactive zzso zzso restored the ability of the virus to replicate efficiently in zzso or in the zzso of infected mice, whereas zzso viruses expressing inactive zzso zzso or zzso were zzso In addition, zzso viruses expressing either active zzso or zzso but not zzso zzso were able to protect zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso able to functionally substitute for zzso in zzso zzso zzso therefore, two disparate zzso viruses zzso proteins with zzso zzso that antagonize zzso of innate zzso
