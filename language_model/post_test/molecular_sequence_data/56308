zzso editing has been described for zzso genes of zzso and plants as well as in three cases for nuclear transcripts of zzso The zzso zzso for zzso acid is zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso However, zzso from the gene product revealed that the second zzso of the zzso of the zzso is zzso changed to be recognized as an zzso zzso This restores the coding property of the zzso zzso sequencing as well as clones of the amplified zzso indicated that about 50% of the cellular pool of zzso molecules for zzso acid is zzso Thus, zzso editing occurs in zzso zzso and can affect the zzso of zzso
