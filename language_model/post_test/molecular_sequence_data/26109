To study the influence of the non zzso tail domain of zzso in filament formation, we prepared a truncated zzso 8 zzso zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso we introduced a stop zzso in the position coding for zzso acid number zzso of the zzso zzso thereby deleting 86 zzso acids of the non zzso tail domain but leaving the consensus sequence at the end of the rod domain zzso zzso of the truncated zzso 8 in zzso coli allowed us to purify the protein by a zzso zzso The zzso capacity of the truncated zzso with zzso zzso and zzso was analyzed using in zzso zzso The in zzso assembly studies with zzso and zzso zzso indicate that the zzso tail domain of a type II zzso including the zzso zzso zzso is not required for filament zzso Moreover, zzso experiments with zzso and zzso a naturally occurring zzso zzso I, show that the tail zzso of type I as well as type II zzso are not an essential requirement for in zzso filament zzso Our results suggest that in zzso filament zzso does not depend on interactions between head and tail zzso although the tail domain might have a role in stabilization of intermediate filaments arising from certain zzso zzso
