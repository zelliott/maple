In here we report the identification of two new members of the zzso gene family, zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences within the zzso domain share high zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso revealed specific expression of these genes in the eye and zzso zzso zzso expression is restricted to the zzso zzso zzso whilst zzso transcripts are confined in the pelvic zzso zzso These results reveal the zzso expression pattern of zzso and zzso during zzso development in all animal species studied to zzso
