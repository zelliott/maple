zzso liver zzso factor zzso was treated with zzso zzso Two major fragments were zzso which were identified by zzso sequencing and zzso The larger one zzso contained zzso zzso including the zzso end, and after a second zzso released a zzso zzso zzso of 62 zzso The smaller one zzso contained the other zzso zzso including the C terminal zzso zzso and zzso either isolated or after zzso were unable to catalyze protein zzso However, we show by zzso that zzso could still interact with zzso and zzso This zzso was was able to participate into a zzso complex with zzso and zzso but not with zzso and a zzso zzso It was unable to protect the zzso against zzso and to be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso though it contained zzso and zzso involved in these zzso On the other hand, zzso could be zzso in the presence of zzso and diphtheria zzso but this zzso was apparently unable to bind to zzso These results and those obtained with other zzso are discussed in the light of the data published recently which show the existence of five different zzso in the three-dimensional structure of zzso
