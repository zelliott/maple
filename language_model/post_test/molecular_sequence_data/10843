Previous studies attributed the zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso to loss of an zzso zzso In this report we show that zzso zzso growth is also associated with an increase in zzso zzso We identified two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso growth which block zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso or is responsible for the zzso growth zzso One of the zzso zzso is identical to a zzso zzso recently implicated in mating zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso corresponding to the second zzso encodes a protein that bears significant sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso of plasma zzso zzso zzso channels from higher zzso zzso lacking zzso or zzso protein exhibit a zzso in zzso zzso zzso and consequently lose viability upon mating zzso The zzso and zzso zzso also display reduced tolerance to zzso zzso such as zzso suggesting a role for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso stress zzso Finally, zzso zzso double zzso are, by both zzso and genetic criteria, identical to single zzso These and other results suggest zzso and zzso are components of a zzso zzso channel that may mediate zzso zzso in response to mating zzso salt stress, and zzso zzso
