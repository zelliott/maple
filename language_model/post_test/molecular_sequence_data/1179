zzso A virus contains eight zzso segments and encodes 10 viral zzso However, an 11th zzso called zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso This novel protein is translated from an alternative open reading frame zzso in the zzso zzso We analyzed the zzso gene of 42 recent influenza A zzso in Taiwan, including 24 zzso and 18 zzso zzso One zzso isolate and 17 zzso zzso contained the entire zzso zzso of 90 zzso three zzso acids zzso longer than the zzso of zzso zzso at the C zzso The one remaining zzso isolate zzso a truncated zzso with 79 zzso The other 23 zzso zzso contained a truncated zzso of 57 zzso zzso analysis of both the zzso and the zzso genes showed that they shared similar zzso of these Taiwanese zzso suggesting that no obvious zzso occurred between the two zzso zzso
