zzso located, zzso zzso replication zzso termed zzso are essential for replication of the zzso of zzso such as human zzso 14 zzso and zzso because they template zzso of the protein zzso zzso by the zzso zzso These zzso form zzso structures sharing a common loop zzso and the zzso zzso can substitute functionally for the zzso zzso in both zzso in zzso and zzso replication in zzso We show, however, that the zzso zzso is unable to support zzso zzso zzso This lack of zzso maps to the stem of the zzso zzso and was reversed by single zzso zzso in the stem as well as the base of the zzso zzso zzso viruses rescued from zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso or a zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso contained zzso zzso acid zzso These mapped to the surface of both the zzso zzso at the tip of the zzso domain, and the zzso zzso on the side opposing the active site and near the end of an extended strand segment implicated previously in zzso zzso These zzso substantially enhanced replication competence when introduced into zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso and they were additive in their zzso The data support a model in which zzso or its derivatives zzso and zzso interact directly with the stem of the zzso during zzso of zzso
