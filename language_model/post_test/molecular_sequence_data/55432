zzso is a potent zzso that has a wide range of clinical zzso Its zzso zzso scaffold, mainly with a zzso origin, features two zzso groups at zzso and zzso and one zzso side chain at zzso due to the zzso incorporation of two unusual zzso units derived from zzso carrier protein zzso and zzso A zzso zzso Whether their zzso zzso can be a bottleneck for zzso production remains zzso In this study, we report the improvement of zzso yield in the producing strain zzso zzso by the zzso of two sets of zzso genes individually zzso the zzso of these two zzso units, thereby providing a promising approach to generate zzso strains via genetic zzso Taking advantage of the fact that zzso zzso is amenable to two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso systems, we genetically enhanced the zzso of zzso and zzso as indicated by zzso zzso Together with the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso eventually increased by approximately zzso in comparison with that of the original zzso The strategy of engineering the zzso of unusual zzso units described here may be zzso to improving the production of other zzso or zzso zzso natural products that contain zzso building zzso
