Studies were carried out to further characterize zzso and promoter elements on the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso We were able to confirm the existence of zzso promoters analogous to the major promoters of the related human zzso B virus zzso and of an zzso analogous to the recently described zzso zzso element zzso zzso Wei, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, we were unable to identity an zzso analogous to the E1 element of zzso despite the fact that these two viruses share a high degree of sequence zzso and genetic zzso Some factor binding sites in the E1 region appeared to be zzso between the two viruses and may be required for the activity of the overlapping X gene promoter of zzso Others did not appear to be essential for zzso X gene promoter activity, and their functional activity, if any, was not zzso Our failure to detect a functional zzso element in the region of zzso zzso to the zzso E1 zzso may indicate that zzso fundamental differences exist in zzso regulation of the small circular zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso contains an E1 element which is functional in the context of the intact viral zzso but which is unable to function in the context of the various expression zzso used in our zzso or zzso correct regulation of zzso zzso via an E1 element is dependent upon zzso factors which are not expressed in the zzso cell lines used in our zzso
