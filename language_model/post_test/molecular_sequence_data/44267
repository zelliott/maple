zzso zzso was zzso from the cell extracts of zzso zzso zzso grown on zzso The product from zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso was identified as zzso zzso by gas zzso and mass zzso zzso The molecular mass of the native zzso was 140 zzso based on gel zzso It was zzso into molecular mass zzso of 32 zzso and 40 zzso zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso indicating that the zzso was a zzso of zzso The genes coding for the zzso and zzso of the zzso were cloned and zzso Open reading frames of the genes zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso base pairs in zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences predicted from the open reading frames of zzso and zzso corresponded to the zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso showed identities to some extent with zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are zzso zzso from zzso coli W and C, respectively, belonging to class III in the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso had identity zzso with only zzso among the zzso zzso
