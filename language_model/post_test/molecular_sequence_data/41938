The evolutionary position of the zzso family, zzso has been very zzso Some plant zzso strongly advocate excluding zzso from the conifer order and raising its zzso status to a new order or even class because of its absence of seed cones, contrary to the case in the majority of zzso However, other authors believe that the zzso are not fundamentally different from the rest of the zzso except in that they possess the most reduced zzso zzso To resolve the controversy, we have zzso the zzso zzso genes from representative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our zzso analysis of the new sequence data with the published zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso as an zzso strongly indicates that zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso group with the exclusion of zzso and that zzso is more closely related to zzso than to zzso zzso zzso should be classified as a family of zzso Our finding that zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso contradicts both the view that the zzso seed of zzso is a primitive character and the view that the zzso are descendants of the zzso Rather, the zzso seed of zzso and that of some species of zzso appear to have different origins, probably all reduced from zzso zzso
