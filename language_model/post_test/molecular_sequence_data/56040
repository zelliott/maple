The X-ray crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been solved by molecular replacement and refined to a resolution of zzso zzso The final zzso is equal to zzso for zzso observed reflections with F zzso 4 zzso The sequence zzso as an zzso double zzso in the zzso space group zzso with one duplex zzso zzso by 66 water molecules in the zzso zzso Cell parameters are a zzso zzso zzso b zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso It is the first time that such a crystal form has been zzso This zzso structure has been compared with the zzso structure of the same zzso It adopts a bent structure with an unusual packing between zzso zzso
