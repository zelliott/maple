The mouse zzso gene is an zzso gene whose zzso is induced in zzso zzso by zzso DNA sequences necessary for zzso control of zzso by zzso were identified in the region zzso the zzso start zzso zzso zzso analysis in zzso using deletion zzso of a zzso sequence placed in front of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene identified an zzso region between zzso zzso and zzso This region contained two zzso B sequence zzso The first motif zzso zzso to zzso zzso beta 1) is highly zzso in all three human zzso genes and in the mouse zzso inflammatory zzso zzso zzso The second zzso B motif zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso was zzso only between the mouse and the rat zzso zzso zzso with previous reports, the highly zzso zzso B site zzso zzso was essential for zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso B site zzso zzso was also necessary for optimal zzso zzso of either zzso B site markedly reduced sensitivity to zzso in zzso cells and to zzso in zzso zzso zzso Although both zzso B1 and zzso B2 sequences were able to bind members of the zzso zzso family, including zzso zzso B1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso B1 site bound these factors with higher affinity and functioned more effectively than the zzso B2 site in a zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso control of the zzso gene requires cooperation between two zzso B sites and is thus distinct from that of the three human zzso genes and the mouse zzso zzso
