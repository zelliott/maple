To identify the molecular zzso causing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a Chinese family with bilateral zzso zzso 

The Chinese zzso family was subjected to a complete zzso examination that included zzso examination and zzso photography to assess and document the zzso deposits and zzso zzso In zzso laser scanning zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also performed on both eyes of zzso zzso Blood samples were taken for subsequent genetic zzso The two coding zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso gene were screened for zzso by direct zzso 

We report on a novel zzso zzso of zzso zzso in two patients with zzso The identified molecular zzso zzso with the disease and is not found in 50 unaffected zzso zzso evaluation on zzso by in zzso laser scanning zzso zzso and zzso zzso highlighted pathological observations at the level of zzso membrane and anterior zzso 

The newly identified zzso expands the spectrum of zzso in zzso that may cause pathological zzso cholesterol zzso Observations by in zzso laser scanning zzso zzso and zzso zzso were consistent with the previous zzso descriptions of zzso
