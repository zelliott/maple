The product of the zzso virus zzso gene was characterized zzso and zzso This zzso protein is zzso in diverse members of the zzso family but shows no zzso to zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso binds to both zzso and zzso DNA in a zzso manner in an zzso mobility shift zzso The protein is expressed at late times during infection, and approximately 700 copies are zzso within the zzso zzso To determine the role of the zzso protein during the viral life cycle, a zzso viral zzso in which the zzso gene was placed under the regulation of the zzso coli zzso zzso was zzso In the absence of zzso plaque formation was abolished and yields of zzso zzso virus were dramatically zzso Although all zzso of gene expression and DNA replication proceeded normally during zzso infections, no mature zzso were zzso zzso microscopic analysis confirmed the absence of mature zzso assembly but revealed that apparently normal immature zzso zzso Thus, zzso is an zzso zzso protein required for the latest stages of zzso zzso zzso
