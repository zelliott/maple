zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells with 5 M zzso yielded a preparation containing a single zzso zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 32 zzso A clone zzso an zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso DNA by screening with an zzso raised against whole cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso determination of the insert in the clone revealed a complete zzso open reading frame zzso that defines a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso confirmed that it is the same as the cloned zzso zzso was found to have a sequence similar to those of family III of the bacterial zzso zzso The sequences of two zzso upstream of zzso are consistent with zzso being located in an zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains no zzso zzso and attachment motif zzso despite its origin in a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of whole cells indicated that this zzso is exposed on the cell zzso The zzso point as predicted from the putative mature sequence is zzso It was consequently hypothesized that the positively charged zzso is anchored by zzso interaction with zzso groups on the cell zzso It was shown that zzso could be selectively removed from the surface by extraction with an zzso zzso thus supporting this zzso
