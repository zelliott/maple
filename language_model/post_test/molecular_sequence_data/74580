Across diverse zzso seminal fluid proteins zzso transferred at mating affect the zzso success of both zzso Such zzso proteins often evolve under positive selection between zzso because of this rapid zzso zzso are hypothesized to play a role in zzso by contributing to zzso isolation between zzso In zzso individual zzso have been characterized and are known to alter male zzso competitive ability and female zzso behavior, but a zzso view of the transferred zzso has been zzso Here we describe a novel zzso method that uses zzso zzso labeling to detect transferred zzso in zzso female zzso zzso We identified 63 zzso which were previously unknown to function in zzso and confirmed the transfer of dozens of predicted zzso Relative zzso of protein abundance revealed that several of these novel zzso are abundant in seminal zzso Positive selection and tandem gene zzso are the prevailing forces of zzso evolution, and comparative zzso with additional species revealed zzso changes in seminal fluid zzso We also report a zzso gene discovery method that uncovered 19 previously zzso genes in zzso zzso Our results demonstrate an experimental method to identify transferred proteins in any system that is amenable to zzso zzso and they underscore the power of combining zzso and evolutionary analyses to shed light on the complex process of zzso zzso
