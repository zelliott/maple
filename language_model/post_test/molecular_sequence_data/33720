Virtually all cell surface proteins and many cell membrane lipids are zzso creating a cell surface zzso The zzso chains attached to cell surface zzso and zzso are complex structures with specific additions that determine functions of the zzso in zzso communication and cell sensing of the zzso One type of specific modification of cell surface zzso is decoration of zzso zzso by zzso zzso On T cells, these terminal zzso acid zzso are involved in almost every aspect of T cell fate and function, from cell zzso zzso and migration to cell survival and cell zzso The roles that zzso zzso play in T cell development and function, including binding to specific zzso zzso zzso are reviewed zzso
