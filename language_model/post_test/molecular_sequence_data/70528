We have determined the solution structure of zzso a zzso extracted from the zzso of the New World scorpion zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to the family of scorpion toxins that affect the sodium channel activity, and is very toxic to zzso zzso zzso g mouse zzso The three-dimensional structure was determined using zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso angle zzso and restrained energy zzso The final set of 15 structures was calculated from 876 experimental distance constraints and 58 angle zzso The structures have a global zzso zzso of zzso A for backbone atoms and zzso A for all heavy zzso The overall fold is similar to that found in the other scorpion toxins acting on sodium zzso It is made of a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso and is stabilized by four zzso zzso A zzso zzso at position 59 zzso a zzso of the zzso chain in the zzso zzso The zzso core of the protein is made up of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by the eight zzso zzso A zzso patch is defined by the aromatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso on the side of the zzso facing the zzso A positively charged patch is formed by zzso and zzso on one edge of the zzso in the zzso zzso Another positively charged spot is represented by the highly exposed zzso The structure of zzso is compared with those of other scorpion toxins acting on sodium channels, in particular zzso II and zzso This is the first structural report of an zzso zzso toxin and it provides the necessary information for the design of zzso zzso that can be used to probe zzso relationships in scorpion toxins affecting sodium channel zzso
