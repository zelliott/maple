zzso of the membrane zzso protein zzso zzso was zzso While the expression of zzso in mice carrying zzso zzso with 125 zzso of 3' untranslated region zzso was zzso that in mice carrying zzso zzso without total 3' zzso was evident in many zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis clearly showed the presence of zzso even in transgenic mice with 3' zzso suggesting that the expression was regulated at the zzso zzso The in zzso expression data of zzso molecules on the stable Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell clone corresponded to that in transgenic zzso The first 125 zzso zzso the expression of zzso molecules in combination with not only zzso but also zzso zzso zzso Also, this region inhibited expression of zzso accelerating factor zzso zzso molecules when it was inserted into zzso of zzso Furthermore, the first 32 zzso of the 3' zzso revealed the same zzso effect as 125 zzso on zzso zzso These findings indicated that the first 125 zzso (and the first 32 zzso in zzso of 3' zzso regulate the expression of zzso molecules in transgenic zzso
