A zzso analogue zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso 1 beta zzso zzso and zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso from zzso zzso If added to cells activated by zzso gamma and zzso zzso analogue A not only inhibited the zzso of zzso beta but also induced an extremely rapid degradation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso levels within 5-8 zzso This degradation is independent of translation and of the signal inducing zzso The common feature of these genes is the inclusion of one or more copies of the zzso zzso zzso in the 3' untranslated zzso Indeed, no zzso effect of zzso analogue A could be observed on zzso derived from the expression of an zzso beta construct lacking the zzso motifs of the zzso The effect of zzso analogue A on zzso interaction and on zzso modifications of zzso proteins is zzso This class of compound constitutes a valuable tool for the further zzso of the mechanism of zzso degradation of zzso and zzso
