The genetic diversity of the zzso S gene has a significant impact on the prophylaxis and treatment of zzso B zzso The effect of selective pressure on this genetic zzso has not yet been studied in Iranian blood zzso To explore zzso evolution and to analyze the effects and patterns of zzso B surface zzso zzso zzso on blood screening zzso zzso Iranian blood donors diagnosed as zzso zzso carriers were enrolled in this nationwide zzso Large S and partial S genes were amplified and zzso zzso zzso zzso and synonymous and zzso zzso were zzso The impact of naturally occurring zzso on zzso zzso results was zzso zzso analyses revealed that isolated strains were of zzso zzso The dominant zzso was zzso zzso and naturally occurring stop zzso in the zzso and major zzso region zzso were zzso In total, zzso of the studied strains zzso 195 single or multiple zzso in the zzso the majority of which were located at the first loop of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a significant effect on the zzso zzso value and carried fewer zzso in the zzso zzso substitution value indicated that negative selection was the dominant evolutionary force in the zzso S zzso This nationwide study revealed that zzso frequency of zzso among Iranian blood donors was much higher than previous reports from the different local zzso These findings regarding the significant differences in zzso of zzso among different zzso of zzso and its correlation with the number of zzso at the zzso will be valuable to public health zzso
