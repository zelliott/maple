zzso zzso virus zzso is the agent of a highly contagious disease that affects domestic zzso zzso zzso Recent reports showed a high prevalence of one main zzso zzso zzso or zzso with low genetic diversity in commercial poultry flocks from zzso This research analyzed zzso positive poultry flocks from different rearing regions to verify the zzso gene zzso and geographic distribution of zzso zzso strains in recent years zzso and zzso zzso of zzso flocks were obtained from 60 different zzso zzso partial zzso gene sequences were determined and aligned for zzso and zzso acid similarity zzso Eleven samples zzso were similar to Massachusetts vaccine strains zzso zzso and 34 samples zzso to the previously characterized Brazilian zzso zzso Interestingly, the remaining four samples zzso clustered into a new zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso divergent from the zzso A unique zzso sequence zzso coding for five zzso acid zzso was observed in all the Brazilian zzso viruses zzso and zzso zzso These results show a higher genetic diversity in Brazilian zzso zzso than previously zzso
