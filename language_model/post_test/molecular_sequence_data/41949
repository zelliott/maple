A study of chicken zzso zzso zzso expression has revealed that the two major liver and skeletal muscle transcripts of the zzso are zzso zzso zzso of the larger zzso zzso transcript increases with zzso The smaller transcript zzso zzso is a zzso product, resulting from alternative usage of a functional zzso zzso signal embedded in the coding zzso The extent to which alternative zzso and zzso occur displays some tissue and sex zzso zzso and zzso occur zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso signal zzso positions zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso The truncated transcript appears to be zzso based on its association in zzso with zzso although the zzso role of the putative protein product of this truncated transcript is as yet zzso Three other avian species zzso zzso and zzso also show a zzso zzso of the zzso message due to a zzso signal at the same location in the coding zzso In cell culture zzso zzso of zzso to zzso prevents production of the truncated zzso In a zzso zzso the signal and neighboring sequence from the zzso are sufficient to zzso zzso and zzso upon the rat zzso a gene that otherwise lacks the internal zzso zzso Alternative zzso within the coding region of a structural gene is discussed as a zzso unknown means of zzso regulation of a gene zzso
