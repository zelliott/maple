zzso and retinal zzso synthesis is controlled by the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is regulated by zzso signals and zzso zzso This zzso converts zzso to zzso by the transfer of an zzso group from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso instability during routine zzso has made zzso characterization difficult, but now a stable zzso protein for zzso has been zzso to investigate the intrinsic zzso properties of zzso from a rat zzso zzso zzso a 205 zzso acid, 23 zzso zzso by using a zzso zzso fusion protein zzso zzso zzso showed zzso specificity for zzso and stability at 4 degrees zzso however, the zzso activity was reduced by zzso upon zzso at 37 degrees C for 2 zzso zzso is zzso zzso by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso but no zzso effect was observed on zzso zzso zzso Among the metal zzso tested in this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed little or no zzso zzso while either 1 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso nearly abolished the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is also inhibited by zzso that are known zzso to modify zzso groups zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting the presence of essential zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso completely protects the zzso zzso from zzso by zzso and zzso indicating that specific zzso and zzso zzso may be at the zzso zzso The conclusion is that the zzso properties of rat zzso zzso is similar to the zzso zzso and retinal zzso with respect to the sensitivity to temperature, metal zzso as well as the zzso modification zzso These data also suggest that the zzso status of the zzso does not affect zzso activity directly, and zzso zzso are potentially important zzso required for high zzso zzso
