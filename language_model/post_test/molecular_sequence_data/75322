zzso zzso zzso an important protein involved in cholesterol transport in the zzso binds with high specificity and high affinity to the zzso E zzso density zzso zzso Several lines of evidence have indicated that key basic zzso in the vicinity of zzso zzso of zzso are important in zzso binding to the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso exhibiting defective zzso binding are associated with the genetic zzso disorder type III zzso To determine whether other basic zzso acids in this region of zzso also affect zzso binding activity, zzso zzso of zzso in a bacterial expression system was zzso This system had been used successfully to produce zzso that was structurally and functionally equivalent to human plasma zzso zzso of zzso in which neutral zzso acids were zzso for basic zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso and 150 were zzso The zzso all displayed defective zzso their activity ranged from 9 to zzso of normal (a range similar to that seen with naturally occurring zzso of human zzso In addition, to determine whether the zzso of this region is important for zzso zzso we designed zzso in which zzso was zzso for zzso 144 or zzso zzso Both zzso were zzso exhibiting 13 and zzso of normal zzso zzso In contrast, a double zzso in which zzso was zzso for zzso 139 and zzso for zzso 149 displayed slightly enhanced zzso binding zzso These studies confirm that the middle of the zzso zzso is important in zzso binding and indicate that only certain zzso acid zzso in this region interfere with zzso binding zzso
