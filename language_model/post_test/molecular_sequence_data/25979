We have reported that a second rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso circulatory and zzso responses in the rat similar to those found after administration of zzso zzso also zzso with zzso to zzso the observed biological activity in the zzso In the present studies in awake dogs, intravenous infusion of low doses zzso zzso of zzso and zzso increased plasma zzso zzso and suppressed plasma zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso like zzso zzso of zzso may have displaced zzso from zzso clearance receptors to increase plasma zzso zzso since factors influencing zzso zzso release were not zzso The effect of zzso zzso and zzso in lowering zzso and plasma zzso may therefore have been zzso via zzso stimulation of active zzso zzso zzso zzso However, an additional direct effect of zzso on an active zzso cannot be zzso
