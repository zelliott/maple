zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso an essential sequence of the zzso C2 cycle, zzso the conversion of two molecules of zzso into one zzso each of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (now designated zzso is defective in zzso zzso activity and displays a lethal zzso zzso when grown at ambient zzso but is virtually unaffected at elevated zzso The zzso zzso harbors seven putative zzso zzso two of which zzso and zzso feature predicted zzso targeting zzso We have mapped zzso to the position of the zzso gene zzso The zzso is due to a G zzso A transition at the zzso zzso site of zzso 6 of zzso causing zzso zzso and a premature termination of zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the F1 progeny of a genetic cross between zzso and zzso displayed the same conditional lethal zzso as zzso zzso of zzso zzso under the control of either the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso or the zzso promoter in zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso or expression of zzso under the control of the zzso promoter did not rescue the zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso is predominantly expressed in leaves, whereas zzso is mainly transcribed in the shoot zzso zzso and zzso Our findings establish zzso as the defective gene in the zzso zzso zzso
