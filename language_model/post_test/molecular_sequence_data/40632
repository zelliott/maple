In muscle cells, a complex network of zzso proteins allows proper reception, zzso and transmission of mechanical and zzso zzso zzso in genes zzso different zzso proteins such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso have recently been shown to cause heart failure by distinct mechanisms such as disturbed zzso altered zzso or mechanical zzso zzso We identified zzso factor zzso zzso as an essential component for maintaining zzso zzso and zzso organization in heart and skeletal zzso In zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso are zzso and zzso are zzso leading to progressive impairment of heart and zzso zzso zzso of the gene zzso zzso mainly depends on zzso zzso In zzso zzso which show a zzso zzso similar to that of zzso zzso transcript and protein levels of zzso are severely zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso can zzso zzso function and rescue heart failure in zzso zzso demonstrating for the first time an essential role of zzso signaling for maintaining zzso architecture and zzso
