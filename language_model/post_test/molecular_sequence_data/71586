A high zzso of zzso serum zzso is observed in multiple myeloma zzso patients treated with zzso stem cell transplantation zzso To determine whether these zzso are produced by myeloma zzso related cells or caused by an zzso zzso zzso we zzso by zzso zzso and DNA sequencing the zzso zzso variable genes zzso obtained from bone zzso samples obtained before and after transplantation and peripheral blood stem cell zzso samples from seven zzso zzso zzso related cells are identifiable by the expression of zzso zzso heavy chain zzso and were detected in two patients at zzso No myeloma zzso related cells were found in zzso samples zzso zzso 7) in spite of the appearance of new serum zzso However, in two cases we amplified sequences from zzso bone zzso cells that were able to bind to the zzso zzso zzso zzso but showed no further similarity regarding the zzso zzso These data indicate that serum zzso zzso is not caused by myeloma zzso related B cells but rather by the zzso zzso zzso
