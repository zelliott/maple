The zzso ring of the bacterial zzso motor is composed of the zzso and zzso proteins that act together to generate a turning force zzso acting on the zzso ring of the zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso is believed to anchor the zzso complex to zzso zzso of the cell zzso The first crystal structures of zzso and its complex with zzso acid zzso have been determined to zzso and zzso resolution, zzso zzso is a zzso both in solution and in the zzso The two zzso chains of the PG zzso can be modeled as zzso zzso and zzso into the grooves harboring the zzso molecules on the opposite faces of the zzso The model suggests that a zzso zzso surface created upon zzso zzso zzso and centered around the zzso axis of the zzso can accommodate the zzso zzso linking the two sugar zzso zzso structural similarities were found between zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso protein M and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that PG recognition by different outer membrane protein zzso proteins may be governed by very similar molecular mechanisms that evidently involve protein zzso
