We have isolated a novel member of putative zzso zzso from a rat heart zzso library using zzso chain reaction zzso The novel zzso is transcribed as zzso zzso zzso zzso for a protein of 629 zzso acids with the zzso zzso zzso zzso acids analysis revealed that the zzso zzso domain is zzso identical to the zzso cell associated zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso found to promote zzso during zzso zzso we designated this novel zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a molecular weight of 66 zzso was shown to zzso itself and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso basic zzso In addition, zzso acid analysis confirmed the zzso protein zzso activity of zzso Although zzso was ubiquitous in adult rat zzso the expression of zzso protein in zzso was restricted primarily to embryonic zzso during early zzso This finding suggests that zzso may be a participant in cardiac zzso
