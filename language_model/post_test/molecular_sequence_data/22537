zzso the zzso degradation of the major membrane protein in central nervous system, zzso is involved in many neurodegenerative zzso In the present in zzso study the zzso actions of zzso human zzso 1 and human zzso 4 were compared on zzso bound and free human zzso basic proteins as zzso The fragments formed were identified by using zzso zzso acid sequencing and mass zzso The analysis of the degradation products showed that of these three zzso human zzso 4 zzso zzso basic protein most zzso It selectively zzso the zzso and zzso zzso bonds in the zzso bound form of human zzso basic zzso Based on this information we zzso zzso zzso that zzso to sequence region zzso of zzso basic protein and contains one of its two zzso 4 zzso sites, zzso Studies on the zzso of this synthetic zzso by zzso 4 have confirmed that the zzso zzso bond is highly susceptible to zzso zzso What may lend biological interest to this finding is that the major zzso found in patients with multiple sclerosis recognize sequence zzso of the zzso Our results suggest that human zzso 4 may be one of the candidate zzso involved in the zzso of multiple zzso
