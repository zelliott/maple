zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in protection of the gastric zzso against various damaging agents and zzso activity on tumor zzso However, the precise regulation mechanism of zzso in gastric cancer cells is still zzso In this study, we isolated a zzso which is regulated by zzso in zzso human gastric zzso cells, using differential display zzso zzso zzso and characterized the function of the gene induced by zzso The full-length zzso of the gene was cloned by the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The zzso base pair zzso consists of a zzso zzso region, an zzso open reading frame and a zzso zzso region that includes a zzso zzso zzso As a result of protein motif search, we found that it has a zzso zzso site, zzso and a zzso binding domain repeat zzso Thus, we designated this gene product as zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in a lower extent in zzso gastric and colon cancer zzso and is translated into 33 zzso protein in nuclear and zzso zzso zzso has a zzso activity, which was detected using the insulin zzso reduction zzso Another potential role of zzso is repression of zzso activity through direct binding to zzso a zzso factor induced at zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and specifically zzso to zzso phase zzso In conclusion, these results imply that zzso is a zzso zzso and plays as a zzso zzso through direct binding to the zzso factor zzso
