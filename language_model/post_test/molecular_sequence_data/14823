A zzso zzso zzso with a molecular mass of approximately 100 zzso was zzso from the zzso fluid of a marine zzso zzso zzso by ammonium zzso zzso followed by column zzso on zzso zzso M, zzso zzso M, and zzso 200 zzso zzso This zzso named zzso in the present study, showed optimal activities at pH zzso and 40 zzso and was stable at the zzso pH range from zzso to zzso and the temperature below 38 zzso The zzso and zzso values for zzso determined at pH zzso and 30 zzso with zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso various zzso zzso as well as zzso liberating zzso as a major degradation zzso Linear zzso from green zzso zzso fragile was completely zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso an zzso zzso which we previously isolated from the same animal zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was amplified from the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso using zzso zzso designed on the basis of zzso and internal zzso sequences of zzso The cloned zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso and zzso an zzso sequence of 931 zzso with the calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced sequence of zzso showed zzso zzso identity to those of zzso 2 zzso zzso The zzso important zzso zzso determined in zzso zzso were completely zzso in zzso Thus, zzso is regarded as a new member of zzso zzso from marine zzso
