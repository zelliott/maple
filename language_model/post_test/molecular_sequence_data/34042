The zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso which contains a zzso open reading frame that encodes zzso zzso acid zzso was expressed in the zzso coli strain zzso The expressed zzso was zzso through heat treatment, zzso zzso column zzso and then zzso SP zzso column zzso zzso DNA zzso has poor zzso and zzso efficiency compared to those of other family B DNA zzso To improve zzso and zzso efficiency, zzso zzso DNA zzso were created via zzso zzso Specifically, we targeted the zzso zzso for enhanced zzso and the zzso zzso for improved zzso zzso The zzso zzso DNA zzso all showed enhanced zzso efficiency and zzso compared to those of the zzso zzso DNA zzso Specifically, the double zzso zzso DNA zzso had an approximately zzso increase in zzso over that of the zzso zzso and amplified a long zzso zzso product in an extension time of zzso However, there was a small change in the zzso zzso activity compared with that of the zzso zzso DNA zzso even though the zzso is in the zzso zzso The double zzso zzso DNA zzso had a zzso lower error rate compared to that of zzso DNA zzso It seems that the double zzso zzso DNA zzso can be used in LA zzso and zzso zzso
