The zzso zzso domain of the large zzso B virus zzso envelope protein plays a pivotal role at the initial step of the viral entry zzso In the present study, the entire zzso domain was mapped for zzso zzso following a zzso approach and using in zzso infection zzso with zzso delta virus zzso or zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso created within the zzso 75 zzso acids of the zzso region abrogate zzso whereas zzso between zzso acids 76 and zzso overlapping the zzso domain, had no zzso In contrast to the results of a recent study zzso zzso zzso Funk, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Will, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the deletion of a cell membrane zzso motif zzso located between zzso acids 148 and 161 at the C zzso of zzso did not interfere with the zzso of the resulting zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, a series of large deletions overlapping the zzso domain were compatible with zzso although the efficiency of infection was reduced when the deletions extended to the zzso zzso Overall, the results demonstrate that the activity of the zzso domain at viral entry solely depends on the integrity of its first 75 zzso acids and thus excludes any function of the zzso domain or zzso
