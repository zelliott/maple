As one of the largest gene families, zzso domain proteins have important roles in regulating various zzso processes and stress zzso In this study, we have investigated a rice zzso domain zzso zzso The zzso protein is mainly localized in the plasma membrane and zzso zzso expression is induced rapidly and strongly by zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression is also induced in root tips by zzso independent of its zzso zzso products, zzso and zzso and the plant hormones zzso and zzso zzso of zzso reduces rice zzso sensitivity and zzso stress tolerance and promotes rice root zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in multiple signaling pathways in regulating root zzso Growth restraint in plants is an zzso strategy against zzso zzso Our results also suggest that zzso plays the negative role in response to zzso stress possibly by regulating root zzso
