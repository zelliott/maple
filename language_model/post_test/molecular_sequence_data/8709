Nearly complete sequences zzso of the zzso zzso genes were determined for type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The four subspecies had less than zzso zzso in their zzso zzso zzso Comparative studies indicated that the zzso zzso zzso shared relatively high zzso with the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso Further comparison with representatives of other zzso zzso and related bacteria with high zzso values showed that this group of bacteria was subdivided into three zzso One cluster consisted of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso another cluster consisted of members of the zzso zzso group of zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso alone formed a unique zzso which was remote from other zzso bacteria zzso The three clusters may reflect a systematic rank higher than the zzso level among these zzso
