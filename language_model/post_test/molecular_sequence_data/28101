An zzso zzso zzso clone expressing zzso found in adult and zzso zzso designated zzso zzso was derived from a zzso message present in adult zzso zzso which encodes a protein with an apparent molecular weight of zzso This protein does not appear to be extensively zzso zzso zzso samples from 52 individuals exposed to zzso zzso were examined for zzso recognizing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced such zzso In addition, individuals producing zzso recognizing the zzso zzso were significantly less likely to develop some aspects of zzso pathology associated with zzso zzso infection than were individuals who did not do zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso such as that produced by zzso zzso may be useful in attempts to understand the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso
