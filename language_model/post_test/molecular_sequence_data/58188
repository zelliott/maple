The zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso cannot be exchanged with its analogous protein in the related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso however, are assembled into zzso zzso zzso These hybrid zzso zzso particles bearing deleted zzso zzso attach to N zzso thus zzso the host attachment property of the protein but not its zzso zzso This means that the attachment specificity is determined by zzso zzso independently of other zzso components in contact with zzso zzso initiation function, the process in which zzso DNA is released into the host, in contrast seems to require either more complex structural features of the protein (for example, a certain zzso zzso provided only in the original zzso or a concerted action of zzso with another particle zzso not zzso by its zzso counterpart in the related zzso
