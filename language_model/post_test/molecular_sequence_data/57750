Studies on the regulation of the human zzso virus zzso promoter, have been focused primarily on the 98 zzso tandem repeat sequence which zzso zzso to viral gene zzso We demonstrate that a distinct regulatory element outside of the 98 zzso region, which spans a stretch of 10 zzso zzso zzso increases zzso activity of zzso late zzso and early zzso promoters in zzso zzso zzso analysis of this motif reveals extensive zzso to the zzso B sequence of zzso zzso A DNA zzso corresponding to the 10 zzso sequence of zzso exhibits zzso activity when placed upstream of the test promoter in zzso zzso The induction zzso by this regulatory motif is moderately enhanced in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments suggest that zzso cells zzso produce proteins that specifically interact with the zzso zzso B, but not the zzso zzso B zzso Treatment of cells with zzso results in formation of new complexes that are sensitive to the zzso B sequences derived from the zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso B sequence located in the zzso zzso may play a role in zzso regulation of zzso gene expression by interacting with zzso and zzso nuclear proteins from zzso zzso
