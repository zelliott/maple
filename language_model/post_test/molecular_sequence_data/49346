This work characterized the putative zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence indicated that the zzso zzso protein contains an zzso zzso A Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso signals were detected by using a zzso zzso Both the signals were enhanced under the presence of a zzso agent, zzso zzso It was also revealed that the expression of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was enhanced at the zzso level by zzso zzso The results suggested that the zzso zzso signal detected by the zzso probe was in two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Besides, primer extension analyses confirmed the enhancement of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was expressed in zzso coli and zzso using a zzso affinity zzso In zzso steps, a 36 zzso band zzso with the zzso and it was detected even in the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences for the 36 zzso protein revealed that it was an intact zzso They showed that zzso formed a zzso under zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consumption in the presence of zzso as a zzso but not zzso To characterize the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso that was generated through zzso reduction of zzso and zzso that was produced by zzso reduction of zzso were zzso During reduction of zzso by zzso zzso zzso was generated, whereas a small amount of zzso zzso of zzso was zzso These results suggest that the activity of zzso is similar to zzso zzso an zzso zzso reduction of zzso
