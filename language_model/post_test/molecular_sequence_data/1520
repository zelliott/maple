At least two zzso that determine zzso to type 1 diabetes in the zzso mouse have been mapped to zzso 1, zzso zzso diabetes zzso and zzso In this study, using a series of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso has been defined to a zzso region containing only four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso thereby excluding a major candidate zzso zzso zzso sequence comparison of the two functional candidate zzso zzso and zzso from the B6 zzso at zzso and the zzso zzso at zzso strains revealed 62 single zzso zzso zzso only two of which were in coding zzso One of these coding zzso base 77 of zzso zzso 2, is a synonymous zzso and has been correlated previously with type 1 diabetes zzso and differential expression of a zzso zzso Additional expression studies in this work support the hypothesis that this zzso in zzso 2 is the genetic variation causing the biological effects of zzso Analysis of additional zzso strains has also localized zzso to a small region zzso zzso of zzso 1, but in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso contains at least 45 zzso zzso the zzso region still includes the functionally zzso zzso zzso Future experiments to test the identity of zzso and zzso as zzso and zzso respectively, can now be justified using approaches to specifically alter or mimic the candidate zzso zzso
