A zzso cloning procedure was used to characterize the molecular changes involved in transformation of normal zzso to zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the cloning of zzso a novel zzso protein expressed in primary zzso but zzso in the zzso cell line zzso zzso is a zzso protein with five zzso zzso zzso one zzso domain consists only of the second half of the consensus zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso was not confined to the zzso zzso cells, but was a phenomenon extended to other zzso cell lines of both zzso and zzso zzso and to some breast cancer cell zzso Analysis of the expression pattern in normal human zzso revealed that zzso is expressed at high levels in the heart, suggesting an important function in the zzso of the terminally differentiated zzso of heart muscle zzso zzso studies using an zzso directed against zzso zzso localized the protein predominantly in the nucleus of cultured zzso On the basis of these results, we conclude that zzso of zzso zzso with the tumor zzso of zzso zzso
