zzso zzso regulatory proteins zzso zzso have been classified into several zzso on the basis of the properties of their alpha zzso though a notable zzso of gamma zzso has also been zzso To investigate whether each zzso of alpha zzso is associated with a particular gamma zzso various zzso G zzso zzso from bovine zzso were subjected to gel zzso in a zzso buffer zzso All G proteins examined were shown to have more than two kinds of gamma zzso Of the brain G zzso zzso zzso and zzso contain the same set of three gamma zzso but zzso contains only two of these zzso Lung zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso had similar sets of two gamma zzso one of which was distinct from the gamma zzso of brain G zzso These observations indicate that each zzso of alpha zzso is associated with a variety of beta gamma zzso and that the combinations differ among zzso For analyses of the structural diversity of the gamma zzso beta gamma zzso were zzso from the total G proteins of each tissue and subjected to zzso zzso under zzso conditions, where none of the beta zzso were zzso from the zzso Three distinct gamma zzso were isolated in this way from brain beta gamma zzso In contrast, lung and zzso beta gamma zzso contained at least five gamma zzso the zzso positions and zzso zzso of which were indistinguishable between the two zzso Among several gamma zzso two subspecies appeared to be common to the three zzso In fact, in each case, the partial zzso acid sequence of the most abundant gamma zzso in each tissue was zzso and the sequences coincided exactly with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kalman, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analysis indicated that this abundant gamma zzso in lung and zzso was zzso and zzso at the zzso as was zzso zzso from zzso In addition to abundant gamma zzso other zzso gamma zzso were also shown to be zzso by zzso mass zzso analysis of zzso zzso gamma zzso These results suggest that most gamma zzso associated with many different zzso of alpha zzso are zzso in a variety of zzso with the single exception being the zzso where the G protein zzso has a zzso gamma zzso
