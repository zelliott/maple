Several protein zzso that zzso with zzso zzso were identified and each zzso was assessed for its ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated using an zzso zzso procedure and the zzso were extracted from zzso with zzso M zzso zzso zzso were incubated with zzso zzso for selected protein zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso and zzso to characterize the zzso Using zzso zzso three types of zzso were identified, and a fourth was identified using zzso protein as zzso The first three zzso were the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso dependent protein zzso II and a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso and was inhibited by zzso Using zzso proteins as zzso a fourth zzso was identified which was zzso and was not inhibited by zzso Neither zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso in zzso on zzso and zzso primarily by the two zzso zzso Using zzso for affinity zzso one zzso of zzso Da was zzso Thus, in addition to zzso protein zzso and zzso dependent protein zzso II, two zzso have been found which are primarily responsible for zzso zzso in zzso and are zzso
