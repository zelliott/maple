A zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso was cloned in zzso coli zzso zzso The gene was expressed in either orientation in zzso zzso indicating that the insert DNA carried a zzso zzso promoter which functioned in zzso zzso However, when cloned in the orientation which placed the coding region downstream of the zzso zzso promoter, expression of zzso was nine times higher than it was in the opposite orientation and the growth of zzso coli cells was zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso gene disclosed an open reading frame of zzso base pairs zzso The zzso sequence at the zzso end of the protein contains a typical signal zzso zzso consistent with the observation that the mature zzso protein accumulated largely in the zzso space of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso produced in zzso coli cells was zzso and its activity was inhibited zzso or more by zzso The zzso zzso cucumber tissue about 1,000 times less efficiently than did zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene has no sequence similarity to the zzso genes thus far zzso from zzso zzso
