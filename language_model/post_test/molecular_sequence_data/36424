The 3' region of a gene designated zzso which shows strong zzso with zzso that encodes the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a gene library of zzso zzso strain zzso The truncated zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso bound tightly to zzso The zzso domain in this zzso consisted of a zzso zzso 167 zzso sequence which showed complete identity with zzso zzso of mature zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso The zzso domain zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso but not with zzso
