The ability of zzso zzso virus types 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso to repress host cell protein synthesis early in infection has been studied extensively and found to involve the activities of the zzso gene product, the zzso host zzso zzso zzso To date, zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso of three other zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso virus, and zzso virus, but very little is known about the putative products of these zzso zzso Our earlier observations that no rapid early host protein zzso occurred in zzso cells led us to test zzso zzso activity more thoroughly and to examine the expression and function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the effects of zzso and zzso infections on cellular protein synthesis and zzso degradation were compared at various zzso of infection in several cell types under an zzso D zzso No zzso zzso of cellular protein synthesis or zzso cellular zzso degradation was detected in cells infected with any of three zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso at zzso of infection at which zzso strain F exhibited zzso zzso zzso However, further analyses revealed that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was transcribed and translated into a zzso protein in infected zzso zzso the zzso protein was packaged into viral particles in amounts zzso in Western blots zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso protein had intrinsic zzso activity comparable to that of zzso zzso zzso and zzso this intrinsic zzso activity was zzso by in zzso zzso zzso in which either the functionally inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at position 214 replaced by zzso zzso was recreated within zzso or two zzso zzso within the putative zzso binding region of the zzso sequence were altered zzso zzso From these results we conclude that zzso low zzso activity in infected cells is not a reflection of the zzso zzso intrinsic zzso activity but may be due instead to the amount of zzso protein associated with viral particles or to zzso of zzso zzso intrinsic activity by another viral zzso
