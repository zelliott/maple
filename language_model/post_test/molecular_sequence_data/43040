zzso zzso were raised against an zzso derived from a component of the zzso site of the alpha 1 zzso of rat zzso zzso of partially zzso zzso from rat kidney with 1 zzso zzso partially inhibited the zzso and reduced its sensitivity to 1 zzso zzso zzso against an unrelated protein were zzso zzso the masses of the proteins detected on zzso of rat kidney by zzso a 160 zzso zzso zzso was greater than the 97 zzso of the alpha 1 zzso In zzso prepared with hot (85 degrees zzso buffer constituted according to zzso zzso for sample buffer zzso zzso a low zzso zzso zzso always bound to the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not bind any proteins on blots of zzso that were prepared with buffer that contained greater zzso of zzso and reducing agent zzso zzso zzso buffer zzso a high zzso zzso regardless of zzso However, the presence of alpha 1 in zzso produced in homogenization buffer was confirmed by the presence of zzso bands that were detected with two additional zzso zzso that recognize the alpha 1 zzso When zzso prepared with sample buffer L were zzso one of these zzso bound to bands of 160 zzso indicating that alpha 1 is a component of the bands bound by zzso It is concluded that zzso recognizes a component of the zzso site of zzso but only under conditions in which the alpha 1 zzso was associated into a higher molecular mass zzso
