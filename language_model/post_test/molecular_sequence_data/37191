zzso zzso zzso genes have been shown to be involved in the formation of lower zzso zzso during early embryonic zzso We report the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso which shows zzso zzso acid sequence identity to the mouse zzso zzso is initially expressed in a broad region of zzso lip at zzso zzso however, at later zzso the region of expression is progressively restricted to the zzso region zzso to the third zzso and to the central trunk region of zzso zzso acid treatment that caused a severe zzso in zzso axis did not induce any significant change in the zzso expression pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso injection into zzso or zzso stage zzso resulted in a severe zzso in the abdominal structure leading to embryonic zzso The results strongly indicate that zzso expression is critical for the formation of abdominal zzso
