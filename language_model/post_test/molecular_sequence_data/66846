zzso zzso zzso comprise a large family of proteins that recruit and activate zzso giving zzso a major role in both immune response and zzso zzso The zzso viral zzso zzso inhibitor zzso binds to many zzso zzso with high zzso acting as a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso We have used zzso zzso zzso to determine the structure of an zzso zzso in complex with a human zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory protein zzso zzso binds to the zzso with zzso zzso forming a complex of 311 zzso zzso uses zzso from its zzso II to interact with a surface of zzso that includes zzso adjacent to its N zzso as well as zzso in the zzso region and the zzso zzso This structure reveals the strategy used by zzso to tightly bind numerous zzso while retaining selectivity for the zzso zzso zzso
