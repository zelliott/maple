zzso of zzso have been zzso in which the zzso zzso is replaced by zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso where tested in three in zzso preparations representative of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso group of the zzso side chain by zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups results in zzso which are full zzso in zzso and zzso preparations with the exception of the zzso and the zzso zzso which are partial zzso at zzso and zzso receptors zzso The zzso analogue shows selectivity for the zzso zzso type and is zzso to the zzso analogue in the same zzso zzso The latter analogue is zzso times more potent than the parent zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso analogue is a full zzso in the zzso preparation and zzso to the parent zzso in contrast to the other zzso in which Met has been replaced by zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that for zzso zzso type the zzso character of zzso side chain is not a determining factor for activity but it is an important factor for activity in the zzso zzso type and has a stronger effect when a zzso group is present, thus leading to zzso which are full zzso and more potent than the parent zzso
