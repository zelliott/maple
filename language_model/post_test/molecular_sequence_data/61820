The killer cell zzso zzso zzso gene family encodes zzso class zzso zzso which regulate zzso cell responses and are also expressed on zzso of T zzso zzso zzso vary in gene content, which, in combination with zzso zzso extensively zzso the zzso zzso both within and between human zzso Species comparison indicates that formation of new zzso genes and loss of old ones are frequent events, so that few genes are zzso even between closely related zzso In this regard, the zzso define a time frame that is particularly zzso for understanding the processes of zzso evolution and its potential impact on killer cell zzso zzso zzso were characterized from zzso of three zzso and zzso DNA were characterized for six additional zzso Eleven gorilla zzso genes were zzso With zzso of these data, a set of 75 zzso sequences representing five zzso species was zzso which also included zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso this data set for zzso events, and zzso analysis using zzso methods, demonstrated that new zzso were usually the result of zzso between zzso in which complete protein zzso were zzso Further zzso analysis of the zzso sequences after removal of zzso zzso segments showed that only two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been preserved throughout zzso evolution, and one of them, zzso is also common to zzso monkey and zzso Other zzso genes represent zzso forms present in a minority of species, often only one, as exemplified by 8 of the 11 gorilla zzso zzso
