The zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso the zzso zzso 1 zzso and 2 zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso is zzso on zzso zzso and this site recruits zzso via its zzso zzso In contrast, zzso binds zzso zzso In this study we have characterized the zzso interaction and examined its role in zzso zzso zzso binds the major zzso protein but not a zzso containing a shorter zzso zzso The interaction does not require a zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso bind zzso in zzso however, relatively little zzso zzso associates with zzso in zzso In zzso binding zzso defined zzso zzso zzso as the minimal interaction domain and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso within this domain disrupted in zzso and in zzso zzso An zzso construct carrying these zzso was either zzso zzso in zzso cells or zzso used to complement zzso zzso zzso zzso the activity of an zzso reporter gene was not reduced but, instead, was enhanced up to zzso This suggests that this particular zzso interaction is not required for zzso zzso but might act to zzso inhibit zzso Finally, a doubly truncated zzso zzso of zzso spanning zzso zzso associated with zzso in zzso indicating that the interaction with zzso is direct and occurs in a central region of zzso marked by a zzso zzso
