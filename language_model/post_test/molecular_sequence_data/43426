The complete sequence of a Tennessee isolate of zzso zzso dwarf virus zzso was determined from zzso clones and by direct sequencing of the viral zzso The zzso is zzso zzso zzso in length and contains one large open reading frame between zzso 435 and zzso that encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences were determined for the three zzso zzso All three were zzso starting at zzso zzso and zzso ending at zzso zzso zzso of the sequence of zzso with other viral sequences revealed similarities to several plant zzso viruses including members of the zzso zzso and zzso This work also provides evidence based on zzso organization that zzso is a member of the zzso zzso within the family zzso
