Using the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated from zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso Two identical clones generated from separate zzso reactions differed from a published zzso zzso although they had a high degree of identity with the bovine and human zzso We show by sequence analysis that the zzso zzso retained the four zzso structure and zzso bonds identified in human zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso was expressed in insect cells using the zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso as a zzso zzso from insect cells infected with the zzso virus zzso an additional protein with a relative molecular mass of zzso This protein was recognized by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a Western zzso and did not react with any proteins in zzso from zzso insect cells or cells infected with the zzso zzso zzso from insect cells infected with the zzso virus induced the proliferation of activated B cells in a zzso manner and typically demonstrated 5 zzso 105 dilution zzso of zzso However, zzso had no effect on the proliferation of resting T cells isolated from zzso zzso and actually inhibited the ability of a zzso to stimulate these resting zzso In contrast, zzso induced the proliferation of zzso zzso demonstrating the complex zzso zzso plays in the regulation of B and T zzso
