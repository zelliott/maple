zzso bacteria, zzso zzso relatives of zzso zzso and zzso pneumoniae, are widely distributed in zzso Using a zzso zzso and zzso zzso approach targeting the zzso zzso zzso we found DNA of zzso bacteria in respiratory samples from patients with zzso zzso Of zzso cases tested, four zzso tested positive if only sequences showing less than zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to known zzso were zzso These included for the first time zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This study extends previous findings suggesting an association of zzso bacteria with respiratory disease, but a zzso link between these zzso and respiratory tract infections has yet to be zzso
