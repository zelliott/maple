The zzso and zzso binding motif zzso of zzso binds to zzso zzso with a preference for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso binding motif abrogates zzso zzso This results in increased zzso of activated zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso which impacts zzso II zzso zzso cells show increased zzso of zzso II in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso II assembly is regulated by zzso heavy chain zzso zzso of its zzso zzso activity depends on the zzso state of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso II zzso of zzso zzso is alleviated by zzso zzso zzso zzso It is rescued by zzso zzso whereas zzso carrying a zzso zzso and zzso binding motif failed to rescue the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso heavy chain zzso affinity zzso from zzso cells show reduced zzso zzso We propose that zzso through its affinity for zzso regulates the availability of zzso for zzso of downstream zzso
