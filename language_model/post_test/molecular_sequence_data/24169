Three genes from zzso zzso with high sequence similarity to gamma zzso zzso zzso a zzso containing zzso from zzso zzso zzso were identified and zzso zzso and structural analyses predict that these genes code for active forms of zzso zzso analyses reveal that these zzso gene products cluster together with zzso and related sequences from alpha and gamma zzso organisms proposed as the zzso zzso zzso Indeed, in zzso and in zzso experiments indicate that these gene products are transported into the zzso as occurs with several zzso protein genes zzso during evolution, from the zzso bacteria to the host zzso Moreover, putative zzso zzso genes are detected in other plants and green algae and were predicted to be imported to zzso zzso modeling and sequence analysis performed in more than a hundred zzso sequences show a high conservation of functionally important active site zzso Thus, the three zzso zzso involved in zzso coordination (His 81, 117 and zzso zzso 59, zzso 61, zzso 75, and zzso 76 of zzso are zzso and properly arranged in the active site cavity of the zzso Two other functionally important zzso zzso 62 and zzso 84 of zzso are zzso but alternative zzso acids that might serve to their roles are zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso organisms zzso algae and zzso contain zzso and that these zzso codified by nuclear genes are imported into zzso to accomplish their biological zzso
