During their zzso immature cells normally pass through sequential transitions to a differentiated state and eventually undergo cell zzso This progression is zzso in cancer, although the transition to differentiation can be zzso in zzso leukemia cell zzso This report describes a zzso zzso that we isolated from the zzso human zzso leukemia cell line during zzso zzso differentiation along the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that expression of zzso increases early in the zzso or zzso of differentiation in zzso (at 1-3 zzso before the appearance of differentiation markers and mature zzso (at 1-3 zzso They further show that zzso has sequence similarity to zzso a gene involved in normal zzso development and in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not fall into previously known gene zzso zzso differs from many zzso in that it zzso programmed cell death, promoting viability rather than zzso this parallels the association of zzso with the programming of differentiation and zzso maintenance of viability but not zzso Thus, in contrast to zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso relates to the programming of differentiation and cell zzso The discovery of zzso zzso our perspective on an emerging zzso gene family and will allow further comparison with zzso zzso
