A zzso for human zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to isolate zzso clones representing the zzso portion of the corresponding human zzso A total of zzso bases of zzso gene sequence were obtained that included zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the structure reported for the rat zzso gene zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the human zzso gene lacked a zzso box, but did contain a zzso zzso binding site at position zzso and an zzso core zzso element at position zzso zzso boxes were identified at positions zzso and zzso for the human and rat zzso zzso zzso comparisons between zzso zzso regions of the human and rat zzso genes demonstrated zzso zzso considerably less than the zzso conservation observed in the zzso coding zzso zzso extension experiments localized the zzso initiation site of the human gene to a position 116 bases zzso from the analogous site in the rat zzso zzso
