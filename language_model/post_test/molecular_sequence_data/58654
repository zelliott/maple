The bacterial zzso acts with dual zzso and zzso character to tag incomplete translation products for zzso Comparative analysis of 17 zzso genes (including eight new zzso has allowed us to deduce zzso features of the zzso secondary zzso Except in a segment that includes the first zzso of the tag reading frame, zzso is highly zzso with four zzso and a total of 11 zzso base pairing zzso The previously identified zzso zzso structure is connected by a long base paired region to a large structured domain composed of a zzso followed by the tag reading frame and a string of three rather similar zzso The conservation of numerous structural elements among diverse zzso species indicates that these elements have important function beyond simply forming an zzso link between the reading frame and the zzso zzso
