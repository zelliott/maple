zzso role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is zzso Here, we show that an unintended point zzso in the zzso zzso promoter of zzso zzso caused the zzso in gene regulation and zzso pneumonia attributed to zzso by earlier zzso In agreement with other studies that failed to detect similar effects of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we found no significant effect of zzso on gene expression or zzso after we repaired the zzso These findings provide further evidence that zzso does not have a major impact on zzso zzso zzso Moreover, our results demonstrate that a single zzso zzso in an zzso region can dramatically affect bacterial physiology and zzso Finally, our work emphasizes the need to frequently evaluate the integrity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
