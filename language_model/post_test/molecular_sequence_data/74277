Some pathogens are capable of suppressing the zzso response of host insects, but the zzso factors responsible are largely zzso The insect pathogen zzso zzso zzso encodes the zzso family of small zzso zzso zzso One family member, zzso was recently shown to suppress zzso of zzso in zzso zzso in part by zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso However, other experiments suggested this viral protein suppresses zzso by more than one zzso Here we report that zzso inhibited the zzso activity of zzso and zzso blocked processing of zzso and zzso zzso with its zzso zzso activity, zzso also prevented processing of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, and zzso Isolation of zzso complexes from plasma indicated that zzso binds zzso through its zzso repeat zzso zzso also potentially interacts with zzso and two other zzso zzso and zzso not previously associated with the zzso zzso Overall, our results indicate that zzso is a dual activity zzso inhibitor that strongly suppresses the insect zzso zzso
