A group of structurally related zzso referred to as zzso zzso accumulate in a zzso fashion in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso To investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the zzso protein zzso in the fat body, zzso sequences coding for these plasma proteins were cloned and their structures and expression during the zzso development were zzso Five zzso zzso each bearing a distinct zzso sequence coding for the zzso protein zzso were isolated from a zzso library constructed from the fat body zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These clones were remarkably similar to each other with respect to both the zzso and the zzso zzso Each clone carried an open reading frame for zzso zzso 251 to zzso with a typical signal sequence for zzso zzso at the deduced zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso provided evidence that the zzso change in the amount of zzso protein zzso in the fat body reflects well that of the zzso concentration of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso of zzso proteins is zzso regulated at a zzso or zzso level in the fat zzso
