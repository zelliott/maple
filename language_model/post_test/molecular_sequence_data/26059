We have cloned an zzso DNA fragment, zzso from the DNA of a zzso hybrid cell line containing zzso 2 as its only zzso zzso human zzso Under high stringency conditions, zzso zzso in zzso mostly to zzso 2 and to a lesser extent to zzso 18 and zzso zzso analysis using the DNA from selected zzso hybrid cell lines revealed that the zzso organization of this zzso DNA differs on each of these three zzso
