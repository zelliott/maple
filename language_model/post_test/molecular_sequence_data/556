zzso have been shown to play a significant role in zzso and introducing the zzso of many zzso secondary zzso In this study, 54 reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were identified after the zzso screening of a large collection of zzso reference strains encompassing all major families and zzso of zzso zzso The wide distribution of this gene was observed to extend to some rare lineages with higher zzso and large sequence zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that strains containing highly zzso zzso tended to produce zzso with similar structures, and zzso genes are likely to zzso by horizontal gene transfer as well as vertical inheritance within zzso Higher percentages of zzso zzso strains than those of zzso zzso ones contained zzso zzso genes and/or zzso zzso zzso genes or displayed zzso activities in the tests applied, indicating their genetic and zzso zzso for producing secondary zzso The zzso of this zzso gene screening strategy for the discovery of particular zzso gene clusters in rare zzso besides zzso was further supported by zzso zzso The described distribution and zzso implications of the zzso zzso gene present a guide for strain selection in the search for novel zzso compounds from zzso
