We have isolated the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso two members of the zzso zzso family implicated in the zzso control of motor zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a discrete subset of embryonic motor zzso and zzso that includes the zzso and zzso cells of the zzso nerve zzso In contrast to mouse where zzso of zzso leads to loss of zzso due to programmed cell death, zzso zzso is not required for zzso zzso Instead, loss of zzso function causes defects in zzso zzso and targeting plus loss of zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso both specific zzso in zzso and changes in neurotransmitter zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso controls two distinct aspects of zzso zzso
