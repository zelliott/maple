The human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso coupled zzso that mediates zzso euphoria and other important central and peripheral neurological zzso In this study, we found in a zzso zzso screen that a protein zzso zzso protein zzso specifically interacts with the C zzso of zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso was zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells that express the full-length zzso and zzso zzso The affinity of zzso for an zzso zzso and its ability to mediate the zzso of a zzso were not altered by their zzso However, the association of zzso with zzso reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso and suppressed zzso zzso partially at the G protein level and completely at the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso zzso zzso was partially inhibited by the zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso exerts a selective regulatory effect on zzso zzso This effect was specific to the zzso zzso because zzso zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso In addition, behavioral studies revealed that both zzso and zzso analgesia were significantly enhanced in the zzso mice that lacked expression of zzso zzso and these mice developed a greater extent of tolerance to zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso functions as a negative regulator in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso
