The positions of the zzso bonds of zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of the Chinese bird zzso zzso zzso have been zzso The existence of three zzso bonds in the native zzso was proved by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso To map the zzso bonds, native zzso was zzso zzso The resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase zzso liquid zzso zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analysis indicated the presence of one zzso bond zzso The partially reduced peptides by using zzso at pH zzso were zzso by reverse phase zzso liquid zzso Four M zzso was found to increase the yields of partially reduced peptides zzso The free zzso were zzso by zzso The specific location of another zzso bond zzso was proved by comparing zzso sequencing analysis of the partially reduced and zzso zzso with that of the intact zzso Finally, the three zzso linkage of zzso could be assigned as zzso zzso zzso
