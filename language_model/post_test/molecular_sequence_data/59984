Thirteen zzso 71 zzso zzso were obtained from both fatal and zzso infections of patients seen in Peninsula Malaysia and in zzso during an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease zzso in Malaysia in 1997, with zzso of fatal zzso zzso The zzso were identified using zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial sequencing of the zzso untranslated regions zzso Assessment of the potential genetic relationships of the zzso using the partial zzso sequences suggested zzso of the zzso into at least two main zzso zzso from Peninsula Malaysia were found in both clusters whereas zzso zzso clustered only in cluster zzso zzso derived from fatal infections, however, occurred in both clusters and no distinctive zzso sequences could be attributed to the fatal zzso zzso of the zzso sequences revealed at least 13 zzso positions in all the zzso which differ completely from the previously reported zzso zzso zzso In addition, at least 11 zzso position differences within the zzso were noted which differentiated cluster I from cluster zzso zzso secondary zzso structures drawn using the zzso sequences also suggested differences between zzso from the two zzso These findings suggest the presence of at least two potentially virulent zzso zzso in Malaysia during the 1997 zzso zzso
