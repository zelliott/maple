In zzso three zzso are directly involved in the hydrogen zzso a zzso that produces molecular hydrogen, zzso as a zzso of nitrogen zzso an zzso zzso that zzso zzso and zzso it, and a zzso zzso that can both zzso and produce zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso fixing zzso containing a zzso and an zzso zzso but no zzso zzso Generally, little is known about the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso In this study gel shift zzso showed that zzso has a specific affinity to a region of the zzso promoter containing a predicted zzso binding zzso The predicted zzso binding site is zzso at zzso zzso upstream the zzso start point zzso To further investigate the zzso promoter, truncated versions of the zzso promoter were fused to either zzso or zzso zzso the reporter proteins Green Fluorescent zzso and zzso zzso 

Interestingly, all zzso promoter deletion zzso showed zzso specific zzso Unexpectedly the shortest promoter fragment, a zzso covering 57 zzso upstream and 258 zzso downstream the zzso exhibited the highest promoter zzso zzso of the zzso binding site neither affected the expression to any larger extent nor the zzso zzso 

zzso data suggest that the zzso promoter in zzso zzso is not strictly dependent on the upstream zzso zzso element and that the shortest promoter zzso zzso to zzso is enough for a high and zzso specific expression of zzso This is highly interesting because it indicates that the information that determines zzso specific gene expression might be confined to this short sequence or in the downstream untranslated leader zzso
