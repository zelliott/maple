zzso are cell zzso proteins thought to mediate zzso contacts at the tight zzso Although a major role of zzso is to control zzso zzso increasing evidence suggests that they may also function in tumor zzso To examine the role of the second zzso loop in cell zzso a small zzso was zzso which mimics a zzso zzso zzso within specific zzso zzso zzso Using fluorescent indicators with zzso zzso cells, treatment with both the zzso and zzso of this zzso showed zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso indicating zzso To test zzso peptides were made both with various zzso and with zzso zzso at each of the five zzso zzso zzso did not influence the activity of the zzso zzso acid zzso at zzso zzso zzso or zzso however, prevented zzso zzso A zzso zzso was shown to associate with the tight junction at 4 zzso and cause zzso when the cultures were warmed to 37 zzso In conclusion, both the zzso and zzso of a small zzso that mimics a sequence in the second zzso loop of zzso can target and disrupt zzso proteins in an zzso zzso and initiate zzso
