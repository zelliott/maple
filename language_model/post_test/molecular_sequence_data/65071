Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso sandstone were zzso zzso and by molecular zzso zzso The zzso had single spores on zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso wall type zzso a whole cell sugar pattern D zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso of type zzso zzso zzso zzso Their zzso fatty acids were zzso and zzso or zzso the zzso profile was complex with mainly zzso zzso and zzso zzso A wide variety of zzso and several acids were zzso for zzso The zzso were sensitive to a few zzso but formation and zzso of antibiotics was not zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences revealed close relationship of strains zzso and zzso with each other zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed both strains to be zzso highly similar to strain zzso zzso zzso they could be viewed as separate zzso but presently they will be considered as strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso close to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso was low with zzso zzso indicating the presence of a different and new zzso zzso isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is described as the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso
