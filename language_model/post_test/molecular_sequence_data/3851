The V zzso 10 family in zzso mice is composed of three members, two of which are zzso in a variety of immune zzso We previously demonstrated that the product of the third zzso V zzso zzso has never been detected as part of a functional zzso and productive zzso are selectively lost during zzso zzso Here we analyzed zzso V zzso 10 genes from zzso and zzso mice by zzso and sequencing in order to determine the origin of the V zzso zzso zzso as well as to examine the evolutionary relationships of V zzso 10 zzso Our results demonstrated that the V zzso 10 family is highly zzso across zzso species and subspecies, but that V zzso zzso is rare, being found in only zzso mice of V zzso 10 zzso group b and two of six zzso zzso zzso zzso It was not found in other zzso zzso subspecies or zzso zzso V zzso zzso and V zzso zzso were found in all zzso with the exception of one zzso zzso zzso zzso which had only V zzso zzso zzso Overall, V zzso zzso sequences were more highly zzso than V zzso zzso indicating that different selective pressures may be operating on these zzso The two V zzso zzso sequences from zzso zzso zzso were zzso identical to that found in zzso zzso V zzso zzso is more closely related to V zzso zzso than to V zzso zzso and our data suggest that it is a recent zzso of the V zzso zzso zzso
