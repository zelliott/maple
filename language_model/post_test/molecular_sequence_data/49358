zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso carries the zzso zzso zzso a type III zzso on a 40 zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that this zzso might carry additional genes required for zzso on zzso We report the sequence and features of zzso In addition to zzso zzso carries an zzso of another type III zzso termed zzso and a gene of unknown function zzso expression of which is induced in zzso suggesting a role in the zzso zzso The region of zzso carrying zzso zzso and zzso exhibits several features of zzso islands zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a significant reduction in zzso on zzso zzso However, zzso studies using zzso zzso demonstrated an obvious zzso function only for zzso zzso can integrate and zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso at low frequency via zzso zzso between identical sequence segments located on the zzso and on zzso These segments are part of two nearly identical zzso carrying zzso The zzso zzso was also detected in other strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso tomato strain zzso The zzso zzso was found inserted at different zzso in different zzso The analysis of sequences surrounding the zzso zzso zzso site in the zzso of zzso zzso indicates that zzso zzso into a zzso that encodes type III zzso The integration of zzso into this zzso region may therefore be seen as an evolutionary process determining the formation of a new zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso
