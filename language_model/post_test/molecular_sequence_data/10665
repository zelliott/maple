Sixty out of 219 zzso bacteria selected from more than zzso urinary pathogens in an zzso zzso survey performed in Italy were screened for zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Only five zzso three zzso and two zzso carried plasmids zzso respectively, zzso and zzso zzso zzso resistance in the other zzso was caused by an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso transport zzso One strain, zzso zzso 279, incorporated zzso and its mechanism of zzso resistance needs to be further zzso Our study showed that zzso amplification is the most accurate, simple and rapid method for zzso studies of zzso zzso resistance, and that zzso resistance zzso by zzso genes (both zzso and zzso accounts for only a low percentage of the zzso zzso
