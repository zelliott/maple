The zzso C virus zzso zzso protein 3 zzso domain has been predicted from sequence comparisons to represent a zzso zzso zzso By expressing zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, we have identified putative zzso proteins 3 zzso zzso 4 (10 zzso and 27 zzso and 5 zzso zzso and have shown that their processing from the viral zzso precursor is dependent on zzso located in the proposed zzso zzso zzso Data obtained from in zzso zzso translations indicate that unlike the processing of the zzso zzso zzso processing is dependent on zzso In contrast to the situation for the related zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso junction does not require the upstream zzso domain and may not occur at zzso zzso
