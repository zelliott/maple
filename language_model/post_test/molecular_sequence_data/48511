The zzso zzso domain represents a very versatile protein domain that mediates the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins are involved in various nuclear functions, including modulating zzso structure and zzso zzso In this study, we identified the gene zzso in zzso zzso The predicted zzso contained a single zzso an zzso domain and a neutral zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the growth and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso showed a higher expression levels during the zzso zzso zzso knockout strains showed no obvious zzso zzso although initiation of zzso knockout strain mating was delayed and maximum mating was zzso zzso localized on the zzso zzso during the zzso growth and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso specially decorated the zzso and zzso functional zzso during the zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso box domain disappeared from zzso and diffused in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso maintained in newly developing zzso and affected the viability of zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso is a zzso zzso marker zzso It may bind to zzso DNA sequences or structures and is likely to have some function specific to zzso of zzso zzso
