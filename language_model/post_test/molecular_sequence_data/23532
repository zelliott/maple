zzso is a zzso zzso zzso the zzso bond after the penultimate zzso zzso It is an important drug target for the treatment of type II zzso zzso is active as a zzso and zzso zzso has been speculated to be zzso In this study, we have identified the zzso loop of zzso highly zzso among zzso zzso as essential for zzso formation and optimal zzso The zzso zzso zzso on the loop contributes significantly for zzso zzso We have determined the zzso structures of the wild type, zzso and zzso zzso zzso by several independent methods including chemical zzso gel zzso size exclusion zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exists as zzso both in the intact cell and in zzso after zzso from human zzso or insect zzso The zzso zzso results in a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has the same kinetic zzso as those of the wild type, whereas the zzso zzso has a zzso decrease in zzso Replacement of zzso with a zzso charged zzso zzso results in nearly exclusive zzso with a zzso decrease in zzso zzso Interestingly, there is no dynamic equilibrium between the zzso and the zzso for all forms of zzso studied zzso This is the first study of the function of the zzso loop as well as zzso zzso zzso with respect to their zzso zzso The study has important implications for the discovery of drugs targeted to the zzso zzso
