The zzso zzso zzso of eastern Australia have been described as a zzso zzso where a chain of cool mountain zzso arise from a warm zzso of tropical and zzso zzso An endemic freshwater zzso belonging to the zzso zzso is found on each of these mountain zzso The zzso are particularly suitable for the study of evolution because each mountain harbors a unique species, there are many zzso present providing replication within the group and, most importantly, their distribution is zzso extending along a zzso zzso This group could have evolved by zzso zzso where there was one zzso separation event of a widespread zzso or by zzso to north stepping stone zzso where there were long distance zzso events from neighboring mountain islands, starting in the south and proceeding north in a zzso zzso We used zzso genetic distances between nearest geographic neighbors as a novel way to test the two zzso If diversification was due to zzso to north stepping stone zzso then zzso genetic distances between nearest geographic neighbors should decrease progressively the farther north the zzso pairs are found, reflecting the decreasing periods of zzso In this case there should be a negative correlation between the south to north rank order of nearest neighbors and zzso genetic zzso A zzso correlation on zzso zzso zzso genetic distances and geographic rank order was not zzso indicating there was no support for the south to north stepping stone zzso zzso If simultaneous zzso was responsible for diversification then all nearest geographic neighbor zzso pairs should have similar genetic distances and, therefore, the zzso in nearest neighbor distances should be zero, or close to zzso To test if the observed zzso was tending towards zero we developed a zzso test where nearest neighbor zzso pairs were assigned random genetic distances and the zzso zzso The observed zzso lay in the zzso zzso range of the simulated zzso providing support for the simultaneous zzso zzso The data also suggest there was simultaneous zzso of at least two ancestral zzso zzso The timing of this zzso event was probably in the zzso which is consistent with the divergence times reported for other Australian zzso rainforest restricted zzso
