zzso 1 and zzso 2 are zzso membrane zzso whose genes are zzso in some individuals with Alzheimer's zzso zzso have been shown to influence limited zzso of zzso beta protein precursor zzso zzso and zzso and have been proposed to be zzso that perform the terminal zzso of zzso In this model, two zzso and apparently zzso zzso acids participate in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are known in plants, zzso and zzso In this work, we have used a combination of different sequence database search methods to identify a new family of proteins zzso to zzso Members of this family, which we term zzso zzso zzso have significant sequence similarities to zzso and also possess two zzso zzso acid zzso within adjacent predicted zzso zzso The zzso family is found throughout the zzso in zzso as well as plants and animals, and in zzso Five zzso are zzso in the human zzso of which three possess zzso zzso that are consistent with the proposed zzso function of zzso Based on these findings, we propose that zzso and zzso represent different zzso of a larger family of zzso zzso zzso zzso
