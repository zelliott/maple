The high affinity zzso zzso is composed of three cell surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso forms of the zzso zzso exist, however, that enlist only two of the three zzso On activated zzso the zzso and zzso combine as a zzso zzso (the zzso affinity zzso that serves to capture zzso On a zzso of natural killer cells, the zzso and zzso interact in a zzso manner to form the intermediate affinity zzso zzso Previously, we have demonstrated the feasibility of employing zzso molecular recognition for the solution assembly of a zzso zzso zzso zzso In that study, although the zzso was functional, the zzso complex was a zzso rather than the desired zzso We have now redesigned the zzso zzso sequences of the zzso to generate soluble forms of both the zzso affinity and the intermediate affinity zzso zzso zzso The properties of these complexes were examined and their relevance to the zzso zzso zzso mechanism is zzso
