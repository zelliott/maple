zzso growth zzso zzso zzso the major bone zzso zzso the biological activity of zzso within the zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso organic zzso zzso zzso we assessed whether the zzso binding domain of zzso zzso zzso the interaction of zzso with the zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the binding of zzso to zzso as well as the binding of zzso to zzso zzso This action was specific for the zzso domain, because zzso zzso and zzso were without zzso zzso was found to bind directly to zzso and cause a zzso enhancement of the zzso binding affinity for zzso whether zzso was bound to zzso or was in a zzso fluid zzso zzso inhibited the binding of zzso to zzso and blocked the interaction of zzso with zzso in the fluid phase, suggesting that the primary zzso domain of zzso specifically enhances the binding of zzso to zzso and increases zzso binding to zzso
