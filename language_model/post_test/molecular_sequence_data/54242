Aedes aegypti and zzso zzso are among the zzso zzso species within the zzso and zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso million years zzso Despite this evolutionary distance, the zzso systems of these mosquitoes exhibit similar zzso and zzso zzso Paradoxically, zzso zzso zzso which lie at the heart of zzso signal zzso zzso belong to a large and highly divergent gene zzso We have used 2 zzso expression systems to investigate the functional characteristics of a highly zzso subset of zzso between zzso aegypti and zzso zzso to investigate whether protein zzso zzso with zzso zzso We find that these receptors share similar zzso response profiles and that zzso a common and ecologically relevant zzso zzso elicits strong responses from these zzso zzso The identification of other highly zzso members of this Or zzso from zzso species of varying zzso zzso supports a model in which high sensitivity to zzso represents an ancient ecological adaptation that has been preserved as a result of its life cycle zzso These results provide an understanding of how similarities and disparities among zzso OR proteins relate to zzso function, which can lead to greater insights into the design of successful strategies for the control of zzso zzso
