The zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso are required for zzso development of germ cells, in addition to their role in primordial germ zzso To clarify their function, a detailed examination of the pattern of expression of zzso in zzso zzso was zzso In zzso the expression of zzso as seen by zzso zzso analysis and by zzso protection zzso is relatively high at birth zzso low from zzso to zzso and high from zzso zzso zzso expression is relatively high in zzso of all zzso The forms of zzso zzso present in the zzso suggest that from zzso zzso the zzso form of zzso zzso while in the zzso significant amounts of both forms are zzso As observed by in zzso zzso and zzso in the newborn zzso zzso is highly expressed in central cords whose cells contribute to the formation of central growing zzso zzso is low in zzso cells of small growing zzso and increases to high levels in zzso zzso during late zzso zzso Large amounts of the zzso are found within growing zzso After zzso growth zzso expression continues only in the outer layers of multilayered zzso In the zzso from zzso through zzso zzso expression is distinct in zzso cells, but not in germ zzso zzso the intensity of zzso expression declines as the number of zzso cells increases within the zzso zzso in zzso cells appears to be concentrated zzso at the stage of the cycle of the zzso zzso when it is known to interact with zzso type A zzso These data are consistent with a role for zzso in zzso growth and in zzso proliferation and/or differentiation of type A zzso
