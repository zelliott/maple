The structures of the first and the second zzso segment of the bovine zzso zzso carrier zzso were studied by circular zzso zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of its primary sequence were zzso and structurally characterized in zzso zzso CD data showed that at high zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso both peptides assume zzso structures, whereas in more zzso environments only zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two peptides in zzso and zzso were fully zzso and the secondary structures of the peptides were obtained from nuclear zzso effects, zzso zzso zzso and zzso chemical zzso The three-dimensional solution structures of the peptides in zzso were generated by distance geometry zzso A zzso zzso was found in the region zzso of zzso zzso and in the region zzso of zzso zzso We cannot exclude that in intact zzso the extension of these zzso is zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is essentially zzso whereas that of zzso zzso is predominantly zzso
