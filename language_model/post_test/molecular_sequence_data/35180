A stock of 148 zzso zzso DNA extracts from zzso and goat kids selected from a previous study examining the occurrence of zzso species and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and goat kids in northeastern Spain was further characterized by a zzso zzso typing approach with six zzso and zzso zzso Various degrees of zzso were seen at all but the zzso zzso although all markers exhibited two major zzso accounting for more than zzso of zzso A total of 56 zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and goat kids (11 zzso were zzso Individual zzso with mixed zzso were detected on more than zzso of the farms, but most zzso zzso were distinctive for individual farms, revealing the zzso of zzso infections on sheep and goat zzso zzso with a previous study in calves in northern Spain using the same zzso zzso scheme showed the presence of zzso zzso differences in the identity of major zzso and very little overlap in zzso between zzso zzso zzso from zzso and those from calves (1 zzso or zzso from zzso and those from goat kids (3 zzso The zzso index of the zzso technique was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso which supports its high zzso power for strain typing and zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed the presence of two zzso zzso showing epidemic zzso among the zzso zzso zzso infecting calves and zzso kids, respectively, although evidence of genetic flow between the two zzso was also zzso
