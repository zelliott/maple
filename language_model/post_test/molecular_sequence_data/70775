During an zzso survey of zzso infections established to monitor the prevalent G zzso circulating in the United States, human zzso zzso I zzso strains causing symptomatic infections were identified as the fourth most common zzso In this report we describe the molecular and zzso characterization of one of these zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequencing studies have demonstrated that both outer zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are closely related to but genetically and zzso distinguishable from those of standard zzso strains zzso zzso zzso and standard zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus the complete zzso type of zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso genes of zzso indicates that strain zzso possessed zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso Finally, Northern zzso studies suggest that the zzso strains are closely related to members of the zzso zzso except for their zzso zzso zzso which has been commonly identified in strains of both major human zzso and their zzso zzso zzso which may have been derived by zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso of historic collections and prospective surveillance of strains will be needed to determine whether this strain has been present for some time or if it is emerging to compete with the other common zzso of zzso
