A soybean zzso zzso zzso named zzso has a markedly extended zzso segment compared to other plant zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family known to zzso To further characterize the molecular structure and the expression pattern of this zzso family, we cloned two typical zzso zzso zzso and zzso from soybeans by zzso zzso The deduced primary sequence of zzso zzso is composed of a signal zzso segment zzso zzso acid zzso and a mature 273 zzso acid sequence zzso molecular mass zzso calculated zzso zzso This zzso zzso is more than zzso identical to zzso zzso but is below 50% identical to zzso zzso Thus, we confirmed the occurrence of two distinct classes, zzso and zzso in the plant zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso interrupted by one zzso were found to be zzso in response to zzso in stems and leaves, but scarcely expressed in developing soybean zzso zzso zzso may be responsible for protecting the plant body from various zzso zzso
