A zzso zzso with capping activity has zzso activity, here characterized alongside its zzso somewhat zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso times slower than the zzso activity, depending on zzso The zzso zzso zzso release 170 zzso times over a control composed of zzso zzso and zzso capped zzso zzso zzso zzso over random capped zzso zzso zzso also supports an unusual zzso reaction, exchanging its cap with zzso zzso to form zzso zzso zzso a capping zzso for the zzso appears to suppress both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities have in common an unusual zzso metal zzso requirement for zzso or less effectively zzso and both are active over a broad pH range of zzso zzso These characteristics resemble the capping activity of the same zzso zzso analysis reveals a zzso zzso complex, and zzso and zzso act as competitive zzso of zzso A strong zzso site is suggested by a low zzso of zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso The role of zzso in these reactions can be zzso from literature data on zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities of isolate 6 zzso are apparently carried out by a single reaction center, whose rate of reaction with all zzso sums to a constant total zzso This suggests a universal zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by this reaction center raises the possibility of zzso zzso
