The zzso zzso sodium channel zzso has previously been shown to be involved in the maintenance of body fluid volume and in zzso zzso across the skin and urinary zzso in zzso However, the function and distribution of zzso have not been clearly described in zzso zzso We therefore cloned the zzso zzso zzso from kidney of the marine zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and protein were abundantly expressed in the kidney and in the urinary zzso and zzso pelvic zzso In an zzso study, the zzso zzso protein was specifically localized to the zzso membrane of the principal cells but not the zzso cells from the late zzso zzso to the collecting duct in the kidney or in the zzso area of cells of urinary zzso zzso When toads were zzso to dry and zzso zzso the levels of zzso zzso expression in the kidney and urinary zzso decreased under zzso zzso but not under dry zzso zzso observations indicated that the levels of zzso protein expression were much lower in the zzso area of zzso zzso zzso and urinary zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso The present study suggests that zzso zzso is significantly expressed and functions during zzso zzso in the zzso membrane domain in the zzso zzso of normal and desiccated zzso zzso may be caused by decreases in zzso expression and its trafficking to the cell surface in the zzso zzso a response to prevent excessive zzso zzso in zzso zzso
