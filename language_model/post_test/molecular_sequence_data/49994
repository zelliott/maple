Two novel zzso for zzso C, a zzso zzso zzso zzso from snake zzso have been zzso from zzso cerebral zzso by a zzso zzso Using tandem mass zzso the isolated zzso were identified as zzso gamma and zzso zzso highly zzso zzso proteins involved in the regulation of numerous zzso zzso The interaction between zzso C and zzso proteins is direct and not zzso by zzso a zzso zzso for both zzso C and zzso zzso as demonstrated in pull-down experiments and by surface zzso zzso The latter technique gave an apparent zzso constant of zzso zzso for the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso usually interacts with proteins through specific zzso zzso zzso C is not a zzso therefore the interaction must occur through a zzso binding site, most probably the zzso sequence at its zzso zzso The interaction we describe suggests an explanation for the zzso effects evoked by some zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso of protein zzso of terminal zzso zzso and of zzso as well as the initiation of zzso cell death, all processes regulated by zzso zzso
