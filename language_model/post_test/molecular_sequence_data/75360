A zzso library of zzso zzso was constructed by cloning sheared zzso DNA into the expression zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were screened using zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso that mediate zzso 10 clones with different size zzso were zzso These clones possessed zzso sequences localized to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso All clones produced fusion proteins that reacted with acute and zzso zzso of patients infected with zzso zzso Interestingly, one zzso zzso contained an zzso that was confined to a region of 13 zzso acids present in the zzso zzso zzso as a single zzso The identification of this zzso zzso permits the production of a synthetic zzso that can be used as a rational vaccine candidate and zzso zzso
