zzso zzso zzso are a widespread family of zzso zzso that consist of zzso zzso zzso within a protein zzso For zzso to function specific zzso must be zzso We recently reported that a short zzso targeting sequence of zzso zzso zzso is necessary and sufficient for the packaging of zzso into a zzso that functions in zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Here we show that zzso is zzso by binding of the zzso targeting sequence to a short zzso zzso of the zzso shell zzso In zzso studies indicated binding between zzso and zzso (and zzso but not other zzso shell zzso zzso scanning zzso determined that the key zzso involved in binding are zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso In zzso targeting studies indicated that the binding between the N zzso of zzso and the C zzso of zzso is critical for zzso of zzso within the zzso zzso zzso models suggest that the N zzso of zzso and C zzso of zzso both form zzso structures that bind one another via the key zzso identified by zzso zzso these results show that the zzso targeting sequence of zzso promotes its zzso by binding to zzso shell zzso This is a unique report determining the mechanism by which a zzso targeting sequence zzso We propose that specific interactions between the zzso of shell proteins and zzso zzso have general importance for guiding the assembly and the higher level organization of bacterial zzso
