The structure of the zzso hormone distributor zzso zzso has been highly zzso during the evolution of zzso Over the last decade, studies into the evolution of zzso have revealed the existence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in all zzso zzso studies have suggested that the zzso gene in fact arose as a result of a zzso of the zzso protein gene in early zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso proteins from various organisms have revealed the remarkable conservation of the zzso zzso zzso The only significant differences between the structures of zzso protein and zzso were localized to the zzso interface and indicated that zzso hormones could not be bound by zzso zzso All zzso proteins studied to date have been demonstrated to function in zzso metabolism by zzso the zzso product of zzso acid, zzso The zzso characterizing the zzso site in zzso proteins are zzso zzso in all zzso protein sequences but are absent in zzso zzso it was proposed that following zzso of the zzso protein zzso loss of these zzso zzso resulted in the formation of a deep, zzso charged channel that runs through the zzso of the zzso zzso The results thus demonstrate the remarkable evolution of the zzso zzso protein from a zzso zzso to a zzso hormone distributor zzso
