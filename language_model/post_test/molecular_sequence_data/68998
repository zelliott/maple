We have identified a new type of A alpha zzso to Val substitution in a zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from a 15-year-old boy having zzso easy bruising and delayed wound zzso The functional zzso was characterized by altered zzso zzso zzso which became evident by increasing the salt concentration and zzso A synthetic zzso with a sequence of the zzso segment of normal zzso zzso zzso substantially inhibited zzso of both normal and the zzso zzso zzso A synthetic zzso with the zzso type sequence of zzso inhibited zzso of the patient's zzso zzso partially at a zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio of zzso and that of normal one at a much higher ratio of zzso Likewise, a synthetic zzso zzso with a replacement of the zzso zzso by another zzso zzso acid Ala inhibited similarly the patient's zzso zzso zzso Thus, the hypothetical two-pronged zzso structure consisting of the zzso group of the zzso zzso and the zzso group of an zzso at position 3 of the normal zzso zzso seems to be restored considerably in the zzso zzso zzso at low zzso strengths and zzso despite the replacement of the zzso zzso by another zzso zzso acid zzso
