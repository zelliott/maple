zzso zzso have been successfully induced in normal, zzso mice by zzso with complexes formed with a zzso zzso zzso and native, B form, zzso zzso zzso is a zzso acid zzso from the internal domain of a zzso fusion protein from zzso zzso The structure of this zzso is zzso to the consensus zzso acid sequence for a zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso binds to zzso A panel of six zzso zzso zzso two zzso and four zzso have been generated from a single zzso mouse zzso with zzso The V region structures for both H and L chains of the induced zzso zzso are highly zzso if not identical to the V region structures of spontaneous zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso of the zzso zzso were also similar to those of zzso zzso zzso Three of the four induced zzso zzso bound equally well to native and zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso specific for zzso can be induced with zzso complexes of native zzso They also demonstrate that zzso representatives of the induced zzso zzso have zzso and structural characteristics similar if not identical to those of spontaneous zzso zzso from zzso zzso The experimental system described here should provide insight not only about the structural basis for zzso to DNA but also the function of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso
