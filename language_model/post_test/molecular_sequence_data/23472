The major surface zzso gene 1 zzso is zzso among members of zzso and may play an important role in zzso zzso Additionally, generation and selection of different zzso zzso of zzso has the potential for inclusion in a zzso vaccine or in the development of a diagnostic zzso In this study, patterns of zzso zzso were used to test the hypothesis that natural selection promotes diversity in different parts of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence analysis of zzso from multiple zzso zzso zzso identified two zzso zzso were identical zzso and highly divergent zzso Also, zzso reconstruction showed sequences zzso into two zzso zzso and zzso and zzso neutrality tests indicated that selection is more likely to be acting on zzso Moreover, a sliding window analysis based on the ratio of silent zzso to zzso acid replacements provided strong evidence that two short segments in the central and 3' domain of zzso have been under positive selection in the divergence of the two zzso suggesting that it may be important for the evasion of host immune responses and would be a suitable target for vaccine zzso
