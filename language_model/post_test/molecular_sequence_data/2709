The activity and zzso specificity of the promoter of the zzso alpha 1 gene of zzso zzso were examined by measuring expression of an zzso alpha zzso gene fusion in zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha zzso A high level of zzso activity was observed only in zzso alpha zzso zzso expression occurred in zzso cells when the hybrid gene was carried on a zzso zzso or on a zzso zzso but not when the hybrid gene was integrated at the normal zzso alpha 1 zzso Analysis of a set of zzso of the promoter region of the zzso alpha zzso gene on the zzso zzso indicated that sequences from zzso to zzso upstream of the zzso start site were required for high level expression in zzso alpha zzso Smaller internal deletions and insertions within the promoter region of the zzso alpha zzso gene were inserted into the zzso at the normal zzso alpha 1 zzso These zzso further delineated four promoter zzso important for expression: zzso two 26 zzso elements zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso with imperfect zzso zzso zzso a 40 zzso segment zzso to zzso that lies about 120 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso box itself zzso to zzso The zzso start sites of the normal zzso alpha 1 promoter and of a zzso lacking the zzso box were zzso The zzso alpha 1 locus was mapped to the left arm of zzso XVI, about 22 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso
