zzso is the zzso of a recently emerging zzso among zzso type zzso zzso and is known to become zzso and activated by a wide range of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Although zzso was recently shown to be involved in the zzso zzso mechanism of zzso transcription, it is yet obscure how zzso zzso the signals from cell surface receptors to the zzso To identify signaling molecules acting downstream of zzso we have looked for zzso proteins zzso by using the zzso zzso zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel zzso zzso which has been simultaneously identified by other groups as zzso zzso or zzso zzso carries one zzso zzso 2 domain with a sequence similarity to that of zzso In zzso cells, zzso associates with zzso and suppresses its zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso can also zzso the activity of zzso but not that of zzso We propose that zzso is a novel type of negative regulator to a subset of zzso zzso
