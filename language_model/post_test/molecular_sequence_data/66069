Genome sequencing projects are either based on whole zzso shotgun zzso or on a zzso zzso Although zzso is in most cases the preferred choice, sometimes the zzso approach may be better because it requires a much simpler assembly zzso Furthermore, when the study is limited to specific regions of the zzso the zzso would require an zzso effort, making the zzso the only feasible zzso In this paper we describe an zzso pipeline called zzso zzso Assisted zzso zzso that we developed to provide a tool to zzso the zzso sequencing zzso zzso has two main zzso zzso zzso to choose suitable overlapping zzso and zzso zzso to verify whether a zzso under analysis is actually overlapping the neighboring zzso
