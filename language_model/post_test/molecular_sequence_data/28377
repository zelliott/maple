zzso acid, zzso and other zzso zzso inhibit DNA zzso activity by interrupting DNA breakage and reunion by A zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Despite their clinical importance, the mode of zzso action and mechanisms of resistance are poorly understood at the molecular zzso Using a DNA zzso enrichment zzso we isolated the zzso gene from a zzso zzso coli strain that encodes a zzso A protein zzso to a variety of zzso When zzso with zzso B zzso the zzso A protein zzso DNA zzso activity approximately zzso more resistant to zzso by zzso than the susceptible zzso and failed to mediate zzso DNA zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the gene differed at 58 zzso positions compared with the K-12 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso A protein differed at three positions from its zzso zzso coli K-12 zzso zzso zzso and zzso replaced zzso zzso and zzso zzso at positions 83, zzso and zzso zzso By genetic analysis of zzso zzso genes in a zzso background, we showed that the zzso zzso in the zzso A protein was solely responsible for high-level bacterial resistance to zzso acid and zzso
