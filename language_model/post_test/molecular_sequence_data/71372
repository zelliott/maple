This study was designed to demonstrate that the principle of molecular recognition underlying zzso binding of zzso II to the type 2 zzso zzso is distinct from that of the type 1 zzso zzso In general, the same functional zzso in hormones are used to bind and activate different zzso of cell surface zzso However, the binding of zzso II to the zzso zzso is distinct from that of the zzso zzso 

To systematically evaluate the effect of modification of zzso II side chains on binding to both the zzso several zzso of zzso II were zzso zzso zzso or zzso receptors expressed in zzso cell zzso were used to determine the affinity of zzso using zzso competition binding experiments under equilibrium zzso 

zzso of all zzso II side chains affected binding to the zzso zzso to nearly similar zzso In contrast, binding to the zzso zzso was significantly affected by modifications at side chain positions 2, 4, 6 and zzso In accordance with previous observations that zzso or zzso zzso II zzso antagonized zzso zzso exclusively by the zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso was significantly dependent on zzso or zzso of zzso II whereas binding to the zzso zzso was zzso Rather surprisingly, the affinity profile of several zzso II zzso towards the zzso zzso was similar to the measured affinity of the zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso zzso is very distinct from that of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is in a constrained zzso and is activated only when bound to zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso is zzso in that no single interaction is critical for zzso like the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso zzso
