To identify factors that interact with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso library was screened using the zzso zzso as zzso A novel zzso zzso containing a putative zzso domain zzso was found to interact with zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso gene belongs to a small gene family of at least three zzso Northern zzso analysis showed zzso to be strongly expressed in zzso flowers, roots, and immature zzso but not in leaf zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso transcript in the leaf zzso was induced significantly within 4 h of exposure of zzso zzso zzso to cold stress, whereas treatment of leaf zzso with zzso an zzso of zzso caused a rapid (30 zzso but transient induction of zzso zzso In contrast to that observed in leaf zzso expression of zzso in the stems was zzso upon cold zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso interacts with zzso via the zzso domain, and that zzso is critical for zzso zzso zzso also exerted modest zzso of the zzso reporter gene in zzso through its zzso zzso These zzso suggest that zzso may function as a zzso factor, which regulates gene expression through interaction with zzso
