We have shown that charged zzso acids near zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso discrimination between zzso and zzso We now examine the role of charged zzso adjacent to the three other zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso domain of the human zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso abilities of the zzso zzso of the one charged zzso acid nearest to zzso gave a zzso zzso zzso requiring two to three times less zzso zzso than wild type zzso zzso to achieve zzso activity and having activity in the absence of added zzso that was zzso higher than that of zzso zzso The enhanced ability of this zzso to bind to zzso response element DNA in the absence and presence of zzso may, at least in part, explain its zzso seemingly zzso zzso activity and its increased sensitivity to zzso While more sensitive to zzso this zzso zzso was less sensitive than zzso zzso to zzso for suppression of zzso zzso zzso of all three charged zzso nearest to zzso (the triple zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in a greatly reduced potency of the zzso in zzso with no change in zzso zzso When zzso (near zzso highly zzso among steroid zzso was zzso to zzso zzso more zzso was required for zzso reporter gene zzso due to an zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso (near zzso was zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso These studies reveal a region in the zzso portion of the zzso domain zzso zzso acids zzso where zzso in charged zzso result in either increases or decreases in zzso zzso activity with no change in zzso affinity for zzso Our findings suggest that this region may be important in DNA binding and zzso interactions that zzso zzso activity of the zzso In addition, the region near zzso which is well zzso among steroid zzso appears to be important in maintaining the zzso in a zzso that is stable at zzso zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of an zzso zzso with a sensitivity to zzso for zzso greater than that of zzso zzso and having high zzso activity in the absence of added zzso
