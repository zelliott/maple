In bovine heart zzso and in zzso zzso zzso proteins with apparent molecular masses of 18 and 10 zzso become strongly zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein is zzso zzso from complex I and not as previously reported the 18 k zzso (with the zzso sequence zzso The zzso zzso in zzso zzso is zzso zzso In the 10 zzso band, the complex I zzso zzso was zzso on zzso zzso In the presence of protein zzso A and zzso the same zzso of zzso complex I were zzso by zzso at the same zzso zzso zzso and zzso both contribute to the membrane arm of complex zzso Each has a single zzso region probably folded into a membrane spanning zzso It is likely that the zzso site of zzso zzso lies in the zzso zzso and that the site in zzso zzso is in the zzso zzso zzso zzso has no known role, but zzso zzso is required for assembly into complex I of seven zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The possible effects of zzso of these zzso on the activity and/or the assembly of complex I remain to be zzso
