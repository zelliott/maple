zzso of a zzso zzso in the adult mouse liver was observed on zzso zzso To characterize this zzso zzso we determined the primary structure of its zzso and examined its expression zzso This zzso zzso consisted of 504 zzso acids and showed 92, 68, 88, and zzso zzso acid sequence identity with mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and was designated as zzso a new mouse zzso zzso In the female liver, levels of zzso zzso expression were comparable to those of zzso the major zzso zzso in the adult mouse zzso zzso of zzso zzso was detected immediately after birth in the zzso of animals of both zzso but increased with age in zzso whereas it was gradually reduced in zzso resulting in predominantly zzso expression in zzso Lesser amounts of zzso zzso were detected in the zzso of female mice, with traces in the stomach, zzso and heart of female mice and in the zzso of male zzso zzso and sex hormone treatment indicated that zzso and testosterone were able to induce and suppress the expression of zzso zzso in the liver, zzso Among the classical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not affect the level of zzso zzso in the liver of either zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso and zzso suppressed zzso level to half that of zzso female zzso These observations indicated that zzso is a zzso zzso and one of the major zzso forms in the female mouse zzso
