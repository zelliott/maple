Currently most available zzso zzso and -C DNA sequences cover zzso 2 and 3 with a limited number extending to include other zzso and zzso We have developed a method for the accurate determination of full-length zzso DNA sequences for zzso zzso and -C zzso The method involves cloning of zzso amplified full-length zzso genes to separate zzso at zzso zzso The approach avoids any ambiguities from sequencing zzso zzso products directly and also avoids ambiguities from sequencing overlapping zzso products to achieve full-length zzso To date we have zzso full-length zzso sequences from representatives of all the major zzso and -C zzso zzso
