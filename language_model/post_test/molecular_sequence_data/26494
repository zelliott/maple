The concept of zzso display is based on zzso of random zzso at an appropriate location within a structural gene of a zzso The resulting zzso will constitute a library of random peptides displayed on the surface of the zzso with the zzso zzso packaged within each zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso system, the random peptides are zzso between zzso coat zzso Libraries of zzso peptides may be used to search for novel zzso zzso to target zzso The success of finding a zzso with a desired property in a given library is highly dependent on the diversity and quality of the zzso The protocols in this chapter describe the construction of a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso coat protein zzso with random zzso from which a zzso library displaying random peptides can be zzso
