zzso synthesis in bacteria involves the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso As zzso organisms differ in their protein zzso mechanisms, zzso zzso the bacterial zzso responsible for zzso represents a potential target for zzso zzso Here we report the zzso and zzso A X-ray structure solution of the zinc containing zzso coli zzso zzso While the primary zzso zzso structure, and use of coordinated zzso suggest that zzso coli zzso belongs to a new zzso of zzso the environment around the metal appears to have strong geometric similarity to the active sites of the zzso zzso This suggests a possible similarity in their zzso zzso Another important issue is the origin of the zzso specificity for zzso over zzso zzso Based on the structure, the specificity appears to result from zzso interactions which orient the zzso for zzso and zzso factors which physically limit the size of the zzso zzso zzso
