This chapter presented an overview of the role of proteins as biological zzso From a simplistic point of view, based solely on comparison of the structural diversity of zzso blood zzso zzso zzso growth factors, and zzso it could be concluded that the functional mechanisms of these protein families bear little or no zzso Despite this enormous zzso in zzso relationship, there are in fact elements of zzso in their zzso roles arising as a direct consequence of the ability of these classes of protein zzso to act as exquisite examples of the processes of zzso All these case zzso and the numerous other familial case studies of protein zzso which could have been employed to illustrate the different functional roles of zzso owe their biological properties to their primordial protein zzso which have traversed the harsh wilderness of evolution in zzso phenomena and survived to elicit specific zzso zzso zzso by underlying zzso constraints, zzso at times by the lulling tones of the siren zzso and constantly vulnerable to the vagaries of other more pervasive forms of biological networking and information transfer zzso in the genes of virus and invading zzso protein zzso in higher life forms, and particularly in zzso represents the finely tuned molecular avenues for the zzso to transfer its information to the next zzso The examples summarized in this chapter illustrate the complex, and in disease states imperfect, functional potential of proteins to be zzso in the zzso of zzso and be realized in the network of nature's biological zzso zzso thus represent a diverse range of zzso molecules whose properties are totally dependent on their zzso or zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure defines active sites on the zzso through which zzso interaction and zzso phenomena can zzso The zzso for this surface topography is, of course, coded in the primary zzso acid zzso Much experimental work is being directed in these and other laboratories at zzso the principles governing the folding of unique zzso sequences into three-dimensional zzso Further advances in the theoretical understanding of the thermodynamics of protein folding as observed by zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance and other zzso techniques will greatly aid this zzso In addition, more comprehensive zzso zzso for structure zzso improved models of protein zzso behavior, and greater insight into the molecular forces which control sequence nucleation will also be zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
