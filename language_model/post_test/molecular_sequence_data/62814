zzso zzso channels zzso are generally considered as the main zzso for zzso transport across the zzso outer zzso Recent zzso studies on isolated zzso zzso from zzso zzso indicated that zzso might also be involved in transport of nutrients between plants and zzso In an attempt to substantiate this, we carried out a detailed molecular and cellular characterization of zzso in zzso zzso and soybean zzso zzso Database searches revealed at least five genes zzso putative zzso in each of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We obtained and zzso zzso clones from zzso zzso zzso five full-length zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso impaired in zzso a zzso of the zzso outer zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso are functional and targeted to the zzso outer membrane in zzso Studies of the expression pattern of the five zzso zzso zzso genes revealed largely zzso expression of each throughout the plant, including zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso and the related zzso protein of potato zzso zzso recognized several proteins between 30 and 36 zzso on western zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and soybean root zzso demonstrated their presence on not only zzso but also on numerous, small zzso at the cell zzso No evidence was found for the presence of zzso on the zzso zzso Nonetheless, the data indicate that zzso may play more diverse roles in plants than suspected zzso
