We have zzso characterized a zzso zzso in zzso nuclear pore complex zzso This zzso previously demonstrated to be essential for the zzso of two nuclear pore complex proteins in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso occurs between zzso and zzso zzso within a highly zzso domain in a zzso zzso Here, we show that a zzso is not involved in the zzso zzso By using a combination of domain mapping and zzso zzso we demonstrate that the human nuclear pore complex protein zzso specifically zzso itself between zzso and zzso A region of zzso zzso acids zzso is able to zzso whereas a smaller region, zzso acids zzso does not zzso In addition, we have generated a zzso zzso that zzso under defined conditions in zzso Further, the two zzso fragments of zzso form a complex, providing a possible mechanism zzso specific, yet zzso binding between zzso and zzso is responsible for the nuclear targeting of zzso Although apparently unrelated zzso zzso has zzso on an zzso zzso mechanism similar to that of zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso
