Based on their zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso later than expected from gel zzso columns in multiple zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso 29, zzso zzso present in these zzso have identical zzso acid sequences and unmodified zzso acid zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso which contains zzso at position 16 and zzso at position zzso Like zzso it also zzso in different zzso on a gel zzso column, yet the zzso show identical zzso acid zzso This perplexing zzso behavior appears to be caused by the association of these proteins with different zzso since zzso zzso in buffers containing different zzso produces up to a zzso change in zzso zzso Certain zzso promote an apparent reduction in the interaction of zzso with gel zzso zzso hence earlier zzso These zzso include zzso zzso and zzso which also inhibit the zzso activity of zzso However, even under conditions which minimize zzso interaction the toxins zzso later than expected based on their zzso zzso
