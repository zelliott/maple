The structural organization of zzso zzso zzso has been investigated mostly in zzso zzso No information is available about the structural characteristics of zzso zzso in major zzso complex zzso zzso systems, although these data may contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis of their functional role in the immune zzso zzso we have determined the zzso and derived zzso acid sequence of the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which had been zzso with the zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso The six zzso zzso are zzso in their zzso and zzso region gene zzso This structural zzso is not correlated with their target specificity and with their ability to elicit zzso zzso The latter characteristic is markedly influenced by a limited number of zzso acid zzso since zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso differs only in two zzso in zzso regions and in five zzso in framework regions from zzso zzso which does not induce zzso zzso The zzso in zzso and zzso region gene usage by the six zzso zzso in the zzso system is at zzso with the restricted zzso and zzso region gene usage by zzso zzso zzso in several zzso zzso Furthermore, at zzso with zzso systems, the primary structure of the D segments of the zzso zzso is not correlated with their ability to induce zzso zzso On the other hand, the frequency of zzso fusion events underlying the derivation of the D segments of the six zzso zzso in the zzso system and their average length are similar to those found in zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, like in the latter systems, zzso zzso appear to contribute to the generation of diversity of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
