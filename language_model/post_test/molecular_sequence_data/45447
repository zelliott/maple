The zzso family of zzso proteins regulates cellular signal zzso events via zzso interactions with target zzso Here, we show that the zzso tail of the zzso zzso of protein zzso 4 regulatory zzso 2 zzso interacts with the small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Using two-dimensional zzso zzso and chemical shift zzso we have identified and mapped the zzso of zzso that form a binding surface for zzso We show that the binding groove is formed primarily of zzso zzso zzso located in zzso 1, the hinge region, and zzso 4 of the zzso four zzso structure of zzso The findings suggest the possibility that zzso zzso of zzso complexes through interactions with small zzso proteins may be a general mechanism for regulation of signal zzso zzso
