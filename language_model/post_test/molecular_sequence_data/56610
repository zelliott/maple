Three genes for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso clustered on the zzso zzso zzso Their gene products showed high levels of zzso acid sequence identity with the corresponding zzso from higher plant zzso zzso and significant levels of identity with those from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso In addition, these three zzso from zzso zzso have zzso zzso acid zzso in their central zzso The gene zzso is interrupted by a zzso zzso group I zzso while genes zzso and zzso are interrupted by group II zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis using zzso specific zzso indicated that these three genes are transcribed as a single precursor zzso of zzso zzso in length and are processed into mature zzso molecules in zzso zzso Several regions of this zzso gene cluster are repeated in the zzso zzso zzso
