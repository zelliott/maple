zzso cells derived from peripheral nerve sheath tumors from individuals with zzso Type 1 zzso are deficient for the protein zzso which contains a zzso domain zzso zzso zzso cells have increased Ras zzso increased proliferation in response to certain growth zzso increased zzso potential, and altered cell zzso This study examined whether expression of functional zzso can reverse the transformed zzso of zzso zzso cells from both benign and zzso peripheral nerve sheath zzso We zzso the zzso using zzso zzso and examined the effects on cell zzso growth potential, and zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso changes, a zzso reduction in Ras zzso and a zzso decrease in proliferation in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso was not sufficient to decrease the in zzso zzso potential of the zzso This study demonstrates that zzso of the zzso can at least partially reverse the transformation of human zzso zzso zzso zzso
