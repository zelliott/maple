After exploring evolutionary aspects of zzso zzso acid zzso the review focuses on the extended zzso zzso zzso as it operates in zzso zzso First, the genes and zzso specific for the zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is given to the unusual distribution of the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso on the newly defined role of zzso and on regulatory mechanisms governing gene expression and zzso activity, including new evidence for the zzso importance of the regulation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso Next, zzso relationships of the zzso regulator zzso are zzso defining its dual role as zzso and zzso and discussing evidence in support of the zzso zzso Recent data pointing at a more extended zzso zzso are zzso An overview of the layered controls of the extended zzso zzso is provided that includes a description of the newly recognized roles of zzso and zzso in maintaining zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso acid zzso and its regulation in other zzso are zzso the question of zzso as zzso signal is zzso and possible directions of future research in this area are zzso
