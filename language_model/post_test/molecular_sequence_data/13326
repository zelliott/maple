During zzso growth factor zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso results in the zzso of several zzso domain bearing zzso including zzso to the plasma zzso This process is part of a complex zzso of specific protein associations that culminates in the regulation of cell growth and zzso The zzso zzso interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso has been demonstrated, yet the precise function of zzso in zzso zzso signaling remains zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso was studied in order to evaluate the molecular basis for this zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso was extensively zzso by zzso and zzso zzso activities in zzso as determined by zzso zzso mass zzso The sites of zzso within the zzso domain zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The majority of the sites identified corresponded to the known zzso sites of zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso were made combining very fast zzso zzso zzso zzso or 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso These studies revealed that zzso was zzso to a significantly higher extent by zzso than by zzso Additionally, zzso was identified as a unique zzso zzso zzso The function of these zzso sites with respect zzso domain interactions was investigated by affinity zzso zzso A subset of peptides corresponding to the eight possible zzso zzso sites within the zzso zzso domain was demonstrated to bind to the zzso domain of zzso Those which bound to the zzso domain included peptides derived from zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These data indicate that specific zzso zzso zzso zzso sites are also zzso for the zzso domain of zzso Finally, extensive zzso zzso of zzso promoted its conversion to a form that exhibits zzso zzso zzso 380 zzso and cooperative zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) binding to the zzso domain of zzso as measured by surface zzso zzso The identification of zzso zzso sequences on zzso as zzso zzso binding sites supports the notion that this interaction plays a significant role in the regulation of growth factor zzso function and signal zzso
