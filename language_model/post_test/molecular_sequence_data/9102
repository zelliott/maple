We have previously confirmed zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene expression as well as the expression of their zzso and zzso human zzso zzso zzso proteins in normal zzso transformed zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the zzso zzso gene locus of the human zzso gene cluster from zzso genes responsible for gene zzso For this study, zzso specimens were selected from women characterized using our zzso score and zzso zzso index that had normal zzso transformed zzso and optimal zzso zzso Using full-length zzso zzso sequence analysis, we found that zzso zzso is zzso as the product of gene locus zzso and zzso zzso as single zzso zzso or to a lower percentage as single zzso zzso In addition to known differences between these genes and zzso the zzso sequence of the zzso differs between zzso and zzso in the untranslated promoter region and in translated zzso zzso zzso results show that zzso joint zzso and zzso single zzso and single zzso zzso expression lead to the release of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso reveal zzso zzso zzso production, which is not observed for zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso is positive for zzso and negative for zzso zzso as revealed by zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso Only zzso zzso expression seems to be supported specifically by zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso is expressed and produced as zzso and/or zzso but not zzso and it is produced together with zzso as a zzso transformation marker in the normal zzso phase zzso
