The complete coding sequence of zzso zzso zzso was generated by rapid amplification of zzso ends and zzso chain reaction using zzso based on the zzso and 3' ends of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso zzso long, with open reading frame of zzso zzso precursors to 239 zzso acids coding for approximately 27 zzso zzso Analysis of zzso acid sequence revealed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso loop pattern, zzso motif and zzso of the zzso hole characteristic of zzso B like zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequences showed the protein shared zzso identity to zzso B zzso in the zzso clan CA family zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed close evolutionary proximity of the protein sequence to counterpart sequences in the zzso suggesting that zzso was a member of the zzso zzso
