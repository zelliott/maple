We have zzso the zzso profile of a zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso from the red zzso zzso zzso using a zzso column and a zzso zzso performance liquid zzso method with a variety of zzso zzso In both methods, zzso exclusively bound with zzso type zzso zzso but not with any of other zzso including complex type, hybrid type and core zzso and zzso from zzso These findings indicate that zzso recognizes the zzso zzso of the zzso However, zzso did not bind with any of the free zzso examined that are constituents of the zzso zzso zzso that the portion of the core zzso zzso zzso of the zzso is also essential for zzso Thus, the zzso zzso was strictly specific for zzso zzso and recognized the extended zzso structure with a minimum size of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of binding with a zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso has four zzso sites per zzso with a high association constant of zzso zzso zzso analysis, by a combination of zzso degradation and mass analyses of the intact protein and of peptides produced by its zzso zzso showed that zzso is composed of 268 zzso acids zzso weight zzso with four zzso repeated zzso of 67 zzso zzso The number of repeats coincided with the number of zzso sites in the zzso zzso Surprisingly, the marine zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from the soil zzso zzso zzso
