We used indirect end labeling to identify a series of five hypersensitive zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso rat zzso zzso These sites were found at zzso base pairs zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso B), over a broad domain between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and at zzso zzso zzso zzso Sites A to D were detected only in cells capable of expressing the zzso zzso whereas site E was present in all of the cells examined thus zzso The HS sites were present in zzso cells even when zzso activity was reduced to a minimum by treatment with zzso zzso of zzso by a zzso zzso analog to a zzso increase over the zzso level did not affect the main features of the HS zzso Furthermore, increased zzso did not disrupt the zzso arrangement of the coding region of the zzso nor did it affect the immediate zzso region zzso zzso which is always zzso In zzso cells, a rat zzso line that is zzso responsive but unable to zzso zzso zzso the four zzso HS sites were totally zzso Our experimental results also showed that, although there is a general correlation between lack of DNA zzso and zzso competence of the zzso zzso the role, if any, of zzso in the regulation of zzso gene activity is likely to be exerted at very specific zzso
