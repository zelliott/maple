zzso protein D zzso plays important roles in innate immunity including the defense against bacteria, zzso and respiratory zzso Because zzso specifically interacts with zzso that zzso the lung in response to acute inflammation and infection, we examined the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso G degrade zzso All three human zzso specifically zzso zzso rat and natural human zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, which was zzso dependent on calcium zzso The zzso generated similar, relatively stable, zzso zzso zzso fragments of approximately 35 zzso zzso and sequencing of a major zzso zzso definitively localized the major sites of zzso to a highly zzso zzso of the zzso recognition zzso zzso markedly reduced the ability of zzso to promote bacterial zzso and to bind to zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso with isolated zzso zzso led to the generation of similar fragments, and zzso was inhibited with synthetic and natural zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso genetically deficient in zzso zzso and/or zzso G were impaired in their ability to degrade zzso Using a mouse model of acute bacterial pneumonia, we observed the zzso of zzso at sites of zzso zzso coinciding with the appearance of approximately zzso zzso fragments in zzso zzso zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso cleave zzso at sites of inflammation with potential deleterious effects on its biological zzso
