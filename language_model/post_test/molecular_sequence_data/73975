To develop a strategy for rapid species assignment and strain differentiation of zzso zzso complex zzso organisms, the sequence of a zzso region of the gene zzso zzso a zzso heat shock protein was determined for 56 zzso including 21 patient zzso and 35 reference zzso Eleven zzso zzso were identified, and there was no sharing of zzso between strains classified as zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that 30 strains had one of two zzso zzso which were found in known zzso zzso organisms, 23 strains had one of six zzso allied with known zzso zzso organisms, and three MAC zzso had one of three zzso zzso that differed substantially from the consensus zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Estimates of strain relationships based on the sequences of zzso and the zzso zzso DNA internal transcribed zzso were zzso zzso DNA sequencing of a zzso region of the zzso gene from MAC organisms provides a rapid and zzso marker system for strain differentiation and permits specific assignment of these zzso organisms for diagnostic zzso
