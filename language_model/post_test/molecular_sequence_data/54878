zzso belongs to a class of zzso zzso zzso harbors a plant zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso via its zzso binds zzso zzso 3 in zzso affinity and has been reported to have the zzso activity of zzso zzso 9 of zzso 3 in zzso However, we did not detect zzso activity for zzso zzso domain (with and without its linked zzso in the context of zzso zzso We determined the crystal structures of zzso zzso domain in the absence and presence of additional zzso metal zzso When zzso or zzso was added at a high concentration zzso and allowed to soak in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso was bound by six zzso in an zzso zzso The side chains of zzso and zzso and the two oxygen atoms of zzso (an analog of zzso provide four zzso in the equatorial plane, while the zzso oxygen atom of zzso and one water zzso provide the two zzso zzso as the fifth and sixth zzso zzso The metal binding site in zzso closely resembles the zzso sites in other zzso zzso zzso with one important zzso zzso zzso of zzso replaces zzso as the fifth zzso However, neither zzso zzso nor high metal concentration renders zzso an active zzso on zzso zzso Wild type and zzso zzso bind zzso with an approximately equal affinity of zzso We propose that there must be other regulatory factors required for the zzso activity of zzso in zzso or that perhaps zzso acts on zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso shares significant sequence zzso throughout the entire region, including the zzso zzso at the corresponding zzso position, with that of zzso zzso zzso which plays an essential role in zzso function but has no known zzso zzso
