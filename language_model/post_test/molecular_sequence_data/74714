zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso and regulates zzso and zzso stresses in budding zzso In this study, we have demonstrated in both zzso zzso and, the most medically important human zzso zzso zzso zzso that deletion of zzso renders cells sensitive to zzso the inhibitor of target of zzso protein zzso controlling cell zzso The zzso activity of zzso does not seem to be required for this zzso sensitivity function in both zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso is not directly involved in cell sensitivity to zzso in zzso zzso whereas disruption of zzso renders cells sensitive to zzso in zzso zzso In addition, we have shown that zzso and its zzso activity are required for cell growth in zzso zzso
