zzso zzso is a zzso identified recently by zzso zzso At present not much is known about its biological actions, and comparative studies of SPX in zzso species are still zzso To examine the structure and function of SPX in fish model, SPX was cloned in goldfish and found to be highly comparable with its zzso zzso As revealed by zzso zzso goldfish SPX is composed of an zzso from zzso to zzso with a flexible zzso zzso from zzso to zzso and its molecular surface is largely zzso except for zzso as the only charged zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso SPX transcripts were found to be widely expressed in various zzso and protein expression of SPX was also detected in the zzso In zzso feeding studies revealed that SPX zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of goldfish brain could be elevated by food zzso However, brain injection of goldfish SPX inhibited both zzso and zzso or zzso feeding behavior and food zzso Similar treatment also reduced transcript expression of zzso zzso and zzso with concurrent rises in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in different brain areas zzso The differential effects of SPX treatment on zzso zzso and zzso transcript expression could also be noted in zzso in goldfish brain cell zzso Our studies for the first time unveil the solution structure of SPX and its novel function as a zzso factor through differential zzso of central zzso and zzso zzso
