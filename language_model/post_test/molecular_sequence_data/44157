zzso regulates gene expression in a zzso way by binding to zzso zzso elements of target gene zzso The zzso zzso function, zzso of zzso is thought to require zzso zzso together with zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso two hybrid system with zzso we have isolated a mouse zzso protein zzso as zzso specifically interacting in zzso and in zzso with zzso among nuclear receptors like zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a mouse zzso to human zzso which has recently been shown to interact with human zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike those of many previously identified zzso the zzso interaction was zzso Thus, zzso seems a putative zzso zzso modulating its zzso
