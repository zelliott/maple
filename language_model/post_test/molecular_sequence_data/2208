The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso E was previously shown to be fully active in binding to the low density zzso zzso In this study, truncated zzso zzso with progressive deletions at the zzso zzso were produced in zzso coli by zzso zzso to define the minimum zzso structure necessary for full zzso zzso These truncated forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were combined with the zzso zzso and tested for their ability to bind to low density zzso receptors on human zzso All of the truncated zzso formed typical zzso particles when combined with the zzso and the particles could be isolated by density zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso had very little zzso binding activity zzso whereas the zzso zzso had nearly full activity zzso The zzso zzso had zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso region of zzso is important for zzso zzso either by contributing one or more zzso essential for zzso binding or, more zzso by stabilizing or aligning the region known to be crucial for zzso zzso in the vicinity of zzso zzso
