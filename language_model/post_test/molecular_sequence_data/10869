zzso zzso defined as a zzso zzso is a novel zzso agent that blocks proliferation of human and mouse zzso Using a zzso chemical probe, we here zzso a target of zzso zzso and called it zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso retained its binding properties and migrated on zzso gel as a Mr 28,000 zzso Cloning of the zzso zzso human zzso shows an open reading frame for a zzso acid zzso which is zzso to the recently cloned zzso 1 zzso Interestingly, the deduced zzso acid sequence was found to be related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso gene product has been identified recently as the molecular target of zzso zzso that mediates zzso effects of the drug in zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso gene expression revealed a single transcript of 2 zzso which was widely expressed among zzso with the highest abundance in liver and the lowest abundance in zzso zzso zzso analysis in various cells, using a specific zzso zzso raised against zzso demonstrated that this protein was associated with the nuclear zzso When studying the binding of zzso zzso on zzso from zzso expressing zzso we found a pharmacological profile of zzso 1 zzso binding was displaced by zzso haloperidol, and zzso zzso with zzso 10, zzso being a more potent competitor than zzso zzso zzso plot analysis revealed zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso respectively, indicating an affinity of zzso zzso higher for zzso zzso than for zzso Additionally, we showed that zzso a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso also prevents the zzso effect of zzso zzso Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that zzso represents the molecular target for zzso zzso in zzso zzso which could be critical for T cell zzso
