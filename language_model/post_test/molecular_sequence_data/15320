zzso zzso zzso is a class zzso zzso with potent zzso activity isolated from zzso zzso zzso Previously, we expressed from a synthetic zzso in zzso coli zzso a zzso zzso designated zzso which possesses four additional zzso acids zzso in the zzso region that result from zzso zzso and retains the initial zzso zzso To unravel the relationship between the structure of zzso and its particularly elevated activity, we produced by zzso zzso eight zzso in which a single zzso acid replacement was specifically introduced into the zzso The point zzso were designed to change either zzso zzso in class zzso zzso or zzso specific to zzso located mainly in the zzso zzso The fusion proteins were zzso from the zzso zzso by immobilized affinity zzso zzso and its zzso were released from the fusion proteins by zzso zzso using zzso The purity of zzso and of the zzso was checked by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso liquid zzso and mass zzso The zzso activity of zzso and its zzso was assessed using different indicator zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The activity of all of the zzso appeared to be less than the activity of zzso The decrease in activity did not appear to be related to a global zzso change, as determined by circular zzso Overall, the zzso of zzso produced in the present study provide interesting insights into zzso relationships of class zzso zzso
