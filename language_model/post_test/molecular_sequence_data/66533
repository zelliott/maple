zzso is the newest member of the zzso family of zzso however, its zzso significance, zzso and zzso functions are zzso Two full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso complementary DNA were zzso The 529 zzso acid protein shared the highest zzso acid identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether the zzso zzso zzso was a zzso zzso we used real-time zzso to zzso measure zzso and zzso expression of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso adult zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso higher than zzso in brain, zzso eye, and zzso while zzso was higher in gastrointestinal tract zzso heart, zzso and zzso zzso had equal but high expression of both zzso There were sex differences in zzso zzso expression in the zzso liver, zzso and zzso zzso exposure caused induction of zzso expression in female and male heart zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and liver zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso highest at 2 weeks zzso and whole zzso expressed 3- to zzso more zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso 10 zzso for 10 days, caused induction of both genes at 120 and 240 h zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso in addition to zzso is zzso by zzso has a broad tissue distribution, and should be further investigated for its role in zzso zzso
