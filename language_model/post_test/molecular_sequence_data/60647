zzso applied zzso which apparently competes with zzso in all three zzso of zzso zzso zzso exchange activity of zzso or zzso with a zzso higher affinity than that of zzso whereas stimulation of exchange by external zzso is significantly greater in zzso and zzso than in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we identified structural zzso in the zzso that zzso differential sensitivity to zzso or zzso by measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso or zzso We found that two segments in the zzso corresponding mostly to the internal zzso and zzso repeats are individually responsible for the zzso of zzso sensitivity, both together accounting for approximately zzso of the difference between zzso and zzso In contrast, the segment corresponding to the zzso repeat fully accounts for the differential zzso sensitivity between the zzso The zzso sensitivity was zzso respectively, by simultaneous substitution of two zzso acids in the zzso repeat zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso and substitution of one zzso acid in the zzso repeat zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso On the other hand, the zzso sensitivity was zzso by double substitution zzso in the zzso repeat zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso Single substitution zzso at zzso and zzso of zzso caused significant zzso in the interactions of the zzso with zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, although the extent of zzso varied depending on the nature of side chains of zzso zzso Since the above four important zzso are mostly in the putative zzso of the alpha repeats, these regions might form an zzso interaction domain in the zzso
