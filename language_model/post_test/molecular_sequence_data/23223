zzso coli zzso protein zzso zzso replication and is an important regulatory target during the replication zzso In this study, a zzso zzso isolated by zzso zzso was found to allow growth of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 40 degrees zzso The zzso consists of a zzso zzso in a previously zzso ORF, here termed zzso a novel heat shock gene whose promoter is recognized by the major heat shock zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso on a zzso zzso zzso growth of the zzso and zzso zzso at 30 degrees C, whereas growth of zzso and other zzso zzso is insensitive to changes in the level of zzso Cellular zzso protein is zzso rapidly at elevated temperature, but zzso disruption zzso this zzso In contrast, zzso protein is rapidly zzso in an zzso zzso zzso and chemical zzso experiments suggest that zzso forms a stable zzso in solution and can form zzso consisting of about four zzso zzso induced zzso such as zzso contain zzso of zzso zzso We propose that zzso is a new factor involved in the quality control of proteins and that it functions by excluding zzso zzso
