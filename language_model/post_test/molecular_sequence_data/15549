A zzso of melting temperatures at zzso for individual zzso of the zzso protein domain has been zzso as evidence for zzso downhill zzso Other members of the peripheral zzso domain family fold zzso at zzso To search for possible causes of anomalies in zzso zzso behavior, we measured the pH zzso of individual zzso by zzso zzso At zzso K, the zzso of zzso was close to that of free zzso at zzso while that of the more buried zzso was highly zzso at zzso zzso of zzso is thus energetically zzso and zzso the protein by approximately zzso zzso Changes in zzso secondary shifts at zzso showed a decrease in zzso of the zzso of zzso 2, where zzso is located, which was accompanied by a measured decrease of zzso zzso in stability from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso therefore, the structure of zzso Only approximately zzso of the structurally zzso state will be present at the biologically relevant zzso zzso at zzso report on a zzso mixture of the two different native zzso Further, at this zzso small changes of pH and zzso induced by changes in temperature will have zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso and on propagation of experimental zzso zzso conventional zzso folding predicts some zzso of measured zzso unfolding zzso of individual zzso at zzso
