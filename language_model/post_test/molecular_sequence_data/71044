zzso Three synthetic zzso corresponding to sequences within the zzso divergent domain of the large zzso zzso zzso gene have been used to amplify the total DNA of zzso zzso and zzso zzso two zzso similar zzso with overlapping geographical distribution and zzso The two organisms may be distinguished by the zzso zzso of their respective amplification zzso For zzso zzso a zzso product was zzso The presence of this zzso was confirmed in 14 zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso two possible amplification products were zzso a zzso DNA zzso for strains typed as lineage 1 and a zzso zzso for lineage 2 zzso Eleven unidentified zzso stocks, recently isolated from zzso zzso could be zzso using the proposed zzso The potential field application of multiplex zzso was further demonstrated by identification of the two zzso species in samples containing zzso tract and feces of zzso In the present study we have also amplified the zzso domain of several zzso employing zzso complementary to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequence zzso were observed, indicating that this region could also be explored as a target for specific detection of other members of the zzso zzso
