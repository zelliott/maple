Several zzso of zzso cells have been shown to produce type I zzso in response to viral infections, thereby assisting the natural killer zzso response that eliminates the zzso Type I zzso production can be induced both by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso Here, we describe a zzso zzso unresponsive zzso that results from an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso Mice zzso for the zzso zzso are highly susceptible to mouse zzso infection and show impaired zzso zzso of zzso and natural killer cell zzso We also demonstrate that both the zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways are activated in zzso on viral zzso and that each zzso contributes to innate defense against systemic viral zzso Whereas both pathways lead to type I zzso production, neither zzso offers full protection against mouse zzso infection in the absence of the zzso The zzso zzso alters a zzso repeat motif and lies within a zzso domain that is zzso within the evolutionary cluster encompassing zzso 7, 8, and zzso In other zzso including three zzso zzso described in this paper, the affected region is not zzso The zzso effect of the zzso zzso thus points to a critical role for zzso in viral sensing and identifies a vulnerable zzso acid within the zzso of three zzso zzso essential for a zzso zzso
