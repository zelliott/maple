The zzso rule zzso targets for degradation proteins that bear specific zzso zzso zzso while the zzso rule zzso targets proteins through their zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso rule pathway, recognizes zzso zzso zzso if it is followed by a zzso zzso This capability of zzso expands the range of zzso that can be targeted for degradation by the zzso rule zzso because virtually all nascent cellular proteins bear zzso zzso We identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso as examples of normal or zzso proteins that can be destroyed through the recognition of their zzso zzso zzso zzso as proteins bearing the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso of the zzso rule pathway, the resulting zzso of the zzso rule and zzso rule pathways enables the elimination of protein zzso regardless of zzso state of zzso zzso in these zzso
