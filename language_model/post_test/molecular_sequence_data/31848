zzso zzso is best known as the producer of the fluorinated natural product zzso This strain of zzso is also unusual for displaying a zzso zzso that is deficient in the formation of aerial zzso and zzso Genome sequencing of this zzso revealed a point zzso in the zzso gene that is predicted to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with a correct copy of zzso restored zzso and additionally promoted production of a zzso acid zzso zzso and a minor amount of the zzso zzso zzso reveal that these compounds inhibit zzso differentiation in other zzso The zzso gene cluster zzso a type 1 zzso zzso was identified and verified through disruption zzso This study underscores the importance of the zzso gene in regulating the expression of cryptic zzso zzso
