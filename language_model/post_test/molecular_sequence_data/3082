The zzso zzso protein zzso is a member of the zzso protein family expressed in the retinal zzso and zzso it is involved in the regulation of the coordinate expression of multiple zzso specific genes during retinal zzso zzso in the zzso gene are zzso associated with retinal zzso zzso in zzso To clone the full length zzso characterize the zzso organization of canine zzso map the gene in a radiation hybrid zzso panel, and evaluate it as a candidate for canine inherited retinal zzso 

zzso zzso difference analysis zzso was done using normal and cone zzso zzso affected zzso zzso zzso designed from consensus sequences of zzso zzso zzso were used to amplify and sequence dog zzso zzso zzso specific zzso were used for zzso mapping of zzso on the zzso cell zzso zzso sequencing and/or mapping the disease locus was used to evaluate zzso as a disease associated candidate zzso 

The gene comprises three zzso and two zzso and codes for a transcript with a 900 zzso open reading frame zzso In agreement with human map data, zzso mapping placed canine zzso on the zzso end of zzso in a region of zzso with zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso linkage or sequencing data, we excluded zzso as the cause of canine early onset zzso zzso affecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso American zzso zzso and Tibetan zzso 

zzso zzso has a high level of zzso and zzso acid sequence identity with zzso sequences reported for other zzso The gene is excluded from zzso association with 4 early onset zzso diseases affecting cones zzso or rods and cones zzso zzso in American zzso zzso and Tibetan zzso
