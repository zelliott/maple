Two zzso methods for the analysis of zzso zzso are zzso In the first approach, zzso zzso are separated by zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso This zzso zzso allows a zzso and zzso zzso of both neutral and zzso zzso zzso Additional information about zzso or zzso and the protein zzso zzso zzso can be extracted from the same zzso In the second zzso method, released zzso are separated on porous zzso carbon zzso A complete structural assignment of neutral and zzso zzso occurring on zzso is thereby achieved in one zzso zzso The two methods were applied to zzso human zzso to commercial zzso expressed in zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso or zzso cells zzso and the zzso zzso zzso produced either in zzso cells or in a human cell zzso Both methods require comparably little sample preparation and can be applied to zzso zzso They both outperform zzso methods in terms of reliability of peak assignment and zzso of zzso zzso with regard to the recording of zzso zzso Regarding fast and yet detailed structural assignment, zzso on zzso carbon supersedes all other current zzso
