In normal human zzso zzso zzso exists in a zzso complex that contains zzso and zzso In many transformed cells, zzso disappears, and a substantial fraction of zzso zzso complexes with zzso zzso and zzso To investigate the significance of these zzso we have isolated zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated that binding of zzso to zzso zzso requires zzso zzso of these proteins to the zzso had no substantial effect on the zzso activity in zzso zzso with zzso function in zzso by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso prevented entry into S phase in both normal and transformed zzso zzso zzso has previously been identified as a zzso whose activity is essential for S zzso Our results identify zzso as an essential element of this zzso The abundance of zzso is greatly increased in many transformed zzso This could result in changes in cell cycle control that contribute to the process of cellular zzso
