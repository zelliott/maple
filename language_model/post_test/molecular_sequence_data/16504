zzso zzso is a major cause of acute zzso media in young children and has also been implicated as an important cause of zzso in adults with underlying pulmonary zzso Due to the considerable level of zzso resistance and the high degree of carriage rates in young children, it is likely that the zzso of zzso zzso infections will continue to zzso zzso zzso is a strict human respiratory zzso and this zzso uses both zzso and zzso receptors to fulfill the essential iron requirement for survival in zzso However, these are the only described iron acquisition systems for this zzso In this report we have demonstrated that zzso zzso can also zzso zzso as a sole source of iron for zzso In addition, we have identified and characterized an outer membrane protein with zzso zzso to zzso zzso to other known zzso binding and zzso proteins in related zzso organisms zzso zzso and zzso zzso This newly described zzso zzso zzso termed zzso is capable of directly binding to zzso coupled to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed on the surface of an zzso coli zzso strain zzso zzso is fully capable of zzso the zzso and thus restoring the ability of this strain to grow in the presence of zzso When zzso zzso is grown in the presence of zzso zzso expression is clearly increased as shown by Western zzso with zzso zzso developed against a zzso zzso In addition, growth analyses revealed that a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is restricted for growth in the presence of zzso as the sole iron source compared to the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is an essential component of a zzso zzso and zzso system previously zzso for zzso zzso thus providing another mechanism of iron acquisition that may facilitate persistent colonization of the zzso zzso
