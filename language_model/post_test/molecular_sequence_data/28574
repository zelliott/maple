zzso zzso zzso zzso the exchange of zzso (or a zzso for zzso 34 in zzso The minimal zzso recognition motif for zzso has been found to involve a zzso sequence in the zzso loop of the zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that the zzso is capable of recognizing the zzso sequence in alternative contexts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Garcia, zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso and have investigated the role of the first U of the zzso sequence in zzso recognition by zzso zzso zzso zzso and Garcia, zzso zzso (2001) zzso 7, zzso The zzso reaction involves the breakage and zzso of a zzso zzso To rule out a potential chemical mechanism involving the zzso at position 34, we zzso and evaluated an zzso zzso with zzso at zzso The high level of activity exhibited by this analogue indicates that the zzso of zzso is not required for zzso Furthermore, we find that zzso can recognize zzso composed entirely of DNA, but only when zzso replace the zzso in the zzso The requirement for zzso bases for recognition is perhaps not surprising given the zzso recognition motif for zzso However, it is not clear if the zzso requirement is due to specific recognition by zzso or due to the effect of zzso on the zzso of the zzso
