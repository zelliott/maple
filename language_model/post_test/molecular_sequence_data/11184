zzso zzso was used to study two zzso zzso 208 and zzso zzso in zzso domain 5 of the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso A series of 4 zzso were constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso and each engineered to contain a zzso zzso demonstrated that all the zzso were expressed in zzso cells at levels comparable to the zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso zzso binding revealed however that all zzso had reduced affinities for zzso zzso zzso 139 zzso zzso zzso 320 to zzso zzso Competition studies, with a series of zzso zzso identified a probable interaction between zzso 211 and the zzso group of zzso The zzso zzso and both zzso 208 zzso displayed a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels in zzso cells, with zzso values in the same zzso as their zzso binding zzso Both zzso and zzso however, did not display any zzso zzso effects and may suggest that zzso 211 is critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso
