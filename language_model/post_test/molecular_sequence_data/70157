zzso proteins that are zzso to zzso identical to zzso have been discovered recently in zzso zzso and zzso In order to study these proteins systematically and relate their functions to those of conventional zzso we are zzso the corresponding genes from the genetically zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the isolation and partial characterization of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifying peptides that are highly zzso within the zzso protein zzso were used in conjunction with zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify a portion of the zzso gene that we have named zzso The corresponding full-length zzso sequence encodes a protein of zzso zzso that is zzso identical to the product of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identical to the bovine zzso zzso but only zzso identical to the principal zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins shows that they have four zzso zzso relative to conventional zzso three of which are well placed to modify zzso zzso and one that is likely to zzso the binding of zzso zzso of two of the five zzso zzso are zzso between zzso and zzso zzso further zzso that they evolved from a common zzso and are likely to zzso proteins having similar zzso We demonstrate that the zzso gene is located on the left arm of zzso 3, within subdivision zzso Finally, we show by zzso zzso that the gene is expressed at low levels, relative to conventional zzso zzso in all zzso zzso From these and other observations we zzso that the zzso protein is a minor component of all cells, perhaps serving to modify the zzso structure, and dynamic behavior of zzso zzso
