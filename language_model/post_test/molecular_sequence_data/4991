To obtain genes with sequence similarity to zzso T zzso of zzso zzso zzso we cloned the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso II zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso and the deduced molecular weight of this zzso was zzso The zzso gene zzso a zzso of 413 zzso acid zzso with a deduced molecular weight of zzso The extent of zzso acid sequence similarity between zzso and zzso was zzso and that between zzso and zzso was zzso The zzso zzso of these expressed zzso were similar, and each efficiently zzso zzso or zzso zzso Since the deduced zzso acid sequence of these zzso show no similarity to other known zzso they appear to comprise an independent family of zzso designated the zzso zzso However, a zzso region within the zzso of the zzso family shows similarity to the active site signature of the zzso zzso family, suggesting that these zzso may belong to the zzso zzso zzso
