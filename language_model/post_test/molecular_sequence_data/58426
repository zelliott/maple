A gene coding for a zzso activity was identified on a 9-7 zzso zzso DNA zzso derived from the large zzso zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed an zzso of zzso zzso and predicted a zzso zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso This putative protein was found to be highly zzso to members of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso Analysis of its zzso acid sequence revealed the presence of characteristic zzso 1 and 2 zzso In addition, an zzso signal sequence was found, suggesting that the zzso is transported through the zzso zzso zzso zzso activities were investigated in zzso and zzso crude extracts as well as in culture zzso from zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso activity was detected primarily in the zzso in strain zzso zzso The newly discovered zzso was designated zzso to indicate its zzso zzso zzso analysis of representative strains of all enteric zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed a close association between the occurrence of zzso and the zzso gene in zzso zzso coli zzso zzso
