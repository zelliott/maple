zzso in the zzso and zzso genes result in an inherited zzso disease, zzso type II zzso Recently, the zzso and zzso genes were also identified as responsible genes for zzso Although we have reported that zzso is a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso complex, it is not clear whether all of the zzso zzso are regulated only by zzso To explore the interaction of zzso and other zzso zzso we focused on zzso zzso a human zzso of zzso zzso that shares the highest similarity with zzso We found that zzso as well as zzso was zzso with all four zzso zzso The direct interaction of zzso with zzso was confirmed on zzso correlation zzso zzso of zzso and zzso decreased the abundance of zzso zzso and zzso within zzso cells, and a significant increase of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso was observed both in zzso cells and in an in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso also functions as an zzso for zzso zzso within the zzso
