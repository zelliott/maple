zzso class I zzso are zzso by a rapidly evolving gene family zzso classical and zzso genes that are found in all zzso and involved in diverse immune zzso However, there is a fundamental difference between the organization of class I genes in zzso and zzso zzso have a single classical gene responsible for zzso zzso which is linked to the zzso processing zzso including zzso This organization allows zzso of advantageous class zzso zzso In contrast, zzso have multiple classical genes within the zzso which are separated from the zzso processing genes by class III zzso It has been hypothesized that separation of classical class I genes from zzso processing genes in zzso allowed them to zzso We investigated this hypothesis by characterizing the class I genes of the zzso zzso a model zzso that has a novel zzso organization, with class I genes located within the zzso and 10 other zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of 14 zzso containing 15 class I genes revealed that nine class I zzso including one to three classical class I, are not linked to the zzso but are scattered throughout the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified zzso the zzso zzso class zzso The zzso zzso contains four zzso class I, zzso with zzso processing zzso Clear zzso of zzso class I are zzso in distant zzso zzso 

We demonstrate that classical class I genes are not linked to zzso processing genes in the zzso and provide evidence that zzso elements were involved in their zzso The presence of zzso elements most likely facilitated the formation of zzso hotspots and subsequent diversification of class I zzso The classical class I have moved away from zzso processing genes in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso but both lineages appear to have benefited from this loss of linkage by increasing the number of classical zzso perhaps enabling response to a wider range of zzso The discovery of zzso zzso between zzso related zzso species is unusual for the rapidly evolving class I genes and may indicate an important zzso specific zzso
