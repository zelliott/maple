zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family are a group of insect zzso that inhibit juvenile hormone zzso by the zzso zzso We have obtained zzso DNA sequences that specify the zzso precursor for the cockroaches, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequences obtained are similar to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso reported zzso The precursors of all these zzso species are similar in size, and the organization of the zzso that they contain (there are 13 or 14, depending on the zzso have been zzso With the sequences of these zzso and using the zzso sequence in the zzso zzso zzso as an zzso a zzso analysis using zzso was carried zzso The zzso obtained from these zzso using the zzso acid as well as the zzso zzso are comparable with current models for zzso zzso zzso analysis was also used to study the zzso of the different zzso within the same zzso zzso suggest that the zzso sequences were generated through a process of internal gene zzso which occurred before these species zzso from each other in evolutionary zzso
