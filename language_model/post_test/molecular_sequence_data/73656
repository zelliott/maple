zzso zzso gene 3 zzso encodes a zzso that is zzso regulated in mast zzso the gene has a functional zzso element at positions zzso to zzso The zzso region of this gene is also known to have a negative regulatory region between zzso and zzso To characterize the negative regulatory elements zzso this region was zzso and then zzso by zzso zzso into two fragments, zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso Both zzso and zzso in the zzso orientation inhibited zzso zzso zzso synthesis by a zzso construct zzso into mast cells that were then zzso Only zzso inhibited zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso Further deletion of the zzso region of zzso partially abolished the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited the activity of a zzso construct independent of cell zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed zzso complex formation with zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso appears to be zzso zzso is identical with a putative zzso motif in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that both zzso and zzso are important in the negative regulation of zzso promoter zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region revealed protection between zzso and zzso which contains zzso The data thus demonstrate identity of a zzso zzso here termed zzso in both the zzso zzso gene and the zzso and that this zzso region in mast cells is functional both in zzso and in zzso Further, evidence is presented that the promoter for zzso contains a novel zzso zzso termed zzso characterized by a zzso zzso
