zzso zzso proteins play important biological functions in cells by changing zzso via zzso zzso This system is especially widespread in zzso Through database search, we identified 30 potential zzso zzso genes zzso in rice zzso zzso zzso An analysis of the complete set of zzso proteins is presented here, including zzso location, zzso zzso domain duplication, and zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the expansion of the zzso gene family in rice, in large part, occurred due to gene zzso A comprehensive expression profile of zzso genes family was investigated by analyzing the signal data of this family extracted from the whole zzso zzso analysis of zzso 63 and zzso 97, two zzso parents, and their hybrid zzso 63, using 27 different zzso representing the entire life cycle of zzso zzso revealed specific expression of some members at zzso transition as well as the zzso stage during the zzso growth phase of zzso zzso genes were also found to be zzso zzso or zzso in rice zzso subjected to treatments of zzso and zzso zzso The expression levels of the zzso genes in the different zzso and under different treatments were also checked by zzso zzso The identification of zzso genes showing differential expression in specific zzso among different zzso or in response to different environmental cues could provide a new avenue for functional analyses in zzso
