zzso zzso C zzso is a family of zzso consisting of ten zzso Some of the members of the zzso family are not dependent on calcium for their activity and also do not bind zzso zzso zzso C is either zzso to the nucleus or present zzso Both zzso as well as zzso zzso are located in the zzso zzso zzso C has specific functions in the events activated within the nucleus during signal zzso Three lines of approach have been taken to discern the nuclear function of zzso pathways of zzso of zzso zzso regulating nuclear zzso zzso of zzso to the nucleus from the zzso and zzso of native zzso in isolated zzso zzso zzso C contains a nuclear targeting zzso motif and has a role in the nuclear calcium signaling zzso zzso and binding of zzso to the sites of zzso and zzso activity may be one of the mechanisms of the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of nuclear zzso and zzso of target nuclear proteins are the areas where much less attention has been zzso zzso these avenues may lead to new insights into the molecular mechanism of nuclear signal zzso
