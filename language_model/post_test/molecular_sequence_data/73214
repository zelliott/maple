Japanese zzso zzso classified as zzso IV is zzso among zzso derived from clinical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and has been characterized as zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso have zzso and genetic features apparently different from North American, European and other Asian zzso especially in major outer surface proteins A zzso and B zzso In this study, we cloned and zzso the genes zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso IV zzso isolated from zzso zzso in zzso zzso A sequence analysis revealed significant differences to the previously published sequences of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The open reading frames of zzso and zzso consist of zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to the proteins of 273 and 295 zzso zzso with molecular weights of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The most interesting finding is that the two zzso genes share a consensus 282 zzso sequence in their zzso portions and that the zzso gene is flanked by a 282 zzso direct repeat zzso The deduced zzso zzso sequences of zzso and zzso of strain zzso showed zzso zzso and have overall similarities of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso
