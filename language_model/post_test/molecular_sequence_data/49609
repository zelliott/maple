We describe the identification and functional characterization of two zzso zzso basic zzso acid carriers zzso zzso and zzso which are related to the zzso zzso zzso carrier zzso also known as zzso The zzso zzso requires zzso zzso supplementation because it fails to export sufficient zzso from the zzso to the zzso where it is converted to zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso partially replaced the function of zzso in zzso zzso The more efficient putative carrier, zzso was expressed in zzso coli, zzso and zzso into zzso zzso where it transported the basic zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso (in order of decreasing zzso zzso recognized zzso whereas both zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso do zzso Also different from zzso zzso did not transport zzso zzso appeared to be more zzso than the zzso and zzso zzso carriers, exhibiting greater preference for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso By zzso both zzso and zzso transcripts were detected in zzso leaves, flowers, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso is consistent with its involvement in zzso breakdown in early zzso development, zzso delivery of zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso by zzso was close to the value we previously determined for the zzso component of zzso zzso into intact zzso from soybean zzso zzso
