zzso in zzso and its zzso zzso in zzso are known to be essential for eye zzso Here we investigate the role of zzso in eye development in another major systematic group, zzso We demonstrate that alternatively spliced zzso derived from a single zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso are expressed in the embryonic eye, zzso organ, brain, and zzso Despite significant sequence differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the region outside the zzso and zzso zzso zzso is able to induce the formation of zzso eyes in zzso Our results support the idea that zzso related genes are necessary for eye and zzso system formation throughout the animal zzso
