To identify critical zzso involved in the binding of a selective zzso to zzso 

The binding of peptides to native or zzso zzso DR molecules was evaluated using zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso 

zzso acid zzso at DR and zzso zzso which were predicted to contribute to interactions within the DR zzso pocket, had the greatest effects on the specificity of zzso 

zzso in the zzso zzso of DR molecules may contribute to associations with zzso zzso
