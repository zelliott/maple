zzso factor zzso zzso environmental signals to the zzso zzso To ensure a quick response yet maintain tight control over zzso target zzso zzso activity is likely to be zzso regulated in zzso zzso To identify proteins that interact with the zzso zzso of zzso and repress its activity, we developed a novel screen for detecting zzso interactions that is not based on a zzso zzso In this system, the zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso is recruited to the zzso zzso plasma membrane harboring a zzso Ras zzso zzso allowing growth at the zzso zzso Using the zzso recruitment system, we identified new zzso zzso One of these, zzso zzso with zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso
