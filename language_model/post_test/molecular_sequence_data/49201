zzso of zzso focuses on the removal of zzso with little attention typically paid to the recovery of disrupted reactor functions such as zzso zzso zzso are widely used in industry as a precursor to a variety of products and are occasionally released into wastewater zzso This work evaluated the effects on zzso reactor functions of a zzso zzso pulse and zzso by zzso with the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso Changes in functions such as zzso carbon zzso and sludge zzso were studied in relation to the sludge community structure, in particular the zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso real-time zzso and fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso were used to characterize and zzso the zzso microbial community immediately after a zzso shock zzso Two days after the zzso zzso ammonium zzso and the zzso activity did not recover over a zzso period in the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso in the zzso reactor started to recover on day zzso The zzso patterns and the FISH and real-time zzso data showed that the zzso microbial community of the zzso reactor recovered in structure, activity, and zzso while the number of zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso reactor decreased drastically and the community composition changed and did not zzso The zzso of the activated sludge was zzso influenced by the zzso addition, with the sludge volume index increasing by a factor of zzso Two days after the zzso shock in the zzso reactor, chemical oxygen demand zzso removal efficiency decreased by zzso but recovered fully by day zzso In contrast, in the zzso reactor, no decrease of the zzso removal efficiency was zzso This study demonstrates that zzso of wastewater zzso to accelerate the degradation of toxic zzso zzso such as zzso protected the zzso bacterial community, thereby allowing faster recovery from toxic zzso
