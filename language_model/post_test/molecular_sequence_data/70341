Evidence derived from sequence comparisons and the zzso organization of the zzso zzso zzso gene clusters suggest that they arose from a primordial cluster through a process of gene zzso and divergence followed by cluster zzso A large zzso domain surrounding the ancestral zzso cluster also appears to have been duplicated and has remained relatively stable since the divergence of humans and zzso To test the extent of the duplicated zzso domain, we have initiated physical mapping studies of the regions surrounding the four zzso zzso clusters using zzso gel zzso and zzso artificial zzso zzso In this study, we present a long-range restriction map of mouse zzso 11 spanning 1500 zzso in the region surrounding the zzso zzso We have determined that the gene for the nerve growth factor zzso is tightly linked to the zzso complex and is located within 50 zzso of the zzso 1 gene at the 3' end of the zzso Four zzso artificial zzso have been isolated and characterized by the zzso chain reaction, long-range restriction zzso and Southern zzso Two clones of 150 and 300 zzso contain the entire zzso cluster and the nerve growth factor zzso zzso A zzso clone contains the 3' end of the zzso zzso the nerve growth factor zzso zzso and extends zzso A zzso clone contains the zzso end of the zzso cluster and extends zzso These clones confirm the zzso restriction map of zzso mouse DNA and represent a zzso of approximately 600 zzso of cloned material from mouse zzso zzso
