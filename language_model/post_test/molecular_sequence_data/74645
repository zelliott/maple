Chemical zzso is an emerging technique for drug target zzso and profiling the toxicity of known zzso With the use of this technique, the specificity of a small zzso inhibitor toward its potential targets can be characterized and information thus obtained can be used in zzso lead zzso Most commonly, small molecules are immobilized on solid supports and used as affinity zzso zzso to bind zzso However, it is difficult to evaluate the effect of zzso on the affinity of the compounds to their zzso Here, we describe the development and application of a soluble probe where a small zzso was coupled with a zzso zzso which was used to affinity isolate binding proteins from cell zzso The soluble probe allowed direct zzso that the compound after zzso with zzso zzso retained its binding zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso was coupled with a zzso containing the zzso zzso Following incubation with cellular zzso the compound and associated proteins were affinity isolated using zzso zzso zzso Using this approach, we identified the known zzso targets, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso type 2, as well as previously unidentified targets zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso This method was directly compared to the zzso method zzso zzso was immobilized to a solid zzso providing an zzso strategy to aid in target zzso and help to eliminate false zzso originating from zzso binding of the proteins to the zzso
