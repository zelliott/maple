zzso zzso zzso zzso the reaction to convert zzso to zzso by zzso with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is expressed in a variety of zzso under regulation of zzso zzso Previously, we localized a zzso specific zzso zzso element between zzso and zzso relative to the major cap site of the zzso by transient expression analysis in human zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that the zzso element consists of two zzso element I zzso between zzso and zzso and element II zzso between zzso and zzso as zzso by zzso I zzso using the nuclear extracts of zzso zzso The gel mobility shift zzso shows that each of these zzso binds specific nuclear zzso The transient expression of the bacterial zzso zzso gene zzso involving the zzso in zzso cells reveals that the elements activate reporter gene expression zzso when present together, nevertheless each of the elements by itself also has an zzso zzso The transient expression analysis further shows that element I is responsible for the zzso zzso with the binding site of a nuclear zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso protein zzso which is located between zzso and zzso relative to the major cap site of the zzso These results suggest that the zzso element plays important roles in sustaining the high levels of zzso expression in zzso cells in cooperation with other zzso zzso regulatory zzso
