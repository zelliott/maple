A zzso zzso zzso protein zzso has been expressed in zzso coli and zzso to near zzso The zzso chain consists of 290 zzso acid zzso and has a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso By introducing two zzso zzso zzso His and zzso zzso zzso we created a zzso center zzso to that in the zzso zzso from the animal zzso In contrast to unmodified zzso this double zzso was isolated as a zzso zzso zzso While unmodified zzso is zzso zzso the zzso zzso CO2 zzso with a significantly higher efficiency than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The activity is strongly inhibited by the powerful and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso
