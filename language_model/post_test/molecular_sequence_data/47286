The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso was determined by single zzso replacement method with anomalous scattering zzso at zzso A zzso The zzso protein is extremely zzso and repairs zzso DNA by suicidal zzso transfer from zzso zzso to its own zzso zzso zzso constitute the third primary kingdom of living organisms, sharing characteristics with zzso and zzso zzso They live in various extreme environments and are thought to include the most ancient organisms on the zzso zzso studies on zzso zzso proteins reveal the structural features essential for stability under the extreme environments in which these organisms live, and will provide the structural basis required for stabilizing various zzso proteins for industrial zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso and structural comparison of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso zzso zzso of Ada zzso zzso of zzso surface area zzso reveals a large zzso between zzso and zzso with respect to the property of the zzso In the zzso structure, the zzso zzso contribute to reinforce stability of zzso The zzso zzso exist in the interior of zzso and stabilize internal packing of zzso zzso Furthermore, structural features of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are found around the zzso structure in zzso
