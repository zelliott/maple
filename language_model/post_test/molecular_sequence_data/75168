The zzso locus of zzso zzso has been cloned from the zzso library of Ferrari et zzso zzso Ferrari, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Hoch, zzso zzso zzso zzso by using as an zzso transformation of the zzso zzso zzso to the wild zzso zzso of the zzso locus was studied by zzso of cloned zzso DNA to zzso zzso at various times during growth and zzso The relative rate of zzso of the zzso locus was highest 3 h after the end of zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso zzso unit indicated the coding capacity for a small protein zzso zzso zzso having significant similarity with one domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this coding sequence by an zzso zzso caused cells to become zzso
