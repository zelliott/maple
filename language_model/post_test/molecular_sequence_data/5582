The spike protein zzso of the zzso coronavirus mouse zzso virus strain zzso zzso zzso both zzso fusion during infection and zzso zzso Thus far, only zzso formation could be studied after transient expression of zzso We have recently described a system in which viral zzso is zzso by using zzso particles zzso and reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Van der zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso was shown to be dependent on the expression of M and zzso We now show in several ways that the zzso of zzso is dependent on zzso zzso was lost when zzso zzso were zzso zzso was blocked upon treatment of the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso zzso When the target cells were incubated with zzso zzso zzso which blocks zzso infection, zzso did not zzso the target zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso resembles zzso zzso The system can be used to identify zzso in S that are essential for zzso As a first application, we investigated the requirements of zzso of S for the zzso of zzso We inserted three zzso S proteins that were previously shown to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso Here we show that zzso of the spike protein of zzso is not required for zzso
