A synthetic library that presents potential zzso in a linear fashion with variable spacing was designed zzso zzso zzso To prove the concept, we zzso a number of individual compounds as well as a model zzso zzso acids connected by zzso bonds via their zzso or zzso zzso groups were used to form the backbone zzso of this zzso The remaining zzso group of the zzso acids were zzso by a variety of zzso zzso generating an appreciable diversity of compounds in this zzso The compositions of compounds in the library were identified by reading a zzso tag zzso zzso with the library zzso This code contained the information regarding the zzso acid zzso and the zzso acid and zzso group to which the acid was zzso
