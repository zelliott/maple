zzso zzso zzso babies born to zzso mothers are examples of natural resistance to zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the zzso and zzso potential of zzso maternal zzso and their correlation with zzso transmission in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined in a cohort of 74 first-time zzso pairs, of whom 40 mothers were infected with zzso zzso zzso Within the infected mother zzso 16 babies were born infected and 24 were zzso negative and zzso at birth zzso exposed but zzso Thirty-four zzso and zzso zzso pairs were included as zzso All zzso mothers and their newborns showed high zzso zzso to linear zzso within the zzso region and to the zzso zzso domain of zzso most zzso also recognized the zzso loop zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso were significantly lower in zzso mothers zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso babies zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso Three zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that were effectively transmitted to zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso babies, zzso overlapping the zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso were zzso targets in two out of four viruses zzso Our findings highlight important zzso in zzso that appear to be associated with exposure without infection and would be important to consider for vaccine zzso
