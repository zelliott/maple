zzso zzso the zzso that zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso acid, has been extracted and zzso from bovine zzso zzso and its structure determined at zzso A zzso The zzso which zzso in the zzso zzso space group, is a zzso characterized by the so-called zzso zzso The zzso of the bovine zzso mimics the zzso present in lower species, such as bacteria and zzso since it is composed of two zzso one of them is equivalent to one zzso whilst the second domain zzso to only a portion of zzso The active site consists of an iron zzso coordinated by two zzso zzso one zzso and an external zzso which has been interpreted as a zzso zzso It is contained in the zzso domain, whilst the function of the zzso domain is possibly zzso The zzso mechanism very likely has been zzso through all species, since the positions of all zzso considered relevant for the reaction are present from bacteria to zzso
