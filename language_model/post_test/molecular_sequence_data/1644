zzso zzso is a novel potential preventative and therapeutic zzso We report that zzso zzso a high degree of protection against zzso zzso challenge in a zzso model of malaria, as shown by the total absence of blood stage infection following challenge with 100 zzso zzso zzso and by a substantial reduction zzso of liver stage zzso zzso following challenge with 50,000 zzso zzso protection was demonstrated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice but not in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso and protected mice, high levels of gamma zzso zzso in serum and elevated zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso T cells were detected 24 h after administration of an additional dose of zzso Treatment of zzso mice that received zzso with zzso against zzso just prior to challenge abolished the protection, and a similar treatment with zzso against zzso T cells partially reduced the level of protection, while treatment with control zzso or zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso T cells, or zzso cells had no zzso Our data establish that the protection induced by zzso is dependent on zzso and is partially dependent on zzso T cells but is independent of zzso T cells, zzso cells, and zzso at the zzso phase and does not induce a zzso zzso zzso
