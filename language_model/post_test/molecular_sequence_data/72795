Within the past decade, zzso have been identified as the zzso agents of systemic disease in a variety of commercially and zzso important zzso Here we examine nine zzso from fish, zzso and zzso and demonstrate that all zzso were more similar to zzso virus 3, the type species of the zzso zzso than to zzso disease virus, the type species of the zzso zzso zzso of viral protein synthesis profiles, restriction zzso zzso patterns, and the zzso acid sequence of the major zzso protein indicated that zzso isolated from the same geographic region were similar, if not zzso whereas viruses from different areas were zzso Moreover, using zzso complementary to the zzso major zzso zzso we found that both zzso and zzso successfully amplified zzso zzso acid from all nine zzso These studies demonstrate that the zzso zzso examined here were members of the zzso zzso and suggest that surveys of zzso zzso zzso may need to include neighboring zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the results indicate that zzso readily identified zzso zzso and suggest that zzso will be useful in the diagnosis of fish zzso
