zzso in the zzso channel gene zzso zzso zzso an zzso dominant form of progressive hearing loss in zzso In the mouse zzso the transcript has been found exclusively in the outer hair zzso By using specific zzso we now show that zzso is situated at the zzso membrane of these sensory zzso In the zzso zzso zzso is restricted to the type I hair cells and the zzso zzso nerve endings zzso these sensory zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that zzso zzso the zzso and zzso currents that have been described in the outer and type I hair cells, respectively, and that are already open at resting zzso zzso is also expressed in zzso of many, but not all, zzso of the central auditory pathway, and is absent from most other brain zzso It is present, zzso in the cochlear zzso the zzso of the lateral zzso and the inferior zzso This is the first zzso channel shown to be specifically expressed in a sensory zzso Moreover, the expression pattern of zzso in the mouse auditory system raises the possibility of a central component in the zzso hearing zzso
