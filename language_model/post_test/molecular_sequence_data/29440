In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is formed as an intermediate and zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso which has previously been shown to be exceptionally resistant to zzso by zzso zzso The gene zzso this zzso ( zzso is preceded by a gene ( zzso potentially zzso a zzso the function of which was zzso The zzso gene product was zzso in zzso coli and zzso in zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by genes identified in strains degrading zzso and zzso respectively, were also zzso and zzso All three proteins showed zzso properties typical for zzso zzso The zzso zzso from strain zzso zzso was fully zzso when zzso was used as zzso zzso zzso could be rapidly zzso in zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and a source of zzso It is zzso that the ability of strain zzso to metabolize both zzso and zzso might depend on the zzso of the zzso zzso activity zzso by zzso Three zzso zzso including zzso were found to be competent in the zzso of zzso whereas zzso a protein known to mediate zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso formed a zzso complex with zzso when zzso with a zzso whereas zzso did zzso In the reverse situation, zzso was found to reactivate zzso as efficiently as zzso and formed an zzso zzso complex with this zzso upon zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso that appear to be involved in the zzso of their zzso zzso zzso Based on primary structure zzso zzso of the zzso possibly involved in the molecular interaction with zzso zzso were identified and their significance is zzso
