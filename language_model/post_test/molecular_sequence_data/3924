zzso carrier protein zzso performs the essential function of shuttling the zzso between the zzso that constitute the type II fatty acid zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis is unique in producing extremely long zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is also unique in possessing a longer zzso zzso than other zzso We determined the solution structure of zzso using protein zzso zzso to define the similarities and differences between zzso and the typical zzso The zzso region of the structure is well defined and consists of four zzso arranged in a right-handed bundle held together by zzso zzso interactions similar to the structures of other bacterial zzso The unique zzso extension from zzso IV has a zzso zzso feature, and the end of the zzso is a random zzso A comparison of the zzso and zzso of zzso revealed that the zzso group zzso between two zzso in one it is bound to a zzso groove on the surface of zzso and in another it is zzso The similarity between zzso and other zzso reveals the zzso structural motif that is recognized by all type II zzso However, the function of the zzso domain extending from zzso IV to the zzso zzso remains enigmatic, but its structural characteristics suggest that it may interact with the very long chain zzso in zzso acid zzso or control specific zzso zzso
