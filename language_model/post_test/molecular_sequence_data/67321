zzso repair is a highly zzso zzso responsible for correcting DNA zzso errors incorporated during zzso zzso zzso is a mismatch repair protein known to coordinate several steps in repair that ultimately results in strand removal following mismatch identification by zzso zzso zzso from bacteria to humans contain zzso zzso and zzso zzso To understand the contribution of the zzso zzso domain to mismatch repair, we analyzed 14 different zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso that were zzso with zzso zzso identified in the human zzso zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso We characterized zzso zzso in or near motifs important for zzso zzso zzso activity, and DNA zzso We found that 13 of the 14 zzso zzso zzso a substantial zzso to mismatch repair in zzso while three zzso zzso showed a dominant negative increase in zzso frequency to zzso zzso We performed zzso analysis to determine the relative stability of each zzso protein in zzso and found that, although most zzso several zzso proteins failed to maintain zzso levels, suggesting defects in protein zzso The remaining zzso zzso located in areas of the protein important for DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities of zzso compromised repair in zzso Our results define functional zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso that are critical for mismatch repair in zzso
