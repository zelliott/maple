zzso zzso zzso zzso show a right-handed zzso growth zzso in roots and zzso zzso due to impaired directional growth of rapidly expanding zzso zzso encodes a small protein with as yet unknown zzso functions, though its zzso to cortical zzso zzso suggests that zzso maintains directional cell expansion by regulating cortical zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains five zzso zzso genes that share high sequence identity in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso rescued the zzso growth zzso of zzso indicating that zzso and zzso proteins share the same zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso and zzso genes are transcribed in partially overlapping zzso A combination of zzso and zzso zzso resulted in randomly oriented cortical zzso zzso and zzso expansion of zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso and zzso act zzso in maintaining the cortical zzso organization essential for zzso cell growth, and that the zzso growth zzso of zzso results from a partially compromised state of cortical zzso Additionally, zzso stems of zzso zzso multiple zzso showed a right-handed zzso zzso growth, indicating that a directional winding response may be zzso to the zzso zzso movement by modulating the expression of zzso zzso
