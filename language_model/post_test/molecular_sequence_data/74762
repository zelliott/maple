zzso one of the most potent general zzso used zzso acts at zzso zzso as an zzso and positive zzso zzso of zzso acid responses, whereas it zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso at zzso above 10 zzso We report here that zzso a zzso zzso zzso acts as a positive zzso zzso zzso rather than an zzso and we identify its binding sites by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso response to zzso (10 zzso with a zzso increase at 60 zzso At higher zzso it inhibited the binding of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso values of zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso and labeled zzso acids were identified by zzso zzso For zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso there was zzso zzso of zzso acids in the zzso channel at positions zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso whereas labeling of zzso zzso was not inhibited by zzso but was enhanced zzso by zzso or zzso In addition, there was labeling in zzso zzso a zzso that contributes to the same pocket in the zzso structure as zzso The pharmacological specificity of labeling of zzso together with their locations in the zzso structure, indicate that zzso binds at two distinct sites: one within the zzso of the zzso channel zzso of zzso and zzso an zzso site, and another at the interface between the alpha and gamma zzso zzso of zzso and zzso likely to be a site for positive zzso zzso
