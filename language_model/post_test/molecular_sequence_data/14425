zzso have an zzso zzso fin skeleton formed by the upward zzso of the zzso portion of the body zzso the zzso zzso This zzso type of zzso fin ensures powerful and complex locomotion and is regarded as one of the most important innovations for zzso during zzso radiation in an aquatic zzso However, the mechanisms that create zzso zzso fin remain largely zzso The spontaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso Double zzso fin zzso exhibits a unique symmetrical zzso skeleton that resembles the zzso type seen in zzso and zzso We performed a detailed analysis of the Da zzso to obtain molecular insight into zzso fin zzso We first demonstrate that a large zzso inserted into the zzso region of the zzso and zzso genes zzso in zzso is associated with the zzso loss of their zzso We then show that zzso are strongly expressed in the zzso part of the zzso zzso and thereby induce zzso zzso fin development in zzso zzso whereas their expression is lost in zzso Comparative analysis further indicates that the zzso zzso expression of zzso is zzso in zzso highlighting the crucial role of zzso in zzso fin zzso
