We determined if any naturally occurring peptides could act as zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Several zzso peptides including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso competitively inhibited the zzso of zzso by zzso A4 zzso consistent with an interaction at its active zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso from zzso with zzso zzso 450 zzso 58 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and from zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso 90 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso of the zzso It is noteworthy that the zzso zzso traits of this zzso include generation of an zzso substance, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso
