An zzso zzso strain zzso was observed infecting an environmental isolate of an zzso zzso The zzso could not be recovered on zzso medium but was recovered and cultivated in zzso using cultures of zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of zzso was found to be new, sharing less than zzso similarity with other sequences in the zzso zzso zzso was found to be a member of the zzso sharing an evolutionary line of descent with a group of uniquely zzso zzso organisms comprised of zzso and zzso species and the zzso zzso zzso bacteria appeared to be highly zzso within zzso zzso analysis of the zzso demonstrated that it is zzso and possesses a typical zzso cell wall, but has no other outstanding features except small zzso structures often associated with the outer surface of each zzso The host range of zzso was found to be limited to the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso infection was slow to manifest when cultures were incubated below 30 degrees C, but at higher temperatures bacteria multiplied zzso and induced host cell zzso The protein profile of the zzso zzso from the zzso was assessed by zzso and its zzso content was estimated to be 41 zzso Although these results support the proposal of zzso as a new species, its zzso zzso nature prevented isolation of a definitive type zzso zzso is therefore proposed as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
