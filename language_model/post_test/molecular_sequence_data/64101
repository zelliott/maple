zzso zzso 1 zzso is a functionally unknown zzso zzso coupled zzso It has been implicated in zzso and cartilage development, and it also has a zzso role as one of the minor zzso involved in human zzso virus type I zzso zzso virus zzso infection of zzso immune zzso Here we report the cloning of the mouse zzso zzso the characterization of its zzso structure for comparison with the human zzso and the mapping and functional analysis of its zzso zzso zzso The gene was found to contain three zzso intercepted by one larger and one smaller zzso The overall structure resembles the human zzso The promoter lacks classical zzso and zzso boxes but contains several zzso regions as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso function was analyzed in mouse zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso expressing zzso as well as in mouse embryonic zzso zzso clone zzso cells not expressing zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso reporter gene zzso of the promoter indicated that a zzso sequence adjacent to the zzso start site zzso through zzso is essential for initiating zzso Within this region it was possible to identify four potential zzso sites that may be active in the zzso of the zzso Thus, we show that the zzso gene has several zzso features in common with its human counterpart, which suggests that they are regulated in a similar zzso The promoter does not seem to be tissue specific but other elements or enhancers may be zzso The results provide a necessary basis for further studies of the gene regulation and function of this zzso zzso and will be useful when manipulating the gene in the development of transgenic animal zzso
