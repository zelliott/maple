As an approach to identifying genes involved in zzso actions of zzso we used differential zzso to screen a zzso library from mouse zzso cells treated with zzso zzso We identified two zzso regulated zzso species which have been examined by analysis of the corresponding zzso and by DNA zzso zzso with the zzso database showed that these zzso clones corresponded to zzso zzso genes for zzso b and zzso I of zzso c zzso A further zzso encompassing three zzso genes was used as a probe to show that a third zzso zzso zzso zzso 5, was also zzso by zzso while a fourth, zzso zzso zzso 6, was zzso zzso of zzso b was also inhibited in mouse zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso and in human zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso The ability of zzso to reduce zzso zzso levels could be blocked by zzso suggesting that these effects are zzso by an zzso nuclear gene which encodes a product capable of regulating zzso gene zzso Analysis of proteins zzso in the presence of zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso translation, showed that the synthesis of several zzso translation products, including zzso zzso was reduced after treatment with zzso Our results reveal a novel effect of zzso on cellular physiology which could have important consequences for understanding the effects of zzso as well as suggesting new mechanisms for the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso
