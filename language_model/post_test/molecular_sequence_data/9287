zzso of the root growth pattern is an important control mechanism during plant growth and zzso To better understand zzso in root growth direction in response to environmental zzso we have characterized an zzso zzso zzso zzso growth 3 zzso whose roots show a zzso pattern of zzso growth on inclined zzso zzso The zzso zzso shows a greater zzso of root zzso in response to gravity, but a smaller zzso in response to light, suggesting that it is a root zzso zzso This zzso zzso also suggests that enhancement of the zzso response in roots strengthens root tip zzso after contact with the zzso surface and/or causes an increase in subsequent root zzso in response to zzso stimulus in these zzso zzso encodes a protein with a zzso finger domain, and is mainly expressed in root zzso zzso proteins often function as an zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein shows such activity in zzso There are three genes zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso DEVELOPMENT zzso 40 zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso triple zzso show marked root zzso zzso This genetic study indicates that zzso functions positively rather than zzso in root zzso and that enhancement of the zzso response in zzso roots is dependent upon the function of zzso in the absence of zzso zzso our results demonstrate that the zzso family of proteins are zzso zzso that are required for root zzso in zzso
