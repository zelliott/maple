zzso plasmids are a class of plasmids from the zzso that are relatively large zzso to zzso zzso that are readily transferred by zzso and that carry multiple zzso resistance zzso Reconstruction of the zzso of these plasmids has been difficult because of the high rate of zzso by zzso horizontal gene transfer zzso We hypothesized that evaluation of zzso zzso relative to the rate of zzso would help to develop a clock to show whether zzso practices have had significant influences on the lineages of the zzso A system was developed to rapidly sequence up to 191 known open reading frames from each of 39 recently isolated zzso plasmids from a diverse panel of zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso With these data plus sequences from zzso we were able to distinguish six distinct lineages that had extremely low numbers of zzso within each zzso especially among the largest group designated as group zzso Two regions, each about half the zzso in size, could be distinguished with a separate zzso zzso The distribution of group 1 showed that it has migrated extremely rapidly with fewer zzso than can be expected in 2,000 zzso zzso by frequent zzso was zzso with a pattern that appeared to have the highest rate just upstream of the putative zzso origin of transfer zzso It seems likely that when an zzso zzso is transferred by zzso there is an opportunity for zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso which was also adjacent to a multiple zzso resistance gene zzso
