The zzso 434 zzso zzso the zzso domain of its zzso zzso and that of zzso zzso zzso constitute a group of small, zzso zzso folding units consisting of five zzso with striking structural zzso The intrinsic zzso zzso in zzso have been correlated to its rapid folding behavior, and a residual zzso cluster found in zzso in 7 M zzso has been proposed as a folding initiation zzso To understand the early events in the folding of 434 zzso and for comparison with zzso and zzso we examined the zzso behavior of five peptides covering the entire 434 zzso sequence in water, zzso (by zzso zzso and 7 M zzso solutions using CD and zzso Each zzso zzso to a zzso and adjacent zzso as identified in the native 434 zzso zzso and crystal zzso All are soluble and zzso in the solution conditions examined except for the zzso corresponding to the 434 zzso zzso 4, which has low water zzso zzso formation is observed for the 434 zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2 peptides in water, for all the peptides in zzso zzso and for none in 7 M zzso zzso data indicate that the zzso limits in the peptides are similar to those in the native protein zzso The number of zzso zzso in water and zzso zzso with the zzso content, and essentially none are observed in 7 M zzso for any zzso except that for zzso 5, where a zzso cluster may be zzso The low intrinsic folding zzso of the five zzso could account for the observed stability and folding behavior of 434 zzso and is, at least zzso in zzso with the results of the recently described zzso model incorporating intrinsic zzso zzso
