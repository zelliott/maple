zzso sugar chains of zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso from normal human liver and zzso zzso zzso 1) liver were comparatively zzso zzso released from the two zzso samples by zzso were zzso by paper zzso and by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (under 400 zzso column zzso zzso of zzso in each fraction were estimated from data on their effective molecular sizes, behavior on immobilized zzso columns with different zzso zzso results of sequential zzso by zzso with different zzso zzso and zzso zzso Sugar chains of zzso zzso from normal human liver and from zzso zzso zzso 1) liver were different from each other, although both of them were derived from zzso sugar zzso The sugar chains of the former were the following eight degradation products from zzso sugar chains by zzso in zzso Man alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso Man alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso Man alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso Man alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso Man beta zzso beta zzso Man beta zzso beta zzso alpha zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso In contrast to these, the sugar chains of the latter were zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso sugar chains that were not fully zzso due to a zzso zzso in acid zzso zzso
