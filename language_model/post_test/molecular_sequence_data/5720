Five zzso zzso were constructed by replacing zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso with zzso in zzso zzso X of a functional zzso zzso zzso devoid of zzso zzso zzso zzso Taking into account expression levels, each zzso zzso except for zzso exhibits significant zzso The intrinsic zzso zzso of each zzso zzso does not change significantly after addition of zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso little change in the zzso of the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso studies with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that a zzso zzso in place of zzso zzso or zzso becomes less accessible to zzso in the presence of zzso while a zzso zzso in place of zzso or zzso becomes more zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso and zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicate that positions zzso and 325 also become more accessible to a zzso environment in the presence of zzso while positions 320 and 331 become less zzso The findings are consistent with a recently proposed mechanism for energy zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 94, zzso in which zzso binding causes a zzso change resulting in movement of zzso to a zzso environment with a dramatic increase in zzso
