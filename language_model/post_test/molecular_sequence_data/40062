zzso zzso is the bacterial pathogen that causes zzso in humans and a number of zzso To date, there is no approved vaccine for this widespread and life-threatening zzso The goal of this study was to identify zzso zzso zzso that can be used in the development of a live attenuated zzso We screened zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso that exhibited reduced growth in mouse zzso as these cells are the preferred host cells of zzso and an essential component of the innate immune zzso This approach yielded 16 zzso zzso zzso that were zzso more attenuated for zzso in a mouse model than the zzso parental zzso These zzso were then tested to determine their abilities to protect mice against challenge with high doses of zzso zzso Five of the 16 attenuated zzso (with zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provided mice with protection against challenge with high doses zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso We believe that these findings will be of use in the design of a vaccine against zzso
