Most zzso proteins are nuclear zzso zzso on zzso zzso and imported into the zzso We have identified and characterized a 309 zzso acid human protein with a molecular weight of 34 zzso that functions as a zzso of the zzso for the import of such zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is displayed on the surface of zzso and is resistant to extraction under alkaline zzso zzso raised against zzso specifically inhibit in zzso import of the zzso precursor protein zzso zzso into zzso isolated from rat zzso Based on zzso zzso experiments, the zzso has a large (27 zzso zzso domain exposed to the zzso This novel component of the protein import machinery possesses a 62 zzso motif zzso with the zzso family of zzso receptors but otherwise appears to have no counterpart so far characterized in the zzso of any other zzso
