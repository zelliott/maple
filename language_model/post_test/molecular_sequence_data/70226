The zzso and zzso zzso properties of two zzso zzso synthetic peptides with the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso where the naturally occurring zzso was replaced by a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zinc finger zzso of human zzso virus type I zzso protein were zzso Fluorescence intensity zzso of both zzso 16 and zzso 37 zzso suggested the existence of two fully zzso zzso classes governed by a C zzso zzso equilibrium zzso The lifetimes of zzso 16 classes differed from those of zzso 37 essentially because of differences in zzso rate zzso zzso plots of the zzso zzso rate zzso suggested that the zzso zzso involved in both classes and in both peptides were different and the zzso rate of these zzso with the zzso ring was very low, probably because of the highly constrained zzso chain zzso The nature of the zzso classes was discussed in relation to zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso Using zzso zzso to monitor the interaction of both peptides with zzso we found that a stacking between the zzso ring of both zzso zzso and the bases of zzso zzso This stacking constituted the main driving force of the interaction and modified the zzso zzso Moreover, the binding of both fingers to zzso was zzso with similar site size (3 zzso zzso but the affinity of the zzso finger domain (K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in low zzso strength buffer was one order of magnitude larger than the zzso one due to additional zzso interactions involving zzso 14 and/or zzso 29 zzso
