A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso carrot storage facility and identified as an zzso of zzso often classified in zzso zzso Growth of this fungus was observed between 0 and 20 degrees C with an optimum at 9-12 degrees C, while incubation of zzso grown at zzso degrees C resulted in absence of growth even after the fungus was transferred back to 15 degrees zzso Growth was inhibited in the presence of the zzso zzso acid or zzso in particular when the fungus was incubated at 18 degrees zzso zzso zzso produces zzso degrading zzso that, when compared to zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso retain a larger proportion of their activity at lower zzso This indicates that zzso zzso could be used as a source for novel industrial zzso that are active at zzso degrees zzso
