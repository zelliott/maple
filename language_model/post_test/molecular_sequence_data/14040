The zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to alleviate DNA restriction by type I zzso and to promote zzso transmission of the unmodified zzso to a restricting zzso To clarify the ecological role of zzso its distribution was determined on plasmids from 23 zzso groups using zzso to the coding sequence as an zzso zzso zzso shown by zzso sequencing to have at least zzso identity with zzso were detected on plasmids belonging to the I complex zzso zzso and zzso the F complex zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were found to specify an zzso zzso which was enhanced by genetic depression of the zzso transfer zzso zzso zzso map in zzso leading regions but show no consistent association with a particular type of zzso or a leading region gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It may be significant that zzso plasmids are authentic zzso plasmids and that type I restriction systems are associated historically with members of the zzso
