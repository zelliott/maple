zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed using zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso All of these compounds have the same molecular weight zzso zzso zzso and consist of only zzso From a comparison of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso correlation between the chemical structures and the relative zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso The correlation is considered to be caused by the difference in the number of zzso sites at the zzso zzso It was found that the intensity of the zzso zzso resulting from one zzso is higher than that resulting from two zzso at a zzso zzso The results show that zzso zzso spectrum method used in zzso mass zzso is a very powerful technique for the structural analyses of the zzso zzso
