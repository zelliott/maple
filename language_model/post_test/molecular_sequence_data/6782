We have screened for zzso in the zzso gene using Southern zzso analysis and the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso method in diverse human zzso Seven of 102 zzso human tumor samples were identified to have point zzso within the coding region of the zzso zzso Two of the seven zzso cases showed gene zzso These results suggest that the frequency of genetic zzso in the zzso gene is relatively low in comparison with several known tumor zzso zzso
