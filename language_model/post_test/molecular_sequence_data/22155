The zzso of zzso and cardiac muscle zzso is one of the most densely packed cellular structures in zzso zzso It provides the architectural framework for assembling and zzso the largest known muscle filament systems by an extensive network of zzso zzso requiring an extraordinary level of mechanical zzso Here we show, using X-ray zzso how the zzso zzso of the longest filament zzso the giant muscle protein zzso is assembled into an zzso zzso sandwich complex by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso mediates a unique zzso arrangement of two zzso zzso a type of molecular assembly previously found only in zzso zzso We have confirmed its unique architecture in zzso by protein zzso zzso and in zzso by experiments using zzso resonance energy zzso The model proposed may provide a molecular paradigm of how major zzso filaments are zzso anchored and aligned within complex zzso zzso
