Vietnam is currently developing domestic capability to manufacture influenza vaccines but information on the genetic and zzso characteristics of locally circulating seasonal influenza viruses is zzso To assess the relevance of WHO recommended vaccine strains to the situation in Vietnam, we analyzed the genetic zzso of the zzso zzso gene of seasonal influenza A viruses circulating in Vietnam from 2001 to 2009 to WHO recommended vaccine strains over the same zzso 

We zzso the zzso gene of 32 zzso and 44 zzso seasonal influenza A zzso from zzso zzso surveillance sites in zzso from 2001 to 2005 and from a national influenza surveillance system from 2005 to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso trees rooted to vaccine strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were constructed with contemporary zzso sequences of zzso from neighboring zzso We found some genetic differences between seasonal influenza zzso viruses and three WHO influenza vaccine strains recommended for use in the Northern and Southern zzso for the zzso and zzso seasons and close genetic identity of circulating zzso strains with the recommended WHO Southern Hemisphere vaccine strains for 2004 and 2009 zzso The genetic similarity of circulating zzso strains with the WHO recommended vaccine strains are described for the study period zzso 

The zzso gene of seasonal influenza virus strains in Vietnam (especially influenza zzso showed varying degrees of genetic identity compared with those of the Northern or Southern Hemisphere vaccine strains recommended by zzso The close zzso of the zzso of Vietnamese strains and contemporary strains from nearby countries indicate a good genetic match of circulating strains during study zzso Greater representation of virus zzso from South East Asia in the vaccine strain selection process is desirable of influenza vaccine development in zzso
