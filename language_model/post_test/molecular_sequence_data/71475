Changes in the zzso interface are thought to play an important role in zzso cellular zzso In this study, we compared the zzso binding properties of the motor domain of zzso zzso zzso and rabbit skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso The zzso motor domain resembles zzso zzso carrying the zzso light zzso in its interaction with zzso Similar to zzso none of the zzso motor domain zzso induced zzso zzso The affinity of zzso zzso zzso was zzso lower for zzso than for zzso but increasing the number of positive charges in the loop 2 region of the zzso zzso motor domain zzso zzso resulted in equivalent affinities of zzso for zzso and for zzso zzso zzso and zzso approaches were used to show that zzso like S1, interacts via the loop 2 region with zzso zzso zzso For both types of myosin, zzso prevents zzso zzso in the loop 2 region and zzso segment zzso can be zzso to loop 2 zzso by a zzso zzso In contrast with the S1, loop zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was not zzso to zzso probably due to the lower number of positive zzso These results confirm the importance of the loop 2 region of zzso for the interaction with both zzso and zzso regardless of the source of zzso The differences observed in the way in which zzso and zzso interact with zzso may be linked to more general differences in the structure of the zzso interface of muscle and zzso zzso
