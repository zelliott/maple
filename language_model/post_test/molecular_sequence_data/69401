A zzso complex formed by the zzso zzso zzso and a 14 zzso DNA duplex zzso weight approximately zzso was prepared in which the protein was zzso zzso Using two-dimensional nuclear zzso enhancement zzso zzso with zzso 1, omega zzso and three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso nearly complete zzso resonance assignments were obtained for both the protein and the DNA in the zzso On this basis zzso constraints needed for a three-dimensional structure determination were zzso Using 855 zzso distance constraints as zzso the structure of the zzso zzso zzso was calculated with the program zzso followed by restrained energy zzso with the program zzso A group of 20 zzso characterizes a zzso structure for zzso 8 to 56, with an average of zzso A of the zzso zzso zzso calculated for the backbone atoms of the individual zzso relative to the mean zzso The quality of the resulting structure is comparable to the one for the free zzso and the global fold of the free zzso zzso was found to be zzso in the DNA zzso The structure of the zzso protein was the starting point for the subsequent structure determination of the complete zzso zzso complex in zzso
