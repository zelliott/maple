First strand transfer is essential for zzso reverse zzso During this step, the zzso zzso hairpin zzso to the zzso DNA zzso this zzso reaction is promoted by the zzso protein and involves an initial zzso interaction between the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Using zzso and probing methods, we investigated the structural and dynamic properties of the top half of the zzso DNA zzso We show that the upper stem located between the zzso and the internal zzso is stable, but that the lower stem of zzso is zzso The zzso of the internal loop undergo slow motions at the zzso zzso that are consistent with zzso exchange zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso loop undergo fast zzso The lower stem is zzso by the slow zzso processes in the internal loop, and thus the internal loop is responsible for zzso zzso of zzso These findings are consistent with the functions of zzso in first strand transfer: its zzso loop is suitably exposed to interact with the zzso loop of zzso zzso and its lower stem is significantly zzso to facilitate the subsequent action of the zzso protein which promotes the zzso zzso
