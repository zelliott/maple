zzso gene zzso was originally described as the molecular process underlying B cell affinity maturation following a zzso immune zzso zzso zzso is also used in some species such as zzso to generate diversity during formation of the primary zzso zzso In zzso B cells mutate their zzso zzso during zzso development in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso patches, but this process is arrested when these same B cells are cultured in zzso We have used these differences between in zzso and in zzso B cell development to perform a zzso zzso between these two cell zzso in order to search for genes that might be involved in the zzso zzso We describe in this paper the characterization of two zzso highly expressed in sheep zzso zzso patch B cells and also in zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso which is related to the zzso zzso and a new zzso zzso zzso The putative role of these zzso which are more likely involved in the zzso center B cell differentiation zzso than in the zzso mechanism per se, is zzso
