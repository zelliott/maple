A naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from an zzso wastewater treatment system at the zzso zzso production facility in zzso Gabriel, zzso zzso zzso was resistant to 1,000 zzso of zzso per zzso but showed relatively low resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA indicated that strain zzso falls into the zzso zzso zzso driven oxygen evolution in strain zzso was only slightly inhibited (about zzso by 2,000 zzso of zzso per zzso whereas in the control strain zzso zzso oxygen evolution was inhibited zzso by 1,000 zzso of zzso per zzso No zzso zzso zzso or zzso were detected when strain zzso was grown with zzso zzso zzso contained three copies of the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso protein of the zzso II reaction zzso zzso sequence analyses indicated that the zzso and zzso genes zzso predicted proteins with the same zzso acid zzso However, the zzso gene product contained five extra zzso zzso which were not found in zzso proteins from five other zzso Moreover, the zzso protein from strain zzso had an additional 13 zzso acid changes compared to the zzso proteins and contained 10 zzso acid zzso compared to zzso zzso found in other zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso gene and the zzso zzso were expressed in zzso grown cells in the presence of zzso These results suggest that strong selection pressure zzso by the continual input of zzso has contributed to the evolution of a zzso yet zzso efficient, zzso gene in a zzso
