The goal of this study was to identify and characterize the hypothesized zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso and/or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the yellow fever zzso Aedes zzso From Aedes zzso zzso we cloned zzso a full-length zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso The expression of zzso transcripts is ubiquitous among zzso zzso and is not enriched in zzso zzso Western blots of zzso zzso suggest that zzso is expressed primarily as an zzso zzso which was confirmed by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in principal cells of the zzso zzso zzso where it zzso to a zzso compartment zzso zzso or zzso but not in the zzso brush zzso Furthermore, feeding mosquitoes a blood meal or treating isolated zzso with zzso both of which stimulate a zzso by zzso zzso do not influence the zzso zzso of zzso in principal zzso When expressed zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso exchange, in which zzso partially and zzso poorly replace zzso The expression of zzso in zzso zzso is associated with the development of a zzso zzso that closely resembles the known zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso does not mediate zzso exchange in the zzso membrane of Aedes zzso zzso it is more likely involved with an zzso zzso
