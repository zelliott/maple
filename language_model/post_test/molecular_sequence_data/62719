Seven putative zzso inhibitor zzso zzso representing four protein families, were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso immature fruit zzso zzso zzso zzso open reading frames zzso proteins with similarity to, and protein signatures for: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso potato zzso inhibitor I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gamma zzso zzso Response of transcript abundance to fruit development and leaf wounding was determined for all but zzso using real-time zzso zzso leaves had the highest transcript levels for all zzso The zzso transcript in immature leaves was the most abundant transcript but was absent from healthy mature zzso In fruit zzso transcripts for all zzso were most abundant in youngest fruit zzso zzso zzso zzso and declined during development, but displayed different patterns of zzso zzso Mechanical or zzso root zzso zzso feeding damage to leaves caused a zzso reduction or had no effect on transcript level with the exception of zzso which, as a result of damage, increased zzso in mature leaves and decreased zzso in immature zzso This zzso control of transcript response to wounding in a woody perennial is opposite of what has been observed for defensive zzso zzso zzso in other plants (typically zzso and/or annual zzso where younger leaves typically invoke a higher defensive zzso inhibitor transcript zzso than older zzso Except for zzso the zzso transcripts were minimally responsive or unresponsive to zzso Changes in zzso transcript levels suggest diverse roles for the products of these genes in zzso with only zzso responding in a zzso zzso
