zzso zzso is a highly zzso and zzso expressed zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in many cellular processes including zzso storage and release, protein zzso and molecular zzso zzso To zzso the function of zzso in plant responses against drought, a main zzso stress limiting cereal crop production worldwide, a full-length zzso zzso zzso protein namely zzso was isolated from wheat zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shares high zzso with other plant zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso clone encodes a wheat zzso zzso Southern analysis suggests that the wheat zzso contains three copies of zzso zzso locations of zzso were the zzso and nucleus, evidenced by transient expression of zzso fused with zzso in onion zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso transcript was observed in wheat zzso in response to zzso drought zzso To investigate further whether zzso is involved in the zzso response, transgenic plants were zzso Compared to the zzso and zzso plants, zzso tobacco zzso zzso plants grew better and exhibited less zzso under the drought zzso Moreover, zzso plants exhibited enhanced drought resistance to water deficit, as shown by their capacity to maintain higher zzso zzso use zzso zzso zzso retention zzso zzso zzso water zzso and lower zzso zzso damaging zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso under zzso zzso In conclusion, a zzso clone zzso wheat zzso was successfully isolated and the results suggest that zzso is involved in the plant response to drought stress, indicating a potential in the transgenic improvements of plant zzso
