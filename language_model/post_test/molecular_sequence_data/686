About 500 million years ago, a new type of zzso immune defense emerged in zzso zzso zzso accompanied by zzso zzso including the zzso Did these evolutionary zzso arise de zzso or from zzso of ancient genetic zzso We reconstructed the genetic changes underlying zzso by comparative zzso and expression analyses in zzso and zzso zzso The derived models of genetic networks were zzso verified in zzso zzso zzso networks defining circumscribed regions of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso expanded in zzso zzso to incorporate novel zzso notably those zzso zzso zzso novel networks evolved in zzso of zzso zzso to control the expression of additional zzso zzso These complementary changes enabled unprecedented zzso signaling between zzso zzso and zzso cells that was exploited for zzso to the T cell zzso Our results provide a framework zzso the evolution of key features of the zzso immune system in zzso zzso
