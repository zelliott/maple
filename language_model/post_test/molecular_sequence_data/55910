The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that mediates the directed locomotion of zzso upon binding zzso zzso The zzso is zzso primarily by a zzso zzso in differentiated zzso and zzso cells, although larger less abundant transcripts are zzso To study the origin of different zzso zzso the genetic linkage of zzso zzso zzso and the regulation of zzso gene zzso we determined the copy number, zzso location, structural organization, and zzso sequence of the human zzso zzso zzso restriction fragments derived from a human zzso zzso zzso clone were isolated, zzso and zzso These data indicate that the zzso structural gene is approximately zzso zzso in length and is comprised of two zzso separated by an approximately zzso zzso The first zzso encodes 66 zzso of the zzso zzso while zzso 2 encodes the coding and zzso zzso The zzso organization of the zzso gene is similar to that of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes in that the coding sequence is contained in a single zzso The different zzso sequences observed in zzso zzso clones are zzso in the zzso structure, thereby indicating that these clones are derived in part by alternative zzso Southern zzso analysis using human X zzso zzso cell hybrids and in zzso zzso indicated that the zzso gene is located on zzso zzso zzso extension experiments using zzso zzso zzso indicated a single zzso initiation zzso zzso analysis zzso of the zzso initiation site indicated possible zzso motifs that may regulate zzso gene zzso These included zzso and zzso consensus sequences that bind nuclear factors of the zzso family and zzso zzso
