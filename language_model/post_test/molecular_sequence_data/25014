zzso in zzso cause the zzso zzso form of zzso muscular zzso zzso zzso zzso at the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope zzso during zzso and zzso into the zzso when the zzso zzso during zzso We analyzed the recruitment of zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins during nuclear envelope assembly in living zzso zzso During zzso zzso accumulates briefly at the zzso region of zzso zzso and later distributes over the entire nuclear zzso zzso factor zzso a protein that binds zzso to zzso DNA in zzso zzso with zzso at the zzso region of zzso during zzso An zzso zzso defective for binding to zzso in zzso failed to zzso at the zzso in zzso and subsequently failed to zzso at the reformed zzso In zzso cells that expressed zzso zzso zzso which did not show zzso zzso the zzso zzso proteins failed to zzso at the zzso region during zzso and did not assemble into the zzso during the subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso and zzso A from the NE, but had no effect on the zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is required for the assembly of zzso and zzso zzso at the reforming zzso during zzso and may mediate their stability in the subsequent zzso
