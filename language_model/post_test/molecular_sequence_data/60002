Although it plays no clinical role in general zzso zzso A, a zzso channel zzso provides an excellent model for studying the specific interaction between volatile zzso and membrane proteins at the molecular zzso We show here that a pair of structurally similar volatile zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 1, zzso zzso respectively, interacts differently with the zzso zzso With 400 zzso zzso A in a zzso suspension of 60 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso rate zzso between zzso of F3 and zzso in the chemical shift regions for the zzso and backbone zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) zzso zzso No zzso was measurable between zzso of zzso and zzso in these zzso zzso transport study showed that with 75 zzso zzso A in a zzso suspension of 66 zzso zzso F3 increased the zzso apparent zzso rate constant from zzso zzso zzso of control zzso zzso 3) to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the apparent influx rate constant from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso had no effects on either influx or zzso zzso It is concluded that the ability of general zzso to interact with zzso zzso near the zzso interface and the inability of zzso to do the same may represent some characteristics of zzso interaction that are of importance to general zzso
