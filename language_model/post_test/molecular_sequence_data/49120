To identify the characteristics and function of a zzso zzso cloned from a human zzso cell zzso zzso library and designated zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso expression of zzso in zzso and cells was analyzed by Northern zzso and zzso zzso In order to express zzso in target cells, we constructed a zzso expression zzso and zzso it into zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso growth was demonstrated by cell proliferation and colony zzso 

zzso zzso zzso a protein of 260 zzso acids and the gene was localized to zzso zzso The predicted protein possessed a definitive zzso sequence motif and shared zzso with classical zzso However, no zzso segment was observed in zzso Northern zzso revealed the ubiquitous nature of zzso transcripts in human zzso with high expression in heart, brain, zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was widely expressed in zzso and zzso tumor cell lines, but was not expressed in zzso Interestingly, zzso expression was zzso in DC activated by zzso zzso expression in the stable zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso and Western zzso zzso protein was found to be zzso by zzso but not expressed on the membrane of zzso zzso zzso resulted in significant zzso of in zzso growth and colony formation of zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso was cloned from human DC and it may be a soluble zzso zzso for tumor zzso zzso was zzso in activated DC and may be involved in the zzso function of activated zzso
