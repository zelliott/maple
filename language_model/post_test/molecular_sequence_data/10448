The expression of two zzso zzso zzso zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso was investigated at the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso which zzso proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, were identified on zzso clones of an zzso zzso zzso library and subsequently zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of these genes exhibited a high degree of similarity to other zzso and zzso zzso family zzso zzso of the zzso genes was characterized in detail for the purpose of developing a model for studying zzso regulation in the domain zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso were zzso induced after heat shock from 37 to 55 degrees C and showed significant heat zzso after 30 zzso at 60 degrees zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also zzso in response to dilute salt zzso zzso analysis of zzso promoter regions coupled to a zzso zzso reporter gene demonstrated that zzso zzso sequences up to position zzso zzso and position zzso zzso were sufficient for promoting zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso genes were directed by a zzso zzso consensus zzso motif zzso centered at zzso relative to the mapped initiation zzso zzso of the zzso promoter regions also revealed a striking degree of sequence conservation immediately zzso and 3' of the zzso zzso
