The zzso is a zzso family that has arisen through zzso expansion and contraction of zzso and a zzso of the evolutionary process is observed in the zzso zzso The number of duplicated genes observed in different zzso groups of zzso fish varies from one to 42, with only a few genes observed in the primitive zzso species, and greater numbers of genes observed in the more advanced zzso zzso In this study, an attempt is made to isolate all of the zzso class I genes of an early zzso species, Atlantic cod zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso sequences were isolated from the zzso of an individual zzso zzso The level of gene zzso observed within each of the lineages and zzso was similar, and most contained an estimated two to four duplicated zzso zzso class I gene zzso in zzso zzso was independent of, and possibly more recent than, extensive zzso in the zzso zzso Only limited contraction of zzso genes is observed in zzso zzso A low level of zzso diversity is observed, with most individuals containing at least one copy of each of the lineages zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso recognition site is observed, indicative of the initial stage of zzso from classical to zzso zzso However, most or all of the lineages are still zzso and zzso is present both within and among zzso Thus, the outcome zzso which genes will remain zzso is as yet zzso
