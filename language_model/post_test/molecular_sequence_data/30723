We have attempted to construct an artificial zzso that folds like the zzso parallel zzso zzso Our approach consists of repeating eight times a unit zzso designed to adopt a zzso zzso A first zzso sequence for this structural unit was deduced from a series of parameters defined after an analysis of three natural zzso proteins and including principally the lengths of the secondary structure zzso the zzso packing and the fitting on average zzso zzso The gene zzso this structural unit was zzso cloned and expressed in zzso coli either as a zzso or as direct repeats of zzso zzso zzso structural characterization of the zzso 8- and zzso unit zzso by circular zzso zzso indicates the presence of the predicted amount of zzso in the three zzso Further analysis by zzso gel zzso demonstrates that, in the conditions tested, only the zzso unit zzso forms a compact structure through a cooperative and rapid two-state folding transition involving long-range molecular zzso
