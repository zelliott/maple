To test the influence of zzso zzso on zzso zzso and the rejoining of DNA double strand breaks in zzso cells, we developed a sensitive and quantitative zzso system using zzso zzso First, zzso was introduced into zzso in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso which specifically zzso the zzso position of zzso bases within zzso zzso mimicking the zzso DNA zzso Next, zzso zzso were incubated in zzso cells for a sufficient length of time to recombine or rejoin prior to zzso zzso zzso from bacterial transformation of the zzso and from direct Southern analysis demonstrate that zzso zzso has no zzso effect on either DNA zzso or zzso zzso Thus, the components of the protein machinery involved in these complex processes are unaffected by the major DNA modification in zzso zzso These results leave open the possibility that zzso may zzso the accessibility of these components to zzso DNA by altering local zzso zzso
