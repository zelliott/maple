zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein involved in zzso zzso via its direct interactions with zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso portion of zzso contains a zzso zzso module of unknown function, known as the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now solved the crystal structure of rat zzso 1 zzso domain to zzso A zzso This domain is structurally similar to zzso and Heat repeats of zzso and zzso zzso We have also identified and characterized the interaction of zzso 1, via the zzso domain, with the zzso factor zzso leukemia zzso finger protein zzso zzso B, an zzso antibiotic, which zzso the zzso dependent nuclear export pathway, zzso an zzso of zzso 1 in the zzso These findings suggest that zzso 1 may function in a signaling zzso connecting the zzso machinery to the regulation of nuclear zzso
