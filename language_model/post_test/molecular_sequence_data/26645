61 blood zzso and 30 zzso zzso obtained from patients with zzso rash from various territories of zzso were studied for the presence of zzso B 19 DNA zzso zzso DNA isolation and amplification was carried out by standard zzso DNA segment including zzso of zzso gene zzso and region of structural gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso original sequences zzso zzso were selected for this zzso zzso analysis was carried out online on the zzso zzso Data for tree construction was obtained from zzso 

zzso 19 zzso detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso segment was zzso in 8 zzso All the zzso 19 zzso belong to a single cluster of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso Republic is similar to zzso strain isolated from zzso 

zzso analysis showed a high degree of genetic similarity between zzso 19 zzso circulating on the territories of zzso their membership in the most widespread zzso in the zzso Local and import cases zzso infection zzso were zzso The authors make a conclusion on the necessity to include zzso into the system of zzso and zzso zzso
