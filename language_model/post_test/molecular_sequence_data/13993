The two zzso zzso zzso of zzso C are connected by a zzso exposed central zzso The requirements of this zzso zzso for regulatory function are not fully zzso In the present work we investigated the structural requirement of the zzso using a series of zzso zzso that differ in predicted zzso zzso has a zzso flexible random zzso zzso zzso has a zzso rigid zzso insert (three zzso and zzso alpha h has a zzso insert with high potential of forming zzso zzso and zzso were defective in the zzso of the regulated zzso zzso activity in the presence of zzso when compared to wild type or zzso alpha zzso suggesting that altering the flexibility of the central zzso zzso the regulatory function of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso had zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso 3, and zzso zzso 2 of the wild type activity, respectively zzso zzso zzso All insertions in the central zzso resulted in zzso of zzso compared to wild type zzso as determined by zzso zzso The zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso and the stability of the zzso zzso were similar to wild zzso zzso of up to two turns of the central zzso have little effect on zzso C function zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In another zzso zzso the entire central zzso zzso was zzso With zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity in the presence of zzso was normal, but zzso in the absence of zzso was less zzso zzso of zzso with zzso was zzso There was a zzso excess of zzso in zzso zzso complex, consistent with another report zzso zzso zzso zzso G, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the native length and structure of the central zzso are optimal for normal regulatory function and that connectivity alone is insufficient for zzso zzso
