zzso zzso larvae from zzso zzso off coast of Rio de zzso were studied using light, laser zzso and scanning electron zzso in addition to a molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso partial zzso zzso and internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA were amplified using the zzso chain reaction and zzso to evaluate the zzso relationships between the zzso zzso The zzso and genetic profiles confirmed that, of the 1,030 larvae collected from the 64 fish zzso 398 were zzso of which zzso were zzso zzso and 37 were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were not identified to the species level due to the absence of similar sequences for adult zzso however, the ITS sequence clustered in the zzso tree with sequences of zzso zzso whereas an zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the presence of two zzso both of them under the same name as the zzso zzso zzso Data on the occurrence of zzso during the winter and summer months were compared using the zzso The greatest prevalence and intensity of infection were recorded for zzso zzso with a prevalence of zzso and an intensity of up to 55 zzso per zzso The zzso zzso exhibit a higher abundance and intensity of infection in the winter months, and those of zzso during the zzso However, the zzso indicated no significant differences between the abundance and intensity of infection recorded during the months of collection for either of these zzso zzso All sequences generated in this study were deposited in zzso
