Both positive and negative regulatory elements responsive to the product of the zzso type 12 zzso gene are located in the promoter region of the gene for mouse zzso major zzso complex zzso class I zzso zzso We have analyzed the negative regulatory element that is affected by zzso and identified a target zzso repeated zzso zzso within zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso in a zzso sequence located in the far upstream region of zzso promoter zzso to zzso zzso refers to the cap zzso The extent of cell surface expression of the zzso class 1 zzso was significantly decreased in the case of zzso obtained by introducing an expression zzso that included zzso class 1 zzso with the zzso repeated element, as compared with that of a zzso with zzso zzso zzso We have also characterized the nuclear proteins that bind to this zzso The analysis of the effects of zzso during competition zzso of in zzso and gel zzso competition zzso demonstrated that the zzso repeated element is essential not only for zzso repression of zzso but also for the cell surface expression of the product of the mouse zzso class I zzso presumably through nuclear proteins that specifically bind to zzso
