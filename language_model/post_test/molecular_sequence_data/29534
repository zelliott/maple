zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts its biological effects by binding to the vitamin D zzso zzso which binds in turn to the vitamin D response elements located in the target zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso binds in zzso with high affinity to the zzso sequence of the human growth hormone zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed the response to zzso zzso of zzso zzso introduced by zzso into the zzso human zzso cell zzso We found that the zzso activity of some of these zzso was markedly reduced by zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that a zzso sequence located between positions zzso and zzso upstream of the zzso start site is sufficient for this repressive zzso This conclusion was also confirmed by gel mobility shift zzso Our results indicate that vitamin D zzso zzso gene transcription, directly or by interference with other zzso zzso
