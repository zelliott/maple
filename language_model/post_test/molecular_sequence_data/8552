The most frequently altered gene in diverse tumor types is the tumor zzso gene zzso Typically, normal function is zzso by point zzso of one zzso and deletion of the zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso of zzso zzso markers is a strong indication for zzso involvement in a zzso zzso This study shows that a highly zzso short tandem repeat zzso within zzso 1 of zzso is an excellent marker for quantitative evaluation of zzso in tumor samples, whose zzso zzso zzso zzso products are analyzed and zzso on an automated DNA zzso The range of error was analyzed in zzso zzso zzso profiles were obtained following amplification of DNA from zzso cell samples of patients with zzso zzso By calculating zzso the relative zzso ratio of a tumor compared with healthy zzso a quantitative expression for the zzso is zzso zzso tumor DNA typing using fluorescent zzso zzso and automated analysis provides an enhanced level of accuracy and sensitivity required for routine analysis in clinical practice, where large numbers of tumor samples have to be zzso
