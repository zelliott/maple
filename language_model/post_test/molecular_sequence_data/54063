The regulation of crystal zzso by proteins is often observed in zzso It is a central feature in the formation of hard zzso such as bones, teeth and zzso zzso We have developed a genetic system in the zzso zzso coli to study the zzso control of crystal zzso We have used the zzso of gold as a model system and found zzso that control the zzso of the resulting gold zzso Analysis of the zzso process influenced by these zzso indicates they act zzso by an acid zzso Our results suggest that the concepts and methods of microbial zzso are general and can be applied to substances not commonly found in biological zzso
