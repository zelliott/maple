zzso disease is an zzso disease of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso of wheat zzso in genetically susceptible zzso zzso to zzso disease has been associated with the zzso defined zzso zzso and zzso of the class II zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Three related class II zzso each consisting of an alpha and a beta zzso chain, have been identified and are designated zzso zzso and zzso These highly zzso zzso proteins bind peptides derived from the processing of foreign zzso and present them to T zzso they also influence the specificity of the mature zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso in zzso has not been as fully explored as that of the other class II zzso because of the complexity of the primed zzso typing zzso method for determining zzso zzso Here we use a new zzso method of zzso typing to zzso the distribution of zzso beta zzso in a group of zzso disease patients and healthy zzso Two specific zzso beta zzso zzso and zzso are increased in the patient zzso zzso of the zzso beta sequences suggests that the zzso zzso at position 69 and at 56 and 57 may be critical in zzso zzso Further, the contribution of the susceptible zzso beta zzso appears to be independent of linkage to the previously reported zzso and zzso markers for zzso zzso The distribution of zzso alpha and beta zzso in patients suggests that a specific zzso zzso may be responsible for the observed DR zzso zzso with both this zzso zzso and a specific zzso beta zzso are at increased risk for zzso zzso
