Four zzso moderately zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the internal tissue of zzso root and their zzso positions were investigated by using a zzso zzso zzso of the four strains were zzso zzso short zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strains zzso and zzso formed one cluster and strains zzso and zzso formed another separate cluster within the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities with type strains of other zzso species were less than 97 zzso zzso of zzso zzso among the four strains showed that strains zzso and zzso and strains zzso and zzso belonged to two separate zzso the mean level of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was only zzso zzso Their zzso and zzso properties supported the view that the two strains represent two different novel species of the zzso zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed the zzso type zzso zzso The lipids present in strains zzso and zzso were zzso zzso a minor amount of zzso and two unknown zzso Their zzso respiratory zzso was zzso The fatty acid profiles of the four novel strains contained large quantities of zzso and saturated fatty zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso alcohol zzso zzso in zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso in zzso On the basis of their zzso properties and zzso zzso two novel species of the zzso zzso are proposed, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
