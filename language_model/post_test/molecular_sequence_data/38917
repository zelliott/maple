The mechanisms by which the zzso zzso zzso gene responds to zzso acid zzso and zzso stress have been zzso zzso show that during late zzso zzso expression in zzso is independent of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso applied zzso significantly enhances zzso zzso zzso zzso using particle zzso show that the zzso zzso element on the zzso promoter is responsible for the induction of zzso expression by zzso We further show that zzso zzso the expression of zzso via the interaction between zzso and one of its binding zzso zzso zzso binding factor zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso stress zzso zzso expression through two alternate signal zzso zzso an zzso signaling zzso leading to the interaction between the zzso motif and zzso and a zzso via the interaction of zzso and zzso zzso binding factor 2) that is independent of zzso The data presented clearly suggest that hydrogen zzso zzso plays an important zzso role in the zzso signal zzso zzso leading to the induction of the zzso zzso
