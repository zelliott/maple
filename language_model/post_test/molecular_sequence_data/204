Due to increasing antibiotics resistance, zzso peptides zzso are receiving increased zzso zzso zzso is a major pathogen in this context, involved, zzso in zzso and wound zzso Novel zzso agents against this pathogen are therefore zzso 

zzso potency was monitored by zzso zzso viable count, and minimal zzso concentration zzso while toxicity was zzso by zzso zzso information was obtained from zzso on zzso zzso disruption and zzso zzso 

zzso by zzso zzso acids yields increased potency of zzso against zzso zzso irrespective of bacterial zzso zzso zzso this by two peptides from zzso zzso and zzso potency increased with tag zzso zzso to more efficient bacterial wall and zzso zzso and to more pronounced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effects remained at high zzso concentration and in the presence of plasma or zzso zzso zzso The zzso peptides displayed stability against zzso zzso zzso and were potent ex zzso both in a contact lens model and in a skin wound zzso 

zzso without need for zzso synthesis zzso may be employed to enhance zzso potency against zzso zzso at maintained limited zzso
