zzso DNA of zzso zzso is organized in short zzso zzso each containing all regulatory sequences for autonomous replication and zzso In these organisms the zzso genes are not clustered but dispersed on different molecules of various zzso Two zzso zzso genes containing fragments, one of zzso zzso and one of zzso zzso were found in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and sequence data reveal that the two zzso pieces are derived from different zzso zzso Both zzso zzso genes code for the same protein of 103 zzso but differ greatly in their zzso zzso
