zzso disease zzso is a zzso disorder zzso by an absence of zzso cells in the nerve zzso of the lower zzso zzso zzso of the disease has been linked to zzso in genes that zzso the crucial signals for the development of the enteric nervous zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is involved in zzso and regulates zzso expression in mice, in which disruption of the zzso results in a zzso zzso 

To investigate the contribution of zzso to the zzso zzso 

Using zzso chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing, we screened zzso coding regions and zzso boundaries for zzso and zzso in 91 patients with zzso and 71 ethnically matched zzso zzso five zzso patients with no zzso zzso were independently zzso zzso and zzso zzso were compared using the standard case control zzso 

zzso analysis revealed three new zzso two novel single zzso zzso zzso zzso and a 15 base pair deletion zzso zzso significant differences were found for zzso zzso zzso zzso G were underrepresented in patients zzso v zzso zzso zzso and zzso v zzso zzso zzso for patients with no zzso zzso zzso linkage zzso zzso analysis revealed no zzso between physically close zzso indicating a hot spot for zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso Whether it directly contributes to disease zzso or represents a marker for a locus in zzso with zzso needs further zzso Our findings are in accordance with the involvement of zzso in the zzso pathways governing the development of enteric zzso
