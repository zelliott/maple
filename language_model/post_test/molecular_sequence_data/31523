In the vast majority of influenza A viruses characterized to date, zzso zzso is the zzso and fusion zzso whereas zzso zzso is a zzso protein that zzso viral release but is zzso for zzso However, the zzso of some recent human zzso zzso have acquired zzso activity via the zzso zzso although these zzso also appear to retain the ability to bind receptors via zzso We report here the laboratory generation of a zzso zzso that enables an zzso zzso to completely co-opt the zzso function normally performed by zzso zzso with this zzso zzso grow to high zzso even in the presence of extensive zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso When the zzso zzso is paired with this zzso zzso viral zzso and red blood cell zzso are blocked by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso particles expressing only the zzso zzso zzso red blood cells in an zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso zzso virus that we characterize is a laboratory creation, this same zzso is found in several natural clusters of zzso and H5N1 zzso Our results demonstrate that, at least in tissue culture, influenza virus zzso activity can be entirely shifted from zzso to zzso
