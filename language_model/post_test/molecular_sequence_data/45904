To determine whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to diabetes in South zzso 

South Asians zzso zzso zzso and Caucasians zzso zzso zzso living in zzso Worth, Texas, and South Asians living in zzso India zzso zzso zzso were enrolled for this zzso zzso zzso was determined using restriction zzso zzso zzso responsiveness to an oral zzso tolerance test zzso was measured in zzso zzso 

The Caucasian diabetic subjects had significantly lower prevalence of zzso zzso when compared with the Caucasian zzso subjects (20 zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, there were no significant differences between diabetic and zzso subjects with reference to the zzso zzso among the South Asians living in Dallas (20 zzso zzso and in India (19 zzso zzso Although Caucasians carrying zzso zzso had lower plasma insulin levels at 2 h of zzso than the zzso zzso carriers zzso zzso 68 and 54 zzso 33 zzso respectively, P zzso zzso no differences in either zzso or zzso plasma insulin zzso were found between South Asians carrying the zzso zzso zzso and those with the zzso zzso at either Chennai or zzso 

Although further replication studies are necessary to test the zzso of the described zzso relationship, our study supports the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso is protective against diabetes in Caucasians but not in South zzso
