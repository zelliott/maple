zzso heavy chain zzso expression was studied in rat zzso and zzso anterior zzso at the zzso and protein levels following zzso 8 and 32 zzso after zzso nerve zzso A zzso nerve crush or zzso injury was produced in the zzso region of adult female zzso zzso A zzso protection zzso was developed to measure four of the adult zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a single zzso zzso zzso and protein were measured and compared in the same zzso Eight and zzso weeks after a crush injury, the zzso zzso profiles were similar to control with the exception of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which were significantly less than control at both time zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso following a zzso nerve zzso injury resulted in an zzso zzso shift characterized by increases in the relative amounts of fast zzso zzso and zzso and a decrease in slow zzso As expected, significant changes first occurred at the zzso level followed by changes in protein zzso zzso weeks after zzso injury and repair, the primary zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was zzso zzso Moreover, at 32 zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in 50% of the zzso zzso following a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso following zzso nerve zzso led to replacement of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso
