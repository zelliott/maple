A clone containing an unusual zzso zzso gene was isolated from a soybean DNA library present in zzso 4A zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that the isolated zzso gene has three intervening sequences zzso zzso and zzso located in the same positions as those found in other zzso zzso Due to a large increase of zzso and zzso the isolated zzso gene is about twice the size of a normal zzso zzso The coding sequence derived from the DNA sequence zzso to no known soybean zzso and attempts to find a corresponding zzso zzso In addition, the zzso sequence of the zzso gene is zzso in two regions which seem to be important for zzso It is, therefore, tentatively suggested that the isolated zzso gene is zzso and consequently is an zzso zzso
