In a previous report zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso 33, zzso zzso methods were used to characterize the residual structure in delta 131 zzso a large zzso of zzso zzso that serves as a model zzso state under zzso zzso On the basis of a large number of missing zzso zzso for the zzso that form a zzso zzso beta sheet in the native state, it was concluded that this beta zzso may be highly populated in delta 131 zzso with severe line broadening due to relatively slow exchange between different zzso zzso In the present report, results from circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicate strands beta zzso 3 form a beta hairpin at zzso zzso below 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso from several zzso zzso adjacent to this beta hairpin disappear in concert with all of the beta zzso 3 zzso suggesting a local, non-native zzso interaction may help stabilize the beta zzso At zzso below 3 M, all zzso zzso from strand beta 1 in delta 131 delta also disappear, suggesting that beta 1 may combine with the beta zzso 3 hairpin to form a zzso beta zzso In addition, the zzso zzso alpha 2 decreases from approximately zzso population in 0 M zzso to approximately zzso at 6 M zzso whereas zzso alpha 1 goes from zzso populated in 0 M zzso to zzso in 6 M zzso zzso of a second, distinctly different zzso state, zzso zzso at pH zzso and low salt, reveals that this zzso zzso state is structurally similar to delta 131 delta at low zzso of zzso From these and previously published data, a zzso equilibrium folding zzso can be constructed for zzso zzso which describes the relative strengths and zzso of the zzso interactions involved in forming the native zzso
