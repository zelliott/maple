The zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso is composed of two distinct zzso alpha and zzso The alpha zzso zzso zzso specifically binds zzso with low zzso The beta zzso zzso zzso does not bind zzso by itself, but forms the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso beta has been revealed to be the zzso zzso zzso which is shared with receptors for zzso and zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated here the zzso of the functional receptors for zzso and human zzso on the mouse zzso cell line, zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso for zzso alpha and/or zzso Only zzso zzso expressing both zzso alpha and zzso expressed the zzso zzso and proliferated in response to zzso zzso Then zzso was zzso with the zzso for zzso alpha and/or zzso zzso zzso the human zzso of zzso Though beta c did not contribute much to binding affinity of zzso only zzso zzso expressing both zzso alpha and beta c proliferated in response to human zzso These results showed that the beta zzso is indispensable in zzso signal zzso We further investigated the function of zzso alpha zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which lacks its whole zzso domain, was zzso into mouse zzso cell line, zzso expressing zzso zzso The resulting zzso did not respond to zzso though the zzso expressed the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso portion of the alpha zzso also has some important role in zzso signal zzso
