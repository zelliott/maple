zzso zzso - rotary zzso machines - consist of two major parts, zzso and zzso connected by two zzso the central and the peripheral zzso In spinach zzso the central stalk zzso zzso zzso forms with the cylinder of zzso III the zzso and zzso zzso motive force from zzso to zzso inducing zzso changes of the zzso centers in zzso The zzso zzso is an important regulator affecting adjacent zzso as well as the activity of the whole protein zzso Using a combination of chemical zzso and mass zzso we monitored interactions of zzso zzso in spinach zzso zzso zzso with III and zzso zzso identification of interacting zzso in zzso zzso and III, one zzso defined the distance between zzso and zzso to be zzso A at zzso zzso was competitively zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso yields revealed the impact of zzso and zzso on zzso of zzso zzso The presence of zzso apparently induced a displacement of the zzso of zzso zzso which separated zzso from both, zzso and zzso zzso and thus decreasing the yield of the zzso zzso zzso and gamma as well as zzso and zzso However, increasing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso gamma instead of zzso indicating an approximation of zzso gamma and zzso and a separation from zzso
