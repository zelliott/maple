During an inflammation and upon encountering zzso immature zzso cells zzso undergo a maturation process to become highly efficient in presenting zzso This transition from immature to mature state is accompanied by various zzso functional and zzso changes including reduction of zzso activity and zzso of zzso in the mature zzso zzso are zzso zzso which play essential roles in zzso necrosis and zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso (a zzso protein of the zzso zzso which has been shown previously to inhibit zzso in DC, is a zzso of zzso Furthermore, we identified two putative zzso zzso zzso sites on the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso expression upon treatment with zzso inhibitor zzso immature DC treated with zzso exhibits lower zzso zzso Thus, our results highlight the role of zzso in regulating zzso expression and subsequently zzso during maturation of zzso
