There are two major zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso a beta zzso and zzso B, zzso a beta zzso The alpha zzso contains a single zzso chain, while the beta zzso is composed of two zzso chains zzso a and beta b) derived from a common zzso zzso The mature zzso like those of most zzso zzso are produced through the zzso processing of zzso once they enter the zzso In order to define the structure of the alpha and beta zzso generated in the zzso the zzso beta zzso and beta b zzso of zzso A and B were separated by a combination of molecular sieve and zzso exchange high performance liquid zzso and zzso sequences were zzso These were localized to the deduced zzso acid sequences of previously isolated zzso coding for the zzso and beta zzso From this analysis, the sites of zzso generating the mature zzso beta zzso and beta b chains from zzso A and B could be zzso First, the signal zzso required for processing of the zzso through the rough zzso zzso was predicted from the first zzso Met zzso on the zzso Second, zzso acid sequencing defined the zzso zzso of the mature zzso chains and identified the zzso removed from both the zzso and zzso zzso Third, an internal zzso resulted in the removal of a zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso chain of zzso A and B, respectively , to generate the beta b and beta a zzso This result localized the beta b and beta a chains to the zzso and zzso halves of the zzso zzso zzso Finally, we previously reported minimal or no zzso processing of the zzso chain in the zzso On the other hand, we suggest that there is trimming at the zzso zzso of the zzso chain based on comparison of molecular weights of zzso alpha with the isolated beta b and beta a chains zzso the mature beta zzso with those predicted from the zzso Thus, in the zzso the pro forms of zzso A and B undergo extensive zzso processing which, while specific in nature, has the appearance of removing easily accessible, zzso zzso rather than contributing to zzso maturation of zzso
