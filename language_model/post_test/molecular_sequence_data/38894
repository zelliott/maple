Using a zzso approach, we recently demonstrated that zzso peptides or zzso proteins specifically interact in zzso with two zzso proteins in crude extracts from zzso zzso The proteins were the folding zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso expressed exclusively in the zzso In this study, we explore the specificity of these proteins in binding peptides and related zzso and show that zzso and zzso zzso in peptides are the recognition motifs for their binding by zzso This zzso specificity may reflect the selectivity of zzso in binding regions of unfolded zzso during zzso of protein zzso
