zzso modifications to zzso are essential zzso zzso changes in gene expression that do not affect the DNA zzso zzso of zzso 9 in zzso zzso is recognized by zzso protein 1 zzso which directs the binding of other proteins to control zzso structure and gene zzso Here we show that zzso uses an zzso mechanism for recognition of this zzso as revealed by the structure of its zzso bound to a zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso of zzso zzso The binding pocket for the zzso groups is provided by three aromatic side zzso zzso zzso and zzso which reside in two regions that become ordered on binding of the zzso The side chain of zzso is almost fully extended and surrounded by zzso that are zzso in many other zzso The zzso zzso sequence preceding zzso makes most of the additional interactions with the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso appearing to be a major zzso of specificity by binding the key buried zzso These findings predict which other zzso will bind zzso proteins and suggest a motif that they zzso
