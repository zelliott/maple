To obtain zzso fusing gene of zzso tuberculosis zzso express the zzso fusing protein in zzso coli zzso zzso identify protein acquired, and predict the structure and function of the protein utilizing methods of zzso 

zzso and zzso gene were amplified from zzso of zzso zzso by zzso The zzso fusing gene zzso by zzso zzso was gained by means of Gene zzso by Overlapping Extension zzso zzso and fusing gene was cloned into expression zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso and expressed in zzso coli zzso The protein was identified by Western zzso using zzso zzso Secondary structure and zzso zzso of the protein were predicting using tools of zzso 

The DNA sequences of zzso were identical with that published by zzso The zzso fusion protein about 50 zzso comprised zzso zzso acids was efficiently produced from expression system in zzso coli zzso under the induction of zzso zzso analysis showed the protein contained one zzso region and zzso potential zzso zzso 

The zzso fusion protein is successfully expressed with zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that it exists as zzso inclusion bodies zzso The existence of zzso doesn't affect zzso of zzso and zzso It will allow for characterization in zzso and establish a foundation of further function research such as vaccine or diagnostic zzso
