The metal binding properties of peptides corresponding to zzso sites spanning regions that normally function as zzso in tandem zzso of zzso zzso proteins were zzso For a zzso with two His zzso from one zzso zinc finger domain, a zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso from an adjacent zinc domain, the zzso constant for the zzso zzso to zzso was found to be 15 zzso 10 zzso compared with 60 zzso for the corresponding zinc finger zzso zzso zzso overlapping two sets of zzso zzso from human zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso proteins were zzso In one case, the affinity of the presumed zzso domain and that for the zzso region were comparable, while in the second case, the affinity of the zzso zzso was higher than that for the corresponding presumed zzso domain zzso These studies revealed that zzso affinities in the zzso range can occur even for peptides that do not zzso to natural zzso zzso and that the degree of distinction between authentic zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso peptides may be modest, at least for single domain zzso zzso
