We describe a scheme for tagging an zzso zzso with a zzso and a zzso to measure unfolding zzso The enhancement in zzso relaxation rate of the zzso due to the presence of zzso was measured at zzso temperatures by zzso electron spin resonance zzso The change in relaxation rate provided the average zzso distance between the zzso and the zzso Control experiments on a zzso zzso verify the zzso of the zzso The change in zzso distances with temperature for the zzso zzso is in zzso with the change in zzso measured by circular zzso The data provide an opportunity to examine the unfolding process in zzso zzso The distance in the folded state is in zzso with molecular zzso However, the zzso experiment measures an average distance of 17 A in the unfolded state, whereas molecular dynamics indicates a distance of 42 A if the unfolded geometry was a zzso type II zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that the unfolded state of this zzso zzso is not an ideal extended zzso type II zzso
