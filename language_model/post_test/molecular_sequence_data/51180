zzso fraction I zzso zzso and fraction II zzso zzso were isolated by zzso zzso The zzso chains of the two zzso were zzso after reduction, by zzso high performance liquid zzso The zzso acid compositions of the B beta and zzso chains of zzso II were identical with those of zzso zzso In contrast, the A alpha chains of zzso II were composed of two zzso one zzso zzso intact A alpha chains and the other consisting of heterogeneous, deficient A alpha chains (A zzso zzso of lengths varying according to the sizes of their zzso zzso The zzso ratio of the A alpha to the A zzso chains in zzso II was zzso The zzso acid composition and sequence analyses of the zzso peptides derived from the A zzso chains revealed that the zzso zzso of the A zzso chains were mainly zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that the zzso II zzso is zzso and can be represented by the formula (A zzso (A zzso zzso and that zzso II cannot be a zzso degradation product of zzso zzso
