The product of the human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso DNA binding zzso Here, we demonstrate that the placement of the specific zzso DNA binding site zzso upstream of a zzso reporter gene zzso zzso expression that was inhibited by the zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso It was observed that zzso was zzso in zzso within the zzso domain at zzso and zzso Replacement of these zzso sites with Ala zzso caused a marked decrease in zzso reporter gene zzso In contrast, the replacement of zzso or zzso with an zzso zzso zzso caused only a small zzso of zzso Together, these data demonstrate that the zzso zzso sites zzso and zzso are required for high levels of zzso of gene expression by zzso
