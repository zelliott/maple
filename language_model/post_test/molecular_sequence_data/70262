Three zzso of the zzso potato gene zzso zzso present in the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso variety were isolated and zzso For one zzso zzso zzso the complete molecular structure was determined by sequence analysis and comparison with its zzso while for the other two zzso zzso zzso only partial sequences of regulatory and coding regions were zzso All three zzso showed (except for one zzso acid exchange in zzso identical sequences in the coding zzso While sequence variation was observed within the respective promoters starting some 300 zzso upstream of the putative zzso start site, the 3' terminal promoter sequences were highly zzso Within this region, a sequence of 81 zzso was identified which showed zzso sequence identity to a corresponding sequence in the zzso zzso This region which contains a putative serum response element was previously shown to regulate the expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso patterns for the three zzso in transgenic potato lines expressing zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso activity was predominantly located in petals and zzso as expected for the activity of a zzso zzso but a significant level of expression was also detected in the zzso wall and in the vascular zzso supporting zzso and zzso The promoters were also active in zzso structures at the junction of flower stem and zzso as well as in zzso zzso
