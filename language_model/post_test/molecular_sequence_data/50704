zzso zzso zzso is a zzso devastating zzso zzso disorder in humans associated with deficient zzso A zzso However, clinically normal individuals described as being zzso deficient also demonstrate the same zzso zzso they may be zzso for the zzso zzso zzso with 2 zzso transitions in the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso with one zzso and one zzso zzso Using as examples 2 families in which the zzso zzso condition occurs either independently or together with zzso we demonstrate the utility of a proposed diagnostic protocol to provide complete zzso identification of individuals suffering from zzso A zzso Patient zzso are extracted for DNA and a zzso zzso which is used for zzso A zzso zzso This will identify an zzso zzso group, which is further analyzed zzso zzso from the clinically affected patients with zzso are completely deficient in zzso A activity, whereas those from the zzso individuals demonstrate a characteristic residual zzso A activity zzso only after zzso Within this zzso group, gene amplification of DNA specific for the zzso zzso will distinguish between those who are zzso for the zzso zzso and those who are compound zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso This protocol of complete zzso identification requires only about zzso zzso (1 zzso 100 zzso zzso and 2 days to zzso Such zzso zzso identification increases accuracy and zzso value of the zzso It will likely become the preferred choice for diagnosis of genetic disease in the future as more zzso zzso are identified at the molecular zzso
