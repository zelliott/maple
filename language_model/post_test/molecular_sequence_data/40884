The paper reports a study on the role of zzso behind peak zzso zzso peak splitting and even peak zzso during the zzso of a zzso at highly overloaded conditions in zzso zzso zzso of component zzso is not uncommon in zzso There are reports which discuss their zzso but mostly at zzso scale, while their occurrence is quite common also in the zzso scale, as in the case discussed in this zzso This paper first describes the conditions leading to peak splitting and peak disappearance of an industrial zzso then explains the plausible reasons behind such zzso and finally with experimental analysis demonstrates the role of zzso in causing such zzso
