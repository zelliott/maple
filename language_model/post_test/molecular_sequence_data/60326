Many studies have convincingly shown that survivors of zzso zzso have impaired zzso activity because of increased zzso of plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso A single zzso zzso zzso in the promoter region of the zzso zzso commonly called zzso has been shown to be associated with plasma zzso zzso Our aim was to develop and validate a homogeneous zzso for rapid zzso of the zzso zzso 

In this report we present a zzso method for zzso of the zzso zzso that combines both zzso zzso with real-time monitoring of the amplification process and generation of zzso fluorescent probe melting profiles on the zzso Two zzso labeled zzso zzso recognizing adjacent sequences in the zzso were present in the reaction zzso The shorter detection probe spanned the zzso site, perfectly matching the zzso zzso After zzso the zzso were in resonance energy transfer, providing real-time monitoring of the amplification zzso At the completion of the zzso zzso was monitored as the temperature increased through the zzso of the zzso duplex, and a characteristic melting profile for each zzso was zzso 

With this method, 32 samples were zzso within 30 zzso without the need of any zzso sample zzso The zzso of 100 DNA samples determined with the zzso were identical to those obtained with conventional zzso and restriction zzso length zzso 

The zzso of the zzso zzso with the zzso is a zzso reliable method that is suitable for typing both small and large numbers of zzso
