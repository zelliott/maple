In cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso form large zzso clusters at zzso zzso and small clusters outside zzso zzso We now show that a pool of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are also present at the cell zzso We also demonstrate that zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso expressed in these zzso assemble with zzso zzso forming zzso zzso that target large zzso zzso small clusters outside zzso zzso or a pool of zzso surface zzso zzso In contrast, zzso or zzso delta zzso only form zzso zzso zzso which can be induced to form clusters by zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso possessing the large zzso loop zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso assembled into zzso zzso but it did not form zzso therefore behaving like the delta zzso Thus, the large zzso zzso of zzso and delta play an important role in determining the synaptic zzso capacity of the zzso zzso
