To obtain a reliable molecular probe to trace the origin of germ cell lineages in birds, we isolated a chicken zzso zzso to zzso gene zzso which plays an essential role in zzso formation in zzso We demonstrate the zzso expression of zzso protein throughout all stages of zzso zzso analyses using specific zzso raised against zzso protein indicated that zzso protein was localized in zzso of germ cells ranging from zzso primordial germ cells zzso in zzso zzso to zzso and zzso in adult zzso During the early zzso zzso protein was zzso localized in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso About 30 zzso cells were scattered in the central zone of the area zzso at stage X, later zzso cells were found in the zzso layer and subsequently zzso positive cells were found zzso in the zzso zzso due to zzso zzso Furthermore, in the zzso zzso protein was predominantly localized in zzso structures surrounding the zzso cloud and zzso zzso structure, indicating that the zzso zzso structure is the zzso germ zzso in the zzso These results strongly suggest that the chicken zzso is determined by zzso inherited factors in the germ zzso
