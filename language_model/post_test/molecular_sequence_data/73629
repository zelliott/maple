zzso is a protein zzso that is required for zzso transition and initiation of DNA replication in zzso zzso The mechanisms zzso zzso and its zzso exerts their effects are zzso We report here the characterization in zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in a member of the zzso family, zzso which zzso the requirement for zzso and its interacting factor zzso Because the zzso family of zzso zzso proteins have been implicated in restricting DNA replication to once per cell cycle, our studies suggest that zzso is required late in zzso because in its absence the zzso blocks the initiation of DNA zzso Moreover, zzso may have both positive and negative effects on the ability of cell to initiate zzso
