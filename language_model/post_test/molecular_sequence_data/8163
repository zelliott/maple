zzso I zzso of zzso zzso has two functional zzso a zzso core domain and a cellulose binding domain zzso The structure of the zzso reveals two distinct faces, one of which is flat and the other zzso Several other zzso zzso zzso have similar zzso structures, in which the zzso show a zzso primary zzso Here we have evaluated the contributions of zzso zzso acids in zzso zzso to its binding to zzso zzso zzso were determined for a set of six synthetic zzso in which zzso zzso acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to assess the structural effects of the zzso by comparing chemical shifts, zzso constants, and zzso of the backbone zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso In general, the structural effects of the zzso were minor, although in some cases decreased binding could clearly be ascribed to zzso zzso We found that at least two zzso zzso and a zzso zzso on the flat face were essential for tight binding of the zzso to zzso A change on the rough face had only a small effect on the binding and it is unlikely that this face interacts with cellulose zzso
