A unique zzso of zzso zzso was recently identified in zzso In contrast to the most closely related pumps in animals, plasma zzso zzso members of this new zzso are distinguished by a zzso zzso located at the zzso instead of a zzso zzso In addition, at least some zzso appear to reside in zzso membrane zzso To begin zzso their functions, we investigated the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso in zzso Here we provide evidence that zzso resides in the zzso zzso zzso In buoyant density zzso zzso performed with and without zzso zzso zzso with an zzso membrane marker and a typical zzso zzso zzso To zzso its zzso zzso zzso was zzso with a green zzso protein at its C zzso zzso and expressed in transgenic zzso We collected zzso images from live root cells using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared as a fluorescent zzso consistent with an zzso zzso In addition, we observed strong zzso around the zzso of mature zzso cells, which is consistent with the hypothesis that zzso may also function in the nuclear zzso An zzso location makes zzso distinct from all other zzso pumps identified in plants or zzso
