The zzso translation initiation factor zzso exists in a varying number of zzso forms in different zzso In zzso coli three natural forms exist, zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso gamma differing only in the zzso zzso beta and zzso gamma lack 158 and 165 zzso acid zzso respectively, as compared to zzso zzso We have earlier shown that the smaller forms of zzso are not the result of a specific zzso of zzso zzso but produced from individual translation initiation sites in the zzso However it has not been known whether the expression in zzso coli of zzso beta and zzso gamma is dependent on or related to a zzso processing of the zzso zzso zzso containing zzso the gene for zzso Here we have used zzso mapping to study the existence of such zzso processing in the region between the initiation sites for zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso The results show a zzso E zzso site at position zzso in the zzso zzso between the translation initiation zzso However, studies of the zzso of the different forms of zzso show that the relative expression of zzso alpha and zzso zzso gamma is independent of zzso E zzso Thus zzso coli exhibits a true tandem translation of intact zzso zzso with multiple zzso translation initiation sites resulting in gene products of different zzso An additional observation is a significant increase in the level of zzso of zzso in cells devoid of zzso E zzso We conclude that due to lack of zzso E activity, the amount of zzso zzso zzso available for translation is zzso resulting in an elevated amount of zzso zzso This observation may have a more general application within the field of zzso protein production and expression zzso
