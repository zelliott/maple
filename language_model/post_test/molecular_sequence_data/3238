To design zzso drugs, it is useful to know the affinities the protein has for its natural zzso under zzso zzso zzso equilibrium zzso are reported for seven zzso zzso bound to the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso include zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the major packaging domain of zzso zzso The binding zzso is based on zzso the zzso of zzso in the protein by G zzso in the zzso zzso zzso bound zzso molecules zzso nearly all the zzso of freshly zzso zzso in zzso M zzso In contrast, when the zzso of zzso zzso is replaced with zzso or zzso zzso is almost zzso indicating very low zzso Interpreting zzso zzso in terms of a rapidly zzso zzso complex explains nearly all of the experimental zzso for the zzso zzso in this way, the highest affinities are for zzso zzso and zzso zzso hairpin zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso 3 and 23 zzso 2 zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso have zzso of the affinity for zzso relative to zzso zzso relative to zzso for the other zzso are the zzso zzso for a zzso construct to model zzso zzso for a zzso model of the zzso zzso loop of zzso and zzso for a zzso model of a 1 zzso 3 zzso internal loop in zzso A zzso construct that includes all four zzso binds tightly to zzso with the equivalent of three zzso molecules bound with high affinity per zzso it is also possible that two strong sites and several weaker ones combine to give the appearance of three strong zzso
