The maternal effect gene zzso is involved in the establishment of segments and the zzso of their zzso the progeny of zzso females are missing portions of zzso and abdominal zzso and may have zzso transformations of third zzso segments to second zzso zzso The zzso locus interacts zzso with zzso such as zzso and zzso in the production of zzso zzso We have characterized zzso clones corresponding to the major zzso transcripts expressed in zzso and early zzso and to a zzso zzso The expression of zzso transcripts in zzso is restricted to the zzso in developing zzso transcripts are found throughout the zzso The different zzso transcripts zzso and zzso zzso are generated by use of alternative zzso and zzso zzso These transcripts zzso two large predicted proteins of 110 and 205 zzso that have unusual zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso are zzso zzso or zzso and there are several regions of zzso and simple sequence zzso zzso analysis indicates that these proteins span the zzso We suggest that the expression of zzso proteins in the membrane of the zzso is required for proper functioning of genes such as zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso
