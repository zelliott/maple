The female zzso zzso lacks a zzso or zzso center in many zzso During cell division, these zzso are organized by the zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies in zzso zzso implicated at least one zzso motor zzso zzso in tapering the zzso into a bipolar zzso We have identified a second zzso zzso zzso zzso that is required for zzso zzso zzso At zzso I in males and zzso zzso zzso affect only the segregation of zzso zzso In female zzso zzso zzso have a similar zzso to zzso even though zzso are joined by zzso they fail to segregate at zzso zzso zzso analyses have revealed that zzso is required for bipolar zzso zzso In zzso zzso we observed zzso that were zzso zzso or frayed with no defined zzso On the basis of these zzso and the observation that zzso zzso genetically interact with zzso we propose that zzso is one member of a group of zzso proteins required for bipolar zzso assembly in the absence of the zzso zzso is also required for the early embryonic divisions but is otherwise zzso for most zzso zzso
