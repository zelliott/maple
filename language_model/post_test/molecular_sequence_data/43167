The highly specific and sensitive zzso provides the basis for zzso sites zzso unique landmarks that have been used widely in the construction of genetic and physical maps of the human zzso Electronic zzso zzso refers to the process of recovering these unique sites in DNA sequences by searching for zzso that closely match the zzso zzso and have the correct order, orientation, and spacing that they could zzso prime the amplification of a zzso product of the correct molecular zzso A software tool was developed to provide an efficient zzso of this search strategy and allow the sort of en masse searching that is required for modern zzso zzso Some sample searches were performed to demonstrate a number of factors that can affect the likelihood of obtaining a zzso Analysis of one large sequence database record revealed the presence of several zzso and zzso markers and allowed the exact zzso distances among them to be zzso This example provides a demonstration of how zzso can be used to integrate the growing body of zzso sequence data with existing zzso reveal relationships among markers that existed previously on different zzso and correlate genetic distances with physical zzso
