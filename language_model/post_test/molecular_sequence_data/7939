The zzso zzso of zzso zzso does not zzso any identifiable zzso Instead, zzso zzso are zzso in the nucleus and subsequently imported into zzso In order to zzso the signals which target the zzso into the zzso an in zzso import system has been developed: zzso zzso were expressed zzso and their import into zzso assessed by zzso and zzso treatment of the zzso zzso Three zzso genes were tested in this system: zzso a zzso version of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso a human zzso zzso The zzso were expressed in their own zzso context, or containing various lengths of the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso In all cases efficient import of each of the zzso was zzso We independently confirmed the zzso import of the zzso zzso since in zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso was inhibited by zzso a highly specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in their own zzso contexts supports the conclusion that no specific targeting signals are necessary to import zzso into zzso of zzso zzso but rather that the zzso structure itself is sufficient to specify zzso
