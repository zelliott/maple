zzso is a zzso member of the zzso family of zzso zzso There is compelling genetic evidence that zzso zzso are needed for zzso proliferation and zzso in the developing zzso zzso However, the role of zzso zzso is not fully zzso and zzso knockout mice display normal zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso specifically lacking zzso zzso or zzso display compromised development of breeding zzso zzso zzso which according to our analyses display more advanced zzso and zzso than regular zzso including continuous zzso and renewal of superficial cells by derivatives of zzso zzso zzso are further enhanced in zzso double zzso pointing to partially redundant roles of the two related zzso zzso zzso treatments with chemical zzso and zzso studies further reveal the existence of a linear zzso 3 zzso required both for enhanced proliferation of zzso at the base of the zzso and their subsequent differentiation in upper zzso Together, these studies identify the zzso breeding zzso as specific zzso structures sharing crucial features with the zzso zzso zzso In addition, they unravel essential roles of zzso and zzso to promote both zzso proliferation and their terminal differentiation by promoting zzso zzso and zzso 3 activity, ensuring formation and proper zzso of this zzso zzso zzso
