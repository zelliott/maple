zzso belong to the family zzso and are maintained in wild zzso Although zzso E6 cells, which originate from African green monkey zzso are used widely in zzso research, isolation of zzso from this cell line is zzso To develop an efficient method of propagation and isolation of zzso we established a novel cell line, zzso derived from the kidney of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the natural host of zzso virus zzso The zzso cells showed a significantly higher zzso to zzso virus zzso hosted by zzso zzso than zzso E6 zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso cells was detected earlier than in zzso E6 cells, and the viral zzso in the culture fluid of zzso cells was higher than that of zzso E6 cells during the early phase of zzso In contrast, zzso cells showed no zzso to zzso zzso zzso which has not been isolated to date, was isolated successfully using zzso zzso Moreover, the newly isolated zzso was successfully zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of the S zzso M zzso and L zzso segment sequences revealed that zzso is related most closely to zzso but is distinct from other zzso These data suggest that the zzso cell line is a useful tool for the isolation and propagation of zzso Moreover, this is (to our zzso the first report of zzso isolation in a cell line that originated from the natural zzso
