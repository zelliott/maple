A zzso zzso mouse zzso growth factor zzso zzso has been cloned by zzso based on the screening result from the database of expressed sequence zzso zzso its gene was cloned from a mouse zzso bacterial artificial zzso library using the zzso as a zzso zzso analysis revealed that mouse zzso protein deduced from the zzso similar to its human and rat counterparts, has two zzso growth zzso zzso type 1 and 2 zzso zzso zzso a single zzso domain and a zzso domain of zzso zzso and the gene consists of 14 zzso spanning approximately zzso zzso Interestingly, mouse zzso zzso was detected not only in the liver but also in the gastrointestinal tract by zzso zzso zzso Since zzso growth factor zzso is zzso in the damaged gastrointestinal zzso our present data suggest that zzso might activate zzso directly in the gastrointestinal zzso and play an important role in wound repair throughout the gastrointestinal zzso
