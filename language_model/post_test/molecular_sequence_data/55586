zzso zzso acids are transported from blood into brain by a zzso carrier at the zzso barrier zzso The transport properties of this carrier were examined in the rat using an in zzso brain zzso zzso zzso into brain via this system was found to be sodium independent and followed zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso transport rates of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso The kinetic properties matched that of System zzso the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso the zzso for which has been cloned from the zzso To determine if the cloned zzso is expressed at the zzso we zzso zzso from rat cerebral zzso and zzso zzso for the presence of the cloned zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso was present in both cerebral zzso and zzso zzso and was enriched in zzso zzso as compared with whole zzso The results indicate that System zzso is present at the zzso and that its zzso is more densely expressed at cerebral zzso than in whole zzso
