zzso zzso was used to identify sequences of zzso zzso DNA which might be of diagnostic zzso zzso DNA from zzso zzso isolated commonly from cattle and whose zzso is used in the comparative zzso zzso test, was zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso A novel zzso of 131 zzso which appears to be zzso tuberculosis zzso was zzso The specificity of this sequence was zzso tested by a probe and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso identity determination and sequence comparisons revealed that the zzso sequence is located directly upstream of a potential zzso zzso zzso coding gene and may be of diagnostic value, enabling differentiation of zzso tuberculosis complex zzso from other zzso zzso
