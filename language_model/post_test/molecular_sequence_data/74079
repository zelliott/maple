Few genes in the divergent zzso zzso zzso have zzso despite the unusually large gene repertoire of this zzso zzso These zzso are characterized by extended zzso regulatory motifs at the zzso and 3' zzso a feature shared with another divergent zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso This unusual characteristic of zzso zzso zzso led us to examine zzso small nuclear zzso zzso predicted to mediate zzso reactions via interaction with zzso zzso Here we identify zzso zzso zzso U2, zzso zzso and zzso zzso present predictions of their secondary structures, and provide evidence for interaction between the zzso zzso complex and a zzso zzso zzso zzso models predict that zzso zzso zzso contain zzso sequences and motifs similar to those found in other examined zzso These data indicate that mechanisms of zzso recognition as well as coordination of the two zzso steps of zzso have been zzso throughout zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso lack the zzso zzso cap typical of zzso and appear to possess unmodified zzso zzso Despite the lack of a cap structure, zzso U2, zzso and zzso genes are transcribed by zzso zzso II, whereas the zzso gene is transcribed by zzso zzso zzso
