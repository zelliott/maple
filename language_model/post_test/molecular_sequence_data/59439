The zzso zzso and zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso exhibit distinct zzso zzso values for zzso transport of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and patterns of zzso transport zzso is capable of zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso Thomas, zzso zzso Jess, zzso zzso & Bell, zzso zzso (1991) zzso 30, zzso We have generated a range of zzso zzso zzso composed of regions of zzso and zzso with a view to identifying the regions of the zzso which are involved in zzso recognition and zzso The functional characteristics of these zzso were determined by expression in zzso zzso after zzso of zzso Replacement of the region from the start of putative zzso zzso 7 to the zzso of zzso with the corresponding region from zzso results in a zzso with the ability to transport zzso and exhibits a zzso for zzso transport of close to that observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso Replacement of the region in zzso from the end of zzso 7 to the zzso with the corresponding region from zzso resulted in a species which was unable to transport zzso and whose zzso for zzso was indistinguishable from zzso zzso We have determined the affinity for zzso zzso and zzso of these and other zzso In addition, the Ki for zzso a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso which binds to the zzso sugar binding site was determined for these zzso The results obtained support a model in which the seventh putative zzso zzso is intimately involved in the selection of transported zzso and in which this region plays an important role in determining the zzso for zzso Additional data is presented which suggests that a region between the end of putative zzso zzso 7 and the end of zzso 10, together with sequences in the zzso half of the protein may also participate in zzso recognition and transport zzso
