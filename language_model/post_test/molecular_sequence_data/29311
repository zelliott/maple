For most imprinted zzso a difference in expression between the maternal and paternal zzso is associated with a corresponding difference in DNA zzso that is localized to a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso of a zzso zzso leads to a loss of zzso These observations suggest that zzso have a zzso role in zzso zzso To examine this possibility, we introduced sequences from the zzso of the imprinted zzso zzso and zzso genes into a zzso zzso of the normally imprinted zzso zzso created by zzso its own zzso zzso zzso with sequences from the zzso zzso were consistently zzso with the maternal zzso being more zzso than the paternal zzso Only the repeated sequences within zzso were required for zzso these zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso sequences and ones containing sequences from the long terminal repeat of a zzso zzso A particle zzso were not zzso The zzso hybrid zzso are comprised entirely of mouse zzso DNA and behave as zzso imprinted genes in zzso zzso and zzso mouse zzso These types of hybrid zzso can be used to zzso the functions of zzso sequences in zzso zzso
