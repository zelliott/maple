zzso removal in nuclear precursor zzso is zzso through two zzso reactions by a zzso zzso machine called the zzso A complex between U2 and zzso small nuclear zzso is a core component of the zzso Here we present an zzso structural analysis of a zzso zzso complex from zzso zzso The observed folding of the zzso complex is a zzso zzso in which the zzso important zzso zzso zzso only within zzso and not with zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso extends the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso structure of this extended zzso zzso reveals structural similarities with domain 5 of group II zzso zzso The observed zzso of the zzso junction could be relevant to the first, but not the second, step of zzso and may help to position the zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso
