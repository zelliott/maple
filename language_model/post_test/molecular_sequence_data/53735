The isolation and functional characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is reported zzso The gene encodes a protein of 840 zzso acids that exhibits high levels of similarity in zzso size, and structural and functional zzso to a group of known zzso zzso of zzso The zzso gene is able to functionally complement the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of two zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the putative zzso site abolish this zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso of growth and a highly zzso zzso in a significant fraction of cells under conditions that normally support zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso has a role in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso
