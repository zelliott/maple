zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes the canine pancreatic zzso zzso revealed the primary structure of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso defining the primary zzso unit, which is organized into three zzso zzso and 130 zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 encodes the zzso signal zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso region zzso at the zzso zzso of the mature zzso zzso 2 encodes zzso zzso zzso and zzso likely to be involved in binding of pancreatic zzso to zzso at the zzso zzso zzso 3 encodes the zzso sequence zzso that is essential for binding the central tightly structured zzso region of the zzso to zzso Southern zzso analysis was consistent with the presence of a zzso zzso gene and a potential zzso gene zzso Among 16 zzso examined by Northern zzso analysis, zzso expression was detected only in zzso zzso contained in nuclear extracts prepared from dog zzso zzso two regions of zzso I protection zzso for both coding and zzso strands zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the coding zzso Competition gel mobility shift experiments indicated that zzso interactions that occur at zzso sites I and II are zzso and zzso and unrelated to the zzso sequence described in the zzso region of the rat zzso B gene zzso zzso zzso zzso Meister, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Genes & zzso 4, zzso Nuclear extracts from zzso and brain, but not liver, contain similar zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent zzso elements that may participate as additional promoter regions in regulated expression of the zzso zzso zzso contains a central zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a zzso region on the zzso strand zzso zzso zzso that is similar zzso zzso to the zzso zzso
