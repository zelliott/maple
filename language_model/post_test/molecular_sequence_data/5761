The zzso family of proteins is subdivided into two major groups: the main type zzso which are zzso in coordination with DNA replication during the zzso of the cell cycle, and the replacement zzso which can be zzso in the absence of DNA replication substituting main type zzso zzso zzso of replacement zzso zzso has been observed in several terminally differentiated zzso that have stopped cell zzso The replacement zzso of the zzso class is termed zzso This protein is zzso by two different genes zzso and zzso that both code for the same zzso acid zzso but differ in zzso sequences and gene zzso This has been shown for human and avian zzso and zzso genes and for a zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to define patterns of replacement zzso zzso gene expression during male germ cell zzso we have constructed mouse zzso zzso libraries and have isolated zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso specific for these two different genes we show by zzso protection analysis and by zzso in zzso zzso with zzso sections that zzso zzso is present in zzso and zzso cells, whereas expression of the zzso gene is essentially restricted to cells of the zzso zzso
