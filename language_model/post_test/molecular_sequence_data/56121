In order to characterize the interaction of human complement with zzso zzso flow zzso was used to zzso binding of complement component zzso to elementary bodies of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in fresh serum in the presence or absence of human zzso zzso zzso Isolation of each of the complement zzso pathways revealed that zzso was activated most effectively by the alternative zzso The degree of binding by the classical zzso was zzso to the concentration of zzso but zzso binding was not greater than zzso alternative zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso outer membrane zzso complexes indicated that the zzso major outer membrane protein was the primary cell surface zzso binding zzso in both the presence and absence of specific zzso zzso zzso of outer membrane zzso complexes provided evidence that the majority of zzso is bound to the major outer membrane protein by zzso zzso zzso This result was also unchanged by the presence of specific zzso An unexpected finding was the apparent binding of zzso zzso to a zzso protein of the zzso outer membrane complex, perhaps indicating zzso mimicry on the part of the zzso major outer membrane zzso
