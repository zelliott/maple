We have used zzso screening with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso to isolate a zzso zzso zzso from human zzso This zzso which encodes a zzso zzso is 59% identical at the zzso acid level to zzso and has a similar number and arrangement of predicted zzso zzso It also shares significant sequence identity with other zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis suggests strong expression of zzso in zzso but, unlike zzso no significant expression in zzso We have been unable to demonstrate definitive transport of any of a number of zzso (including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso although sequence conservation makes it likely that zzso represents another member of the zzso zzso family, possibly a second zzso zzso
