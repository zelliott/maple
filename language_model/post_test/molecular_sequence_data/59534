The zzso zzso zzso Type zzso zzso zzso resistance to many zzso antibiotics by zzso zzso of their zzso zzso The chemical mechanism of zzso transfer is zzso Based on sequence zzso it has been suggested that a zzso His zzso zzso could be zzso by zzso and this zzso would transfer the zzso to the incoming zzso We have used chemical zzso zzso zzso and zzso isotope exchange methods to probe the mechanism of zzso transfer by zzso 

Chemical modification by zzso implicated His in zzso zzso by zzso We prepared His zzso Ala zzso of all four His zzso in zzso and found minimal effects of the zzso on the zzso zzso of several zzso One of these zzso zzso was largely zzso when compared to the zzso zzso zzso isotope exchange experiments using zzso did not support a zzso zzso 

His zzso are not required for zzso zzso by zzso The zzso His 188 is thus not a zzso accepting zzso but does seem to be important for proper zzso zzso zzso isotope exchange experiments are consistent with direct attack of the zzso zzso group on the zzso of zzso
