Part of zzso virus zzso zzso zzso coding for the zzso zzso protein was cloned and zzso in two independent zzso The C gene of zzso virus is composed of 77 zzso both for the zzso and zzso zzso and is 48, 24, 33, 15, 3, and 3 zzso shorter than that of Venezuelan zzso zzso zzso zzso Forest, Ross River, zzso zzso and Eastern zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It contains 16 zzso changes in comparison with the zzso strain, four of which are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso charges, zzso profiles, and location of potential functional sites in C proteins of the zzso studied zzso have been zzso High positively charged zzso of the zzso is the most variable in all zzso and is characterized by an irregular secondary structure due to high Pro content zzso zzso charged zzso zzso of total) and zzso zzso of total) are presented 18 and 11 times, respectively, in the zzso of zzso virus zzso zzso and clusters zzso possibly form the initial sites for interaction with zzso Only zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso do not contain zzso while others do contain several zzso This part of C protein includes overlapping nuclear transport signals predicted for several cellular proteins and repeated 4, 7, and 2 times in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso There is a highly conservative region zzso as zzso in the C protein structure of all studied zzso which potentially binds to a large zzso zzso as it was shown for zzso virus by zzso et zzso (1992), and a consensus motif zzso could be a main part of the zzso zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso zzso is absolutely conservative for all zzso and with the zzso zzso could have a common function, including C protein lateral interaction zzso et zzso zzso The zzso of zzso virus C protein from zzso virus is confirmed by very high zzso similarity of this zzso C domain in the zzso pair and low zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of C gene and protein type in the zzso virus zzso might be useful in the differential identification of this virus zzso
