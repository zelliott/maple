Nuclear zzso DNA zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso sequences from artificial hybrids and zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were studied to assess the possible effects of concerted evolution in natural zzso F1 artificial hybrids show the expected pattern of additive zzso for five of the six variable sites as estimated from direct zzso However, homogenization of zzso is already observed in the zzso and is biased towards zzso zzso except for one zzso In zzso an expected tendency towards homogenization of zzso sites in the direction of the zzso parent is observed for five sites, although this does not necessarily imply concerted zzso zzso the sixth site appears to elude such a mechanism and thus provides additional support for the occurrence of biased concerted zzso Our findings are relevant to interpreting zzso patterns involving gene flow and are also consistent with the hypothesis of a hybrid origin of zzso zzso zzso zzso
