We have cloned and characterized the entire DNA zzso gene and zzso regions from zzso zzso zzso zzso and two closely related zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have also identified and partially characterized the corresponding zzso region of another zzso zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso with close similarity to zzso zzso zzso A sequence comparison of these four zzso viruses and two zzso zzso recently identified in African green zzso zzso zzso types 1 and 2 zzso and zzso reveals the presence of two distinct lineages of zzso zzso in Old World zzso The first zzso lineage consists of zzso and its closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso while the second more zzso related lineage consists of zzso zzso and zzso Our findings raise the possibility of the existence of another human zzso zzso belonging to the second zzso zzso
