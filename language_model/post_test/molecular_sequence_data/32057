The rare but clinically important zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso blood group systems are due to zzso in zzso and zzso zzso A recently identified zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso predicts the common zzso and zzso zzso but rare zzso have not been zzso 

The aim of this study was to analyze 84 zzso zzso zzso , and zzso zzso samples, with special emphasis on unknown zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Of these, 27 samples came from individuals not previously investigated genetically and were therefore subjected to sequencing of zzso or zzso and a subset was tested by flow zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso linked 20 zzso zzso in zzso to zzso or zzso zzso zzso Eight p zzso remain zzso due to compound zzso For 23 of 25 zzso samples, zzso results were zzso zzso zzso samples had at least one zzso zzso while zzso zzso had zzso zzso The two remaining samples typed as zzso and zzso but were genetically zzso zzso zzso A tendency toward higher zzso zzso expression was observed on zzso zzso cells compared to zzso zzso zzso In total, six previously unknown zzso zzso were found and characterized in zzso while four new changes were revealed in zzso 

For the first time, p zzso were shown to occur on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso predicted the zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso in more than zzso of zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso was increased by 50% and several zzso zzso were zzso
