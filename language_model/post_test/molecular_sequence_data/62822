zzso signals mediate a multitude of plant responses to external stimuli and regulate a wide range of zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso represent important zzso in plant calcium zzso These proteins form a complex network with their target zzso being the zzso protein zzso zzso Here, we present a comparative zzso analysis of the full complement of zzso and zzso in zzso and rice zzso zzso We confirm the expression and transcript composition of the 10 zzso and 25 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Our identification of 10 zzso and 30 zzso from rice indicates a similar complexity of this signaling network in both zzso An analysis of the zzso evolution suggests that the extant number of gene family members largely results from zzso zzso A zzso comparison of protein sequences and zzso positions indicates an early diversification of separate branches within both gene zzso These branches may represent proteins with different zzso zzso interaction analyses and expression studies of closely related family members suggest that even recently duplicated representatives may fulfill different zzso This work provides a basis for a defined further functional dissection of this important zzso signaling zzso
