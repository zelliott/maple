zzso are peptides of 24 zzso acid zzso originally isolated from the skin of the Oriental frog, zzso zzso zzso by nature of their zzso activity against a wide range of zzso and zzso bacteria and against strains of zzso zzso zzso libraries were constructed from zzso skin zzso of three, zzso species of Chinese frog, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using our recently developed zzso In this report, we describe the zzso cloning of novel zzso by means of zzso using a zzso zzso primer directed towards a highly zzso zzso acid sequence domain within the zzso region of previously characterized zzso skin zzso zzso Novel zzso deduced from cloned zzso zzso zzso were subsequently identified as mature peptides in the same samples of respective species skin zzso zzso analysis of both zzso zzso acid sequences and translated zzso frame zzso acid sequences revealed a highly zzso signal zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The experimental approach described here can thus rapidly provide robust structural data on skin zzso peptides without harming the donor zzso
