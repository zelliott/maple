zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso reduction of zzso by zzso to form zzso and zzso was zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso was very unstable but was stabilized by low zzso of various zzso such as zzso zzso The zzso was a zzso protein with the native molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed a single zzso peak at 280 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were excellent zzso and no measurable activity was observed with short chain zzso zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso was obviously different from those of zzso zzso zzso zzso so far zzso The zzso sequences of zzso zzso were identical with those in a hypothetical zzso acid protein from zzso zzso (the zzso zzso number zzso The gene corresponding to this protein was expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso protein was found to have zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed the same properties as those of native zzso zzso zzso zzso showed only low sequence identities with members of zzso zzso established to date; it shows the highest identity zzso with human zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso The elements of secondary structure of zzso zzso however, distributed similarly to those demonstrated in the three-dimensional structure of human zzso zzso except that loop A region is lost, and loop B region is zzso zzso acid zzso involved in zzso binding or zzso are also zzso Conservation of these features, together with the major zzso establish zzso zzso as the first member of a new zzso family, zzso
