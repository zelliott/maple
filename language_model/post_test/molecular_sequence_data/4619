The zzso specificity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso E from three different species has been studied using the method of automated zzso sequencing and a newly developed method for zzso sequencing of peptides and zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso sequencing of zzso pools is a fast and easy method to identify and compare the zzso specificity of zzso Our analysis shows a zzso zzso specificity between human, mouse and bovine zzso zzso with only small differences in fine zzso Furthermore, our results confirm and extend the rules governing the interactions of the zzso with the zzso acid zzso side chains of the various pockets within the zzso active zzso We found that the positions zzso the zzso zzso bond zzso are occupied exclusively by zzso zzso with both zzso or aromatic side zzso Val and zzso however, are not allowed in the zzso binding zzso The zzso and zzso zzso accept zzso zzso Additional requirements concerning the zzso to zzso zzso were also zzso Finally, the sequences of single peptides generated by zzso E from the three different species can be easily aligned to the determined zzso zzso showing the reliability of our pool sequencing zzso
