zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso involved in cellular cholesterol zzso and zzso zzso is an zzso zzso responding to its zzso cholesterol in a zzso zzso It is a zzso protein that spans the membrane multiple times, with its zzso 131 zzso zzso acids residing at the zzso side of the zzso zzso This region contains two closely linked putative zzso Our current studies show that this region contains a zzso zzso Adding this motif to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso converted the zzso zzso to a zzso fusion zzso zzso deleting this motif from the full-length zzso converted the zzso from a zzso to a zzso The zzso zzso remains zzso zzso Its zzso zzso including the zzso response to cholesterol, the zzso value toward a specific zzso zzso and sensitivity toward heat zzso are essentially zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso exhibits a zzso increase in the zzso of the overall reaction and a zzso increase in the zzso for zzso Thus, deleting the zzso motif near the zzso changes zzso from its zzso form to a zzso form and increases its zzso zzso
