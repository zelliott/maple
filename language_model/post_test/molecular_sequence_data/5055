Human zzso zzso zzso contain a zzso high molecular weight zzso zzso and a zzso low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso is the product of the zzso zzso whereas the gene for zzso has not been zzso Previously, we isolated a clone zzso from a human zzso zzso zzso expression library using an zzso against zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso Res zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to identify the zzso gene from which zzso was zzso Northern blots of human zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso with a series of zzso for tandem repeats found in the high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The only known zzso expressed at high levels in zzso zzso was zzso and no known zzso was expressed at high levels in zzso zzso A series of overlapping clones was obtained by zzso the zzso zzso zzso library and by reverse zzso chain zzso The resulting clones connected zzso to a series of zzso tandem repeats at the 3' end of the repeat domain and provided the complete zzso and deduced zzso sequence of the zzso terminal region of zzso This region is enriched with respect to zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso and contained a D domain and a zzso terminal domain that could be aligned with the corresponding zzso in human zzso zzso human zzso zzso and human von zzso zzso The limited expression of known zzso zzso together with the considerable zzso zzso capacity of zzso zzso suggests that a novel zzso not zzso zzso gene is expressed in this zzso and constitutes a portion of zzso in zzso zzso
