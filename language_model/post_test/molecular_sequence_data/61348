A zzso approach was used to design zzso zinc fingers that recognize the zzso Rev response element zzso An zzso zzso from zzso Rev was engineered into the zinc finger zzso and the designed fingers were shown to bind specifically to the zzso with high affinity and in a zzso manner, and display zzso zzso and CD zzso characteristic of properly folded zzso The results indicate that a zzso zinc finger can recognize a specific zzso acid site and that the zzso of a finger can be used to recognize the major groove of zzso as well as zzso The zzso zinc fingers demonstrate how zzso approaches may be used in the design of potential zzso zzso and provide a framework for selecting zzso fingers with desired zzso
