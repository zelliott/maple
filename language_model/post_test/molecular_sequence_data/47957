A unique zzso zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the serum and urine of a patient with zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso light chain zzso efficiently activated the alternative zzso of complement zzso When added to normal human serum, zzso temporarily enhanced zzso zzso activity, but during a prolonged incubation the zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso was found to bind to factor zzso the main regulator zzso of zzso By binding to the short consensus repeat domain 3 of factor zzso the zzso zzso blocked one of three interaction sites between H and zzso and thus inhibited the activity of H and induced an uncontrolled zzso of the zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso belonged to the zzso zzso of zzso light zzso The variable zzso region of zzso was most closely related to the predicted product of the zzso zzso gene zzso although it contained several unique zzso that in a zzso zzso model structure form an unusual ring of charged zzso around a zzso groove in the putative zzso binding zzso This site fitted considerably well with a putative binding site in the molecular model of domain 3 of factor H containing a zzso ring of charged zzso acids around a zzso zzso Apparently, functional blocking of factor H by the zzso zzso zzso light chain zzso had initiated the development of a severe form of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso light chain zzso zzso represents the first described zzso zzso in human zzso
