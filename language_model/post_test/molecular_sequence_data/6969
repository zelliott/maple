We have previously shown that a zzso zzso zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso rat liver zzso cell zzso when the zzso is carried out with a zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raised to unique sequences within the zzso region of zzso zzso we now report that the zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was not due to zzso of the zzso for the following reasons: zzso on zzso the zzso zzso did not zzso with zzso zzso and vice zzso zzso inclusion of the zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the ability of zzso zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso but blocked the ability of zzso zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso and zzso crude zzso zzso contain zzso amounts of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso does not zzso any other zzso However, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso by their respective zzso in zzso zzso zzso density zzso analysis of zzso cell zzso indicated that the zzso fraction is exclusively located at the density expected for zzso zzso suggesting that zzso was not a reflection of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso by protein zzso A indicated that only the zzso zzso could be zzso in zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso and zzso studies showed that the zzso and zzso zzso have very similar zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso cell contains both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and that a proportion of these receptors exist as zzso
