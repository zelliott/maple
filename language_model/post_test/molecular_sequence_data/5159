zzso zzso is a member of the family of zzso factors, which also includes nerve growth factor zzso and which have specific activities on different zzso of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine which zzso in zzso direct its specificity to the zzso zzso zzso It was possible to replace zzso of the zzso in zzso with zzso zzso without loss of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso together with either the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or the variable regions IV and zzso accounted for the specificity of zzso It is concluded that zzso and zzso use overlapping as well as separated regions for determination of zzso for their zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso
