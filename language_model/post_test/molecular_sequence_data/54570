The emergence of the 2009 zzso zzso pandemic followed a multiple zzso event from viruses originally circulating in zzso and humans, but the zzso nature of this emergence is poorly zzso 

Here we base our analysis on zzso complete zzso of zzso viruses sampled in North America between 2000 and 2010 in zzso and human zzso We show that while transmission to a human host might require an zzso phase in the zzso and zzso zzso the emergence of the 2009 pandemic was essentially zzso A more detailed analysis of the zzso protein shows that the 2009 pandemic sequence is characterized by novel zzso and by a particular substitution in loop zzso which is responsible for a zzso structural change tightly associated with the emergence of the zzso 

Because this substitution was not present in the 1918 zzso pandemic virus, we zzso that the emergence of zzso is due to zzso interactions between sites distributed over different zzso Altogether, our results are consistent with population dynamics models that highlight the zzso and zzso rise of novel zzso in viral zzso followed by their demise when the resulting virus is too zzso
