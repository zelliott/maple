Nuclear migration plays a prominent role in a broad range of zzso zzso We have cloned a zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein that is zzso zzso between humans and zzso The zzso zzso zzso is one of a group of genes required for nuclear zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso and the zzso terminal half of the protein shares zzso zzso acid identity with zzso zzso We show that the structural zzso between zzso and zzso extends to the functional level since the zzso gene can rescue the nuclear migration defects seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso against zzso reveal that the protein is localized to the zzso in zzso zzso and zzso Our data suggest that the zzso genes may be components of a functionally zzso zzso involved in the regulation of nuclear zzso
