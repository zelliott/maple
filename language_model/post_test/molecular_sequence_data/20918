zzso A viruses are characterized by a unique zzso structure, causing genetic instability, especially to the genes of zzso and zzso The objectives of this research was molecular and zzso analysis of influenza zzso strains that circulated in Northern Greece since 2004, particularly the identification of sequence variations and the comparison of circulating viruses with vaccine zzso Since 2004 in Northern Greece, a total of 216 clinical samples were positive for influenza virus infections, of which 83 zzso were attributed to influenza zzso zzso analysis of the zzso genes of 23 zzso showed that all circulating strains had variations at zzso zzso zzso binding sites were zzso in zzso and zzso strains whereas a variation was observed in all zzso strains zzso Furthermore, alternative zzso acids for zzso acid zzso binding sites were observed in most of the zzso zzso Some zzso acid zzso were also observed at the zzso zzso which however had no effect on the zzso of the zzso zzso analysis of each year's circulating strains revealed a relatively low match with the vaccine strains zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso respectively, whereas most zzso zzso match with the vaccine strain, zzso This year, unique variations were observed at zzso and zzso sites of zzso zzso zzso surveillance of yearly variations is of great importance, so that vaccine strains can be zzso
