zzso zzso zzso cause zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso growth zzso and zzso However, in humans this class of zzso zzso does not appear to have the same adverse zzso The zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso mediates the effects of zzso in zzso via zzso zzso response elements zzso upstream of zzso genes such as zzso zzso A zzso zzso When the human zzso promoter was cloned zzso it was found to be active and to contain a consensus zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso To confirm and extend those original findings, we isolated a 2 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter from a human liver biopsy and used it to create a zzso reporter gene zzso The human zzso promoter reporter zzso was added to both zzso and zzso zzso cells together with a zzso expressing zzso and assessed for its ability to drive zzso gene zzso The human zzso promoter zzso was zzso unlike the equivalent rat zzso promoter zzso used as a positive zzso The zzso within our cloned zzso of the human zzso promoter differed at three positions zzso G zzso from the previously published active human zzso zzso Next, we studied the frequency of the inactive versus the active human zzso within the human zzso Using a zzso strategy, we isolated and zzso zzso DNA fragments from 22 unrelated human individuals and from the human zzso cell line zzso In each case, the zzso contained the inactive zzso These data show that the human zzso gene promoter found in a sample human population is zzso This may explain at the zzso level the lack of response of humans to some of the adverse effects of the zzso class of zzso zzso
