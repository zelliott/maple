zzso and other circular zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso delta agent, use a rolling circle replication cycle requiring an intact circular zzso However, many infectious zzso have the potential to form zzso structures, whose formation must be controlled in order to preserve the circular replication zzso The native structure of delta zzso contains a highly zzso element of local zzso structure which is composed of sequences partially overlapping those needed to form the zzso zzso A zzso complex containing the zzso structure can be zzso We show that when it is part of this zzso complex the potential zzso site is protected and is not zzso by the delta zzso demonstrating that the element of local zzso structure can function as a zzso control element in zzso Physical studies of the complex containing this element were carried zzso The complex binds zzso zzso and is not readily zzso by zzso under the conditions zzso zzso 50% of the complexes remain following incubation in 1 zzso zzso at 60 degrees C for 81 zzso The zzso stability of the complex is reduced in the presence of sodium zzso A DNA complex and a perfect zzso duplex studied in parallel showed a similar effect, but of lesser zzso The zzso complex melts at temperatures approximately 10 degrees C lower in buffers containing zzso zzso zzso and 100 zzso zzso than in buffers containing zzso zzso zzso with no zzso zzso compared with zzso degrees zzso The element of local zzso structure in delta zzso zzso appears to be a molecular clamp whose stability is highly sensitive to zzso concentration in the zzso zzso
