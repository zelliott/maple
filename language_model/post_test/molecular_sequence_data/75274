zzso strains of zzso zzso types C and D are converted to zzso strains by infection with specific zzso zzso The zzso acids were extracted from five converting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso and treated with zzso The zzso acids isolated were not zzso by zzso A, but were zzso by zzso I and zzso III, indicating that they were zzso zzso On the basis of the restriction zzso zzso patterns on zzso zzso gel zzso the length of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was estimated to be about 110 zzso pairs and that of zzso and zzso was about 150 zzso zzso The zzso patterns of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso were very zzso High zzso was observed in the dot zzso zzso For other zzso and zzso a good similarity was not zzso Only a little similarity was observed between zzso and zzso zzso The existence of the structural genes for the toxin in both zzso and zzso zzso was confirmed by the zzso test with these zzso zzso and the zzso probe which represented the DNA sequence predicted for the zzso zzso acids (2 to 17) of zzso zzso type C zzso The loss of the converting ability of zzso zzso may be caused not by the deletion of the zzso gene but rather by the base zzso in zzso zzso zzso
