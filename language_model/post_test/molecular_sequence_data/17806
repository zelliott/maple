We describe the generation of zzso zzso cell lines that carry different zzso zzso zzso These genes were constructed by zzso zzso changing a zzso gene from zzso zzso to a zzso gene and changing a zzso gene from zzso zzso to a zzso as well as a zzso zzso These genes were zzso integrated into the zzso zzso zzso together with a reporter zzso An zzso zzso gene fusion carrying corresponding zzso stop signals served as a zzso Active zzso is expressed only in zzso zzso strains that contain, in addition to the reporter, a functional zzso zzso Both amber zzso are active in zzso zzso without interfering significantly with cell growth and zzso We failed, however, to establish cell lines containing a functional zzso zzso This may be due to the fact that nearly every message from zzso zzso known so far zzso with zzso Therefore a zzso capable of reading this termination zzso may not be compatible with cell zzso
