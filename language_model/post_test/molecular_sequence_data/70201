zzso zzso is a major sign of sexual ambiguity due to inadequate zzso action in genetic and zzso zzso In patients showing these symptoms we have detected two zzso zzso gene zzso In consequence we characterized the properties of the zzso receptors with respect to zzso zzso and zzso An zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso was detected in 3 and 2 brothers, zzso This zzso zzso zzso bound zzso in a normal zzso It showed a zzso zzso of zzso and was unable to induce zzso of a promoter containing one zzso responsive element but showed almost zzso zzso of a promoter containing two closely spaced zzso zzso The complex promoter of the human zzso zzso gene was induced with intermediate zzso In zzso mobility shift zzso zzso was unable to form a complex with zzso containing 1 or 2 zzso responsive zzso however its zzso activity was restored by an zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso A point zzso which caused substitution of zzso in the zzso domain with zzso was detected in a zzso male with ambiguous zzso This zzso zzso zzso showed a reduced zzso zzso The total amount of specific zzso binding sites in zzso zzso of the patient was zzso zzso activity of zzso was dependent on hormone zzso It was inactive at low levels of zzso but was fully activated in the presence of high zzso zzso The nature of the promoter had no effect on zzso properties of this zzso zzso zzso Its zzso activity in gel shift experiments was zzso
