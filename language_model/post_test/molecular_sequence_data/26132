During zzso zzso infection, the zzso flanked by 24 zzso imperfect direct repeats is transferred and zzso integrated into the plant zzso at random zzso Here we measured the frequency with which a zzso reporter gene is activated after zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso When adjacent to the right or left zzso border zzso at least zzso of the zzso express the marker zzso suggesting preferential zzso zzso zzso than zzso in zzso active regions of the plant zzso When the zzso zzso zzso II zzso gene is located internally in the zzso the zzso frequency drops to zzso since gene zzso requires zzso zzso These zzso events in the zzso upstream region occur independently of the nature of the upstream sequence and of the zzso zzso zzso of the right border region prevents the detection of activated marker zzso zzso zzso zzso probably occurs after synthesis of a normal zzso intermediate during the transfer and/or integration zzso In the absence of border regions, expression of the zzso zzso marker directed by the zzso zzso promoter was detected in 1 out of zzso zzso zzso suggesting the possibility that any DNA sequence from the zzso zzso can be transformed into the plant zzso albeit at a low zzso
