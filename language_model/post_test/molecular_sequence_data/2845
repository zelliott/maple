The two structural genes zzso tobacco nitrate zzso zzso were isolated from tobacco zzso libraries constructed in zzso zzso zzso Two independent zzso clones of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, zzso with a partial tobacco zzso zzso probe, were further zzso Southern zzso experiments were performed with the zzso zzso probe on zzso DNA derived from zzso zzso and from the ancestors of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso They showed that the larger zzso referred to as zzso was related to the zzso zzso parent, and the smaller one, referred to as zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso genes were found to be expressed in zzso The sequence of the gene zzso from which the zzso previously cloned is zzso was zzso It encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso Three intervening sequences were found zzso with the coding sequence of the zzso The precise location of the zzso initiation site on the structural gene was mapped by primer extension zzso A zzso consensus sequence was detected 32 zzso upstream from the zzso initiation zzso The leader sequence of the transcript is 138 zzso long and a stable secondary structure involving the translation initiation site has been zzso The zzso acid sequence of tobacco zzso deduced from the zzso sequence of the gene shows that zzso and zzso binding zzso occupy the entire zzso zzso of the zzso The remaining zzso part of the protein should thus carry the zzso site of nitrate reduction by the zzso zzso
