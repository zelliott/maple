A zzso chain zzso typing method for zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso amplified zzso DNA fingerprints were generated from boiled zzso prepared directly from bacterial colonies without the need for DNA zzso The technique was applied to zzso obtained during putative outbreaks of chest infection and validated by comparison with sodium zzso zzso gel zzso analysis of outer membrane zzso preparations and zzso gene restriction zzso There was complete zzso between the three zzso The results show that randomly amplified zzso DNA analysis provides a highly zzso method of characterizing strains of zzso zzso zzso which is eminently suitable as an zzso tool for the rapid investigation of outbreaks of zzso
