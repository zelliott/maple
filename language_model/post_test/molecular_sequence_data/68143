The surface topography and structural features of zzso zzso in relation to its interaction with the alpha zzso of its zzso zzso zzso have been zzso by limited zzso zzso followed by detailed structural zzso Four sensitive zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as surface zzso zzso suggesting that they are potential binding sites for zzso zzso To examine the involvement of these zzso in zzso alpha zzso a truncated zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso through zzso was generated and it was found to be incapable of binding zzso alpha in a zzso zzso binding sequencing zzso These studies have led to the conclusion that the zzso alpha contact region of zzso includes zzso zzso and zzso This finding is supported by the refined three-dimensional structure of zzso in which these zzso are located outside of the compact bundle of four zzso and thus are readily available for interaction with zzso zzso
