A zzso zzso zzso isolated from a patient's wound obtained from a dog zzso was characterized by zzso zzso and molecular genetic zzso zzso features suggested assignment of the unknown zzso to the zzso zzso The isolate exhibited the following peculiar features which made it possible to differentiate it zzso from all other medically relevant zzso older colonies exhibited a zzso zzso zzso colonies were strongly adherent to blood zzso and the strain did not have zzso activity, but was positive for zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing showed that the closest zzso relative exhibited more than zzso divergence from the unknown zzso Based on zzso and molecular genetic data, it is proposed that the isolate should be classified as a representative of a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
