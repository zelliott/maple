zzso syndrome zzso a disorder of zzso zzso affects zzso zzso and zzso dense zzso Seven genes cause zzso in humans zzso and at least 15 zzso zzso cause zzso in zzso Where their function is known, the zzso proteins participate in protein trafficking and zzso zzso events during zzso zzso zzso genes participate in at least 4 distinct protein zzso the zzso complex zzso zzso of zzso zzso complex 1 zzso consisting of 4 zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso consisting of zzso ear and zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning of the mouse zzso zzso reduced pigmentation zzso We show that the zzso zzso gene encodes a novel, widely expressed zzso acid protein that shares zzso zzso acid identity with its human zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso Further, we show that zzso zzso is part of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice, a premature stop zzso zzso the protein after 79 zzso zzso zzso in all the 5 known components of zzso including zzso cause severe zzso in mice, suggesting that the zzso are zzso and that zzso plays a key role in zzso zzso
