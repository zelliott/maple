zzso zzso are found in a large number of zzso zzso Most function as zzso zzso zzso catalyzing the terminal step in the zzso zzso zzso these zzso have been characterized as binding two zinc zzso in a stable zzso zzso The zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso termed zzso which functions as an immune evasion zzso by zzso major zzso complex class zzso zzso possesses at its N zzso a domain related to cellular zzso zzso but with an altered zinc zzso zzso This domain was initially characterized as a plant zzso a structure not previously known to function as an zzso Here, it is zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso domain is a zzso member of the zzso domain family and not a plant zzso The domain is found to interact with the cellular zzso zzso zzso to -C and zzso which dock to the equivalent surface as on classical cellular zzso zzso zzso with zzso suggests a possible role for zzso in catalyzing zzso zzso
