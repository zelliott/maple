The zzso of zzso zzso is assembled in zzso and the negative regulatory zzso zzso is able to sense the completion of an intermediate stage of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in steps leading to the formation of the zzso structure do not express the zzso filament structural zzso zzso and zzso due to negative regulation by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Hughes, zzso zzso zzso zzso We have discovered another novel regulatory zzso zzso which appears to sense the completion of another assembly stage in the zzso zzso zzso just prior to zzso zzso the completion of the zzso and zzso zzso that are unable to assemble the zzso or zzso do not express the zzso structural zzso zzso by zzso zzso in either the zzso or zzso locus allow expression of the zzso zzso structural gene in strains defective in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso but not zzso in the zzso zzso allow expression of the zzso gene in strains defective in all of the steps leading to zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to zzso 52 of the zzso zzso linkage map between the zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso was zzso in trans by a zzso zzso present in a zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso gene has revealed it to be identical to a gene of zzso coli of unknown function which has an zzso divergent promoter with the zzso gene promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Winkler, zzso zzso zzso zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso acids corresponding to the zzso gene product of zzso zzso and 331 zzso acids from the zzso coli sequence was zzso The zzso start site of the zzso zzso zzso gene was determined and zzso of the zzso gene was independent of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein observed in a zzso zzso zzso expression system showed an apparent molecular mass of 35 zzso slightly smaller than the predicted size of 37 zzso The predicted structure of zzso is a mostly zzso protein with a very zzso zzso segment preceded by positively charged zzso zzso This finding predicts zzso to be inserted into the zzso membrane facing inside the zzso
