We investigated the zzso protein zzso gene of two boys in a Japanese family with zzso disease zzso an zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso in the central nervous system zzso The patients showed similar clinical signs from birth and autopsy on the elder brother confirmed a zzso type of zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso gene and zzso zzso from the brain of the zzso patient revealed a G to T transition in zzso V of the zzso zzso which leads to a zzso to zzso substitution at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that this zzso was also present in his brother, but was absent in 100 X zzso of normal Japanese zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso levels of zzso and zzso basic zzso two major zzso proteins produced by zzso were much reduced in the zzso brain, zzso there was a specific loss of zzso It seems likely that the substitution is responsible for zzso zzso zzso in this particular family and causes zzso death in the zzso
