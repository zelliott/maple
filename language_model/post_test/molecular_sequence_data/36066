In the zzso zzso expression of the early genes is prevented by premature termination of zzso from the zzso promoter zzso In order to identify the region coding for the immunity zzso we cloned several fragments of zzso DNA and tested their ability to zzso immunity to zzso zzso A zzso zzso long zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to zzso immunity to an infecting zzso zzso and to complement the zzso zzso zzso zzso both in the presence and in the absence of the helper zzso zzso The immunity region covers zzso and the zzso zzso We were unable to obtain evidence of translation of the region, thus we suggest that zzso immunity is not zzso by a protein but by a transcript (or zzso zzso by the region downstream of the promoter zzso The promoter zzso appears to be necessary for the expression of zzso zzso fragments in which the zzso region is deleted did not complement zzso zzso for zzso although they still zzso with zzso zzso Two complementary sequences downstream of zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso and 3' ends of the immunity region play an essential role in the control of zzso zzso
