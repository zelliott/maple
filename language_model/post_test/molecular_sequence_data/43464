It has been assumed that zzso zzso function within the zzso apparatus to zzso zzso We now report, however, that a zzso soluble zzso form of the zzso zzso expressed in human zzso cells is highly efficient and comparable to the full-length zzso in zzso both newly zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the soluble zzso was zzso by cells as expected, we also found that the zzso zzso form was zzso zzso both zzso forms are zzso zzso at two primary sites within the stem region by zzso zzso at the indicated positions in the sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the soluble zzso is functional within the cell and that specific zzso occurs in the stem zzso The widespread occurrence of different soluble zzso zzso by cells suggests that normal zzso zzso may involve cooperation between zzso and soluble zzso
