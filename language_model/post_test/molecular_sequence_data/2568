Chemical probing methods have been used to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at each step during the in zzso assembly of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These experiments yield information about the location of each protein relative to the structure of zzso zzso and provide the basis for derivation of a detailed model for the three-dimensional folding of zzso zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso play an important part in the zzso of zzso assembly and in zzso of the zzso and dynamics of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
