zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso and collagen protein zzso are signaling proteins which are rapidly zzso on zzso after insulin zzso zzso zzso We have recently shown that both zzso and zzso interact with the zzso zzso motif of the zzso and zzso growth factor I zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso He, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and O'Neill, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso O'Neill, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14, zzso zzso zzso O'Neill, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we characterize these interactions by examining the effects of 18 zzso acid zzso within and around the zzso zzso motif upon interaction with zzso and zzso We confirm that zzso within the zzso motif of the zzso is essential for both zzso and zzso interaction and that zzso and zzso are essential for zzso interaction and important but not critical for zzso zzso Additional zzso surrounding the zzso motif revealed completely distinct patterns of interaction for zzso and zzso Specifically, zzso of zzso or zzso (at positions zzso and zzso from zzso markedly reduced zzso interaction but had no effect upon zzso zzso Likewise, zzso of zzso zzso reduced zzso but not zzso zzso zzso substitution of zzso zzso with either Ala or zzso reduced zzso interaction by 70 and zzso respectively, yet had no effect upon interaction with zzso Our data show that the sequences within and surrounding the zzso contribute zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso Our findings suggest mechanisms by which the differential interaction of known receptors with zzso and zzso may be zzso
