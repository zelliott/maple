An improved method for the rapid sequence determination of biologically active peptides selected from zzso zzso libraries has been zzso In this method, beads carrying unique zzso sequences were subjected to multiple cycles of partial zzso degradation zzso by the treatment with a zzso mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to generate a series of zzso zzso products (a zzso zzso for each zzso zzso Following zzso the zzso group was removed from the zzso and any reacted side chains by zzso zzso The sequence of the full-length zzso on each zzso was then determined by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso The use of zzso as a zzso capping agent resulted in cleaner zzso zzso and improved reliability for sequence zzso This zzso sensitive, and inexpensive sequencing method should further expand the utility of zzso zzso libraries in biomedical zzso
