The main zzso changes in the evolution of zzso microbial zzso are ongoing zzso and loss of genes combined with rapid sequence evolution and extreme structural zzso these changes reflect high levels of genetic drift due to small population sizes and strict zzso This zzso erosion includes irreversible loss of genes in many functional categories and can include genes that zzso the nutritional contributions to hosts that are the basis of the symbiotic zzso zzso zzso zzso is an ancient zzso of zzso insects and is typically zzso with another bacterial zzso that varies among host zzso Previously zzso zzso zzso retain pathways for the same eight essential zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso the remaining zzso Here, we describe a dual symbiotic system consisting of zzso and a novel species of zzso zzso zzso zzso both living in the zzso zzso zzso This zzso has completely lost the zzso for the zzso of zzso and, therefore, retains the ability to make only 7 of the 10 essential zzso zzso zzso has a tiny zzso zzso zzso and the most extreme zzso base composition zzso G + zzso reported to date, yet retains the ability to make the remaining three essential zzso zzso perfectly zzso capabilities of the zzso zzso Combined with the results from related symbiotic systems with complete zzso these data demonstrate the critical role that bacterial zzso play in the host zzso biology and reveal one outcome following the loss of a critical zzso activity through zzso zzso
