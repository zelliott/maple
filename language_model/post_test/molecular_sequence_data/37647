Some zzso zzso mosquitoes are capable of killing zzso the zzso agent of malaria, by zzso zzso of invading zzso zzso zzso appears to be involved in the formation of zzso and toxic zzso in the surrounding zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library screened with an zzso produced by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso zzso designed against zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows significant zzso to other insect zzso sequences especially at the two putative zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in zzso zzso and adult zzso The zzso zzso was detected by zzso and in zzso zzso in zzso fat body and zzso of adult female zzso A low level of expression was detected in the zzso whereas no expression was detected in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed that its expression was similar in adult female heads, zzso and zzso No change in the level of zzso expression was found in adult females after blood zzso bacterial challenge or zzso zzso zzso However, elevated PO activity was detected in zzso zzso zzso suggesting that in zzso zzso mosquitoes PO may be involved in limiting zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso and zzso suggest the presence of more than one zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso which is consistent with the findings in other zzso and zzso zzso The greatest similarity in sequence and expression profile between zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggests that they might be zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is zzso expressed through different zzso stages and under different zzso conditions, zzso that other factors in the zzso zzso cascade regulate zzso zzso
