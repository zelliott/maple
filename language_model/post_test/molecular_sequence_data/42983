We examined the gene expression of zzso zzso receptors in zzso zzso cells of zzso induced zzso rats using reverse transcribed zzso chain reaction zzso The gene expression of zzso zzso receptors in zzso zzso cells of zzso induced zzso rats showed a zzso increase when compared with that in zzso control zzso These results raise a possibility that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso in the zzso of zzso induced zzso
