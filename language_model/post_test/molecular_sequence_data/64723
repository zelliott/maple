zzso of a zzso brain zzso DNA library allowed to isolate a zzso zzso of the gene zzso the human zzso zzso that contained zzso zzso of the zzso region, the open reading frame and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso upstream from the start zzso was rich in zzso lacked consensus zzso or zzso box, but contained several zzso zzso Other potential zzso elements found in the zzso region included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A single zzso zzso signal zzso was found at position zzso and the zzso site was zzso zzso downstream from zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso zzso containing various truncated fragments of the zzso showed that the zzso zzso exhibited promoter activity in all tested cell lines and permitted the definition of a minimal zzso promoter zzso containing three putative zzso sites and two zzso zzso zzso activity of this region was inhibited by the addition of zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso binding to zzso zzso The search for sequence zzso within a zzso covering zzso zzso of zzso region and the coding region allowed us to identify five novel single zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso substitution at position zzso relative to the start zzso was common and in complete linkage with a previously identified zzso zzso in the coding region which was showed to affect zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso data and zzso sequence analysis, the zzso zzso single zzso zzso was located within a portion of the zzso zzso affecting zzso activity and it created additional putative binding site for zzso However, zzso substitution had no significant zzso on promoter activity in zzso or zzso zzso
