Ten zzso zzso of pea zzso A were expressed in zzso zzso and analyzed for zzso assembly with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso constitute two specific changes for each of five zzso zzso acid zzso located in the zzso of the zzso attachment zzso which is zzso in pea zzso zzso All zzso zzso were zzso able to zzso attach zzso indicating that there were no major structural zzso in the zzso However, the rate of zzso zzso varied significantly among the zzso zzso the zzso zzso are of three zzso zzso zzso that are indistinguishable from the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso and zzso that are not zzso From an analysis of the results, we concluded that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are probably not zzso involved in the zzso zzso reaction, but some zzso may play significant structural and zzso zzso zzso might anchor the zzso as has been suggested zzso zzso zzso & Grimm, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Parker, zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso (in zzso The zzso zzso three zzso downstream from the zzso attachment site, is not zzso critical for the spectral integrity and zzso of zzso but this zzso is zzso important to the zzso zzso It appears that the role of the five zzso acid zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso binding zzso is structural rather than zzso for the zzso zzso
