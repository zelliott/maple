For suicide gene therapy to be successfully applied for clinical settings, zzso expression of such suicide gene should be zzso We previously showed that group I zzso from zzso can induce new zzso that exerts zzso activity through zzso replacement by zzso reaction with high zzso and specificity onto targeted human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells, and hence the zzso can selectively zzso growth of the cells in zzso as well as in zzso However, the shortage of complete zzso due to zzso expression of highly zzso normal cells can limit therapeutic zzso of the zzso zzso In this study, to explore the possibility of improving specificity of cancer therapy, we have attempted to stimulate zzso gene activity specifically in liver cancer cells by zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the expression of zzso such as zzso gene was specifically and highly triggered from zzso liver cancer cells zzso with the zzso Moreover, zzso expression of the zzso with diphtheria toxin A or zzso zzso virus zzso zzso gene as 3' zzso could specifically and highly zzso the growth of the zzso liver cancer zzso In conclusion, we can greatly improve specificity of cancer zzso by combination of zzso targeting for zzso zzso expression with zzso replacement for zzso zzso gene zzso
