We isolated zzso an zzso zzso with a decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso While zzso zzso has a zzso in leaf starch zzso it accumulates starch in root cap zzso It has been shown that a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso and expresses restricted mainly to the zzso zzso The decreased starch content in leaves of the zzso zzso indicates that zzso zzso cannot be efficiently transported into zzso to complement the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity for starch zzso We cloned the zzso zzso gene and showed that it encodes the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to have a single zzso zzso causing a zzso to zzso zzso While the flowering times of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were similar to that of the wild type under zzso conditions, it was significantly delayed under zzso zzso The zzso zzso of late flowering zzso by these starch zzso zzso suggests that zzso metabolism plays an important role in floral zzso
