We constructed a zzso map of the 150 zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso It was established using known sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and eight random sequence zzso The tags were generated using zzso DNA of zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso from the zzso clone which carries the major part of this zzso The ends of two other zzso were positioned on the map using total DNA extracted from zzso cells carrying zzso The procedure allowed the placement of precisely known and new zzso genes on the physical zzso map and the generation of sufficient amounts of DNA for sequencing this zzso Apart from allowing correction of the genetic map in this region, these results demonstrate how a collection of long segments of bacterial zzso and Long zzso zzso can be used for reliable high-resolution physical mapping of an extended zzso zzso
