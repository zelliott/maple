zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso that are widely distributed in snakes from the zzso zzso of the zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso zzso they have a zzso activity similar to that of zzso and play an important role in the process of blood zzso However, zzso cannot activate factor VIII, which is essential in zzso zzso zzso blood clots produced by zzso are not stable and are cleared zzso This characteristic makes zzso attractive as potential candidates for zzso zzso zzso an zzso from zzso zzso was zzso and zzso to obtain a high-quality zzso from which data were acquired to zzso zzso zzso X-ray zzso analysis showed that the crystal belonged to space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement and the final R factor was zzso the zzso was zzso This is the first report of a crystal structure of an zzso zzso belongs to the typical zzso fold of zzso zzso Its structure was compared with those of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso The observed differences in the zzso composition of the zzso surrounding the active site appear to contribute to different zzso zzso and thus alter the shape of the zzso zzso which may explain the differences in zzso zzso
