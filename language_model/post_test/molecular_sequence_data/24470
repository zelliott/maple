This study was aimed to identify lentil zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes and to carry out a comparative analysis of these genes in the tribe zzso zzso differ from zzso a related group of plant seed storage zzso mainly by the presence of an additional sequence of zzso acids in the sequence corresponding to the first zzso referred as the zzso zzso A single gene for zzso a component of zzso seed storage zzso was identified in the cultivated zzso In this species, the zzso extension is formed by a stretch of 126 zzso acids of which zzso are charged zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This lentil zzso sequence is similar to the sequence of zzso in other species of the tribe zzso However, the size of the zzso extension clearly differs among zzso zzso comparison and zzso analyses including zzso and zzso of zzso species indicated that the differentiation between zzso and zzso predated the differentiation of the two zzso gene families zzso and zzso zzso and that the zzso extension evolved mainly by a series of zzso of short internal sequences and zzso expansions, the zzso one being zzso
