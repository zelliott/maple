As in other zzso a substantial portion of the zzso of the human blood zzso belonging to the zzso zzso appears to be composed of mobile genetic elements and other repetitive zzso The zzso elements and their relative organization are not well zzso although zzso (the zzso alpha zzso and a family of zzso terminal repeat zzso zzso (the zzso zzso have been reported from the zzso of zzso zzso Here, we report the presence of a second family of zzso zzso from zzso zzso which we have termed the zzso zzso zzso elements are members of a recently described lineage of zzso zzso typified by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso We determined the sequence for approximately zzso zzso of a consensus full-length zzso element, which included a long zzso untranslated region zzso potential first and second open reading frames zzso of 78 and zzso zzso acid zzso respectively, a short 3' zzso and an zzso 3' zzso zzso elements were bound by target site zzso The putative first and second zzso did not zzso The second zzso was zzso to zzso pol and zzso an zzso zzso and a reverse zzso A number of extremely short zzso elements of less than zzso zzso reminiscent of zzso were also zzso These consisted solely of the zzso and 3' zzso of full-length zzso zzso having both zzso zzso Analysis indicated that these zzso zzso elements were produced by replication of a zzso zzso element, rather than by repeated deletions within larger zzso zzso
