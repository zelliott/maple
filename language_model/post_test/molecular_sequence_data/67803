In rice zzso zzso zzso leaf photosynthesis is known to be highly correlated with zzso zzso however, it remains unclear whether zzso zzso zzso limits the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso channel protein controlling zzso closure in response to environmental zzso In order to examine zzso limitations to photosynthesis, a zzso zzso of rice was isolated and zzso A zzso screen of zzso zzso lines was conducted for the rice zzso zzso gene zzso and four zzso lines containing zzso within the open reading frame were zzso A second screen using an infrared zzso camera revealed that one of the zzso named zzso had a zzso low leaf temperature zzso zzso of leaf gas exchange showed that zzso plants grown in the greenhouse had significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso rates of photosynthesis zzso and ratios of internal zzso to ambient zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso plants, whereas there was no significant difference in the response of photosynthesis to internal zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations demonstrate that in zzso conditions, zzso zzso is a major zzso of zzso rate in zzso
