zzso is an zzso protein involved in zzso cell zzso and zzso The zzso 197 zzso acids of zzso zzso are zzso similar to the zzso zzso of zzso a zzso protein implicated in polarized assembly of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is also zzso in this region to zzso zzso cellular slime mold zzso and an zzso zzso from zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso sequences of these five proteins with zzso MAKER reveals a series of four blocks, which we name the zzso module after the zzso initial zzso in each zzso zzso presented here show that the zzso protein domain represented by the zzso module competes zzso with native zzso for binding to zzso in zzso Furthermore, the corresponding domain of zzso binds to both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of one of the zzso zzso in the fourth zzso block zzso the interaction of the zzso zzso module with zzso These results establish the location of an zzso binding domain in native zzso demonstrate that direct interaction of zzso with zzso is a possible basis for its effect on the zzso zzso in zzso and define the zzso consensus as a new zzso zzso
