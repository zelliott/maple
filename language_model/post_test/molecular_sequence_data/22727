The zzso zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso is the precursor of the virus zzso activities and is produced via a programmed zzso zzso zzso In this study, we altered the zzso efficiency by introducing zzso within the slippery sequence and the zzso zzso zzso the two elements that control the zzso These zzso decreased the zzso efficiency to different degrees, ranging from approximately zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso These values were mirrored by a reduced incorporation of zzso into zzso zzso as assessed by a decrease in the reverse zzso activity associated to these zzso Analysis of zzso processing in infectious zzso zzso revealed processing defects to various zzso with no clear correlation with zzso zzso Nevertheless, the observed zzso reductions translated into zzso reduced viral zzso and replication zzso Our results show that even moderate variations in zzso efficiency, as obtained with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso reduce viral zzso zzso targeting of this structure may therefore result in the zzso of virus replication and in clinical zzso
