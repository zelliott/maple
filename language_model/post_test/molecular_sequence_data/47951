Whether memory B cells possess altered zzso zzso and respond in a zzso distinct fashion to zzso signals as compared with their zzso precursors is a current subject of zzso We have investigated this issue by examining the participation of a zzso zzso zzso in the primary and secondary responses in the zzso of zzso zzso While this zzso gives rise to few zzso cells zzso in the primary response, shortly after secondary zzso its memory cell progeny produce a massive zzso zzso AFC response, largely in the red zzso zzso zzso expansion and migration take place during the secondary AFC response but zzso V region zzso zzso is not zzso The primary and secondary zzso center zzso responses of this zzso are both characterized by ongoing V gene zzso and zzso selection, little or no zzso migration, and derivation of zzso zzso distinct zzso from a single zzso However, the zzso of these responses zzso with V genes containing a high frequency of total as well as zzso zzso appearing rapidly in secondary zzso suggesting either recruitment of memory cells into this response, or accelerated rates of zzso and zzso In contrast, the frequency of zzso observed per V gene does not increase zzso during the primary zzso response of this zzso suggesting ongoing zzso of B cells that have sustained zzso and zzso zzso
