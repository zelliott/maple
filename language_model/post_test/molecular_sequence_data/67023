zzso repeats are involved in a number of debilitating diseases such as zzso syndrome and zzso zzso zzso to 75 zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso using a combination of zzso zzso differential scanning zzso and zzso methods zzso gel zzso zzso zzso All zzso formed stable zzso structures under near zzso conditions with a melting temperature which was only zzso dependent on zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso process by zzso and zzso experiments revealed a zzso zzso between the zzso values deduced from zzso zzso and zzso experiments zzso as recently shown for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 33 (2005) zzso Evidence for zzso zzso heat capacity changes was also derived from the analysis of the zzso zzso Such zzso is zzso in the framework of an zzso zzso or zzso hairpin model, in which long zzso do not fold into a simple long zzso zzso structure, but allow the formation of several independent folding units of unequal zzso These results suggest that this observation may be extended to various zzso zzso zzso
