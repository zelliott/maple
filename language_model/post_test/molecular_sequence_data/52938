zzso zzso 227 possesses two clusters of genes potentially zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that one zzso called zzso is expressed under zzso zzso conditions, and the deduced zzso acid sequences for zzso structural genes in that cluster most closely resemble those for the Mo zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The previously cloned zzso from zzso zzso shows zzso relationships with genes zzso components of zzso zzso zzso alternative zzso and other zzso zzso In this study, we cloned and zzso zzso and part of zzso from zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso by zzso from zzso zzso showed great similarity with zzso gene products from zzso zzso zzso with an zzso identity at the zzso acid level with the zzso gene product from zzso zzso Moreover, there was a small open reading frame located between zzso and zzso with clear zzso to zzso a hallmark of zzso alternative zzso zzso of zzso growth of zzso zzso 227 by V in the absence of Mo was zzso The unusual complement of zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso with one cluster resembling that from a zzso zzso and the other resembling a zzso V zzso gene zzso suggests horizontal genetic transfer of those zzso
