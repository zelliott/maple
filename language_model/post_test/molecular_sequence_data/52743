zzso mediates its diverse zzso effects through a family of five zzso receptors zzso however, knowledge about the distribution of individual zzso zzso proteins in zzso brain is zzso In the present study, we have examined the regional and zzso distribution of the zzso zzso zzso in the rat zzso by raising zzso zzso to the zzso tail of zzso The specificity of zzso zzso was demonstrated using zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso In Western zzso the zzso reacted specifically with a broad band in rat brain, which migrated at approximately 70 zzso before and approximately 50 zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso was most prominent in many zzso regions, including the cerebral cortex, zzso zzso amygdala, and zzso Analysis at the electron microscopic level revealed that zzso zzso target this zzso zzso to their zzso zzso Like the zzso zzso zzso zzso were often closely zzso by zzso fibers and zzso However, unlike the zzso zzso zzso was not zzso in response to zzso administration of zzso After percussion trauma of the cortex, zzso zzso receptors progressively declined at the sites of zzso This decline coincided with an induction of zzso expression in cells with a zzso zzso Together, this study provides the first description of the distribution of zzso zzso zzso proteins in rat zzso We show that zzso is strictly zzso and most likely functions in a zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso may have a previously unappreciated function during the zzso zzso zzso
