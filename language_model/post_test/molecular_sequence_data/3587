zzso from zzso zzso is a zzso family zzso These proteins may serve as zzso storage facilities for zzso which they bind with high zzso High resolution structures of zzso in a number of states, including the first structure of an zzso together with zzso data, allow us to describe zzso binding and provide support for the proposed storage function of the zzso zzso assembles as a zzso of zzso and binds eight zzso at two types of binding sites located at zzso zzso Two type 1 sites are on the molecular zzso axis and three pairs of type 2 sites occur on the molecular zzso zzso The zzso is largely unaffected by the binding of zzso zzso is admitted to the otherwise zzso type 2 binding sites by the movement of the zzso zzso of each protein zzso This contrasts with the structurally related zzso zzso regulator zzso which zzso extensive zzso zzso on zzso zzso Despite similarities between the binding sites of zzso and the type 2 sites of zzso the zzso has a significantly reduced zzso zzso due, in part, to the high density of negative charges at the center of the zzso In the absence of zzso this effects the movement of an important zzso side chain, thereby partially zzso the binding zzso The differences are consistent with a biological role in zzso zzso
