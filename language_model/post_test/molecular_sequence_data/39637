Recent studies have revealed the contribution of zzso to zzso restriction in cells from a variety of zzso zzso zzso consists of a zzso motif (the zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso The zzso domain is thought to be involved in determination of restriction specificity and contains three variable zzso To investigate the relationship between the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso restriction zzso a series of zzso zzso consisting of the human zzso domain followed by the zzso domain from various primates was zzso These zzso showed restriction profiles largely consistent with the origin of the zzso zzso zzso specificity was further investigated with a variety of zzso containing mixed or zzso zzso zzso This study revealed the importance of all three variable regions for determining restriction zzso Based on the molecular structures of other zzso zzso solved recently, a model for the molecular structure of the zzso domain of zzso was zzso The model revealed that the variable regions of the zzso domain are present as zzso located on one side of the zzso core zzso It is hypothesized that these three zzso form a binding surface for virus and that evolutionary changes in any one of the zzso can alter restriction zzso
