zzso zzso often differ dramatically for zzso proteins that have identical zzso zzso For two types of zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso proteins zzso no structural explanations for these differences have been zzso We calculated the classical zzso potential at the zzso site using zzso crystal structures of four zzso and four zzso to identify important structural zzso of their zzso zzso The contributions from just the backbone and polar side chains are shown to explain major features of the experimental zzso zzso For instance, in the zzso the presence of Val 44 versus Ala 44 causes a backbone shift that explains a approximately 50 zzso lower zzso potential in one of the four zzso This result is consistent with experimental zzso zzso of five additional zzso with known zzso Also, we attribute the unusually lower zzso zzso of two of the zzso studied to a less positive zzso environment around their zzso zzso Finally, molecular dynamics simulations of zzso around zzso zzso crystal structures indicate that water alone is a major factor in zzso the contribution of charged side zzso in zzso with experiments showing that zzso of surface charges produce relatively little effect on zzso zzso
