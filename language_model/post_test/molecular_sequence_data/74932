zzso zzso strain zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso which possesses an zzso zzso acid zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso with apparent molecular weights of 27,000 and zzso respectively, zzso with zzso acid zzso activity upon zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of crude cellular protein zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to greater than zzso zzso by zzso liquid zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso The first 28 zzso acid zzso of the N zzso of this zzso were determined by zzso sequencing, and a corresponding mixed zzso zzso was zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso total zzso of zzso DNA showed a zzso zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso This zzso was enriched for by size zzso of an zzso total digest of zzso DNA and zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the putative gene zzso the zzso zzso were detected with the zzso zzso by plaque zzso zzso The insert was zzso zzso in length and may contain the entire coding sequence for the zzso zzso The zzso insert was zzso into zzso and transformed into zzso coli zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso was not detected in cell extracts of this zzso when specific zzso was zzso zzso zzso acid sequence data correlated exactly with the zzso acid zzso A zzso zzso zzso species of greater than 6 zzso in size was identified by Northern zzso zzso analysis of total zzso suggesting that the gene coding for this zzso is part of a larger zzso
