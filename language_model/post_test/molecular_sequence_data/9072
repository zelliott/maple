The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses the zzso zzso zzso zzso however these are linked to a unique gene zzso an outer membrane channel, dubbed zzso that is absent in most zzso zzso zzso Using genetic zzso and single copy zzso zzso we showed that zzso resistance in zzso is zzso in part by the zzso zzso and zzso that zzso in this strain can zzso either the zzso or zzso outer membrane channel, linked to the zzso zzso zzso We also identified a small portion of the zzso gene immediately downstream of the zzso gene in zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso strains might have zzso but lost, the intact zzso zzso pump zzso zzso with this, most of a panel of zzso strains possessed the truncated zzso but the zzso zzso isolate had an intact zzso zzso similar to zzso and the related strain zzso zzso We also showed that the zzso zzso gene upstream of zzso in zzso is zzso leading to zzso of zzso using sequencing, zzso replacement and real-time quantitative reverse zzso zzso Finally we assessed the contribution of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso together to resistance in zzso and the zzso zzso clinical isolate zzso concluding that the effect of the zzso zzso is enhanced by functional zzso especially in the presence of zzso zzso to develop high-level zzso resistance in zzso zzso
