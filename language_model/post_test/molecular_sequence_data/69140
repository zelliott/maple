Recent studies have shown that a locus responsible for zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso is on zzso zzso and that tumors developing in these patients contain zzso in zzso sequences zzso zzso We have used zzso zzso to obtain highly zzso markers from zzso zzso These and other markers were ordered in a panel of zzso cell hybrids and used to define a zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso genes were then zzso and one was found to lie within the zzso zzso zzso We identified this candidate by virtue of its zzso to zzso mismatch repair zzso zzso clones were obtained and the sequence used to detect zzso zzso including those producing termination zzso in zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso of the gene were identified in zzso tumor zzso This zzso zzso is therefore likely to be responsible for zzso
