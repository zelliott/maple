All higher plant zzso zzso have six classes of zzso genes containing zzso One of those is the zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso In the case of zzso species from the zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso the zzso coding gene zzso represents a truncated form of other plant zzso zzso several zzso of the reverse zzso domain and so-called domain X are not present in these zzso These zzso probably represent zzso of the zzso zzso The analysis of zzso usage within the zzso gene revealed the presence of strong zzso zzso The use of zzso with the third letter being U or A varies from zzso The comparison of zzso zzso acid sequences at the family level shows a high identity between zzso However, when zzso and zzso zzso sequences are zzso the percentage of identity drops zzso The calculated values of the number of zzso zzso vary zzso even when zzso species are compared zzso The zzso tree of relationships between plant species on the basis of zzso zzso sequences zzso with the generally accepted plant zzso
