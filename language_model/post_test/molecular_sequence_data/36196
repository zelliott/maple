The zzso chain reaction zzso has been used to generate a series of overlapping zzso clones representing 43 zzso of zzso untranslated zzso 63 zzso of 3' untranslated sequence and the entire coding sequence of the gene zzso potato zzso zzso zzso zzso This portion of the gene is approximately zzso zzso in length and is interrupted by three zzso one of which is present in the zzso untranslated zzso Southern zzso analysis indicates that zzso is zzso by a small gene family, and sequence data from a number of zzso zzso clones indicate that there are as many as six zzso zzso zzso differences between the zzso zzso clones and a zzso zzso clone are discussed with respect to the zzso of zzso zzso An alignment of zzso placement in the potato zzso gene with zzso placement in zzso genes from other sources indicates that two of the potato zzso zzso to zzso positions in other zzso
