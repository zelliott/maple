The analysis of viral populations requires the use of techniques that describe characteristics of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso makes possible the identification of genetic differences between viral sequences and constitutes an alternative to the expensive and time-consuming cloning and sequencing zzso zzso to small zzso regions (from 100 to 500 bases in zzso zzso patterns could describe, under appropriate experimental conditions, single zzso variations in the studied zzso The different steps of a complete zzso zzso from sampling to pattern analysis (including zzso acid zzso zzso amplification, zzso DNA zzso zzso gel preparation, zzso conditions, and zzso zzso are described using a region zzso zzso of the barley yellow zzso zzso zzso zzso as molecular zzso
