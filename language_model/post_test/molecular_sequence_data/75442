zzso zzso of zzso strain of zzso disease virus zzso were selected with zzso zzso directed to the three zzso zzso sites on the zzso zzso zzso and their zzso genes were zzso to identify the zzso acids important for the integrity of each zzso Seven zzso for site I, which is zzso and zzso among zzso zzso had a change of zzso acid at position zzso mostly to zzso and in a single case, to zzso In the second group of two zzso for site IV, a change of zzso to zzso acid was found at position zzso This resulted in elimination of the zzso attached to this zzso zzso of the parental zzso Together with the finding that the site IV was destroyed by treatment with zzso zzso it was suggested that the zzso is important for maintaining the structure of site zzso The zzso appeared to contribute to exposing a nearby zzso by zzso zzso on zzso A zzso for site II had also a zzso zzso resulting in the change of zzso acid to zzso at position zzso The site I recognized by zzso which inhibit zzso activity with a small zzso zzso was located closer to the predicted zzso zzso site than to the other sites recognized by zzso lacking the zzso zzso The sequence of the parental virus zzso gene revealed that the zzso precursor for the zzso protein is an zzso protein whose C zzso is zzso by 45 zzso zzso compared with the usual zzso protein zzso in zzso
