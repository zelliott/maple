The three members of the zzso family, zzso binding zzso zzso and C1 inhibitor are zzso zzso from zzso canine kidney zzso cells, whereas two zzso family members, zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso in a zzso zzso zzso coding for zzso composed of complementary portions of an zzso targeted zzso and a zzso zzso were generated, expressed in zzso cells, and the ratio between zzso and zzso zzso was zzso These experiments identified an zzso sequence of zzso binding zzso zzso zzso that is sufficient to direct a zzso with zzso mainly to the zzso zzso A zzso analysis showed that no individual zzso acid is absolutely required for the zzso targeting ability of zzso acids zzso of zzso binding zzso The corresponding zzso sequences of zzso and C1 inhibitor were also sufficient to zzso zzso zzso Based on our results we suggest that the zzso targeting ability is zzso in the zzso of the zzso
