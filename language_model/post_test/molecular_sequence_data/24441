The skeletal muscle zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso encodes the skeletal muscle calcium release zzso To date, more than 25 zzso zzso have been identified in zzso and are associated with central core disease zzso zzso zzso and/or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso are clustered in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso Only four zzso have been identified so far in the highly zzso zzso region zzso the zzso domain of the protein which forms the zzso zzso Three of these zzso have been found to segregate with pure or mixed forms of zzso We have screened the zzso domain of the zzso gene for zzso in 50 European patients, diagnosed clinically and/or zzso as having zzso We have identified five zzso zzso (four of them zzso in 13 index zzso The zzso cluster in zzso 101 and 102 and replace zzso acids which are zzso in all known zzso zzso zzso In order to study the functional effect of these zzso we have immortalized zzso from some of the patients and studied their zzso zzso We show that zzso carrying the newly identified zzso zzso zzso zzso a release of calcium from zzso stores in the absence of any pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso significantly smaller zzso zzso calcium stores, compared to zzso from control zzso and zzso a normal sensitivity of the calcium release to the zzso inhibitor zzso Our data suggest the zzso domain of zzso as a hot spot for zzso leading to the zzso zzso If the functional zzso of zzso zzso channels observed in zzso cells are also present in skeletal muscles this could explain the zzso symptom of zzso zzso chronic muscle zzso Finally, the study of calcium zzso in zzso cells naturally expressing zzso zzso offers a novel zzso approach to gain insights into the zzso of zzso and zzso
