The zzso of a zzso zzso in the gene for the zzso beta 3 zzso zzso is associated with cardiovascular and zzso disorders, distinct cellular features and altered drug zzso The molecular mechanisms that give rise to this complex zzso have been linked to the occurrence of G beta 3s, a zzso zzso of zzso G beta zzso is predominantly expressed in cells with the zzso In the present study we describe the identification and characterization of an additional G beta 3 zzso zzso referred to as G beta zzso Its zzso is expressed in heart, blood cells and zzso zzso and its expression is also tightly associated with the zzso zzso G beta zzso is generated by alternative zzso using zzso zzso zzso G beta zzso belong to the family of zzso proteins and consist of seven regular zzso zzso zzso for G beta zzso are lacking 129 zzso of the coding sequence of the zzso G beta 3 zzso Thus the predicted structure consists of only six zzso zzso which resembles the structure of G beta zzso zzso analyses indicated that G beta zzso zzso with different G gamma zzso zzso G gamma 5, G gamma zzso and G gamma zzso In zzso insect cells, expression of G beta zzso together with G gamma 12 enhances zzso zzso of G zzso zzso of G beta zzso in zzso cells activated the zzso protein zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that G beta zzso is a biologically active G beta zzso which may play a role in the manifestation of the complex zzso associated with the zzso
