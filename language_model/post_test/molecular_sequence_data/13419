We have studied three Phase II genes in the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso mouse appears likely to be caused by zzso loss of the zzso zzso zzso gene on zzso 7 and absence of the zzso zzso which leads to increased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso We show here that increases in zzso Phase II gene expression in the zzso mouse are correlated with an zzso DNA motif called the zzso response element zzso which has been found in the zzso zzso regulatory regions of all zzso zzso Phase II zzso zzso hydrocarbon response element zzso are responsible for zzso zzso of all six zzso battery zzso and one or more zzso have been found in the zzso zzso regulatory regions of all of these zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with a synthetic zzso probe corresponding to the zzso show that zzso proteins are more than twice as abundant in zzso than in the zzso zzso nuclear zzso Competition studies of zzso binding with an excess of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha zzso suggest that several common zzso factors bind to the zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protein block formation of an zzso complex on gel mobility zzso These data suggest that zzso (or zzso zzso might be an integral part of the zzso zzso complex associated with the zzso stress zzso To our knowledge, this is among the first reports of the same zzso factor operating at two different response elements upstream of a single zzso
