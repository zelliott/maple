We have cloned and zzso the four members of a rice zzso zzso to zzso zzso gene family that are zzso arrayed in a locus approximately 30 zzso in zzso Each of the genes contains a single, small zzso They are all zzso active and zzso proteins of Mr zzso with two highly zzso zzso Northern analysis with zzso zzso showed slightly different patterns of expression for the four genes in rice plant zzso and in response to zzso zzso zzso of the promoter regions revealed a zzso zzso sequence zzso with some zzso to the zzso binding site zzso et zzso zzso Another zzso sequence zzso whose core is found in the promoter regions of zzso cotton zzso is reminiscent of the zzso responsive element zzso et zzso zzso
