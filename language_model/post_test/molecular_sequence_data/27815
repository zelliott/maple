In the zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso designated zzso can be induced in the liver by administration of zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso are induced in zzso rats that possess a responsive zzso zzso but are not induced in zzso zzso rats zzso although the zzso zzso is competent to induce other zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso state (without zzso zzso in zzso tissue in both zzso and zzso zzso We report the complete zzso sequence of the rat zzso zzso The protein zzso by the zzso zzso is zzso zzso acids in length and has a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence predicted from the zzso demonstrates a strong conservation between the rat zzso and the human zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Ya zzso zzso levels in the liver are altered zzso by administration of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso different responses to zzso administration between the various zzso species in each of the zzso suggest that the regulation of specific gene expression by zzso may involve multiple zzso
