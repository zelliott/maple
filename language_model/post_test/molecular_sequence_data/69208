The molecular events underlying the zzso of zzso by zzso toxin were investigated in zzso adrenal zzso zzso We found that replacement of zzso acid zzso within the putative zinc binding domain of the zzso toxin light chain such as of zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso or of zzso zzso zzso by zzso completely abolished the effect of the light chains on zzso induced zzso zzso zzso acid, a strong zzso agent for zzso also prevented the effect of the zzso toxin light zzso zzso and, less zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso restored the activity of the zzso These data show that zinc and the putative zinc binding domain constitute the active site of the zzso toxin light zzso Neither zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso nor peptides spanning the site of zzso zzso by the zzso toxin in zzso prevented the zzso of zzso induced zzso release by the zzso toxin light zzso This suggests that zzso are not a major target of zzso toxin in adrenal zzso zzso
