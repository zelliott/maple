The zzso zzso zzso has two zzso the short form zzso zzso and the long form zzso zzso which differ by the presence of a zzso acid insert in the third zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso receptors have been shown to couple to members of the G zzso family of G zzso but whether each zzso couples to specific G zzso zzso remains zzso In previous studies using G zzso zzso resistant to modification by zzso toxin zzso zzso we demonstrated that the zzso zzso couples selectively to G zzso and that the zzso zzso couples selectively to G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, two point zzso of the zzso zzso were created by random zzso zzso and zzso The two zzso zzso receptors demonstrated pharmacological characteristics comparable with those of the zzso zzso zzso with similar zzso and zzso binding zzso We used human embryonic kidney zzso cells zzso zzso with G zzso G zzso or G zzso to measure zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso before and after zzso toxin zzso The two zzso zzso receptors demonstrated a change in zzso zzso specificity compared with the zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso zzso coupled predominantly to G zzso zzso zzso coupled zzso to G zzso and zzso zzso coupled zzso to G zzso These results suggest that this region of the third zzso loop is crucial for determining zzso protein zzso zzso
