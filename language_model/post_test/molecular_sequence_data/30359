zzso zzso intolerance zzso is an zzso error of zzso inherited as an zzso zzso disorder and caused by a decrease in the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso in affected zzso Investigation of the molecular basis of zzso is reported here by the identification of two molecular zzso in the zzso B gene of the zzso zzso Using zzso chain reaction to specifically amplify zzso at this locus and zzso zzso for the sequence determination of these zzso fragments, we show the zzso zzso of the zzso One zzso previously indicated by restriction analysis, was confirmed as zzso zzso 149 to Pro in zzso zzso The other zzso was identified as a zzso deletion found in zzso 4, a deletion which causes a zzso at zzso zzso resulting in a truncated protein of 132 zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso in the zzso family was shown by using zzso zzso to probe blots of amplified zzso The techniques employed here represent a rapid and efficient method for detection of other zzso in families with this zzso In addition, the ability to detect zzso zzso by zzso zzso offers a new method for definitive diagnosis, a method which avoids a zzso loading or zzso zzso
