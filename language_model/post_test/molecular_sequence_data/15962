Two bovine zzso clones that zzso with zzso beta zzso have been zzso zzso sequence analysis of the beta 1, beta 2 and zzso zzso zzso regions for one of these clones revealed 70, 89 and zzso identity with the corresponding zzso beta zzso Stop zzso are present in the beta 1 and TM zzso and a single base deletion toward the 3' end of the TM zzso zzso the consensus sequence for zzso zzso zzso we conclude this is a bovine DR zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso regions have been used as zzso in Southern zzso analyses of bovine zzso DNA zzso with zzso The beta 2 zzso of zzso beta I results in prominent bands of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were observed for all but the zzso zzso band and at least three of these bands were identified in each of the 185 animals zzso A probe containing the TM zzso of zzso beta I zzso only to the zzso and zzso bands, suggesting that these are zzso bands corresponding to this zzso zzso from zzso of a TM zzso probe of the second bovine DR zzso clone zzso beta zzso suggest that the zzso and zzso bands zzso to this second bovine zzso A zzso zzso band results from a probe containing the zzso beta I beta 1 zzso Major differences in frequency for the zzso zzso were found for the four breeds zzso
