The use of dilution culture techniques to cultivate zzso bacteria present in the zzso soil of flooded rice zzso allowed the isolation of three new strains of bacteria, typified by their small cell sizes, with zzso numbers estimated at between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells per g of dry zzso The average cell volumes of all three strains were zzso to zzso zzso and therefore they can be termed zzso or zzso zzso The small cell size is a stable zzso even when the organisms grow at high zzso zzso and thus is not a zzso zzso All three strains have zzso DNA with a zzso zzso ratio of about 63, are gram negative, and are zzso by means of a single zzso The three new zzso zzso only zzso and some sugar zzso as zzso for zzso The metabolism is strictly zzso but the new strains are oxygen zzso zzso are zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso production was not zzso In the presence of zzso zzso of zzso the zzso end products or ratios did not zzso The zzso analysis on the basis of zzso zzso DNA zzso sequence comparisons indicates that the new zzso belong to a branch of the zzso lineage and are closely related to a cloned zzso zzso sequence zzso recovered from rice zzso field soil from zzso The isolation of these three strains belonging to the order zzso from a model rice zzso system, in which rice was grown in soil from an Italian rice field, provides some information on the possible physiology and zzso of the zzso represented by the cloned zzso zzso sequence zzso The new zzso also extend our knowledge on the zzso and zzso depths of members of the order zzso to date acquired mainly from cloned zzso zzso sequences from zzso and other zzso
