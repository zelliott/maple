B1 elements are an abundant class of short zzso elements zzso in the mouse zzso and mobilize by a process known as zzso Here, we report the characterization of a zzso B1 zzso into zzso 4 of the zzso zzso which was previously shown to be responsible for the jittery zzso zzso in the human zzso of this zzso zzso are responsible for zzso zzso The B1 zzso is approximately zzso long, ends in a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso tail, is flanked by a perfect zzso zzso duplication, and is inserted into a sequence that resembles a zzso zzso consensus zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso zzso is most closely related to elements of the zzso zzso and we have identified two possible zzso B1 sequences on mouse zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate that B1 zzso is ongoing in the mouse zzso and is consistent with the hypothesis that the reverse zzso and zzso zzso by zzso elements mediate B1 zzso
