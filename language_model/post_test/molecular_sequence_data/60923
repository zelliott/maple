zzso in zzso proteins have been implicated in human genetic zzso However, efforts in understanding the functions of these proteins have been hampered by the inability to obtain their zzso zzso To identify zzso cellular zzso associated with an zzso zzso we devised a strategy termed isolation of specific zzso acids associated with proteins zzso The zzso technique allows isolation and subsequent identification of these zzso To assess the zzso of this approach, we zzso cellular zzso and protein from zzso cells and zzso a protein implicated in zzso zzso stability, as a model zzso zzso of an zzso protein with the zzso zzso domain enables isolation of zzso within an zzso context and the identity of the bound zzso is determined by the differential display zzso The specificity of zzso interactions was considerably enhanced when the interactions were carried out in the presence of cellular extract rather than zzso zzso Two of the zzso specifically bound by zzso were zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso c zzso zzso II zzso zzso A specific zzso complex formed on the zzso and zzso 3' zzso consistent with the binding of zzso Furthermore, direct binding of zzso zzso proteins to these 3' zzso was demonstrated and the binding sites zzso These results support the feasibility of the zzso technique and suggest a broad zzso for the approach in identifying zzso targets for clinically relevant zzso proteins that will provide insights into their possible zzso
