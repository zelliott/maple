Two forms of zzso anchor have been described for the zzso disposed zzso of zzso plasma zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the complex zzso zzso zzso The chemical structures of the major species of zzso anchors found on a single zzso surface zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso mass zzso chemical zzso and zzso zzso The zzso anchor was found to be zzso with respect to zzso zzso and several novel zzso linkages were zzso The results are pertinent to the mechanism of the zzso of zzso zzso
