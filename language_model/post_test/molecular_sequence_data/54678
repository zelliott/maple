zzso is a key constituent in structural materials found in biology, including bone, tendon, skin and blood zzso Here we report a first molecular level model of an entire overlap region of a zzso zzso type I collagen assembly and carry out a zzso characterization based on large-scale molecular dynamics simulation in explicit water zzso Our results show that the deformation mechanism and strength of the structure are greatly affected by the presence of the zzso and by the specific loading condition of how the stretching is zzso We find that the presence of a zzso results in greater strength during deformation as complete zzso slip is zzso and thereby particularly affects larger deformation zzso zzso the lack of a zzso results in the onset of zzso sliding during deformation and as a result an overall weaker structure is zzso Through a detailed analysis of the distribution of deformation by calculating the molecular strain we show that the location of largest strains does not occur around the zzso bonding region, but is found in regions further away from this zzso The insight developed from understanding zzso materials from a fundamental molecular level zzso could play a role in advancing our understanding of zzso and disease states of zzso zzso and also enable the development of new scaffolding material for applications in zzso medicine and biologically inspired zzso
