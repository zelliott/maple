zzso can be detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso when 3 zzso copper is added to the growth zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso 3 library by screening with the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene is present as a single copy and, as deduced from the DNA zzso encodes a precursor protein of 126 zzso zzso The predicted 29 zzso acid transit zzso shows substantial zzso to the zzso zzso transit zzso thought to direct the zzso precursor to the zzso zzso zzso promoter sites zzso and zzso base pairs from the start of the zzso gene have been zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence has the greatest zzso zzso to the green zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite the lower zzso the copper binding zzso and certain aromatic zzso remain highly zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is not zzso regulated since the zzso of zzso zzso appears to be independent of the copper concentration in the growth zzso The possibility of an additional zzso needed to facilitate the electron transfer from zzso to zzso is also zzso
