zzso and zzso are essential zzso components and zzso in biological zzso Here, we report the de zzso design, zzso and properties of model zzso bundle zzso The proteins were designed and constructed from three different zzso with 21 or 22 zzso acid zzso by zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso A free zzso unit is placed at the zzso core of the protein for binding of zzso and zzso through a zzso zzso The zzso with molecular weights of zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso circular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso difference zzso The zzso zzso zzso at pH 8 in zzso solution zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso were 89 zzso and zzso zzso and with a synthetic protein 229 zzso and zzso zzso versus standard hydrogen zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso difference zzso studies of the model compounds and zzso show the special resonance features for zzso bands at zzso and zzso zzso due to the sulfur substitution to zzso and zzso zzso The construction of model zzso represents a significant step toward more complex artificial zzso zzso
