The zzso of neurotransmitter identity is a critical step in neural zzso Recent zzso have indicated that the closely related zzso factors zzso and zzso are essential for development of zzso zzso zzso zzso and may directly determine the neurotransmitter zzso With a long-term goal of understanding the regulatory cascade of zzso zzso determination, we isolated and characterized a zzso zzso clone encompassing approximately zzso zzso of the zzso upstream promoter region, the entire zzso structure, and approximately 4 zzso of the 3' zzso zzso Using zzso isolated from the zzso human cell line, both primer extension and zzso amplification of zzso ends analyses identified a single zzso start site that resides zzso zzso upstream of the start zzso The zzso start site was preceded by a zzso sequence motif and transcripts from this site contained an additional G zzso at the zzso position, supporting the authenticity of this site as the zzso start site of zzso We assembled zzso reporter zzso containing different lengths of the zzso upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso of these reporter zzso in both zzso and zzso cell lines show that zzso or longer upstream sequences of the zzso gene may zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell line show that forced expression of zzso but not that of zzso or zzso significantly zzso the zzso activity of zzso This study will provide a frame to further delineate the regulatory cascade of zzso zzso zzso
