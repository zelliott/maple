zzso has been used to investigate the composition of zzso zzso from zzso and elastic zzso and to compare zzso zzso fingerprints derived from whole zzso zzso and zzso zzso In all zzso zzso zzso was abundant and the only zzso zzso zzso was the only other zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso so this association may contribute to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides mapped throughout the zzso and included virtually all predicted peptides except for those larger than zzso zzso smaller than 600 Da or zzso zzso In contrast, fewer zzso zzso zzso peptides were zzso although they were derived from zzso throughout the zzso and included two peptides after the zzso zzso processing zzso Several zzso zzso and zzso zzso never yielded any zzso while zzso peptides from other zzso yielded numerous zzso suggesting that some tissue zzso features are retained after zzso This first zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso assembly has provided new insights into zzso composition and zzso zzso within zzso
