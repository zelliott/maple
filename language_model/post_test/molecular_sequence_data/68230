The promoter and upstream region of the zzso zzso zzso storage protein zzso gene were studied to identify zzso sequences involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso generated by successive deletions of the zzso control region of the zzso gene were fused to the reporter gene zzso zzso These zzso were used to transform tobacco leaf zzso zzso of zzso activities in mature seeds from the transformed plants indicated that there were both zzso and positively acting sequences in the zzso gene zzso zzso of sequences between zzso and zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso In contrast, deletion of sequences between zzso and zzso decreased the zzso The minimum sequence required for zzso expression was a 196 zzso zzso between zzso and zzso Further zzso deletion of the zzso to zzso abolished this zzso zzso comparison showed that a G zzso sequence and two sequence motifs zzso between zzso storage protein genes are located between zzso to zzso zzso and zzso analysis of tobacco seeds showed that the spatial and zzso expression pattern was retained in the deletion fragments down to zzso However, the expression in tobacco seeds differed from the spatial and zzso expression in zzso zzso In zzso the zzso promoter directed zzso activity early in the zzso before any visible activity could be seen in the heart-shaped zzso Later, during the transition from heart to torpedo zzso the main expression of zzso was localized to the zzso No significant zzso activity was found in either root or zzso
