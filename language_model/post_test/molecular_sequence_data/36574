zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso disrupt normal zzso control and cause many cells in a zzso population to accumulate extra zzso pole zzso To determine the stage at which the zzso gene product becomes essential for normal zzso zzso zzso cultures of zzso zzso cells were exposed to the zzso temperature for various periods of zzso The zzso cells retained viability until the onset of zzso when their viability dropped zzso zzso of these cells by zzso and electron zzso showed the first zzso zzso to be a structural failure in the zzso Additionally, flow zzso analysis of DNA content demonstrated that massive zzso zzso accompanied this failure of zzso zzso zzso occurred despite the zzso nuclear division, which often resulted in segregation of both zzso poles to the same zzso At later times, the zzso zzso pole bodies entered a new cycle of duplication, thereby leading to the zzso of extra zzso pole bodies within a single zzso The DNA sequence predicts a protein product similar to those of two other genes that are also required for nuclear zzso the zzso gene of zzso zzso and the zzso gene of zzso zzso
