The zzso coli zzso contains two zzso located zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso reaction contributes to pH zzso by consuming zzso zzso and producing zzso zzso This compound is exported via the protein product of the zzso zzso which is zzso with zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso of both zzso and zzso is positively controlled by zzso a gene downstream of zzso zzso a zzso regulator belonging to the zzso zzso The zzso promoter encompasses the zzso region preceding the zzso zzso start site and contains both zzso and zzso putative recognition zzso zzso of zzso occurs in neutral rich medium upon entry into the stationary phase and is increased at zzso zzso zzso the expression profile of the zzso structural zzso However, zzso zzso expression in neutral rich medium results in zzso of target genes even in exponential phase, zzso when the zzso system is normally zzso zzso of the whole zzso system is zzso by the positive effect of zzso on the zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso in an zzso zzso and strongly reduced in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso consistent with the expression profile of zzso structural genes in these genetic zzso zzso shift and zzso I zzso analyses with a zzso fusion protein demonstrate that zzso binds zzso and zzso promoters at different sites and with different binding zzso
