A bacterial strain zzso that zzso both the zzso group and the aromatic ring of the zzso zzso and that is capable of using zzso as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen was isolated from a soil in Washington zzso zzso fatty acid and zzso zzso sequencing analysis indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso contains five zzso at least some of which are required for metabolism of zzso Loss of the plasmids induced by growth at 42 degrees C resulted in the inability of the cured strain to grow on zzso as a sole source of zzso Introduction of the plasmids zzso on zzso zzso zzso the ability to use zzso as a sole source of carbon for growth and zzso Of the five zzso four are rich in zzso sequence elements and contain large regions of zzso zzso zzso and loss of individual plasmids that resulted in the loss of the zzso zzso were observed following introduction of zzso
