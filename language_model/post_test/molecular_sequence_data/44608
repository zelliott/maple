We investigate the zzso expression of two recently cloned zzso channels, zzso and zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction on single zzso zzso from the rat kidney and by zzso using a zzso zzso that recognizes both highly zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were detected in outer zzso late zzso zzso zzso zzso ascending thin limbs zzso and outer zzso zzso and cortical zzso thick ascending zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso outer zzso and inner zzso collecting zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the zzso proteins were restricted to the zzso zzso from ATL, zzso and collecting ducts cells, whereas zzso and zzso exhibited a more diffuse zzso zzso When rats were zzso a condition which increased the expression of zzso in zzso and zzso a weak zzso zzso was found in late zzso zzso zzso Thus these results demonstrate that rat kidney zzso channels are predominantly located in the zzso zzso from cells of the late segments of the zzso zzso where most of zzso zzso takes zzso
