The expression of zzso genes in the zzso zzso of the third zzso zzso of zzso is a zzso restricted response to zzso by the steroid hormone zzso For zzso we have previously demonstrated that its strictly tissue and zzso expression is the result of combined action of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding proteins zzso One of these zzso zzso was shown to be the product of the zzso gene fork zzso Together with zzso zzso appears to be responsible for the spatial restriction of the hormone response of zzso Here, we show that zzso is a zzso binding activity that consists of different zzso zzso zzso We cloned the zzso zzso of human zzso factor zzso zzso and identified it as one of these zzso zzso The zzso protein shows great similarity to its human and zzso counterparts within the zzso domain, the second zzso zzso zzso zzso and a third region of unknown zzso The expression pattern of zzso indicates that it is a zzso expressed zzso protein in zzso As a second component of zzso we identified the zzso zzso zzso which is also zzso expressed and binds to zzso sites independent of zzso Since both zzso and Da can be detected in zzso at zzso zzso zzso control elements in zzso zzso zzso zzso we propose that each of the two proteins contributes to the zzso control of zzso
