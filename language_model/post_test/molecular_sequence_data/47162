We have observed that 2 forms of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in normal human pancreatic duct cells, but only zzso in pancreatic duct zzso We report here partial organization of the zzso zzso zzso of 2 forms of zzso zzso is driven by alternative promoters zzso and zzso Lack of expression of zzso in zzso cells is caused by zzso of the downstream promoter zzso Analysis of the promoter zzso sequence and function in normal and zzso cells demonstrated that neither structural changes zzso nor a change in the pool of zzso factors is responsible for its zzso Although zzso was found in a large number of cancer zzso treatment with zzso did not fully cause the promoter function to zzso We conclude that the initial zzso of zzso promoter zzso activity in pancreatic duct zzso is due to the structural or functional zzso in the regulatory zzso localized outside the analyzed promoter zzso zzso of zzso is responsible for the zzso of the suppressed promoter at the late stages of tumor zzso
