zzso zzso is an zzso mobile membrane protein that is predominantly located at the zzso zzso zzso It is an essential component of a number of zzso zzso zzso In animal and zzso cells zzso zzso is thought to be an electron donor for zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso however, yielded cells that had no nutritional requirement for either zzso or zzso fatty zzso zzso of zzso and fatty zzso genes was increased in the zzso zzso cells, however, suggesting that zzso zzso may play some zzso role in these zzso zzso fatty acids in zzso are formed by zzso an zzso zzso fatty acid zzso that is an intrinsic zzso zzso membrane zzso Although the zzso zzso fatty acid zzso does not appear to require zzso zzso introduction of the rat liver zzso zzso gene into an zzso zzso zzso zzso strain revealed that this zzso specifically requires zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the coding sequences of the zzso and rat zzso genes showed that the zzso protein contains a zzso acid zzso extension not found in the rat zzso That extension has regions of strong zzso to zzso zzso particularly in the zzso binding and electron transfer zzso zzso or disruption of the zzso zzso zzso domain in cells that contain the wild type zzso zzso produced zzso fatty acid zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso domain of zzso plays an essential role in the zzso zzso
