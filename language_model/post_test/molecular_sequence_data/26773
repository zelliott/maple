zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulates zzso zzso protein zzso zzso However, the biological functions of this zzso have not been clarified in zzso To investigate the biological significance of zzso during zzso zzso we cloned and characterized zzso zzso zzso The isolated zzso clone possessed an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso zzso acids and shared zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with rat and human zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso lacks the zzso cluster corresponding to zzso zzso in the rat zzso and was not activated by zzso such as zzso The zzso zzso required zzso rather than zzso for zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso regulates zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso in zzso zzso zzso During zzso the expression of zzso increased gradually after zzso zzso as demonstrated by Western zzso using an zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso gene with zzso zzso zzso resulted in an increased zzso of zzso with severe zzso and cellular zzso zzso a significant increase in the number of zzso zzso and zzso cells in the whole zzso A marked decrease in zzso expression was observed in the zzso but not control zzso zzso zzso death was rescued by zzso with zzso rat zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso These results clearly show the significance of zzso during zzso zzso
