The survival of zzso species is dependent on the ability of individuals to adequately interact with each other, a function often zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are used by this system to recognize zzso Among these zzso the zzso zzso by a very large gene family in most zzso are able to detect zzso zzso which also express zzso zzso possess a very limited zzso zzso Here, taking advantage of the possibility to unequivocally identify zzso zzso in zzso we analyzed the zzso expression and evolutionary constraints of a pair of clustered fish zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the two genes were found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but a single representative was observed in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso sequences from 12 different zzso species indicate different evolutionary rates between the two zzso zzso leading to a highly zzso zzso gene and a zzso gene under more relaxed selective zzso Moreover, zzso sites were detected in specific branches of the zzso zzso Our results suggest a zzso zzso specificity of the zzso zzso between zzso species, its loss in the zzso zzso and the acquisition of different zzso characteristics for the zzso zzso
