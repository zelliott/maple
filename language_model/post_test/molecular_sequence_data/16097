Fifteen zzso zzso of side chains of the 20 natural and of 26 zzso zzso acids are compiled and simple methods for their evaluation zzso The relevance of these parameters to account for zzso zzso and electric properties of the side chains is assessed and their zzso zzso It is shown that three principal zzso one zzso one bulk, and one electric zzso account for zzso of the total zzso in the available zzso These parameters may prove to be useful for correlation studies in series of zzso zzso zzso
