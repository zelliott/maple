Avian influenza virus zzso is prevalent in waterfowl and has become endemic in poultry in Asia and the Middle zzso zzso influenza viruses have served as a zzso of internal genes for other avian influenza viruses that zzso humans, and several cases of human infection by zzso influenza viruses have indicated its pandemic zzso Fortunately, an extensive surveillance program enables close monitoring of zzso influenza viruses worldwide and has generated a large zzso of virus sequences and zzso zzso Despite the large quantity of sequences in different databases, very little is known about specific virus zzso and their zzso Here, we characterize a zzso avian influenza virus, zzso zzso zzso which is representative of influenza virus strains that have caused severe morbidity and mortality in poultry zzso We show that under certain circumstances the zzso zzso zzso can be activated by zzso a hallmark of highly zzso avian influenza zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso can be zzso in cells with high levels of zzso expression and that a zzso that eliminates a zzso site in zzso allows the zzso zzso to gain universal zzso in cell zzso zzso generated from zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso cells zzso In contrast, introduction of a zzso zzso site into zzso zzso leads to zzso that are compromised for zzso Our data indicate a mechanism for an zzso evolutionary zzso that may allow it to gain zzso in a distinct manner from zzso and zzso influenza zzso
