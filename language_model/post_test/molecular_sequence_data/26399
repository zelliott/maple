zzso clones zzso a novel zzso growth zzso protein zzso zzso from rat serum and human bone zzso medium have been isolated from rat liver and human zzso liver, and zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso revealed a mature zzso consisting of 233 zzso acids for the zzso while the human structure contains an additional zzso acid sequence in the middle region of the zzso This zzso now proposed to be named zzso contains two extra zzso compared with the previously characterized zzso zzso and zzso but the alignment of the remaining 18 zzso is zzso across the four zzso zzso acid sequence comparison among the four binding proteins within the rat species demonstrated that both the zzso and zzso one thirds of the molecules are highly zzso while the middle one third region, where no zzso are present except for the two that exist in zzso is the most zzso The overall sequence zzso among the four rat zzso is very similar zzso suggesting that their individual genes zzso from a single ancestral gene at about the same evolutionary time zzso Northern analysis of the zzso zzso in rat tissue demonstrated that zzso of the zzso gene is highly active in the liver, although a single zzso zzso zzso band was zzso in all zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso heart, zzso zzso liver, stomach, zzso and brain zzso
