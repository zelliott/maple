As a crop, zzso holds significant commercial value for its omega-3 rich zzso and stem zzso Canada is the largest producer of zzso but there exists scope for significant yield zzso Implementation of mechanisms such as male zzso can permit the development of hybrids to assist in achieving this zzso zzso sensitive male zzso has been reported in zzso but the zzso of this system in field conditions limits the production of quality hybrid zzso Here, we characterized a zzso zzso transcript zzso expressed in male sterile lines of zzso The twelve zzso gene predicted to zzso a 368 zzso acid protein has five zzso repeats which, in zzso form a zzso structure with putative zzso acid and zzso binding zzso The zzso protein localized to the nucleus and its expression increased during the transition and continued through the zzso stages zzso zzso zzso zzso while the transcript levels declined during zzso development zzso zzso and embryonic zzso of male fertile zzso zzso lines for zzso in zzso failed to develop shoots while zzso lines showed delayed growth zzso and were male zzso The zzso flowers failed to open and the zzso grains from these flowers were zzso Three independent transgenic lines zzso the zzso gene had zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso delayed flowering and maturity compared to male fertile zzso The present study provides new insights into a male zzso mechanism present in zzso
