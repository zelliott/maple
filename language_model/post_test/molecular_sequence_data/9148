Many bacterial pathogens inject into host cells zzso proteins that are zzso for host zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso family zzso zzso zzso eventually zzso host cell zzso aiding disease zzso In the case of the gastric pathogen zzso zzso which is a major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer, the only known zzso protein injected into host cells is the zzso zzso Here, we followed the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso as a model system to study early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso on zzso zzso motifs zzso zzso and zzso in Western strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in East Asian zzso We found that zzso only zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso molecules were zzso on 1 or 2 zzso zzso but never simultaneously on 3 zzso Furthermore, none of the zzso zzso motifs alone was sufficient for inducing zzso cell scattering and zzso The preferred combination of zzso zzso motifs in Western strains was zzso and zzso either across 2 zzso molecules or simultaneously on zzso Our study thus identifies a tightly regulated zzso zzso model for zzso starting at zzso followed by zzso of zzso or zzso These results provide insight for clinical zzso zzso typing and clarify the role of zzso bacterial zzso proteins in zzso
