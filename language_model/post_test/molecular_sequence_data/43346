The ability of DNA tumor virus proteins to trigger zzso in zzso cells is well zzso For example, transgenic expression of a zzso virus 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has generally been considered to be a zzso event because cell death in the brain is greatly diminished in a zzso background strain and is zzso by expression of zzso zzso zzso T zzso We now show that while zzso triggered zzso in rat zzso zzso cultured in low serum, expression of full-length T zzso unable to bind zzso zzso protected against zzso without causing zzso One domain essential for blocking zzso by T zzso was mapped to zzso acids 525 to zzso This domain has zzso zzso with a domain of zzso type 5 zzso zzso required to prevent zzso zzso In the context of both zzso T zzso and zzso zzso of two zzso zzso acids in this region eliminated T zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso T zzso contains a novel functional domain involved in preventing zzso independently of zzso of zzso
