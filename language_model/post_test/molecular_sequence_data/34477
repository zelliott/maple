zzso of zzso sequence that are compatible with multiple folds may facilitate evolutionary transitions in protein zzso In a previous study, we described a zzso designed zzso sequence zzso structurally ambivalent sequence zzso 1) that could adopt either of two naturally occurring zzso zzso or zzso when incorporated as part of the zzso zzso zzso of two structurally divergent zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we describe longer zzso designs zzso and zzso that in the case of zzso zzso to the full zzso half of the ordered region of a zzso zzso zzso sequence alignment zzso zzso zzso and zzso show moderate zzso stability in zzso zzso monitored by circular zzso zzso values of 46 and zzso respectively), while zzso and zzso have somewhat reduced stability zzso values of 33 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso secondary chemical shift analysis confirms two zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to secondary structure locations in the two parent zzso zzso relaxation data show that both zzso sequences have a relatively zzso zzso Comparisons of zzso correlation zzso for zzso and zzso proteins strongly suggest that zzso retains the zzso of zzso Both zzso zzso zzso can be zzso in a single zzso showing the zzso of linking different zzso folds by smooth evolutionary zzso The zzso zzso though largely zzso in structure, also exerts an important contextual influence on the structure of the zzso zzso
