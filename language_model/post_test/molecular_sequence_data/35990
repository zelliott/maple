The major soluble protein of bovine cornea zzso zzso bovine zzso protein 54 zzso was isolated successively by gel zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso acid sequence of a zzso of the zzso zzso 54 obtained by zzso zzso showed marked zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso From the high similarity of zzso 54 with zzso zzso in structural form, it is suggested that zzso 54 has zzso zzso We confirmed a high zzso activity of zzso 54 by zzso using a mouse zzso 54 zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso for zzso zzso Next we demonstrated the unique properties of the zzso zzso 54 as zzso The major zzso point is zzso zzso 54 zzso zzso aromatic zzso such as zzso with zzso as zzso but cannot zzso zzso After heat treatment the zzso activity is more stable with zzso than with zzso With zzso the pH profile shows a broad plateau from pH zzso followed by a sharp rise up to pH zzso In contrast, with zzso there is a sharp optimum at pH zzso The activity with only zzso is inhibited by zzso but is not affected by zzso and zzso So we suggested that zzso 54 is an zzso with kinetic properties different from the rat zzso zzso
