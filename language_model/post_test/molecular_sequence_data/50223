zzso zzso zzso designed to cleave sequences unique to viral zzso might be developed as zzso For this purpose, they would require high zzso efficiency and resistance to zzso zzso here are two approaches that can be used in combination to improve these zzso First, zzso efficiency can be improved by zzso zzso that bind to the zzso zzso with the zzso of the zzso Second, zzso of zzso sequences of the zzso increases zzso activity as well as resistance to zzso In combination with a zzso zzso the zzso rate was increased 20 fold over that of the unmodified zzso
