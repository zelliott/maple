According to the results of the theoretical zzso analysis and available experimental data, the known zzso can be divided into two groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to form a family of zzso zzso proteins characterized by a statistically significant zzso in zzso acid sequences and by common features of the secondary structure zzso zzso of the sequences of 72 zzso zzso omega reveals three clusters of conservative zzso acid zzso Their participation in the formation of active sites of zzso zzso omega is zzso
