The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a central component of the zzso respiratory chain as well as the respiratory and/or zzso systems of numerous zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso complex has a dual zzso When the cells are grown zzso the zzso complex is present in the zzso membrane and is a critical component of the zzso electron transport zzso When the cells are grown in the dark in the presence of zzso the same zzso complex is a necessary component of the zzso respiratory zzso The fact that the zzso complex from zzso zzso has been extensively zzso plus the ability to manipulate this zzso zzso makes this an ideal system for using zzso zzso to address questions relating to the structure and function of the zzso zzso In the current work, the cloning and complete sequence of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso is zzso As in other bacteria, this zzso contains three zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso b zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques were used to delete the entire zzso zzso from the zzso The resulting strain cannot grow zzso but can grow zzso utilizing a zzso zzso zzso growth is restored by providing zzso zzso on a zzso and the reappearance of the protein zzso and the zzso features due to the zzso complex are also zzso Finally, a zzso is introduced within the gene zzso the zzso b zzso which is predicted to zzso resistance to the inhibitor zzso It is shown that the resulting strain contains a functional zzso complex which, as expected, is resistant to the zzso zzso this system is suitable for the detailed characterization of the zzso complex, combining zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso techniques which have been previously developed for the study of zzso zzso
