Cloning and characterization of a zzso of the spruce zzso zzso zzso that showed high zzso acid similarity with the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Initially, a zzso zzso and then a full length zzso were cloned from zzso zzso The longest open reading frame of this zzso had zzso zzso and its deduced zzso acid sequence had all five zzso typical of a steroid hormone nuclear zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this zzso showed the highest identity with the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and is therefore named zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso probe detected a zzso zzso zzso that was abundant at the time of the zzso zzso during zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the sixth zzso larvae, zzso zzso was detected in the zzso fat body and zzso and maximum expression was observed during the zzso peak of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was induced in zzso treated zzso cells and in the zzso fat body and zzso of larvae that were fed the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and translation of the zzso zzso yielded a 79 zzso protein that bound to the zzso acid zzso related orphan zzso response element zzso
