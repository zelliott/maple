The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso channel zzso providing zzso drive within the nervous zzso We report here the isolation and functional characterization of a novel alpha zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from adult zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence is zzso zzso and zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibits many of the molecular features of zzso zzso but the sequence patterns in the zzso and zzso zzso are more similar to zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is more closely related to the zzso zzso zzso being zzso however, on a distinct zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso similar to that described previously for zzso zzso zzso When expressed in zzso zzso or a human cell line zzso 23), zzso forms a zzso zzso which is activated by zzso and antagonized by zzso This zzso demonstrates unexpectedly high sensitivity to zzso and can also be activated by zzso These results are consistent with zzso findings in zzso and zzso and they suggest that this zzso fish zzso zzso displays a lower selectivity to zzso than that reported for zzso zzso zzso
