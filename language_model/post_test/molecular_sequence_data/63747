zzso signaling is zzso by direct protein interaction with various types of zzso zzso zzso and additional zzso zzso In brain tissue and in cultured zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso has been found to impact cellular calcium zzso Using a zzso zzso approach, we have uncovered a direct physical interaction between the zzso and the transient zzso potential channel zzso zzso 1, 4 and zzso The zzso interaction was further validated by zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso expression indicates zzso of the two proteins within the cell body and zzso of cortical zzso In cultured cells, expression of zzso was found to increase expression of zzso at the cell surface by zzso These findings shed new light on the constituents of the zzso zzso and support the involvement of zzso in cellular calcium signaling pathways via a novel link to zzso zzso
