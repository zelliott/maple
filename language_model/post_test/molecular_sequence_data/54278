zzso regulation in the zzso is exerted by zzso zzso and zzso zzso One of these zzso is zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso II zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso zzso exhibit specific abnormalities in the expression of the zzso zzso including the zzso of precursor zzso zzso and zzso species and a zzso decrease in the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso however, accumulate to a very low level in both precursor and mature forms, suggesting that they are unstable in the zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso plants zzso an zzso zzso zzso that is complementary to the zzso zzso its zzso zzso and the downstream zzso zzso which encodes zzso raising the possibility that zzso zzso zzso zzso or its precursor and/or blocks zzso zzso To investigate this, we used an in zzso system that supports zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso maturation from a zzso zzso and shorter versions of zzso demonstrate that zzso requires zzso zzso To test whether the sense and zzso zzso form zzso regions in zzso treatment with the zzso zzso bean zzso was zzso These results suggest that zzso duplexes interfere with a zzso secondary structure near the zzso zzso site downstream from the zzso zzso coding zzso We zzso that these duplexes are zzso by a zzso zzso in zzso contributing to the zzso zzso zzso observed in zzso
