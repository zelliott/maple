zzso zzso is a zzso pathogen that is responsible for life-threatening disease, particularly in the context of compromised zzso This zzso makes extensive use of zzso in constructing its cell wall, zzso and zzso zzso also comprises up to two-thirds of the main zzso zzso factor, a zzso capsule that surrounds the zzso The zzso reactions that generate cellular zzso structures usually require activated donors such as zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is produced in the zzso by the sequential actions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, most zzso zzso are zzso within zzso zzso This zzso separation zzso a specific transport mechanism to move this key precursor across biological zzso to the appropriate site for zzso zzso We have discovered two zzso zzso in zzso zzso in contrast to the single such protein reported previously for other zzso zzso studies of each protein expressed in zzso zzso show that both are functional, with similar zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that the two proteins zzso and zzso are transcribed with distinct patterns of expression in response to variations in growth zzso Additionally, deletion of the zzso gene yields cells with small capsules and a zzso in capsule zzso while deletion of zzso does not alter the zzso We suggest that zzso zzso produces two zzso zzso to satisfy its enormous need for zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, we propose that the two proteins have distinct biological zzso This is supported by the different expression patterns of zzso and zzso in response to environmental stimuli and the dissimilar zzso that result when each gene is zzso
