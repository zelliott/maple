zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso short curved rod that grows by zzso the reductive zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso was isolated from San Francisco Bay zzso zzso zzso grew at zzso of zzso ranging from zzso to zzso but zzso of zzso above zzso zzso inhibited zzso The isolate used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and ethanol as electron donors for growth coupled to reductive zzso Among the zzso aromatic compounds tested, only the zzso position of zzso was zzso zzso and additional zzso at other positions blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nitrate were also used as electron zzso for zzso The optimal temperature for growth was 30 degrees C, and no growth or zzso activity was observed at 37 degrees zzso Growth by reductive zzso was revealed by a growth yield of about 1 g of protein per zzso of zzso zzso and about zzso g of protein per mole of zzso zzso The zzso features and zzso zzso DNA sequence suggest that the zzso is a novel species of the zzso zzso and which we have designated zzso zzso The unusual zzso feature of this strain is that it uses zzso as an electron donor and carbon source for growth with zzso but not with zzso
