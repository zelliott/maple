zzso delivered zzso zzso has been associated with systemic protection against various disorders in humans and zzso In an attempt to understand how zzso delivers a systemic signal following its local oral administration, the present study aimed at identifying genes zzso regulated in bovine peripheral blood through the use of zzso zzso following oral therapy with zzso We identified thousands of genes to be zzso zzso Of these, about zzso had a minimum zzso degree of change, the majority of which represented novel zzso genes zzso Several zzso zzso were transcripts with key and diverse zzso functions, including zzso processing and zzso zzso migration, zzso zzso immune zzso and zzso functions, zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso expression itself was not modulated in bovine peripheral blood, suggesting that the blood levels of zzso are not the hallmark of the zzso effects of oral zzso zzso Rather, zzso seems to interact with local zzso zzso cells in the gastrointestinal zzso This interaction may initiate a signaling cascade eventually leading to the zzso induction of zzso which in turn zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso through the proteins they zzso may potentially perform critical immune zzso zzso
