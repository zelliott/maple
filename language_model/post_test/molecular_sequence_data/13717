To search for new molecules relating to the zzso of zzso zzso we raised a new zzso zzso zzso zzso which reacted with the surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso study revealed that the zzso appeared initially on the primary zzso The zzso expression increased during zzso development, reached the highest level in small zzso 1-2 zzso in diameter, and then decreased in the zzso zzso The zzso was not detected on zzso cells in the zzso zzso profiles of zzso zzso zzso from isolated zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso indicated that it consisted of two proteins zzso and 130 zzso and that the zzso zzso of zzso was on the zzso zzso We next zzso a large amount of zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso Analysis of the partial zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein showed that 16 zzso acids from the zzso zzso were very similar to those of both human and zzso mature zzso alpha 6, with zzso zzso zzso profiles revealed that the zzso protein was bound to a zzso protein by a zzso zzso this was compatible with the reported characteristics of human zzso alpha zzso We then examined the zzso distribution of zzso alpha 6 using zzso alpha 6 zzso zzso The zzso profiles obtained with zzso were very similar to those obtained with zzso These findings showed that the zzso detected by zzso was a zzso zzso of human zzso alpha 6 and that zzso alpha 6 was a differentiation zzso of zzso zzso cells, suggesting an involvement of zzso in zzso zzso
