The complete zzso sequence of the rat zzso gene is described and compared with published zzso zzso The rat zzso gene organization is typical of other zzso zzso with five zzso one large zzso of zzso zzso and three smaller zzso averaging 145 zzso Because complete sequences for mouse and Chinese zzso zzso are also known, it is possible to compare the evolutionary rates of change in the zzso with those of the zzso The latter provide one possible estimate of underlying rates of zzso It is shown that the zzso zzso have differential rates of evolution in zzso and have had a recent and rapid burst of zzso within the mouse zzso Rates of change in the zzso do not appear to be strongly correlated with the rates of change in the zzso
