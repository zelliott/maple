Seven human zzso zzso zzso have been identified to zzso In this study, we clarified the mechanism of zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ) zzso by the human zzso gene and whose zzso slightly differ from each zzso Although both zzso contain zzso zzso targeting signals at their zzso we found that the zzso zzso was localized mainly in zzso whereas the zzso zzso was localized in both zzso and zzso zzso which is composed of only the common domain, showed the same zzso zzso as that of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso Further analysis showed that the zzso of zzso , which is rich in zzso zzso acid zzso functions as a zzso membrane zzso zzso In addition, a de zzso protein synthesis zzso experiment using zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso is necessary for maintaining the stability of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso sequence analysis from each zzso examined indicated that zzso is a zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that human zzso potentially controls various zzso functions via two zzso with different zzso zzso or zzso
