zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins of zzso and human zzso namely zzso and zzso reveal a substantial sequence similarity despite their enormous evolutionary zzso Moreover, all these zzso display zzso activity and are in higher zzso zzso to zzso zzso The recently solved zzso structure of zzso enabled us to build the three zzso structures of zzso and zzso by comparative zzso The generated models revealed the expected similarities, but also fundamental differences with respect to charge distribution, zzso and core zzso The combination of these structural properties and known zzso data provides insight in the different zzso mechanisms of the zzso For zzso exposed zzso grooves and a locally loosely packed protein core may allow a zzso of the protein and therefore may account for its ability to penetrate the target membrane and to form defined zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the structural features of zzso and zzso appear to be suitable for a zzso mode of action rather than for channel zzso
