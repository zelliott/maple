We report here the presence of numerous processed zzso derived from the W family of zzso zzso in the human zzso These zzso are structurally zzso with the zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso Our analysis of zzso sites of zzso processed zzso shows a strong preference for the zzso motif of long zzso nuclear element zzso zzso The zzso distribution, stability during evolution, and frequent zzso at the zzso end resemble those of the zzso generated by zzso We therefore suggest that zzso processed zzso arose by multiple and independent zzso zzso of zzso zzso These data document that the majority of zzso copies are actually zzso zzso zzso The current search for zzso associated with several human diseases should concentrate on a small subset of zzso competent zzso
