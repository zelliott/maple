zzso toxin 2 zzso zzso coli zzso zzso caused one of the world's largest outbreaks of zzso colitis and zzso zzso syndrome in Germany in zzso These strains have evolved from zzso zzso coli zzso by the acquisition of the zzso genes and have been designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing has shown that the zzso gene is carried by zzso integrated into the zzso of zzso zzso We studied the properties of zzso zzso which are responsible for the emergence of this new type of zzso coli zzso For this, we analyzed zzso zzso from zzso zzso strains from Germany (in 2001 and zzso Norway (2006), and the Republic of Georgia zzso zzso zzso zzso could be isolated from all zzso strains except for the Norwegian zzso The zzso zzso formed zzso on zzso coli K-12 by integration into the zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso of a German zzso zzso outbreak was zzso From the zzso analyses of the zzso sequence of zzso zzso 79 open reading frames were zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso from the German 2001 and 2011 outbreak strains were found to be identical and closely related to the zzso zzso from the Georgian 2009 zzso Major proteins of the zzso particles were analyzed by mass zzso zzso production in zzso zzso strains was zzso by zzso C and was compared to zzso production of zzso coli K-12 zzso
