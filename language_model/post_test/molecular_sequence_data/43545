zzso an zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a disorder associated with breast cancer and motor dysfunction, is a zzso nuclear zzso binding zzso We have identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso by combining zzso zzso selection with zzso zzso Starting with a pool of approximately zzso random zzso zzso we identified long zzso zzso zzso that bind to zzso with high affinity zzso of approximately 2 zzso The loop region of these zzso harbors a approximately zzso zzso element zzso which is essential for zzso zzso zzso studies defined the third zzso domain of zzso and the zzso element as necessary for in zzso zzso Consensus zzso zzso elements were identified in two zzso zzso one zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a second zzso zzso zzso zzso protein binds these zzso with high affinity and specificity in zzso and this binding can be blocked by zzso zzso Moreover, both zzso and zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso with zzso protein from brain zzso Thus, zzso functions as a zzso nuclear zzso binding protein in zzso disruption of the specific interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso may zzso the motor dysfunction seen in zzso
