To test the effects of disruption of a zzso zzso in the green cone zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso 

zzso cell lines were established by zzso zzso cells with a zzso containing zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso green zzso zzso zzso The proteins were induced by zzso the cells in the presence of cadmium zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso zzso Western zzso zzso with zzso and zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso the folding and zzso of the green zzso zzso and its abilities to absorb light at the appropriate wavelength and to activate zzso Similar disruption of zzso zzso and light zzso occurs when zzso or its presumed partner for formation of a zzso bond zzso is replaced by zzso zzso 

Like zzso the folding of the cone zzso appears to be dependent on the formation of a zzso bond between the third zzso zzso and the second zzso zzso zzso of this zzso bond represents a cause of color vision deficiencies that is unrelated to spectral shifts of the zzso
