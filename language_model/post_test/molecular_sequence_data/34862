In this study we describe molecular mechanisms of resistance to several classes of antibiotics within drug targets by in zzso zzso comparisons for bacteria of the zzso zzso Apart from the zzso in the zzso gene in naturally zzso zzso species previously reported by our team, we found that zzso group zzso zzso had a triple zzso acid difference in the highly zzso region of the zzso zzso protein as compared to the spotted fever group zzso zzso which could explain the natural resistance of zzso zzso to zzso We found also that the zzso of zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso Finally, either zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was missing in the zzso of zzso strains explaining the natural resistance to zzso Finally, multiple genes zzso for pump zzso were found especially in the zzso of zzso zzso that could be involved in resistance to zzso Five specific zzso related to zzso resistance have been identified in the zzso of zzso zzso including a zzso resistance protein zzso a class C zzso a class D zzso a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso For the first time, using this approach, an experimental zzso activity has been shown for this zzso We believe that whole zzso sequence analysis may help to predict several zzso characters, in particular resistance to antibiotics for zzso zzso zzso
