zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso has always been studied as a zzso zzso in plant cells where it serves to degrade zzso and provide carbon for zzso and synthesis of cell wall zzso and zzso We report here that at least half of the total zzso of developing cotton fibers zzso zzso is tightly associated with the plasma zzso zzso this form of zzso might serve to channel carbon directly from zzso to cellulose and/or zzso zzso in the plasma zzso By using detached and zzso cotton zzso we show that carbon from zzso can be converted at high rates to both cellulose and zzso zzso of cellulose or zzso is favored by addition of zzso or calcium and zzso zzso These findings contrast with the traditional observation that when zzso is used as zzso in zzso zzso is the major product zzso zzso studies show that zzso can be localized at the fiber surface in patterns consistent with the deposition of cellulose or zzso Thus, these results support a model in which zzso exists in a complex with the zzso zzso and serves to channel carbon from zzso to zzso
