zzso zzso of hydrated zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso at zzso zzso ratios of 1:10 and zzso were recorded as a function of pressure from atmospheric to 22 zzso zzso features corresponding to zzso of the zzso linkages in zzso and to various functional groups in zzso zzso zzso zzso were monitored in order to investigate the structure and dynamics of zzso zzso zzso was found to cause zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso chains in zzso zzso The magnitude of these disorders was higher for higher concentration of zzso in zzso The higher concentration of zzso was also found to disrupt the zzso zzso through interactions with the zzso head zzso Such disruption may be related to some of the biological properties of zzso
