A new member of human origin recognition complex zzso has been cloned and identified as the human zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso by a zzso zzso whose zzso acid sequence is zzso identical to zzso zzso has a putative zzso zzso binding motif that is not seen in zzso zzso also reveals an zzso zzso to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso expression and protein levels remain constant through the cell zzso zzso is zzso from cell extracts with another zzso of human zzso zzso consistent with it being a part of the putative human origin recognition zzso
