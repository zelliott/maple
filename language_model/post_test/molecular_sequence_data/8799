The binding capacity of large sets of peptides corresponding to naturally occurring sequences and carrying previously defined zzso motifs was zzso It was found that only a minority zzso of the zzso peptides bound the relevant zzso zzso with good affinity zzso 50% zzso or zzso 50 zzso while the majority of them bound only zzso or not at all zzso 50% zzso or zzso 500 zzso By zzso the presence of specific zzso types at each position along the zzso sequence with average binding zzso the prominent influence of specific secondary interactions zzso anchor zzso was zzso Moreover, secondary interactions appeared to be zzso in that the specific effects detected differed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on these zzso zzso refined motifs were also established for both zzso and zzso zzso and their merit was verified by testing the binding capacity of independent sets of synthetic zzso Such refined motifs should facilitate accurate prediction of potential zzso zzso zzso It was also noted that certain crucial secondary interactions appear to be remarkably similar in the case of zzso and other zzso molecules previously analyzed zzso A3, zzso and zzso This may reflect contributions to binding affinity of relatively zzso zzso located within the zzso pockets of the zzso binding zzso
