The zzso plant zzso zzso comprises a range of species whose zzso zzso have different degrees of reductions in their coding zzso In this study, four zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that possess substantial zzso differences, were zzso with respect to the sequence and promoter structure of the zzso gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso Whereas the coding region of this gene is highly zzso among all four zzso species, significant differences were observed in the zzso region zzso of zzso with respect to both the length of the zzso region between zzso and zzso and the promoters used to initiate zzso of the zzso zzso In the green species zzso zzso zzso zzso starts from a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter that is missing in the other three species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Instead, a zzso zzso sequence immediately upstream of the mapped zzso ends bearing the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter motif could be identified in these three zzso The lack of a zzso promoter in these species zzso with the loss of two genes that zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
