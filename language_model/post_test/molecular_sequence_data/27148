Gene zzso is a major force for generating evolutionary zzso that lead to adaptations to zzso We previously identified two zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso and zzso in zzso a zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso locus responsible for zzso zzso In zzso insensitive lines, zzso is zzso by the zzso of a zzso in zzso zzso Here, we describe the detailed characterization of the element and its evolutionary significance zzso from the distribution of the zzso that harbors the zzso zzso characteristics indicated that the element, designated zzso is a novel zzso zzso in zzso which was zzso related to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The element was zzso active, and the zzso was partially zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso were detected in a zzso sequence database of zzso most of which appeared zzso zzso that harbors the zzso zzso was detected only in cultivated soybean lines grown in northern regions of Japan, consistent with the notion that zzso zzso caused by the dysfunction of zzso is one of genetic changes that allowed soybean zzso at high zzso Taking into account that genetic zzso is zzso by the two zzso zzso we propose a novel model for the consequences of gene zzso and zzso of zzso when the gene is zzso zzso zzso that causes the loss of a gene function can lead to zzso evolution while the zzso is sustained by the zzso effect brought about by gene zzso
