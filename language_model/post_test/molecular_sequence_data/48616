zzso zzso zzso constitutes the largest zzso in human zzso In particular, zzso zzso are the most abundant structural module within cell surface zzso functioning in nervous as well as immune zzso Here I describe some key sequence signature of an zzso zzso domain from known structures of zzso zzso These signature zzso define the zzso zzso domain, which should aid structural and functional studies of cell surface zzso
