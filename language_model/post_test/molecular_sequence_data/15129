zzso is a zzso zzso found in variety of organisms including plants, zzso and zzso In insects, zzso is thought to play an important role in zzso zzso with its ability to catalyze the zzso of zzso compounds to their corresponding zzso From the newly zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we zzso a zzso form of zzso zzso with zzso zzso Mass zzso analysis of the zzso fragments and zzso sequence analysis revealed that the gene for the zzso zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso one of the multiple zzso genes found in insect zzso zzso is highly expressed in the zzso prior to zzso suggesting that the zzso protein accumulates before zzso However, the zzso of newly zzso zzso does not have zzso activity, and the activity only becomes zzso several hours after zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso is zzso as an inactive zzso which is later activated after zzso We also found that zzso zzso protein extract contains an inactive form of zzso that can be activated by zzso zzso
