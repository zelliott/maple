The zzso regulatory proteins zzso and zzso of zzso coli K-12 regulate expression of the major outer membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that is involved in both the positive and negative control of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso in response to environmental zzso We used DNA migration zzso analysis to examine the interactions of zzso and the zzso form of zzso zzso with the regulatory region immediately upstream of the zzso zzso Our results indicate that the binding of zzso to this regulatory region is cooperative and that zzso significantly stimulates these cooperative zzso Moreover, although zzso increases the intrinsic binding of zzso to a single zzso site, the primary role of zzso in zzso regulation is to facilitate cooperative interactions between zzso molecules bound at adjacent zzso Based on these results, we propose a model to explain how the zzso of zzso could stimulate the occupancy of specific sites in the zzso regulatory region, thereby resulting in the zzso or repression of zzso zzso under the appropriate environmental zzso
