We describe a selection procedure for construction of very high affinity zzso of human growth hormone zzso for binding to the extra cellular domain of its zzso (called the zzso Five different libraries of zzso zzso genes (each containing approximately 2 zzso zzso protein zzso were created by randomly mutating four different zzso at zzso that were shown to be important for zzso binding by structural or functional zzso zzso proteins were displayed as single copies from their respective zzso zzso particles and sorted in zzso for binding to the immobilized zzso zzso particles that bound the immobilized zzso were zzso and zzso After three to seven rounds of binding zzso zzso zzso were isolated that contained 2 to 4 zzso and exhibited three- to zzso improvements in binding zzso Because of the limits of DNA zzso efficiency in creating the library we could not sample thoroughly zzso at more than four zzso at zzso Nonetheless, the free energy effects for these zzso acted zzso Thus, by combining affinity enhanced zzso from libraries independently sorted we created an zzso zzso with 15 zzso that bound approximately zzso more tightly to the zzso than zzso zzso The affinity enhancements occurred predominantly by slowing the zzso of the hormone zzso zzso and partly through increasing the zzso (up to zzso zzso that were shown to be important for binding by zzso were most highly zzso after binding selection, and interestingly many of them could be further zzso Thus, we found it most effective to randomly mutate the zzso that were shown to zzso affinity by zzso and to combine the zzso from separate libraries that exhibit the highest zzso The selection procedure and zzso strategy provides a framework for affinity maturation of zzso zzso
