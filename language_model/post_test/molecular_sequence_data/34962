zzso zzso a newly described zzso species found living in pine shoot tunnels bored by the pine tip zzso zzso zzso zzso has potential as a zzso to transport biological agents for controlling this zzso zzso of pine trees because of the high degree of niche overlap zzso between zzso In order to help determine the suitability of potential biological control zzso it is useful to obtain knowledge concerning the zzso variation of the zzso We examined zzso zzso collected from 14 different geographical populations in China using zzso and molecular zzso An zzso zzso based on zzso characters showed divergence of populations of zzso zzso in a comparison of zzso from southwestern and 3 other geographic regions zzso zzso and eastern zzso We also compared zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso I gene from 56 zzso 19 zzso were identified based on 28 zzso sites in this zzso A zzso zzso tree showed significant genetic divergence among the different populations in eastern zzso In addition, absence of shared zzso coupled with high zzso zzso values, demonstrated significant genetic divergence between the populations from the southwest and the other 4 main geographical regions zzso zzso central, and northwestern zzso Generally, we found the zzso divergence to be zzso with genetic divergence in these zzso zzso zzso This information should be useful for selection of suitable source materials in the species gene pool for future biological control zzso
