zzso mimicry of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in nervous tissue is considered to induce zzso zzso that lead to zzso syndrome zzso an acute zzso To determine whether specific bacterial genes are crucial for the zzso of zzso structures and the induction of zzso zzso we characterized the zzso zzso LOS zzso gene locus in zzso and control zzso We demonstrated that specific types of the LOS zzso gene locus are associated with zzso and with the expression of zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso of 2 potential zzso marker zzso both involved in LOS zzso expressed truncated LOS structures without zzso acid, showed reduced zzso with zzso patient serum, and failed to induce an zzso zzso response in zzso We zzso for the first time, to our knowledge, that specific bacterial genes are crucial for the induction of zzso zzso
