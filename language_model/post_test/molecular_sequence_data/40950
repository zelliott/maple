In the present study, a full-length zzso zzso the zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso was cloned from the liver of zzso grouper zzso zzso by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The zzso zzso sequence was zzso zzso long and had an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso a predicted zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contained a putative signal zzso of 22 zzso acid zzso resulting in a mature protein of 248 zzso zzso Using zzso zzso tissue distribution pattern showed that zzso zzso was observed in all regions of brain with high levels, except lower levels in zzso and zzso In peripheral zzso zzso zzso was most abundant in liver, although relatively high levels were observed in zzso zzso and zzso Low or no zzso zzso expression was observed in other examined zzso From the zzso stage to the zzso stage, zzso zzso was expressed zzso Furthermore, 1 zzso zzso could inhibit the zzso zzso zzso expression significantly in zzso The zzso expression and regulation profiles suggest that the zzso may play important zzso roles in fish growth and zzso as well as cell growth and organ differentiation during the embryonic zzso zzso
