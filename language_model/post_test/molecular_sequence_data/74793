A zzso variable heavy chain zzso zzso zzso specific to the zzso zzso zzso was obtained after zzso of a zzso zzso zzso with the protein zzso zzso plus zzso Classic zzso After confirmation of a zzso response to zzso toxin in both conventional zzso and heavy chain zzso zzso zzso a zzso library was constructed from amplified zzso by zzso zzso zzso fragments with binding affinity for the zzso were selected by panning of the zzso library against zzso plates coated with zzso The dominant clone zzso was expressed in zzso coli and was zzso as a zzso zzso zzso at a final concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was fused to the zzso domain of the B zzso of zzso to generate the zzso format of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and was zzso at a final concentration of zzso zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance zzso analysis of soluble zzso binding zzso to immobilized zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated a zzso constant zzso of zzso Competitive direct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso polarization zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso and zzso confirmed binding to zzso Competitive zzso zzso with zzso and zzso determined zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, for zzso zzso These values were similar to the zzso value of zzso zzso for zzso given by zzso zzso serum sampled 56 days after zzso Competition formats for structurally related zzso resulted in no zzso to: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our study confirmed that zzso zzso fragments capable of binding low molecular weight zzso can be produced through the creation and panning of zzso zzso zzso zzso
