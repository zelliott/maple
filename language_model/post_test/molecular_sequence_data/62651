The zzso 24 zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that is specific for zzso tuberculosis complex and zzso zzso The present study was carried out to identify the zzso T helper 1 zzso zzso of the zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso zzso by using 15 overlapping synthetic peptides zzso zzso overlapping by 10 zzso covering the sequence of the complete zzso The analysis of zzso sequence for binding to 51 zzso of nine zzso defined zzso zzso by using a virtual zzso prediction program zzso showed that eight of the 15 peptides of zzso were predicted to bind zzso to zzso zzso from more than or equal to three zzso defined zzso zzso The zzso zzso of all the peptides was assessed in zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso with peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from 37 zzso zzso zzso healthy zzso The results showed that 17 of the 37 donors, which represented an zzso group, responded to one or more peptides of zzso in the zzso zzso Although each zzso zzso zzso from one or more donors in the above zzso the best positive responses zzso zzso zzso were observed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggested a highly zzso presentation of zzso to zzso zzso In addition, the sequence of zzso is completely identical among the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which further supports the usefulness of zzso and zzso in the zzso vaccine design against both tuberculosis and zzso
