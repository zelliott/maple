Red zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso are zzso and ecologically distinct plant zzso In addition, the two zzso differ in the role of coat protein zzso in zzso zzso However, both are small zzso viruses requiring zzso for systemic movement in the host zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso gene is capable of zzso the vascular movement of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene with the zzso zzso gene permits movement of the resulting zzso virus to zzso zzso zzso lacking a zzso gene or containing a zzso zzso zzso gene do not move zzso This report introduces the molecular characterization of zzso and describes the unprecedented zzso of systemic movement function by zzso complete substitution of a plant virus zzso zzso
