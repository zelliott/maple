A zzso chain reaction zzso zzso followed by partial sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso gene was performed for the presence of zzso and/or zzso A total of 242 zzso ticks were collected from domestic zzso and their shelters, as well as humans, and their individual zzso zzso were dissected out for zzso From the 242 ticks zzso six zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso one zzso zzso and two zzso zzso were zzso Of these zzso samples directly obtained from the zzso products, three sequences from zzso zzso zzso were identical to that of the gene of zzso zzso zzso One sequence identified in zzso zzso was closely related to zzso zzso The remaining two sequences detected in zzso zzso were similar to that of the gene of zzso zzso The study presented here provides preliminary data regarding the presence of zzso pathogens in ticks in zzso
