zzso genes containing the coding sequence for bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso have been introduced by zzso into zzso zzso (Black Mexican zzso and transient expression monitored by zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression were enhanced zzso and zzso respectively by the inclusion of zzso alcohol zzso zzso 2 and 6 in the zzso zzso This enhancement was seen when the zzso was placed within the zzso translated region but not when it was located upstream of the promoter or within the 3' untranslated zzso zzso of zzso sequences adjacent to zzso 2 abolished its ability to mediate enhancement of zzso gene zzso Northern analysis of zzso zzso with zzso zzso revealed elevated levels of zzso zzso However, this zzso was insufficient to account for the increased zzso zzso One explanation of these results is that zzso affects both the quantity and quality of zzso
