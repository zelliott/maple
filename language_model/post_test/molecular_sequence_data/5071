The zzso zzso zzso is a high molecular mass zzso 700 zzso zzso zzso complex which is the focus of worldwide research in order to identify the structure, mechanism of action and specificity of the zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities of ostrich liver zzso The zzso was zzso from ostrich liver by employing ammonium zzso zzso followed by three sequential zzso steps on zzso Super zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and pH zzso were examined and the effect of zzso detergents, fatty acids and zzso on the zzso activities was zzso zzso zzso exhibited a relative zzso of approximately zzso using zzso zzso PAGE and zzso into the characteristic zzso associated with the zzso zzso during zzso The pH zzso for the zzso activities were found to be slightly alkaline zzso zzso and neutral zzso and zzso zzso zzso liver zzso was found to be activated in terms of the zzso activity by fatty acids and zzso whereas the zzso and zzso activities were zzso zzso zzso zzso in its zzso by zzso zzso was similar to the zzso extracted from other zzso The specificity of the zzso appears to be very zzso although it lacks zzso zzso The yield compared zzso with similar extraction procedures which have been zzso On the basis of the zzso and kinetic properties which ostrich liver zzso zzso it can be safely concluded that it zzso well with the zzso isolated from many other zzso
