We have characterized a zzso zzso zzso into a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso Its predicted zzso acid sequence shares significant zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are implicated in zzso and cell zzso zzso encodes a protein of 465 zzso zzso and contains an evolutionary zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso and a highly zzso domain at the C zzso zzso zzso reporter gene expression in transgenic zzso was first detected at zzso in the neural fold, and high levels of expression continued throughout zzso in the neural tube and zzso In addition, a low level of transient expression was detected in the zzso gut, and zzso arches of mouse zzso Overall, reporter gene expression zzso zzso zzso expression during mouse zzso In adults, zzso transcripts were only detected in the brain and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso sequences exist in several zzso species including zzso frog, chicken, mouse and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso into the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso no obvious zzso associated with the promoter trap were detected in transgenic zzso or adult zzso In zzso we report the first isolation of a novel full-length zzso zzso and extensive characterization of its expression during mouse zzso and in adult zzso
