The protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not exist freely in the cell and its activity must be very strictly zzso Several protein zzso of zzso have been described including the classical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Association of these zzso with zzso appears to involve multiple contacts and in the case of zzso no less than five zzso interaction zzso have been zzso In this report, we provide both in zzso and in zzso evidence that the zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein zzso that is an zzso of zzso zzso being the first zzso interacting protein characterized in this social zzso Despite the low overall sequence similarity of zzso with other zzso sequences and its long zzso extension, the five zzso interaction motifs proposed for zzso zzso are reasonably zzso in the zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso interacts with and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which we have previously zzso Moreover, using zzso zzso zzso we show that a stable interaction of zzso with zzso requires multiple zzso
