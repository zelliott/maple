The effects of nicotine on the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso levels, and the zzso of zzso zzso were studied in bovine adrenal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso caused an immediate zzso zzso 1 zzso of ME followed by a delayed zzso zzso zzso after zzso into the zzso zzso with the zzso antagonists, zzso (1 zzso and zzso (1 zzso up to 6 zzso after the nicotine treatment significantly inhibited the delayed zzso of ME induced by zzso However, zzso long-term zzso of ME was not affected when zzso zzso were added 9 or 12 zzso after the nicotine zzso zzso (24 zzso stimulation of zzso cells with nicotine also increased zzso zzso zzso This zzso response was inhibited by zzso with zzso zzso zzso 1, 3 and 6 zzso after the nicotine zzso As with the zzso experiments, these zzso zzso did not affect the zzso responses when they were added at 9 and 12 zzso zzso with zzso (1 zzso zzso (1 zzso or zzso (5 zzso up to 6 zzso after the nicotine treatment significantly inhibited the increases of the long-term zzso of ME and zzso zzso level induced by zzso However, these agents were ineffective in blocking the long-term zzso of ME and zzso zzso level induced by nicotine when zzso cells were zzso after 9 and 12 zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
