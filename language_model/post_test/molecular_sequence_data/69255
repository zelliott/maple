We have cloned and expressed a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso factor, zzso This zzso extends beyond the zzso of a previously reported zzso zzso et zzso Cell 66 (1991) zzso zzso our zzso includes an zzso start zzso which was absent from the previously reported zzso where it was suggested that translation might initiate at a zzso zzso instead of at an zzso zzso Using the zzso virus zzso expression system, we demonstrate that translation starts at the conventional zzso start zzso and not at the zzso zzso The protein is zzso as a zzso of 282 zzso acids zzso that is zzso processed by removal of the initial 73 zzso to a mature protein of 209 zzso
