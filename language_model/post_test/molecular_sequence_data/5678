At least three zzso protein zzso zzso zzso were identified in zzso each consisting of a zzso zzso module composed of a zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso These zzso play key roles in relaying various zzso zzso or pathological signals from the environment to the zzso machinery in the zzso One of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates the zzso activity of zzso in response to growth factors, zzso zzso and certain environmental zzso such as short wavelength zzso light or zzso zzso The zzso are directly activated by the zzso zzso However, zzso of the gene zzso this zzso by zzso zzso suggested the existence of at least one more zzso zzso Recently, the zzso cascade was found to be structurally and functionally zzso in zzso where zzso is activated by the zzso zzso zzso By a database search, we identified an expressed sequence tag zzso zzso a portion of human zzso that is highly related to zzso zzso We used this zzso to isolate a full-length zzso clone zzso a human zzso We show that zzso is a highly specific zzso zzso Unlike zzso it does not activate the related zzso zzso Although the regulation of zzso activities and that of zzso activities could be very similar, the two zzso may play somewhat different regulatory roles in a zzso zzso
