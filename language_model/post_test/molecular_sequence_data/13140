The zzso cell line is derived from primary human zzso zzso that have been zzso with human zzso virus type zzso At late passage, these cells produce invasive zzso cell zzso when injected into nude zzso A striking, but zzso aberration of zzso 3 occurs very early after establishment of the culture; a consistent zzso is observed zzso with zzso Using molecular zzso techniques, we characterized the complex development of this zzso A whole zzso probe to this zzso was made by zzso zzso amplification of a single zzso zzso zzso of this probe to normal zzso zzso revealed the der zzso to be composed of zzso 3, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso probe and a zzso V probe which maps to zzso indicated that this locus is duplicated in the final form of the zzso but that much instability occurs prior to its zzso The zzso zzso which maps to zzso is zzso to the zzso when the cell line becomes zzso but not prior to this zzso zzso cells which have been induced to become zzso by exposure to the zzso zzso also have the zzso of the zzso at zzso
