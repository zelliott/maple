zzso zzso are major zzso of woody materials in zzso environments because of their ability to decompose zzso However, little is known on the possible associations of zzso zzso with other zzso during wood zzso We investigated the numbers, community composition and functional traits of bacteria present in natural wood samples under advanced zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The wood samples contained high numbers of zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso colony forming units zzso per g of dry zzso Most zzso bacteria belonged to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The same zzso were also found to be dominant zzso and zzso zzso using a zzso zzso technique, zzso direct cloning and sequencing of zzso genes extracted from zzso zzso that could be zzso consisted of zzso strains that seemed to rely on zzso released by zzso zzso activities of the zzso There were no indications for antagonism zzso of the bacteria against the zzso
