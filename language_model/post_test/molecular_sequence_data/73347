The zzso effects of zzso are zzso by the obese zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso Several zzso of zzso that differ in the length of the zzso domain have been zzso An zzso with a long zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso termed zzso contains the zzso box 1 and box 2 motifs and is likely to be responsible for zzso zzso A point zzso in the zzso gene of diabetes zzso mice generates a new zzso donor that interferes with the correct zzso of the zzso zzso and is predicted to cause absence of the zzso protein in zzso zzso Here we examined the signaling potential of the long zzso zzso and of a short zzso zzso in zzso cells, a zzso zzso cell zzso The long zzso was able to generate a zzso signal and upon zzso zzso activated zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso The short zzso zzso was inactive in both proliferation and zzso zzso These results provide further support for the long zzso zzso being the principal zzso of the effects of zzso and help to explain why zzso mice are resistant to zzso despite the presence of the short zzso zzso
