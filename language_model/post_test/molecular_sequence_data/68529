The zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso first appear at the initiation of zzso and their expression continues throughout zzso These zzso proteins have not been detected in any other adult or fetal sheep zzso and are specific to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso recognizes the zzso zzso common to a group of proteins ranging in molecular mass from 30 to 200 zzso whose function during pregnancy remains zzso The zzso properties of these uniquely expressed zzso were investigated by analyzing both the zzso and protein portion of the zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso A binding to zzso separated zzso proteins revealed that the major proteins between 40 and 70 zzso bind zzso In contrast, zzso A bound only to minor proteins in the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso revealed that the major chains are zzso zzso and complex partially zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso acid in an zzso structure indicates the unique nature of this zzso zzso The differential binding to zzso and zzso A provided a method for further zzso and characterization of the major protein components with zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins being further separated by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the major zzso zzso proteins zzso 62, and 57 zzso revealed partial zzso to zzso and bovine zzso zzso and rabbit zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso proteins showed zzso with zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that together these zzso represent members of a zzso zzso family of zzso molecules in the zzso zzso
