In this study we report the identification of a zzso Response zzso zzso zzso present in whole cell extracts of zzso cells and zzso zzso tumor cells which specifically binds to two classes of functionally distinct zzso In gel zzso experiments zzso binds preferably to zzso containing an zzso response element zzso or a symmetrical zzso response element zzso it binds less well to a zzso zzso and poorly, if at all, to a zzso response element zzso The zzso does not recognize zzso factor binding sites present in the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have zzso using gel zzso zzso that the zzso has a relative molecular weight under zzso conditions of 205 K zzso 20 zzso The zzso is not a steroid zzso as evidenced by different DNA sequence zzso cell type distribution, and molecular zzso We propose that by modulating the interaction of steroid receptors with target zzso the zzso plays a role in specificity of steroid hormone zzso
