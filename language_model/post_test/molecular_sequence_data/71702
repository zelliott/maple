In order to zzso the zzso activity relationship of zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso hybrid zzso several truncated peptides and the zzso with zzso acid zzso were zzso and their zzso zzso and zzso activities of were zzso zzso zzso 2 hybrid zzso zzso zzso as zzso in this zzso zzso is known to have potent zzso and zzso activity with less zzso zzso We found that the zzso region of zzso is more involved in the zzso structure on cell zzso environment than zzso one by circular zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the central hinge region of zzso produced a considerable reduction in zzso and zzso activity rather than an zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso or zzso in this hinge region of zzso caused retention of both zzso and zzso activity while causing a significant decrease in zzso zzso However, the substitution with zzso instead of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso hybrids resulted in a drastic decrease in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The increase of zzso at position 16 in zzso by substituting zzso or zzso induced a significant increase in zzso activity without a considerable change in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso these results suggested that the appropriate flexibility in the hinge region of zzso and zzso hybrid peptides and the appropriate zzso at position 16 in the zzso region of CA zzso are important in potent zzso and zzso activity with no zzso zzso
