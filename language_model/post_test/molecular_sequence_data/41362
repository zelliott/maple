zzso sequence features are explored in relation to the production of zzso zzso proteins by zzso zzso on features influencing protein production and zzso could be employed to improve zzso production levels in industrial zzso via protein zzso A large set, over 600 zzso and nearly 2,000 zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso using a standardized expression cassette and scored for high versus no zzso zzso zzso machine learning techniques were applied for identifying relevant DNA and protein sequence zzso The zzso composition of the protein sequence was found to be most zzso and interpretation revealed that, for both zzso and zzso gene zzso the same features are zzso zzso and zzso composition was found to have a positive correlation with high-level production, whereas for unsuccessful production, contributions were found for zzso and zzso zzso The predictor is available online at zzso zzso work aims at zzso these findings by protein engineering as a method for increasing expression levels per gene zzso
