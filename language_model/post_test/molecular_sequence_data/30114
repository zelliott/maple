The zzso gene of zzso zzso is one of at least five genes required for zzso incision of DNA during zzso zzso zzso This gene was previously cloned and zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso Reynolds et zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso In the present studies, we have mapped one major and three minor zzso start sites in the zzso zzso The locations of these sites relative to the zzso start zzso are remarkably similar to those previously identified in the zzso zzso gene zzso et zzso zzso Gene 36, zzso The two genes also share common sequences in these zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 83, zzso zzso is not induced following exposure of cells to the zzso agent zzso zzso Native zzso protein and also two different zzso fusion proteins are rapidly zzso in most zzso coli zzso However, following zzso of the cloned zzso gene in zzso native zzso protein was zzso to greater than zzso zzso A zzso function has not been identified for the zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the cloned zzso contain fewer than 500 molecules per zzso This is similar to the levels of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso repair proteins in zzso zzso
