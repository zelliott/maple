T cells recognize protein zzso as fragments zzso held in a defined binding site of class I or class II major zzso zzso zzso The formation of complexes between various zzso active peptides and different zzso molecules has been demonstrated directly in binding studies between the peptides and zzso zzso molecules of class II zzso Studies with intact cells, living or zzso have not directly demonstrated the binding of the peptides to zzso molecules on zzso cells, but the formation of such complexes has been shown indirectly through the capacity of zzso cells to stimulate specific T zzso Here we report evidence that supports directly the binding of zzso influenza zzso zzso zzso to products of the human class II zzso locus zzso on living zzso zzso lines, and we show that the zzso of such binding is much faster with living cells than with fixed zzso Furthermore, whereas the zzso zzso with zzso molecules of all zzso it binds zzso to zzso the restricting element in zzso zzso
