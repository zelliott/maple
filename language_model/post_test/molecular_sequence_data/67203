The sheep is an important model animal for testing novel fracture treatments and other medical zzso Despite these medical uses and the well known economic and cultural importance of the zzso relatively little research has been performed into sheep zzso and DNA sequences are available for only a small number of sheep zzso 

In this work we have zzso over 47 thousand expressed sequence tags zzso from libraries developed from healing bone in a sheep model of fracture zzso These zzso were clustered with the previously available 10 thousand sheep zzso to a total of zzso zzso with an average length of zzso zzso We used the newly identified sequences to develop zzso zzso for 78 sheep genes and measured differential expression during the course of fracture healing between days 7 and 42 zzso All genes showed significant shifts at one or more time zzso 23 of the genes were zzso expressed between zzso days 7 and 10, which could reflect an important role for these genes for the initiation of zzso 

The sequences we have identified in this work are a valuable resource for future studies on musculoskeletal healing and zzso using sheep and represent an important zzso for zzso sequencing projects for zzso zzso with partial or complete sequences being made available for over zzso previously zzso sheep zzso
