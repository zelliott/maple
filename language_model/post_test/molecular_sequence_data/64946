In most organisms, light plays a key role in the synchronization of the zzso timing system with the environmental zzso zzso Light zzso that zzso the zzso clock also induce the expression of period zzso genes in zzso Here, we report the cloning of a zzso per zzso zzso which is remarkable in being zzso by zzso We have developed an in zzso zzso reporter zzso for this gene in cells that contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso traces have enabled us to accurately measure zzso of the clock by zzso We have also exploited this model to study how four zzso elements in the zzso promoter regulate zzso zzso reveals that the integrity of these four zzso is crucial for maintaining low zzso expression together with robust zzso and repression by zzso zzso in the context of a minimal zzso promoter, the zzso elements also direct a robust zzso rhythm of expression that is significantly zzso compared with the original zzso promoter and lacks the zzso zzso Thus, these results reveal flexibility in the phase and light responsiveness of zzso rhythmic zzso depending on the promoter zzso
