Two zzso bacterial zzso designated zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso soil samples collected from zzso zzso zzso Finland zzso zzso N zzso zzso zzso zzso of both strains were zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the strains belong to the zzso zzso in subdivision 1 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso shared identical zzso and ERIC fingerprints and zzso % zzso zzso gene similarity indicating that, together with their identical zzso features, these strains are members of the same zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso A low zzso zzso value zzso zzso and zzso gene sequence similarity zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso soil zzso represent novel members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso grew at pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso were the preferred growth zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate the two zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
