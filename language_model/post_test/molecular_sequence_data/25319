Loss of zzso for zzso zzso including the RB locus is a common genetic zzso in zzso lung zzso zzso as well as in zzso We examined the RB zzso sequences of zzso 13 to 18 and zzso 19 to 23 in 9 zzso cell lines to detect zzso which cause zzso of the remaining zzso of the RB zzso Internal deletions of RB zzso were observed in 3 of the 9 zzso cell zzso In the zzso cell line, a 114 base pairs zzso deletion corresponding to zzso 22 was due to abnormal zzso which probably resulted from a zzso zzso within zzso zzso 22, and zzso 105 zzso RB protein was detected by zzso zzso A base pair deletion within zzso 20 in the zzso cell line and a 1 zzso deletion within zzso 23 in the zzso cell line were due to the deletions of the corresponding zzso DNA, and each deletion resulted in formation of a premature termination zzso These results indicate that both zzso of the RB genes are zzso in zzso by several different mechanisms, including small zzso zzso and zzso zzso
