zzso raised against human zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso has been used to identify a previously zzso rat zzso zzso zzso This novel zzso is designated rat zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and it characteristically zzso faster during zzso than does the zzso zzso zzso protein (now called zzso zzso zzso is essentially zzso with zzso zzso raised against zzso Besides its distinct zzso and zzso properties, zzso appears to be regulated differently from zzso as it is expressed in most rat zzso and does not appear to be induced by zzso Multiple forms of zzso have been zzso zzso zzso on zzso followed by zzso zzso on columns of zzso Orange A and zzso Blue, have been employed to purify zzso from rat liver zzso The zzso zzso step resulted in the resolution of zzso into three zzso of zzso activity, two of which were zzso and shown to be capable of zzso the reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The two most highly zzso zzso preparations zzso from the zzso Blue column were 91 and zzso zzso Analysis of these by zzso indicated that the least zzso zzso zzso comprised a zzso of zzso zzso whereas the most zzso zzso zzso contained two closely zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by contrast, in the present study, zzso was estimated by zzso to be composed of zzso zzso zzso Final zzso of the 37 zzso zzso in zzso and zzso was accomplished by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two preparations of the 37 zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded fragments of identical size, suggesting that they represent the product of a single zzso Furthermore, the zzso maps from zzso and zzso differed substantially from that yielded by zzso indicating that they are genetically distinct from the zzso zzso A zzso generated by zzso zzso of the 37 zzso zzso from zzso was shown by zzso degradation to share zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso of zzso This provides evidence that the rat protein identified by its zzso with zzso serum is an additional member of the zzso zzso
