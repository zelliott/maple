Three binding sites for zzso protein were shown to be required for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Selective zzso of zzso sites on the DNA demonstrated that zzso and zzso are required in zzso to produce repression of zzso in the presence of zzso whereas zzso and zzso are required in its zzso We found that the zzso site zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso and zzso provide zzso zzso sites, which allow cooperative binding at zzso zzso effects on the zzso promoter and the zzso promoter are produced by zzso changes in zzso occupancy of functional sites on the zzso We suggest that zzso exerts its zzso of controls through two alternative states of cooperative interactions with DNA and we illustrate this with a zzso This model presents our interpretations of zzso and repression of the zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso
