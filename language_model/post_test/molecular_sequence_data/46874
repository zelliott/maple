zzso is a protein component of the membrane domain of tight zzso and has been shown to be zzso in zzso in cultured cells and zzso zzso zzso However, nothing is known about the identity of specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, nothing is known about the interaction of zzso with zzso a zzso plaque component of tight zzso Here we report the isolation and sequencing of a complete zzso zzso zzso zzso and experiments aimed at mapping zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and characterizing zzso interaction with zzso The sequence of zzso zzso is zzso to that of zzso from other species, with identities ranging from zzso to zzso zzso expressed domain E of zzso zzso zzso acids zzso was a good zzso for protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not for zzso zzso protein zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as potential zzso zzso sites in this region based on sequence zzso zzso of zzso to zzso acid or zzso reduced zzso by zzso by approximately zzso and double zzso of zzso into zzso acid and zzso into zzso acid essentially abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso pull-down experiments using extracts of zzso A6 zzso cells showed that zzso of zzso fused to zzso and zzso forms of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso associate with several zzso and zzso analysis showed that one of these zzso is zzso zzso pull-down experiments using in zzso zzso full-length zzso zzso indicated that zzso interacts directly with the zzso region of zzso
