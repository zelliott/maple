zzso in the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso have been identified in patients with several forms of retinal degenerative zzso To investigate the mechanisms by which these zzso cause zzso zzso zzso zzso representing zzso known zzso as well as a set of zzso zzso were generated and tested for their ability to activate a zzso reporter in a transient cell zzso zzso To further define functional zzso several zzso zzso were similarly tested using a zzso response element containing zzso zzso This analysis demonstrated that the zzso region, between zzso acids 200 and zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso with this, four zzso carrying zzso zzso demonstrated significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso the importance of the zzso zzso four of the five zzso carrying HD zzso zzso displayed altered zzso activity, either decreased zzso or increased zzso In zzso zzso binding zzso zzso with zzso peptides representing the three HD zzso with decreased zzso activity, indicated that the zzso was due to reduced, but not zzso DNA binding to zzso zzso Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso involved in human zzso zzso act by zzso zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso However, a clear relationship between the magnitude of zzso zzso and degree of disease severity was not observed, suggesting that other genetic and environmental zzso may also contribute to the disease zzso
