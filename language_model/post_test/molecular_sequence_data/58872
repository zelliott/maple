The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso specifies head and tail as opposed to trunk zzso During later stages of zzso zzso is also expressed and required in a small number of zzso and zzso in the developing zzso zzso encodes a zinc finger protein of unusual but characteristic zzso We made use of these unique features to isolate zzso genes from zzso Here we report the isolation and molecular characterization of two zzso zzso units, termed zzso and zzso which are located on zzso zzso and zzso zzso Their transcripts are expressed in a limited number of adult zzso including the zzso While zzso is evenly expressed in different brain areas, zzso transcripts zzso accumulate in the corpus zzso and the zzso zzso In the fetal brain, transcripts of both genes were detected in zzso The arrangement of zzso zinc finger zzso and their high degree of sequence similarity suggest a novel and zzso zzso of human zinc finger zzso factors that is closely related to the zzso gene product zzso by the gene zzso
