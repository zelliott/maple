zzso clones coding for human zzso zzso zzso were isolated by zzso screening of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso comprises the entire coding region and has a total length of 1,394 zzso The sequence deduced from the open reading frame encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids and its zzso acid composition is identical to the zzso protein 9 zzso whose isolation and characterization were described by zzso et zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso human zzso shows high zzso to the rat zzso both proteins belong to the same protein zzso as human liver zzso zzso lens zzso and bovine lung zzso F zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis revealed a size for the zzso zzso of approximately 1,500 zzso In addition to the full-length zzso one zzso zzso clone was isolated which carries a putative zzso of zzso zzso at zzso position zzso corresponding to zzso acid position zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso coli resulted in the synthesis of a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 35 zzso which can be zzso specifically with zzso raised against zzso Despite the absence of a typical signal zzso the human zzso zzso is partially zzso into the zzso of the zzso coli cells, where it is present in an zzso active zzso
