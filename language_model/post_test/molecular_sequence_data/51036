A zzso pair element within the zzso promoter, termed the zzso zzso control zzso has previously been shown to be the target of zzso regulation by the product of the zzso zzso zzso We have identified three nuclear proteins zzso control proteins zzso that complex with this promoter element in zzso The zzso gene does not appear to zzso the zzso as the expression of zzso in zzso does not correlate with zzso complex formation in zzso A single binding site for the zzso within the zzso zzso was identified, and the zzso required for zzso complex formation were zzso Similar sequences are found in the promoters of two additional genes that are regulated by zzso zzso and zzso 1), and binding zzso demonstrate that the zzso also interact with these zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso promoter led to a zzso stimulation of expression in transient zzso zzso zzso within the zzso binding site that abrogate stable interaction of the zzso with the zzso in zzso block zzso zzso activity in zzso Our results suggest a role for the zzso in zzso zzso and the regulation of zzso by the zzso zzso
