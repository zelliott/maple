The Syrian golden zzso zzso zzso is an important model in the study of zzso zzso However, as in other zzso little is known about the zzso that mediate zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso zzso we found no evidence for the presence of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cone zzso was demonstrated in the zzso both by zzso and zzso zzso When used as a probe in zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso one transcript zzso zzso in zzso retinal zzso These findings are in accordance with preliminary data from other investigators using zzso which showed one zzso zzso mechanism with a maximum sensitivity of zzso zzso but none at shorter zzso However, we found that zzso zzso of ultraviolet radiation zzso zzso caused phase shifts in locomotor zzso These results corroborate earlier reports that zzso radiation can regulate the zzso response in this zzso Having confirmed these apparently contradictory earlier reports, we discuss the mechanisms that might create a zzso zzso response in a green cone zzso Finally, we propose the use of the Syrian golden zzso as a model for zzso development and function in the absence of zzso zzso
