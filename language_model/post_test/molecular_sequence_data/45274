Recent findings suggest that the zzso link promotes both zzso and zzso zzso but the mechanism by which zzso influence the zzso of appropriate zzso and zzso differentiation remains zzso Previous studies suggested that the presence or absence of alternatively spliced zzso at zzso site 4 zzso in the zzso zzso domain may regulate zzso zzso We demonstrate that addition of the zzso insert selectively reduces the ability of zzso to cluster zzso and zzso zzso zzso although zzso of zzso and zzso zzso proteins remain zzso Furthermore, addition of the zzso insert decreases the binding affinity of zzso to zzso and zzso but has little effect on binding to zzso and zzso Additional zzso studies reveal the zzso binding interface zzso zzso activity to be composed primarily of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso on one rim of the zzso domain beta zzso zzso of two predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and binding to zzso consistent with previous findings that zzso binding is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was more readily disrupted by the zzso than zzso zzso protein zzso Perhaps zzso or zzso at least, is most important for zzso zzso formation or controlling the balance of zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that differential zzso binding affinities and zzso variations may play an zzso role in zzso zzso
