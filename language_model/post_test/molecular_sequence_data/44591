X-ray data have been recorded to zzso A resolution from a crystal of zzso zzso zzso using zzso radiation and an zzso zzso The zzso treatment of zzso motion led to a fivefold increase in accuracy and to a considerable quality improvement in the electron density maps with respect to an intermediate zzso zzso The final model has an zzso of zzso with a mean coordinate error of zzso A, as estimated from inversion of the zzso zzso The availability of an accurate structure at atomic resolution and of meaningful estimates of the errors in its atomic zzso allowed an extensive analysis of several zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and some zzso bond zzso The hydrogen atoms could be clearly identified in the electron density, thus providing zzso evidence on the zzso state of the zzso zzso zzso The atomic resolution revealed an appreciable extent of flexibility in the zzso active site, which might be correlated with a possible adaptation to different zzso The zzso treatment of zzso factors provided insights into the zzso nature of zzso The analysis of these motions in the two zzso zzso the zzso zzso pointed out a zzso movement in the zzso binding region of zzso
