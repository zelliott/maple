The identification of key molecules is crucial for designing zzso vaccines zzso among those zzso zzso proteins are candidate as a general class of malaria zzso zzso Here, the sequence analysis of an zzso malaria protein expressed in zzso named von zzso factor A zzso protein zzso is reported in 91 zzso zzso zzso circulating in different regions of zzso 

Clinical zzso were collected from north temperate and southern tropical regions in zzso zzso have been designed based on zzso zzso sequence zzso which amplified a zzso of about zzso zzso with no size zzso zzso sequencing of zzso products was used to determine zzso and further zzso analysis in zzso zzso sexual stage zzso zzso 

zzso zzso gene showed zzso zzso in size, with no zzso zzso analysis showed a similarity of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso however, Iranian zzso had 2 zzso zzso in 247 and 531 positions that were zzso substitution zzso zzso to A zzso and R zzso to S zzso in comparison with the zzso zzso 

This study presents the first large-scale survey on zzso zzso in the world, which provides baseline data for developing zzso zzso against both temperate and tropical zzso zzso zzso
