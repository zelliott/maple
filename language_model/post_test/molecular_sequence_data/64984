zzso are flanked by a partially zzso coding sequence that forms the immediate zzso junction sequence following zzso removal from zzso zzso evidence indicates that these sequences have been targeted by numerous zzso insertions during evolution, but little is known about this zzso Here, we test the prediction that zzso junction sequences were functional zzso sites that existed in the coding sequence of genes prior to the zzso of zzso To do this, we zzso identified nine cryptic zzso sites within the coding sequence of zzso genes from humans, zzso and zzso by zzso their normal zzso zzso zzso We found that seven of these cryptic zzso sites zzso exactly to the positions of zzso junctions in zzso genes from other zzso Because zzso genes are highly zzso we could conclude that at least seven zzso zzso are flanked by cryptic zzso sites, and from the zzso evidence, we could also conclude that zzso zzso were inserted into these cryptic zzso sites during zzso Furthermore, our results indicate that these zzso events were dependent upon the zzso zzso Because most zzso are flanked by similar zzso our results are likely to be of general zzso
