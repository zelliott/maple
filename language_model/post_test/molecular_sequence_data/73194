The zzso of crop plants has often involved an increase in zzso dominance (the concentration of resources in the main stem of the plant and a corresponding suppression of zzso zzso A striking example of this phenomenon is seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which exhibits a profound increase in zzso dominance compared with its probable wild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous research has identified the zzso zzso zzso gene as a major contributor to this evolutionary change in zzso We have cloned zzso by zzso tagging and show here that it encodes a protein with zzso to the zzso gene of zzso The pattern of zzso expression and the zzso of zzso zzso plants suggest that zzso acts both to repress the growth of zzso zzso and to enable the formation of female zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is expressed at twice the level of the zzso zzso suggesting that gene regulatory changes zzso the evolutionary divergence of zzso from zzso
