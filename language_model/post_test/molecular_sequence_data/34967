The zzso zzso zzso is selectively targeted to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso but the mechanism for targeting this and other zzso membrane proteins among the zzso is zzso To address the mechanism of zzso zzso we employed in zzso zzso tandem affinity zzso and mass zzso to identify a novel zzso zzso zzso which is important for the zzso trafficking of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are strongly impaired in zzso targeting of zzso and trafficking of the zzso was arrested in the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is located at the base of the zzso within the zzso pocket, where it associates with the zzso segment of the zzso zzso We propose that zzso mediates transit of zzso from the zzso pocket into the zzso membrane via interaction with the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso represents the first component involved in zzso trafficking of integral membrane proteins among zzso zzso Of considerable interest, zzso zzso zzso are strongly compromised for growth as zzso within host zzso Thus, zzso is also important for the disease causing stage of the zzso life zzso
