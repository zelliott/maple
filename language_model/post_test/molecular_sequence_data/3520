zzso is the major zzso zzso in most zzso The zzso maintains a reduced zzso environment and protects cellular components from damaging zzso zzso is zzso by the action of two zzso zzso steps, in which zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso and subsequently zzso zzso zzso adds zzso to the zzso Recently it was shown that the synthesis of zzso is crucial for the survival of the zzso stages of the malaria zzso zzso zzso by using the specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso In order to investigate further the synthetic zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso was cloned and expressed zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso shares only a moderate degree of identity with other known zzso but the zzso responsible for zzso and zzso binding are almost all zzso with the exception of the ones involved in zzso zzso The protein is active as a zzso with a zzso molecular mass of 77 zzso and the addition of reducing zzso such as zzso is essential in maintaining zzso activity, indicating that zzso groups are important for stability and zzso zzso The zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso were determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was in the same range as that of the zzso zzso However, the negative zzso observed for zzso binding to the rat zzso was not found for the zzso zzso This may be due to the zzso of several zzso acids in the zzso zzso
