The presence of zzso in zzso zzso has been reported to vary with zzso zzso and geographical origin of the zzso An understanding of the zzso in other related species is important for an overall perception of zzso resistance in zzso The objective of this work was to study the characteristics of zzso and their genes in strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated from clinical and zzso sources in zzso 

The zzso zzso (a zzso class A zzso and zzso (an zzso class C zzso were found to be present in all the clinical and zzso strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by double disc diffusion zzso The results showed differential expression of zzso as indicated by zzso of zzso whereas expression of zzso was quite zzso The presence of these zzso was also reflected in the high minimum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso antibiotics against these zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso revealed zzso in both zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso shared significant sequence identity zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The sequence identity of zzso of zzso zzso with these zzso was zzso The sequence identity of zzso gene of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was more zzso with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 compared to other species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso focusing data further revealed that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed presence of zzso and zzso genes and unequivocal expression of the two zzso Limited zzso was detected in zzso and zzso genes as judged by zzso zzso relationships showed that the two species shared a high degree of identity in their zzso zzso This is the first study reporting characteristics of zzso and their genes in strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated from Asian zzso
