In most cells and zzso containing zzso receptors zzso zzso regulates the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso As the zzso concentration is correlated with zzso zzso this zzso of zzso zzso may affect cellular sensitivity to zzso zzso decrease levels of zzso zzso in many cell lines and zzso however, in some zzso and possibly also at certain zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso within the zzso region and zzso promoter do not appear to be sufficient for zzso regulation of zzso zzso We have previously shown that both zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso can be reproduced in cell lines expressing a zzso human zzso complementary DNA zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso this zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that sequences within the transcribed region of the zzso gene are sufficient for zzso In this study we have determined the mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the human zzso zzso in the prostate cancer cell line, zzso and have identified the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso that are zzso The observations that zzso D blocked zzso zzso of zzso zzso but zzso had no effect are consistent with a model in which zzso is directly involved in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso showed that zzso treatment resulted in increased zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso zzso inserted zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso This zzso fragment, which is located in the zzso coding region, contains two putative zzso response elements zzso separated by 182 zzso The zzso ARE zzso zzso resembles a zzso of the zzso consensus hormone response element, recognized by several steroid zzso including zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is identical to a portion of an zzso region found in the rat zzso gene zzso Analysis of either zzso or zzso zzso revealed that these elements function zzso zzso protein binds to the zzso fragment, as demonstrated by zzso mobility shift zzso using a zzso fusion protein containing the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso These results indicate that the zzso coding region contains an zzso region that is involved in cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso
