zzso zzso zzso cells were unique among several human cancer cell lines which include two other prostate cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso in expressing zzso zzso as an exclusive zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso columns were used for a partial zzso of this zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso value zzso zzso for the zzso type 2 zzso was quite similar to the one reported for the cloned blood group H zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 35, zzso zzso was a potent inhibitor zzso ) zzso zzso The zzso showed zzso zzso preference for the zzso type 2 unit in comparison to the zzso in zzso core 2 zzso Its main features were similar to those of the cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso of terminal Gal in the zzso unit increased the zzso efficiency, whereas zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso type 2 decreased by zzso the zzso ability, whereas zzso type 1 was zzso zzso Lewis zzso did not serve as an zzso zzso the zzso zzso rather than the zzso zzso group of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso was essential for zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso was the best zzso among the zzso zzso Additionally, highly significant biological features of zzso were identified in the present zzso The synthesis of zzso H and Lewis b zzso became evident from the fact that zzso and zzso served as zzso zzso for this zzso Further, zzso was a very efficient zzso indicating that the zzso zzso group of the terminal Gal zzso in zzso H is not essential for the zzso zzso Thus, the present study was able to demonstrate three different zzso roles of zzso zzso zzso the expressions of blood group zzso Lewis b from Lewis zzso and zzso zzso
