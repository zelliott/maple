We have isolated, by zzso screening of a zzso zzso expression library, a zzso clone that represents the complete coding sequence for bovine alpha zzso The coding sequence predicts a zzso protein with three distinct structural features: a large, potentially zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso a single zzso domain (16 zzso zzso and a short zzso domain (6 zzso zzso Thus, the domain structure for this zzso is similar to that deduced for beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Douglas, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that two sets of zzso which are zzso at their zzso ends, are zzso Because both sets initiate upstream of the zzso start site, only one protein is zzso by this zzso alpha zzso is widely expressed in different zzso species, with the notable exception of man and Old World monkeys zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By Northern zzso analysis we were indeed unable to detect transcripts for this zzso in various human and Old World monkey cell zzso transcripts were readily detected in other zzso zzso However, by Southern zzso analysis, zzso sequences for alpha zzso were identified in human zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso although present in the human zzso is normally not zzso These observations have potential medical zzso Because many humans have high levels of circulating zzso directed against the zzso product of alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso Clark, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 84, zzso it has been suggested that zzso of this normally silent gene may play a role in zzso disease in man zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
