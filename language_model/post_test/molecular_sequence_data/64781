The zzso zzso zzso by a small gene family, are responsible for controlling the expression of a number of zzso genes and zzso events, including zzso important zzso such as flowering time and zzso zzso The understanding and control of flowering time are particularly important goals in zzso zzso development for diverse zzso and naturally occurring variation in the zzso genes might prove useful in breeding zzso Also of interest is whether variation observed at the zzso zzso in zzso zzso or in particular races, is a result of human zzso zzso genetic studies can reveal evidence of such selection in patterns of zzso and zzso In this study we report a population genetic analysis of the zzso gene family in zzso zzso zzso zzso in a diverse panel including both cultivated and wild zzso We show that the level of zzso variation in all gene family members is about half the average for this species, consistent with zzso selection acting on these zzso However, the rate of zzso acid substitution is accelerated at zzso compared to the other two zzso In comparisons to a closely related zzso species, zzso shows a pattern of intermediate frequency zzso acid changes that differ from the patterns observed in comparisons across longer evolutionary zzso There is also a departure from expected patterns of zzso and divergence at synonymous sites in zzso although the data do not fit a simple model of directional or diversifying zzso zzso zzso has a level of variation similar to that of wild relatives zzso zzso but many zzso are zzso including several zzso acid zzso
