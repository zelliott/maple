We have taken a combined genetic and zzso approach to identify major constituents of the zzso nuclear pore complex zzso A synthetic lethal screen was used to identify proteins which interact genetically with the major zzso protein zzso In zzso zzso present in similar amounts to zzso in a highly enriched preparation of zzso zzso have been characterized by direct zzso These approaches have led to the identification of two novel and major zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso are similar to each other and to an abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso and interestingly, zzso zzso can be zzso with zzso zzso In addition, the synthetic lethal screen identified genetic interactions between zzso and two other major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso manuscript submitted for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have determined that together, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso comprise greater than one-fifth of the mass of the isolated zzso zzso zzso of the genetic interactions between these proteins indicate that while deletion of either zzso zzso or zzso alone is not zzso zzso combinations zzso zzso of zzso is also not zzso However, zzso zzso zzso while lethal in combination with zzso and zzso zzso zzso are not zzso lethal with zzso zzso zzso We suggest that zzso and zzso may be part of a zzso symmetrical but functionally distinct zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we observed zzso abnormalities in the nuclear envelope as a function of zzso in the expression levels of zzso suggesting a specific zzso relationship between zzso components is required for the maintenance of normal nuclear zzso
