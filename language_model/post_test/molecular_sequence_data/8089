The remarkable zzso of cellular zzso DNA zzso derive their tight grip to DNA from a zzso protein that zzso DNA and zzso the zzso to the zzso The crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are ring shaped proteins for zzso zzso Although beta is a zzso and zzso is a zzso their structures are nearly zzso Even though they are not zzso the sliding zzso have a zzso zzso symmetry resulting from three zzso zzso zzso each beta zzso and two zzso zzso each zzso zzso These zzso have the same chain fold and are nearly identical in zzso The zzso acid sequences of 11 beta and 13 zzso proteins from different organisms have been aligned and studied to gain further insight into the relation between the structure and function of these sliding zzso Furthermore, a putative embryonic form of zzso is the size of beta and thus may zzso DNA as a zzso like the zzso zzso
