The difficult chemistry of nitrous oxide zzso reduction to gaseous nitrogen zzso in biology is zzso by the novel zzso zzso zzso cluster of the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso distinct forms of this cluster have been identified as zzso and zzso We have obtained a zzso A resolution crystal structure of the zzso species of zzso from zzso zzso zzso isolated under zzso zzso This structure reveals a previously zzso zzso with two oxygen atoms from zzso coordinated to zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso We ascribe this structure to be that of the zzso form of the zzso since the previously reported structures of two blue species of zzso also isolated zzso have zzso the zzso inactive zzso form, revealing a single water zzso at zzso Exposure of the zzso zzso to sodium zzso led to reduction of the zzso zzso site and the formation of a blue zzso zzso determination of this zzso at zzso A resolution showed that zzso was bound at the zzso site bridging the zzso and zzso zzso This structure represents the first observation of an inhibitor bound to the zzso edge of the zzso zzso providing clear evidence for this being the zzso edge in zzso These structures, together with the published structural and zzso data, give fresh insight into the mode of zzso zzso reduction and zzso
