A novel zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso agent of bacterial zzso disease on zzso was studied at the functional and molecular zzso zzso was shown to act rather specifically on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not on zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed that, in this zzso zzso with an estimated molecular mass of zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso acid sequences determined for several segments have corresponding zzso sequences in zzso a zzso gene found in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on this information, the zzso zzso consisting of an open reading frame of zzso zzso was cloned by screening a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Database searches and sequence comparison revealed that zzso has significant zzso to some family 13 zzso with all of the crucial zzso zzso involved in the zzso mechanism zzso but it shows no similarity to known zzso belonging to family zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso requires zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in an absence of zzso zzso zzso activity in crude protein extracts and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli and zzso was shown to have the same zzso characteristics in terms of kinetic zzso
