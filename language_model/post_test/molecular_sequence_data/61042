zzso zzso release channels such as zzso receptors play crucial roles in the zzso signaling that triggers zzso zzso in zzso Although the existence and the role of these channels are well characterized in skeletal and cardiac muscles, their existence in smooth muscles, and more particularly in the zzso is very zzso We have now clearly demonstrated the expression of zzso zzso zzso release channels in rat zzso smooth muscle, and for the first time, zzso zzso concentration experiments with zzso 1 on single zzso cells have revealed the existence of a functional zzso and zzso zzso release mechanism in zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso protection zzso on whole zzso smooth muscle demonstrate the existence of all three zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso with much lower levels of expression for zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso release mechanism in rat zzso is largely zzso by zzso Moreover, using zzso zzso concentration zzso and zzso protection zzso we have demonstrated that the zzso the percentage of cells responding to zzso and the function of these channels are not modified during zzso
