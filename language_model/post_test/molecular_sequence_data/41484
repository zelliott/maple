One group of zzso protein family, which shares only the zzso domain zzso is critically involved in the regulation of programmed cell zzso zzso we demonstrated a novel human zzso protein zzso as zzso which could induce zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Further analysis indicated that Bop mainly localized to zzso and used its zzso domain to contact the loop regions of zzso dependent zzso channel 1 zzso in the outer zzso zzso In addition, zzso Bop protein induced the loss of zzso zzso potential zzso and the release of zzso zzso Furthermore, Bop used its zzso domain to contact zzso zzso family members zzso zzso zzso A1 and zzso which could inhibit zzso zzso Bop would be constrained by zzso zzso proteins in resting cells, because Bop became released from zzso zzso induced by zzso agent like zzso zzso Indeed, zzso experiments indicated that Bop was partially required for VCR induced cell zzso Finally, Bop might need to function through zzso and zzso likely by releasing zzso from zzso zzso In conclusion, Bop may be a novel zzso factor that can engage with the regulatory network of zzso family members to process intrinsic zzso zzso
