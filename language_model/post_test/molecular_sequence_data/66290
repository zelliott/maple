The broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes a linear zzso in the C zzso of the zzso external region zzso of zzso This zzso is particularly attractive for vaccine design because it is highly zzso among human zzso virus type 1 zzso strains and zzso escape in zzso has not been zzso Multiple zzso genes were cloned from an zzso zzso C virus isolated from a 7-year-old zzso infected child who had zzso zzso zzso One clone zzso was resistant to zzso zzso as a result of an zzso substitution in the zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was present in zzso of the viral zzso and in all cases was linked to the presence of an intact zzso zzso Two other envelope clones were sensitive to zzso zzso but zzso was zzso less sensitive than zzso zzso at positions zzso and zzso within the zzso rendered zzso more sensitive to zzso but had no effect on zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso of these two zzso we further demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso domain in the zzso tail affected the accessibility of the zzso zzso as well as virus zzso zzso these genetic changes in the face of a zzso zzso response to the zzso strongly suggested immune escape from zzso responses targeting this zzso
