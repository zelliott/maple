An zzso zzso purple zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated in pure culture from a water sample collected from a saline pond with zzso water, located near zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso and grew zzso with a number of organic compounds serving as carbon sources or electron zzso zzso zzso zzso were of the zzso zzso zzso a and zzso of the zzso series were present as zzso zzso zzso and zzso were required for growth of strain zzso zzso analysis on the basis of zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso was related most closely to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso % zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and clustered with species of the zzso zzso of the family zzso On the basis of zzso and molecular genetic evidence, it is suggested that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
