The zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso regulates the formation of focal zzso and zzso stress fibers and hence plays an important role in cell zzso migration, and zzso zzso Using human skin zzso cultures, we demonstrate that alternative zzso of the neighboring zzso domain may regulate the activities of the zzso II domain in cell spreading and zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso adjacent to either the zzso domain or the zzso zzso zzso that contains the zzso sequence of the zzso domain, blocked zzso zzso and required zzso zzso to mediate cell zzso If the zzso II domain was adjacent to either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso which both lack the zzso zzso of the zzso domain, zzso was not inhibited and cell spreading was independent of a zzso zzso zzso The effect of the zzso zzso on the zzso II domain could be zzso using a zzso II domain that contained only 6 zzso acids from the zzso repeat or 10 zzso acids from the zzso domain suggesting that sequences zzso to the zzso repeat determined the role of the zzso II domain in these zzso We propose that alternative zzso of the zzso domain zzso interactions between zzso zzso zzso and the zzso II domain and that this serves as a mechanism to control the biological activities of zzso
