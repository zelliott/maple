It is suggested to use short zzso in the study of zzso relationship between different zzso It is likely that the presence of the above mentioned zzso copies in different zzso zzso to identical origin of these zzso The fact that the zzso of different species include not the same but similar zzso is considered as evidence for identical zzso zzso A new zzso was found in zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso This element has zzso with the B2 element of zzso rat zzso and zzso zzso The zzso elements were not detected in zzso and zzso zzso hence we suggest the earlier divergence of these animals from the route leading to zzso and zzso The structural analysis of the zzso element supported the role of the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso in the process of appearing the B2 zzso of zzso in zzso
