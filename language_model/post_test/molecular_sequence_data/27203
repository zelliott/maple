zzso diffusion zzso zzso are found in all three zzso of life and are involved in transporting transition metals out of the zzso The metals they transport include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso however, no single zzso zzso all zzso Previously we showed that a single zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso zinc zzso zzso changed its zzso specificity from zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nelson, Warner, Ward and Kaplan zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that gained iron transport activity could protect cells with a deletion in the zzso iron zzso zzso from high iron zzso zzso suppression of high iron toxicity and zzso zzso of zzso we identified other zzso acid zzso within zzso that changed its metal zzso All zzso zzso that transported zzso could also transport zzso Some zzso zzso lost the ability to transport zzso but others retained the ability to transport zzso All of the zzso acid zzso that resulted in a gain in zzso transport activity were found in zzso zzso In addition to zzso of zzso adjacent to the putative zzso binding site in two zzso zzso zzso of zzso distant from the binding site affected zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso selection involves zzso between zzso zzso
