With the increasing use of zzso such as zzso B, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients at high risk for invasive zzso resistance of zzso zzso to these agents will ultimately zzso Due to the limited availability of molecular zzso for zzso zzso few studies have addressed its mechanisms of resistance to zzso We transformed zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA library zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso which also has the zzso gene for zzso We obtained one zzso zzso that grew in medium containing a zzso concentration zzso zzso of zzso To determine whether zzso resistance in that zzso was zzso dependent, we evicted the zzso and found zzso loss of zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis identified the gene responsible for zzso resistance as the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso which encodes the target zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amplified from the zzso and cloned into zzso also zzso zzso zzso This molecular approach has the potential to enhance our knowledge of the mechanisms of zzso zzso resistance to modern zzso
