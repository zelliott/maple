Several zzso zzso zzso zzso were described in tick zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this work, we present a synthetic gene based on two tick zzso zzso zzso zzso the first domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso the zzso were named zzso and zzso zzso Our present results showed that zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and human plasma zzso zzso zzso and 35 zzso but in contrast to zzso the zzso did not inhibit human zzso zzso zzso was able to produce zzso response in mice but not in zzso In addition, it is the first description of a zzso inhibitor as a zzso zzso zzso zzso apparent zzso constant zzso for zzso L was 108 zzso Our findings open the possibility up to obtain new molecules as potent zzso or zzso zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso
