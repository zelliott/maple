Exposure of vascular zzso cells to fluid mechanical forces can zzso the expression of many genes involved in vascular physiology and zzso Here, we report that zzso growth factor zzso zzso gene expression is induced at the level of zzso in cultured bovine zzso zzso cells exposed to a zzso level of steady zzso zzso stress (10 zzso zzso zzso analysis of the human zzso promoter revealed that a zzso region near the zzso box was required for zzso reporter gene zzso This element zzso zzso zzso onto a zzso zzso construct that was otherwise unresponsive to zzso zzso The induction of zzso expression by zzso was preceded by rapid and transient induction in the expression of the zzso zzso zzso which binds to zzso zzso zzso shift studies indicated that zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso promoter in a specific and zzso manner, zzso zzso from their overlapping recognition zzso Overlapping consensus binding sites for zzso and zzso also appear in the zzso promoters of several other zzso zzso including transforming growth zzso 1 and tissue factor, whose expression is modulated by zzso zzso These findings define the zzso binding site in the zzso zzso promoter as a zzso element and suggest that zzso zzso gene expression may be a unifying theme in the induction of various other zzso genes exposed to zzso zzso
