Native zzso zzso receptors are zzso zzso of four or five zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been cloned in several species, including zzso The zzso zzso which in zzso is predominantly expressed during early development, seems to function by reducing the zzso zzso zzso The human zzso to the rat zzso however, had not been zzso In order to study the functions of the human zzso zzso we have cloned and zzso the zzso It was found to share zzso of the DNA sequence with the rat zzso corresponding to a zzso zzso at the zzso acid zzso Based on available data from human zzso databases, we localized the gene to zzso zzso The transcript could be detected by in zzso zzso in human fetal spinal zzso and zzso Two zzso zzso of zzso have been reported in rat brain, the longer of the two containing a 60 zzso insert in the zzso zzso We were unable to detect this 60 zzso insert in fetal or adult human brain, suggesting that only the short zzso is expressed in zzso
