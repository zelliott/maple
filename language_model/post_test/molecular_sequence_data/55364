This review focuses on quantitative protein zzso analysis based on coverage of both the zzso and zzso zzso In this way, zzso data on the degree of zzso can be measured, generating the most detailed level of zzso status analysis of zzso To highlight the experimental challenges in this type of quantitative protein zzso analysis, we discuss the typical zzso for mass zzso zzso with a focus on the quantitative analysis of zzso zzso We review zzso for measuring zzso degrees of zzso including the zzso approach, differential stable isotope labeling of zzso and methods based on the addition of stable isotope labeled zzso pairs as internal zzso The discussion also includes the determination of zzso zzso abundance data for multiply zzso motifs that contain information about the connectivity of zzso zzso The review closes with a prospective on the use of intact stable isotope labeled proteins as internal standards and a zzso discussion of the typical zzso of the individual zzso
