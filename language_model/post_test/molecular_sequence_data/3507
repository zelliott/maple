We have determined the solution structure of zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein of the large zzso of the zzso and binds to both 5 S and 23 S zzso In the zzso state zzso folds to a mixed zzso zzso structure with a long zzso zzso zzso We compared our high-resolution structure with zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso to examine zzso as well as zzso structural zzso We also identified zzso zzso zzso as a structural zzso and found that the structures of the zzso sites are zzso Important features, for instance a zzso in the zzso zzso are zzso in both zzso We suggest that the zzso fold recognizes a specific zzso motif and that the resulting zzso module is tolerant to variations in zzso
