zzso interference zzso is an zzso zzso mechanism of gene zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso Among the widely used zzso small interfering zzso zzso and short hairpin zzso have evolved as extremely powerful and the most popular gene zzso zzso The key challenge to achieving efficient gene zzso especially for the purpose of zzso is mainly dependent on the effectiveness and specificity of the selected zzso zzso zzso only a small number of zzso are capable of inducing highly effective and zzso gene zzso via zzso zzso In addition, the efficiency of gene zzso induced by zzso can only be zzso examined based on zzso of the target gene zzso zzso it is essential to develop a fully robust and comparative validation system for measuring the efficacy of designed zzso In this chapter, we focus our discussion on a reliable and quantitative zzso zzso validation system that has been previously established in our zzso The system consists of a short synthetic DNA zzso containing an zzso sequence of interest and two expression zzso for targeting reporter and triggering zzso zzso The efficiency of zzso is determined by their abilities to inhibit expression of the targeting reporters with easily zzso zzso including enhanced green zzso protein and zzso zzso Since only a readily available short synthetic DNA zzso is needed for constructing this reliable and efficient zzso zzso validation system, this system not only provides a powerful strategy for screening highly effective zzso sequences from zzso genes but also implicates the use of zzso zzso zzso for reverse functional zzso and molecular zzso
