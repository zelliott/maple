A zzso syndrome caused by molecular defects in the zzso zzso gene zzso ) results in partial to complete loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity with patients exhibiting life-threatening toxicity following administration of routine doses of zzso To date, more than 19 reported zzso have been zzso associated with zzso zzso with 16 occurring within the open reading frame of the zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the conservation of functional zzso (including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso across three zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the conservation of regions corresponding to the previously reported zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso and zzso binding sites in zzso and zzso demonstrated zzso zzso acid identity between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso and zzso identity in these zzso zzso The zzso sequences demonstrated zzso identity in two iron zzso motifs zzso acids zzso and zzso with significant conservation in zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity, zzso Comparative zzso acid analysis revealed zzso in the zzso of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Seven zzso occurred in highly zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso this comparative analysis identified zzso regions which may be critical to zzso structure and/or zzso The conservation of zzso where zzso zzso occur was also examined to evaluate their functional significance on zzso zzso zzso These data should prove useful in the evaluation of newly discovered zzso in the zzso zzso
