In higher plants, the zzso cell layer zzso of the shoot zzso gives rise to the zzso of shoot zzso Our previous study demonstrated that an zzso motif named the zzso box functions as a zzso element for zzso gene expression in the shoot system of zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso class of zzso zzso is expressed exclusively in the zzso of shoot zzso and that zzso zzso protein specifically binds to the zzso box in zzso Although knockout zzso of zzso and zzso another zzso zzso class gene sharing the highest zzso with zzso display normal shoot development, the double zzso results in severe defects in shoot zzso cell zzso This suggests that zzso and zzso are functionally interchangeable and play a critical role in maintaining the identity of zzso cells, possibly by interacting with their zzso box and those of downstream zzso zzso
