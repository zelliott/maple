To assess the zzso and zzso diversity of zzso zzso bacteria in zzso zzso zzso six zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso rock and zzso zzso in North and South Pacific Ocean zzso fields located at zzso m depth were fully zzso Three strains were isolated on media that contained zzso zzso of organic carbon zzso % zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene indicated that all strains belonged to the zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso with previously described species, the novel strains were slightly to moderately zzso and grew in media containing up to zzso % total zzso The zzso grew at temperatures as low as zzso to 2 degrees C and had temperature zzso of 30 or zzso degrees zzso Both the minimum and optimum temperatures for growth were similar to those of Antarctic and zzso zzso species and lower than typically observed for the zzso as a zzso zzso tests revealed that the zzso were zzso versatile and tended to have more traits in common with each other than with closely related zzso species, presumably a reflection of their common zzso zzso habitat of zzso The zzso content of the DNA for all strains was zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments revealed that four strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso represented novel species and that two strains zzso and zzso were related to zzso zzso The proposed new species names are zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
