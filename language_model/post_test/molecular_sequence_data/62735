We have identified 50 P zzso sequences in the zzso of zzso zzso by performing zzso searches against the public zzso database of zzso zzso using the zzso P element from zzso zzso as a query zzso While most of these sequences belong to P zzso previously described from zzso zzso at least four new zzso were zzso One of these zzso zzso P zzso which we termed zzso was zzso in zzso zzso consists of three zzso and does not have zzso terminal zzso This element retains several of the structural features of other zzso zzso such as motifs involved in zzso and zzso interaction, and a motif involved in zzso zzso Strong sequence and structural similarity to functional P zzso a number of zzso zzso that is smaller than that of synonymous zzso and the presence of putative nuclear zzso signals suggest that the zzso zzso elements may retain the capacity for zzso or its zzso These sequences seem to be most closely related to P elements described from zzso zzso and Lucilia zzso the only P element hosts known outside the family zzso
