A yellow, zzso zzso zzso zzso gliding zzso designed strain zzso was isolated from zzso sand of the Yellow Sea, zzso Analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso formed a distinct lineage within the family zzso sharing zzso % sequence similarity with type strains of species of the most closely related zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso The strain grew at zzso zzso and with zzso % zzso zzso It reduced nitrate to zzso and zzso gelatin and zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso : 0, zzso : 1 G and zzso : 0 and the major respiratory zzso was zzso Polar lipids included zzso zzso three unidentified zzso zzso and four unidentified lipids zzso The zzso DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso Data from this zzso study suggest that strain zzso represents a novel species in a new zzso in the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
