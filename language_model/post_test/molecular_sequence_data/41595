To investigate how zzso zzso and zzso zzso affect protein structure in various zzso solutions, in the present study we used zzso zzso as the model protein to study its folding process in zzso zzso and zzso process in zzso solutions, zzso It was observed that zzso moderately enhances the structure stability of native zzso consistent with the previous experimental observation that the hairpin zzso population of several zzso is increased in zzso solution compared to in pure zzso More interestingly, the formation of zzso is significantly accelerated in zzso zzso The accelerated folding of zzso consists of following sequential events: the zzso of zzso on protein surface zzso less water surrounding zzso group zzso zzso of zzso zzso the formation of zzso backbone hydrogen zzso In contrary, the zzso of hairpin structure of zzso zzso in zzso solution is induced by the zzso of zzso on protein surface and the hydrogen bonding from water as well as zzso zzso this study shows the importance of water in zzso formation and zzso zzso of zzso zzso
