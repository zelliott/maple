The zzso zzso and zzso zzso database zzso zzso sequence and structure of a highly diverse protein family, including mainly the zzso of zzso and zzso but also zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These proteins have a highly zzso structure, but display a remarkable diversity in sequence and zzso A total of zzso protein entries were assigned to 14 zzso families, forming two zzso zzso zzso alignments and zzso trees are provided for each zzso family and zzso zzso derived structures of 19 proteins are zzso and consistently zzso zzso and structure of all zzso proteins were systematically zzso Thus, deeper insight is gained into the role of a highly zzso sequence motifs and structural zzso
