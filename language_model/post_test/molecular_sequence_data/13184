The zzso zzso zzso zzso is comprised of several zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso gamma 1-3 and zzso In the present studies, the expression of alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 zzso zzso was examined in zzso zzso cells and deep zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice during zzso zzso In control animals, the three zzso zzso were present at high density in zzso cells which, in adult animals, form a zzso at the interface of the zzso cell and molecular zzso The number of zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso the majority of those that remain are retained within the zzso cell layer and are unable to receive normal zzso zzso from zzso zzso The three zzso zzso were ex pressed at similar levels in both zzso and control zzso cells until zzso day zzso After this time, although the alpha 1 zzso zzso was maintained at control levels in zzso zzso cells, the expression of beta 2 and gamma 2 zzso zzso zzso and was largely absent by zzso day zzso The loss of beta 2 and gamma 2 zzso expression in zzso was specific to zzso cells, since all three zzso were present throughout zzso development in other brain regions, including the deep zzso zzso The present studies indicate that in zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso alpha 1, and beta 2, and gamma 2, zzso zzso are regulated by distinct mechanisms which are zzso affected by the zzso zzso
