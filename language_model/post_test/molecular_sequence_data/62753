Three zzso zzso peptides have been isolated from the zzso of three different zzso scorpion species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the primary sequences reveals that they structurally belong to zzso 11 of short chain zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Garcia, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso van der zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1999) Trends zzso zzso 20, zzso These toxins are zzso zzso acids in length and have six aligned zzso zzso but they differ substantially from the other zzso toxins because of the absence of the critical zzso and their total overall negative zzso zzso 1 zzso which has been expressed by zzso methods, has been submitted to functional zzso Despite the lack of the zzso this toxin blocks several zzso channels zzso expressed in zzso zzso but with low affinities zzso zzso Because a relationship between the biological activity and the zzso zzso zzso may exist, we set out to zzso the relative impact of the zzso character of the toxin and the lack of the critical zzso on the weak activity of zzso toward zzso zzso To achieve this, a specific zzso named zzso zzso was made zzso and fully characterized on zzso channels zzso expressed in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso displaying an affinity toward zzso and zzso channels in the zzso range shows the importance of the functional zzso above the zzso character of this zzso
