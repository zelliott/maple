zzso analysis of human liver zzso preparations revealed that human zzso zzso zzso zzso Mr approximately zzso was expressed in each of 40 individual specimens zzso In about zzso of the zzso an zzso related protein having a lower zzso mobility (Mr approximately zzso was also zzso A single liver was found that expressed only the lower mobility zzso designated zzso and zzso isolated from this liver was used to construct a zzso zzso zzso The library was screened with an zzso zzso probe resulting in the isolation of a unique full-length zzso that was zzso and shown to zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this zzso contained 502 zzso a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and displayed zzso similarity with zzso The deduced zzso sequence of zzso was identical to that of zzso a major zzso zzso expressed in human fetal liver that is zzso zzso with several family III zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso cells using a zzso virus expression system and shown to zzso active zzso both characterized by reduced zzso zzso with zzso max at 450 zzso zzso analysis revealed that both zzso zzso were similarly active in catalyzing zzso of the calcium channel blocking drug zzso Both zzso also zzso 6 zzso of the steroid hormones testosterone, zzso and zzso although zzso exhibited zzso higher expressed activity than zzso Several minor zzso products of these steroids zzso 15 zzso zzso up to approximately zzso of the total zzso were formed by zzso but not zzso indicating that zzso is a more highly zzso zzso catalyst with steroid zzso Clear differences were also detected in their zzso activities toward the zzso drug zzso with two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso formed by zzso but only one zzso zzso formed by zzso These studies establish that zzso is a newly described zzso zzso that is zzso expressed in the adult human population and that has overlapping zzso specificity compared to zzso for metabolism of steroid and drug zzso
