The work reported here has been directed to the identification of new nuclear zzso zzso To achieve this goal, zzso from rat zzso were zzso and a fraction enriched in zzso and zzso proteins was extracted using zzso I and zzso zzso zzso proteins present in this nuclear zzso were zzso by zzso using first a zzso column and subsequently a zzso zzso Four major zzso of zzso zzso 48 and 45 zzso were found to bind to the zzso column in a zzso zzso zzso overlay analysis confirmed that the proteins of zzso 48 and 45 zzso are zzso zzso These proteins bind zzso and also zzso zzso A partial zzso acid sequence obtained from the 48 zzso protein revealed a zzso identity with the zzso zzso an zzso implicated in several zzso diseases, such as lupus zzso and zzso zzso zzso gel zzso Western zzso analysis and experiments of binding to zzso also supports the identity of zzso as zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso in the zzso regions within the nucleus of rat zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso resulted in an increase in the binding of zzso to zzso suggesting that zzso can play a role in the regulation of the association of zzso with zzso
