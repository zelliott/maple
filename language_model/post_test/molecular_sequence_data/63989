A zzso gene zzso was cloned from zzso zzso the cause of northern leaf blight of zzso by screening the zzso library from the fungus using a approximately 500 zzso zzso zzso of the gene as a zzso The gene is a second zzso gene cloned from the fungus and it is different from the previously cloned zzso gene zzso The two genes are grouped into separate zzso in a zzso tree based on DNA zzso The patterns of zzso and zzso transcript zzso were studied in zzso with different carbon and nitrogen sources and during infection of zzso by the zzso In culture high zzso transcript was detected in zzso obtained from medium containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso plus zzso as sole carbon zzso On the other hand zzso transcript was detected in a medium containing zzso zzso plus zzso but not in the medium where only zzso zzso was used as the sole carbon zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso inducing media had zzso effect to the expression of both zzso The zzso transcript zzso declined sharply with an increase in concentration of ammonium zzso and zzso acid, while increased zzso transcript was observed with an increase in zzso of the two nitrogen zzso zzso zzso transcript was detected at early and late stages of infection of zzso by zzso zzso On the other hand no zzso zzso transcript was found in northern zzso under the test zzso This study demonstrated that in zzso zzso zzso system zzso and zzso are zzso expressed and might play important roles in the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
