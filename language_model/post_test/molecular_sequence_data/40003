zzso remains indicate that the origin of western agriculture occurred in a brief period about 10,500 years ago in a region of the Middle East known as the zzso zzso where the wild zzso of several key agricultural cereal species are zzso zzso entailed the appearance of zzso traits such as seed size and zzso For a representative sample of 20 zzso barley zzso zzso lines, including 13 zzso and 7 zzso zzso we determined the zzso at seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso encompassing zzso bases per zzso compared them to the zzso at the same zzso for 25 wild forms zzso zzso collected within and outside the zzso zzso In comparisons of wild versus zzso zzso the number of zzso zzso zzso 17), average zzso diversity, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at silent sites zzso zzso zzso was reduced in zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced significant values of zzso zzso At zzso zzso was slightly higher in zzso than wild forms, due to divergent zzso zzso for the remaining six zzso zzso of zzso diversity has been lost in the zzso zzso zzso acting on zzso evolving zzso either during the zzso process, during subsequent zzso or both, are sufficient to account for reduced diversity and the results of zzso test, without the need to evoke selection at these zzso zzso networks data uncover distinct wild and zzso barley zzso and suggest that barley may have been zzso in the Jordan zzso Because, based on zzso data, the zzso Turkish zzso had a genetic basis as large as that present in large zzso collections, all comparisons provided in this paper are of general value more than being restricted to the Turkish barley zzso
