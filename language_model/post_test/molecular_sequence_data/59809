Two zzso zzso clones representing genes involved in zzso zzso nitrogen metabolism were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso responsible for ammonium zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso involved in the zzso of zzso the nitrogen transport form in zzso zzso zzso was found at highest levels in root zzso where it was present in the infected cells as well as in the cells of the zzso of the vascular zzso zzso transcripts were found at high levels in zzso confined to the infected cells, suggesting that in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso takes place mainly in the infected zzso
