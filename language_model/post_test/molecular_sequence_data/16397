A new member of the tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso response zzso zzso factor family, designated zzso has been isolated by zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso protein zzso binds zzso box zzso which mediate zzso zzso of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso activated by zzso by infection with the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso as well as by zzso with zzso mosaic virus zzso In contrast, zzso zzso is not enhanced after application of salicylic acid, zzso acid, or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso under control of the zzso promoter results in no visible zzso in plant growth or enhanced resistance to zzso zzso Furthermore, no zzso expression of zzso genes has been zzso In contrast, zzso plants show enhanced resistance to zzso with reference to reduced size of local zzso zzso and impaired systemic spread of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso plants, the viral zzso accumulates only up to 10 to zzso of the zzso level, we suggest that zzso gene expression is controlling resistance to viral zzso Previous research has demonstrated that zzso of zzso genes enhances resistance to bacterial and zzso zzso Here, we provide further evidence that resistance to viral infection can be engineered by zzso of zzso zzso zzso
