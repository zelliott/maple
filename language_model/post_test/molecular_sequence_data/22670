Plant disease resistance zzso genes mediate specific recognition of pathogens via perception of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The numerous highly similar zzso proteins from the bacterial zzso zzso provide together with their corresponding R proteins a unique biological resource to dissect the molecular basis of recognition zzso A central question in this context is if R proteins that mediate recognition of structurally similar zzso proteins are themselves functionally similar or rather zzso The recent isolation of rice zzso rice zzso and tomato zzso R genes that collectively mediate recognition of zzso zzso provides a first clue to the molecular mechanisms that plants employ to detect zzso zzso Their initial characterization suggests that these R proteins are structurally and functionally surprisingly zzso This review summarizes the current knowledge on zzso recognition of zzso proteins and provides working models on how recognition is achieved at the molecular zzso
