We have investigated the zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso gene which is involved in the zzso zzso of zzso aromatic zzso zzso genetic study using the fusion gene composed of the zzso upstream sequence of zzso gene and the structure gene for bacterial zzso zzso zzso and a cultured cell line of zzso cells localized two kinds of zzso regulatory DNA zzso One is designated zzso or zzso responsive element which is responsible for the zzso of the gene and is distributed 5 times in the region from zzso to zzso zzso The other is zzso or zzso zzso element whose deletion reduces a low level of the zzso zzso expression to a background level, and which is localized immediately upstream of the zzso zzso Both kinds of regulatory elements are necessary for a high level of zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso strongly suggests that the binding protein to the zzso is an zzso zzso with a specific affinity for zzso or zzso zzso Without zzso treatment, cryptic form of the binding protein occurs only in the zzso of the zzso zzso Upon treatment with the zzso the cryptic form of the binding protein exhibits binding activity to zzso and, at the same time, zzso to the zzso The zzso protein is an ubiquitous nuclear factor and its zzso cloning reveals the zzso feature with zinc finger zzso
