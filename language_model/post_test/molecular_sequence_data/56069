The alpha beta T cell zzso of adults and zzso are distinctly zzso For example, T cell receptors zzso from adult animals have substantial zzso addition at their zzso junctions while those from zzso animals do zzso This zzso reflects a rather abrupt change in expression of the terminal zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso on day 4 after zzso We have asked whether this change is due to the differentiation of successive waves of stem cells harboring different zzso for zzso zzso a scenario like the one proposed to explain zzso regulation of gamma delta T cell zzso zzso of adult severe combined zzso mice with either fetal liver or adult bone zzso precursors gave rise to T cells with substantial zzso diversity in their zzso even at the earliest points of zzso It is most zzso then, that the abrupt change in zzso gene expression in day 4 zzso is due to an environmentally induced zzso
