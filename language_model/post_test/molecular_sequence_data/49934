We report the complete zzso DNA sequence of the spotted asparagus zzso zzso zzso The zzso complement, gene order, and zzso composition of this zzso zzso zzso were found to be typical of those reported for other zzso zzso features of this zzso include the substitution of zzso for zzso as the zzso for zzso an unusual zzso loop for the zzso zzso and the identification of a putative zzso start zzso for zzso The utility of complete zzso zzso data for zzso zzso of the insect orders was tested, and compared to that of zzso and combined zzso zzso DNA zzso Even though the number of insect orders represented by complete zzso zzso is still zzso several well-established relationships are evident in the zzso analysis of the complete zzso zzso of the orders zzso zzso and zzso were consistently zzso zzso of the zzso was also observed in some (though not all) zzso The zzso of complete zzso sequences from a broader array of insect orders holds the promise of clarifying the early diversification of zzso
