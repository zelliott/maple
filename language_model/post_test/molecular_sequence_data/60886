The first zzso multiple drug resistance gene zzso has been cloned and zzso from zzso zzso data revealed the sheep zzso gene to have high sequence and structural similarity to other characterized zzso proteins from humans and zzso A restriction zzso length zzso was discovered using the zzso zzso and used to map the zzso gene to sheep zzso zzso Physical mapping using fluorescent in zzso zzso confirmed this map placement and assigned the zzso locus in the region zzso The zzso zzso gene was also cloned and found to map to the same region as zzso
