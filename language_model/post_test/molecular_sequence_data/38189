zzso is the highly specific modular zzso zzso that mediates the zzso activity of the C1 complex and thereby triggers zzso of the complement zzso The crystal structure of a zzso zzso from human zzso zzso the second complement control protein zzso module and the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain has been determined and refined to zzso A zzso In the areas surrounding the active site, the SP structure reveals a restricted access to subsidiary zzso binding sites that could be responsible for the narrow specificity of zzso The zzso zzso module is oriented zzso to the surface of the SP zzso This arrangement is maintained through a rigid zzso interface involving intertwined zzso and zzso zzso zzso The relative orientation of SP and zzso is consistent with the fact that the latter provides additional zzso recognition sites for the C4 zzso This structure provides a first example of a zzso assembly that is zzso in diverse zzso zzso Its implications in the zzso mechanism of C1 are zzso
