The central theme of this review is the molecular basis for commitment of cells to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso regulation are illustrated by two zzso the role of zzso during zzso differentiation and the function of zzso proteins in zzso Several regulatory proteins have been described in the zzso zzso Here, we focus attention on the zzso box family of DNA binding zzso This recently defined family can be divided in two zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso The first group contains at least two zzso boxes and binds DNA zzso while the other group of proteins has one zzso box and interacts with DNA zzso zzso of the most prominent members of both zzso will be zzso In particular, we will address the role of zzso box proteins in controlling the expression of zzso specific proteins during zzso
