We report here that the expression of zzso zzso zzso can be efficiently silenced in zzso zzso zzso using artificial zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that an zzso designed to target a mature zzso directs zzso against all zzso family members, whereas an zzso designed to target the zzso region of a zzso precursor transcript directs zzso against only the individual family member zzso Furthermore, our results indicate that zzso targeting both the mature zzso and zzso sequence direct zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso precursor transcript, which presumably occurs in the nucleus of a plant cell during the initial stages of zzso zzso This suggests that small zzso zzso zzso zzso in plants occurs not only in the zzso but also in the zzso Many plant zzso gene families have been identified via sequencing and zzso analysis, but, to date, only a small zzso of these have been functionally characterized due to a lack of effective forward or reverse genetic zzso Our findings therefore provide a new and powerful zzso tool for the analysis of zzso function in zzso
