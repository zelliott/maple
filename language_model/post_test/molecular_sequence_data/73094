The zzso domain of the Alzheimer's disease zzso precursor protein zzso is zzso in zzso at zzso and zzso and both in zzso and in intact cells at zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

We have developed zzso zzso zzso to each of the sites, and we have used these to analyze the zzso of zzso in adult rat brain and in cultured cell zzso 

We demonstrate that all three sites in zzso are zzso in adult rat zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso was also observed in several cultured cell zzso In zzso cells, zzso at zzso was increased more than zzso by treatment with zzso acid, a specific inhibitor of protein zzso 1 and zzso but was not affected by zzso of protein zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso at zzso was regulated in a cell zzso manner with zzso zzso being observed at the zzso phase of the cell zzso In general, zzso at zzso was found to be highest in mature zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso was highest in immature zzso zzso in cultured zzso 

The results demonstrate that zzso of the zzso domain of zzso occurs at zzso zzso and zzso under zzso zzso The further characterization of zzso zzso using zzso zzso may help in the zzso of the biological function of zzso
