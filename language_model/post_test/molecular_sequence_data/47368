During the screening for zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso degradation, one zzso zzso which was able to grow with zzso as a sole nitrogen source only in the presence of high zzso zzso (1 zzso a zzso resembling zzso coli zzso zzso was zzso zzso the corresponding zzso zzso was located within the zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis and zzso zzso of regions zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that no further genes essential for zzso zzso are located in the vicinity of zzso and revealed that zzso forms a zzso zzso unit in zzso zzso zzso acid sequence alignments of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso with zzso coli zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso contains an internal domain zzso to zzso suggesting similar functions of these proteins in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso did not exhibit zzso zzso zzso or nitrate zzso activity, which both require the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso even after addition of 1 zzso zzso to the zzso In contrast, the activity of zzso zzso which binds the zzso zzso zzso was restored to zzso levels after the addition of 1 zzso zzso to the growth zzso Analysis of fluorescent derivatives of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, revealed that zzso is inserted into the zzso only after zzso zzso and both metal zzso and zzso zzso can occur only under high zzso zzso in the absence of zzso These data support a model for the zzso of the zzso zzso in which the zzso of zzso and zzso are split at a stage when the zzso atom is added to zzso
