The zzso region of zzso initiation factor zzso is a common region to the three active forms of the factor zzso beta and zzso but its function is still zzso We report here that this region of zzso carries at least one domain which is zzso to the zzso and middle part of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain harbors functionally important features of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso motif and some of the zzso essential for the structure of the zzso core of the zzso This zzso domain of zzso was fused to the zzso zzso The hybrid zzso as well as zzso itself, shows a consistent DNA binding activity in zzso zzso zzso but does not display the specificity of the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso The implication of this domain in the zzso activity of zzso reported by others, is zzso
