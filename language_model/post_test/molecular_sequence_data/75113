A zzso sequence in the short unique region of human zzso zzso strain zzso contains a series of five imperfect zzso repeats with zzso to the zzso and zzso major immediate early zzso zzso containing these putative zzso zzso sequences linked to the human zzso gene were zzso zzso into zzso cells, and the ability of the zzso sequences to activate zzso zzso was zzso The zzso region zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, to approximately the same degree as that of the zzso zzso A promoter located immediately 3' to the zzso in the zzso zzso is active only in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso from this zzso promoter was zzso by a combination of zzso zzso protection mapping and Northern zzso At immediate early times zzso at least four extremely abundant zzso spliced zzso were zzso these zzso constitute a previously unknown class of immediate early zzso
