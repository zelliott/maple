We have characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso D zzso that encodes for a zzso protein consisting of repeated zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in the zzso and lateral zzso and the zzso zzso at the late zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to inhibit the translation of zzso zzso and zzso and we found that the circulation of red blood cells completely disappears in the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso vein in the trunk region was severely zzso in these zzso zzso of zzso affected the expression of zzso a terminal differentiation marker of red blood cells, but did not affect the expression of zzso zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso precursor cells differentiate normally in the zzso zzso The transplantation of labeled zzso followed by tracing of the donor cells revealed a role of zzso in migration of the embryonic zzso and zzso zzso These observations first demonstrate the role of the novel zzso proteins in migration of the embryonic zzso
