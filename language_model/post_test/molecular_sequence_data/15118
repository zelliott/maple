Previous work in zzso zzso has shown that zzso embryonic zzso muscle lineages are regulated through a genetically defined zzso cascade that includes zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors, including zzso and zzso which together orchestrate zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso zzso in zzso we now demonstrate direct binding of zzso in zzso to an zzso zzso zzso Through zzso analysis of the zzso zzso sequences within this zzso we identify two zzso elements and their associated zzso factors zzso and zzso that are crucial for the zzso expression of zzso and proper zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso is indeed a direct target of zzso in the zzso embryonic zzso zzso muscle zzso defining a novel in zzso binding site for this crucial zzso zzso We find that the same zzso element is also a target of zzso positive auto regulation, underlying (at least in part) the sustained high levels of zzso in zzso muscle throughout zzso Together, these results provide a molecular framework for the gene regulatory network zzso the muscle module during zzso
