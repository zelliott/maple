zzso contributes to the establishment of zzso virus zzso zzso in B cells and to the zzso zzso in zzso growth pattern by zzso expression from specific viral and cellular zzso We have taken a comparative approach toward characterizing functional zzso within zzso To this end, we have cloned and zzso the zzso gene from the closely related zzso virus zzso zzso zzso All human zzso zzso have either a type A or type B zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso gene falls into neither the type A category nor the type B category, suggesting that the separation into these two zzso may have been a recent evolutionary zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequences indicates 37% zzso acid identity with zzso type A zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with type B zzso To define the zzso of zzso required for zzso zzso the DNA binding domain of the zzso protein was fused to overlapping segments of zzso zzso This approach identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain located between zzso zzso and zzso zzso ability was completely lost when the zzso boundary of this domain was moved to zzso zzso indicating that the motif at zzso zzso to zzso zzso contains zzso critical for zzso The zzso zzso boundary identified in these experiments zzso precisely with a block of zzso sequences in zzso zzso and the comparable zzso region of zzso zzso also functioned as a strong zzso zzso domain when fused to the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso share a mixed zzso zzso charged character with a striking conservation of zzso equivalent zzso zzso The importance of the individual zzso acids making up the zzso motif was examined by zzso Any zzso of these zzso was found to reduce zzso efficiency, with changes at the zzso and zzso positions producing the most deleterious zzso zzso of the zzso zzso C promoter by zzso was shown to be dependent on the presence of the zzso zzso zzso However, this requirement was zzso rather than specific, since the zzso zzso domain could be replaced with those from the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso protein or the zzso zzso zzso Potential zzso signals within zzso were examined by introducing zzso zzso positively charged zzso acid groupings that might serve in this capacity into a zzso test zzso zzso delta zzso and by examining the zzso zzso of the resulting zzso This zzso identified a strong nuclear zzso signal between zzso zzso acids zzso zzso to zzso which was zzso in zzso and a weaker zzso signal between zzso zzso zzso to zzso which was not zzso in zzso
