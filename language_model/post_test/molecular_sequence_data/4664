Numerous studies have established that zzso is a critical feature of cell surface zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso interactions are typically evaluated by using zzso that focus on the behavior of zzso zzso zzso in zzso It has generally been assumed that the relative affinities of zzso zzso zzso in solution correlate with their zzso zzso In this paper we show that zzso zzso zzso directly on zzso beads interact with zzso proteins in a zzso zzso The zzso beads can, therefore, be used as model systems for cell surfaces to evaluate zzso zzso zzso By using a zzso approach to zzso zzso libraries of zzso zzso one can rapidly address key issues in the area of cell surface zzso zzso For example, studies reported zzso demonstrate that there is an unanticipated degree of specificity in recognition processes involving zzso zzso However, the correlation between zzso zzso and solution affinities is zzso Apparently, the presentation of carbohydrates on the zzso surface has a profound influence on the interaction of the zzso with the protein zzso These findings have implications for how carbohydrates function as recognition signals in nature, as well as for how zzso zzso interactions should be zzso
