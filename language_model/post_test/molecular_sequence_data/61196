The zzso zzso also known as the per zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso is required for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes the major zzso and assembly machinery of zzso zzso zzso An immobilized zzso zzso fusion protein that binds specifically to upstream promoter sequences of zzso and zzso was used to zzso zzso from a promoter library other zzso zzso fragments that are bound by the zzso zzso After screening for promoters exhibiting zzso zzso one was identified that was positively regulated by zzso and that is not present in the zzso of two zzso zzso coli laboratory zzso zzso and zzso Further analysis of this positively regulated promoter in zzso showed that it resided within a zzso zzso sequence that is not present in zzso coli zzso This zzso located downstream of the zzso zzso was found to contain four open reading frames zzso zzso promoter was localized upstream of zzso An zzso knockout zzso produced less of the zzso structural zzso zzso and formed smaller than normal adherent zzso on cultured zzso zzso however, this zzso did not affect zzso zzso An zzso fusion protein specifically bound the zzso and mature forms of the zzso protein and thus appears to stabilize the former within the zzso zzso zzso therefore is a newly isolated zzso zzso gene that encodes a zzso protein involved in the production of zzso zzso zzso was designated zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso protein also specifically bound 39 zzso and 90 zzso proteins that are expressed by zzso but not by zzso coli zzso The 90 zzso protein was revealed to be zzso a protein product of the zzso zzso which is required for the zzso zzso zzso suggesting a direct interaction of zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso
