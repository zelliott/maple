The copy number of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso for the zzso of geographically diverse strains of zzso zzso and restriction site variation within and around the genes was zzso A DNA probe of 550 zzso was amplified by the zzso chain reaction from zzso DNA of the type strain zzso zzso This probe constituted a sequence internal to the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles were compared for zzso Southern blots made with four restriction zzso cutting within and outside the probe zzso A copy number of two was established for all 12 strains zzso This approach yielded significantly simpler data than does conventional zzso ' of zzso zzso It was equally zzso however, and provided zzso zzso zzso gene zzso These represent both fundamental zzso information and a novel approach to typing this gastric zzso
