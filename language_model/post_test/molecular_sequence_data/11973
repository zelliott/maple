The zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of two distinct zzso zzso containing the zzso active sites for zzso and zzso having two zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso in place of zzso is highly soluble but indistinguishable from the zzso zzso in its ability to zzso zzso and to support the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso is essential for assembly of zzso complex upon analysis of the mixture of its components by gel zzso followed by zzso gel zzso in the presence of sodium zzso zzso Either zzso or zzso zzso could not support the complex zzso Furthermore, zzso which carries a zzso in the second zzso site and therefore is unable to cleave zzso could not interact with zzso On the other hand, zzso carrying a zzso in the first site and zzso could be assembled into a complex at 2 zzso zzso but not at zzso zzso at which concentration the zzso zzso protein can not form a zzso These results indicate that assembly of zzso zzso requires zzso of zzso by zzso in addition to its binding for zzso zzso
