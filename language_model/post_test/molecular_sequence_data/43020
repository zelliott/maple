Gene targeting in zzso stem zzso cells was used to generate mice with a disruption in the zzso gene zzso zzso Mice zzso for this zzso show a radically remodeled zzso zzso The anterior arch of the zzso is transformed to an extension of the zzso bone of the zzso The lateral masses of the zzso also assume a zzso more closely resembling the zzso and, to a variable extent, fuse with the zzso zzso of the second cervical vertebra, the zzso is also zzso The zzso and the superior zzso are deleted, and the axis shows zzso zzso An unexpected observation is that different parts of the same vertebra are zzso affected by the loss of zzso zzso Some parts are deleted, others are zzso transformed to more anterior zzso These observations suggest that one role of zzso genes may be to zzso control the proliferation rates of the zzso zzso that give rise to the zzso zzso Within the mouse zzso complex, zzso genes not only zzso very similar proteins but also often exhibit very similar expression zzso zzso it has been zzso that zzso zzso genes would perform similar zzso Surprisingly, however, no zzso or structures are affected in common by zzso in the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso
