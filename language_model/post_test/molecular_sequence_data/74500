The diversity and distribution of a bacterial community from Coffee zzso Hot Spring, a zzso spring in Yellowstone National Park with a temperature range of zzso to zzso degrees C and pH range of zzso to zzso were investigated by sequencing cloned zzso products and quantitative zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The spring was inhabited by three zzso zzso zzso and zzso members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and candidate division zzso The in zzso chemical affinities were calculated for 41 potential zzso reactions using measured environmental parameters and a range of hydrogen and oxygen zzso zzso that use zzso zzso iron, zzso and nitrate as electron zzso were predicted to be the most energetically zzso while reactions using zzso were expected to be less zzso zzso were screened for genes used in zzso zzso zzso bacterial gene zzso the reductive zzso acid zzso cycle zzso the Calvin cycle zzso zzso reduction zzso nitrogen fixation zzso zzso reduction zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso Genes for carbon fixation by the zzso cycle and nitrogen fixation were zzso All zzso sequences were zzso related and zzso correlated to zzso zzso zzso gene sequences using zzso zzso zzso zzso This result supports the recent finding of zzso zzso by zzso other than zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cycle of the zzso zzso We briefly consider potential zzso mechanisms that may allow zzso and zzso to zzso some zzso zzso
