The zzso U2, zzso and zzso small nuclear zzso zzso are components of the zzso which zzso zzso zzso One of the largest and the most highly zzso proteins in the zzso is zzso a component of the zzso zzso Despite its size and zzso very few motifs have been identified that suggest specific zzso zzso A zzso of the zzso domain found in a class of zzso zzso is present near the C zzso of zzso zzso regulates a broad range of cellular zzso and its functions generally require zzso recognition by one or more zzso zzso zzso No precise role for zzso has been defined in the zzso zzso pathway, and no known zzso have been found within zzso zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso containing the zzso domain binds directly to zzso with an affinity comparable to other known zzso Several zzso within this domain that compromise zzso also reduce interaction of the zzso with zzso Our results define a new zzso and suggest functional links between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso
