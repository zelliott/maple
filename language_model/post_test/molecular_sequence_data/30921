The zzso chain reaction zzso technique was employed in searching for human T cell zzso virus type I zzso zzso zzso and pol sequences in samples of DNA prepared from two zzso zzso patients with tropical zzso zzso zzso the Swedish multiple sclerosis zzso patients who recently have been reported to be zzso for zzso gag and zzso zzso and eight healthy zzso zzso were taken in order to reduce the risk of zzso in the zzso In the two zzso patients strong signals were obtained with zzso zzso and pol amplification zzso and detection zzso In zzso patients and healthy individuals, no signals were obtained with gag and zzso In occasional experiments, weak signals were seen for the pol segment for a single zzso patient and/or healthy individuals, but these signals were not zzso in subsequent zzso Thus, the present data do not confirm the presence of zzso sequences in zzso zzso
