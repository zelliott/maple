zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso belonging to the zzso family, is present in the zzso anterior zzso and adrenal zzso where it regulates hormone release, in the zzso tract where it zzso zzso and in human zzso cell lines where it shows a zzso zzso It is now appreciated that alternative zzso of two zzso of the rat zzso gene generate four major zzso zzso zzso that are zzso expressed in zzso and zzso coupled to zzso second zzso Because of the potential implications of these findings in human zzso we cloned the zzso zzso Similar to the zzso two zzso zzso and zzso are alternatively spliced to account for four major zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned from a human frontal zzso zzso library, zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and each characterized for zzso zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso C zzso and zzso expression of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing similar numbers of receptors of the four zzso zzso showed nearly identical responses for zzso affinity and potency for zzso and zzso increases in zzso and total zzso zzso However, each zzso zzso zzso differed in their zzso efficacy for total zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed the greatest efficacy for stimulating zzso C that was approximately zzso greater than the zzso twofold greater than the zzso and zzso greater than the zzso zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso zzso also differ in their ability to stimulate immediate early gene zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were zzso by Northern zzso and zzso by zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso expression for all four of the zzso zzso zzso that paralleled the efficacy for zzso zzso with the the zzso zzso zzso showing the greatest zzso These results show that the zzso exhibits enhanced efficacy for zzso to both zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso suggesting a novel and potentially important mechanism for zzso zzso signal zzso pathways that influence cellular growth and zzso
