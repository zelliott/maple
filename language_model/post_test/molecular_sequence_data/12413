To examine the mechanism of resistance to zzso in zzso zzso we selected spontaneous zzso zzso from a susceptible strain, zzso and studied the zzso of these zzso and two zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso to various zzso and to zzso and zzso Furthermore, since zzso within the zzso zzso region of the structural gene zzso the A zzso of DNA zzso are the most common mechanism of acquired resistance, we amplified this region by zzso and compared the zzso sequences of the zzso strains with that of the susceptible zzso zzso zzso of zzso appeared at zzso of 2 zzso zzso to 1 zzso zzso For three zzso selected on zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and the two clinical zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were as high as 16 zzso and those of zzso were 4 to 8 zzso They displayed zzso to all zzso tested but not to zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were the most potent zzso All of the zzso strains zzso zzso or zzso 4 zzso had zzso in the zzso zzso region which led to substitution of the zzso zzso at position 87 zzso by zzso or Ala or the substitution of zzso by Val in the A zzso of DNA zzso Similar zzso have been noted in other bacterial species and recently in zzso The broad resistance to zzso that arose readily by point zzso in the laboratory and apparently during inadequate therapy, as was the case in the clinical zzso may ultimately lead to to serious restriction of the use of these drugs in the treatment of zzso
