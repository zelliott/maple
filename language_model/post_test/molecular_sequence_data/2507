We have designed a set of zzso zzso to amplify the zzso of mouse zzso heavy and light chain variable zzso by the zzso chain zzso The zzso incorporate restriction sites that allow the zzso of the variable zzso to be zzso for sequencing and zzso Here we have applied the technique to clone and sequence the variable zzso of five zzso zzso and to express a zzso zzso zzso that binds to the human zzso zzso line zzso The technique should also lead to the cloning of zzso zzso directly from zzso zzso
