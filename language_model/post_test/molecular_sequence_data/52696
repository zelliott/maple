zzso zzso zzso that cleave pathological zzso are being developed as therapeutic zzso Chemical modification of the zzso zzso has produced zzso zzso that cleave targeted zzso in cell culture and exhibit zzso activity in zzso Unfortunately, stabilizing modifications usually reduce the zzso rate in zzso An alternative to rationally designed chemical modifications of existing zzso is to identify novel motifs through in zzso selection of zzso sequence zzso This approach is desirable because the zzso can be zzso to function under simulated zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso selection, we have identified a zzso zzso that demonstrated optimal activity at simulated zzso zzso The initial library of zzso unique molecules contained 40 zzso zzso with all zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The selection required zzso activity and zzso specificity towards a zzso zzso zzso zzso selective pressure was zzso with a 30 zzso reaction time and 25 zzso zzso zzso of selection pressure was gradually increased until final conditions of 1 zzso zzso and less than 1 zzso reaction times were zzso The resulting zzso catalyst required the zzso zzso at selected zzso positions and was stable in human serum zzso of 16 zzso 

We demonstrated that it is possible to identify completely novel, zzso zzso capable of zzso target zzso at zzso relevant zzso zzso The new zzso motif has minimal zzso requirements, allowing for a wide range of potential zzso zzso
