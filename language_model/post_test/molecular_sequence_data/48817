zzso 2 zzso is the most abundant zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso and its expression zzso with zzso zzso zzso Here we identified a zzso zzso zzso that has major effect on protein structure and function, along with an influence on human plasma zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified with the zzso zzso zzso modeling using zzso and the zzso package revealed that the zzso zzso zzso a predicted zzso in zzso zzso of zzso from individuals carrying zzso zzso and human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with either of the zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso causes increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso Analysis of zzso size distribution in zzso zzso cells showed that the minor zzso zzso resulted in an increased number of small zzso per cell and increased zzso 3 protein expression levels as compared with cells carrying the major zzso zzso zzso of zzso individuals indicated that the zzso zzso is associated with decreased plasma zzso and very zzso zzso zzso Altogether, these data provide the first evidence of a zzso in zzso that affects zzso function and may influence the development of zzso and cardiovascular zzso
