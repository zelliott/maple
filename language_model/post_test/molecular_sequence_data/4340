The specificity of zzso in zzso by zzso ethanol zzso is studied using an all zzso protein such as zzso analogue I zzso I) from the Taiwan zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso such as zzso It is found that alcohols including zzso can zzso induce zzso at high zzso both in zzso I and zzso at neutral zzso However, among the alcohols used, only zzso could transform the zzso zzso zzso of zzso at pH zzso into an zzso The zzso to zzso conversion in zzso (in the zzso zzso occurs even at very low zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, experiments on the zzso of zzso on the zzso and reduced zzso I zzso I) indicate the zzso in zzso I takes place at low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of this study hint at the possible influence of zzso bridges on the induction of zzso by zzso
