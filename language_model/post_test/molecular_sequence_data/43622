We have previously demonstrated that the 101 zzso upstream from the zzso of the potato virus S zzso coat protein gene has the ability to act as a zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso when fused to a range of marker zzso These 101 zzso which have been designated zzso zzso zzso zzso contain a block of zzso zzso that is zzso between members of the zzso group, centered around a core sequence of zzso When deletions were generated that lacked 47 of the zzso zzso but still retained the zzso block, and zzso in zzso and in zzso it was observed that these leaders had lost their ability to act as zzso zzso These results suggest that the sequences zzso to the zzso block may be acting as a zzso zzso or may be important in placing the zzso block in optimal zzso This is confirmed to some extent by hybrid arrest translation results in which the effects on translation of zzso complementary to regions within the zzso leader, were zzso It was observed that zzso complementary to the zzso zzso to the zzso block had a dramatic effect on the zzso competence of transcripts derived from zzso zzso decreasing levels by zzso whereas zzso complementary to sequences 3' to the zzso block reduced levels of translation by only zzso
