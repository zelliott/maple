The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and encodes a zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is most abundant in germ cells, suggesting a normal role for zzso in zzso Here we describe the isolation of zzso clones containing the complete coding region of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene is transforming when introduced into zzso zzso zzso cells, and transformation is zzso by a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of in zzso transcribed zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso causes a resumption of zzso leading to zzso zzso breakdown and zzso zzso zzso maturation was not observed after zzso of in zzso transcribed zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso protein can induce progression through the cell cycle for both zzso and zzso cells and that this property is dependent on the zzso zzso domain in the protein zzso
