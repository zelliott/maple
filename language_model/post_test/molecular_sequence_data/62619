We describe a mechanism of gene regulation involving formation of a complex between zzso protein and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor 1 zzso gene zzso by binding to an zzso growth factor response element zzso motif in the zzso The complex with zzso zzso releases zzso allowing zzso to zzso zzso zzso transmission of zzso zzso to human tumor cells induced several zzso including zzso which also are induced by zzso and promoted zzso In mice, steroid synthesis is activated in zzso cells by zzso hormones, which zzso induce zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso We showed that steroid synthesis could also be activated in mouse zzso adrenal cells by zzso with zzso zzso either zzso zzso tracts that form a complex with zzso or a small interfering zzso zzso that degrades zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso regulates zzso and possibly other zzso processes of mice, by complex formation with zzso zzso such as zzso apparently evolved not only as zzso DNA but also as zzso active zzso DNA that acquired zzso and pathological zzso
