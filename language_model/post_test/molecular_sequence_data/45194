The zzso gene codes for one of two zzso in zzso zzso zzso which catalyze the formation of zzso zzso We have examined the role of zzso a DNA binding protein that is associated with the zzso switch between zzso growth and zzso zzso growth, in zzso expression and found that zzso zzso is directly activated by zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso I protection zzso we have mapped two binding sites for zzso within the zzso upstream zzso each of which contains an identical zzso zzso Using zzso zzso reporter plasmids in zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso we showed that zzso was required for zzso zzso We also found that the relative impacts of altering DNA sequences within the two binding sites are different depending on whether cells are growing zzso or zzso This reveals a greater level of complexity associated with zzso regulation of zzso than has been zzso zzso Our findings are of particular importance with respect to those genes regulated by zzso having more than one upstream binding zzso In the case of the zzso zzso we discuss possibilities as to how these new insights can be zzso within the context of what has already been established for zzso zzso regulation in zzso zzso
