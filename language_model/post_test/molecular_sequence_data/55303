zzso proteins are a family of type I membrane proteins localized to compartments of the early zzso zzso and to coat protein I zzso and zzso zzso They can be zzso by sequence zzso into four zzso named zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to animals and zzso plants contain only members of the zzso and zzso zzso It has previously been shown that zzso expressed red fluorescent protein zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso as a consequence of highly efficient zzso recycling from the zzso zzso Using specific zzso zzso zzso has now been localized to the zzso and zzso to the zzso apparatus in zzso root tip cells by zzso electron zzso The relative contributions of the zzso tail and the zzso zzso to zzso trafficking have also been zzso It is demonstrated that whereas the zzso motif in the zzso tail determines the location of zzso in the early zzso pathway, the zzso domain may contribute to its distribution downstream of the zzso zzso By using zzso zzso and zzso experiments, it is shown that zzso and zzso interact with each zzso Finally, it is shown that zzso and zzso exhibit coupled trafficking at the zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso and zzso interact with each other at zzso export sites for zzso exit and coupled transport to the zzso zzso Once in the zzso zzso interacts very efficiently with the zzso machinery for retrograde transport back to the zzso
