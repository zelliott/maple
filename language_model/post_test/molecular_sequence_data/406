zzso and zzso zzso of the Tomato spotted zzso virus zzso protein were generated to identify zzso involved in zzso formation, movement and zzso using a zzso zzso mosaic virus expression zzso Two regions of zzso zzso and zzso were required for both zzso formation in zzso and zzso movement in plants, indicating a correlation between these zzso Three zzso acid groups, zzso zzso and zzso were linked with long-distance movement in zzso zzso zzso was essential for zzso long-distance movement, whereas zzso was essential for zzso formation and zzso zzso indicating separate genetic controls for zzso and long-distance zzso The region zzso was identified as the zzso of zzso necrosis in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso greatly reduced zzso These findings are likely zzso to other zzso species, especially those within the zzso zzso group as zzso sequences are highly zzso
