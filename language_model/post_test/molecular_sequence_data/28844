Class V zzso are one of the most ancient and widely distributed groups of the zzso zzso and are hypothesized to function as zzso for zzso zzso zzso We report the discovery and initial characterization of a novel member of this family, human zzso zzso The zzso protein sequence shares approximately 50% overall identity with the two other class V zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and protein distribution of these zzso indicates that zzso is most abundant in brain, whereas zzso and zzso are expressed chiefly in zzso zzso zzso is particularly abundant in zzso and zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso stomach, colon and zzso zzso in colon and zzso zzso indicates that zzso is expressed chiefly in zzso zzso A dominant negative approach using a zzso tail construct in zzso cells reveals that the zzso tail selectively zzso with and zzso a membrane compartment containing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso also accumulates in this zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in zzso zzso As a class V zzso of zzso cells, zzso is likely to power zzso membrane trafficking in many zzso crucial zzso of the human zzso
