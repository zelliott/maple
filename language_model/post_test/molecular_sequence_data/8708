The zzso clone zzso (in zzso zzso contains the zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso activity expressed was present within a zzso insert zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene was determined, and upon analysis, revealed an open reading frame of 1943 zzso that encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso A putative zzso sequence was identified 6 zzso upstream from the translation start zzso The zzso 32 zzso acid zzso were typical of zzso signal zzso zzso cluster analysis zzso and DNA alignment of zzso to other published zzso zzso sequences in zzso indicate that zzso belongs in zzso zzso family zzso zzso extension analyses were performed using zzso isolated from zzso zzso grown on cellulose and zzso and from zzso coli containing the zzso clone zzso zzso is initiated at different sites in zzso coli and zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso is initiated at a C zzso zzso zzso 221 zzso upstream from the translation start zzso There were no regions resembling zzso coli zzso zzso promoter sequences present upstream from this putative zzso initiation zzso In contrast, numerous zzso initiation sites were identified when zzso from zzso coli was used in the primer extension zzso
