All carbon skeletons of zzso whose chain lengths vary widely from zzso zzso zzso to natural rubber zzso are zzso by sequential zzso of zzso zzso with an zzso zzso through zzso functions of a group of zzso commonly called zzso zzso are classified into two major groups, zzso or zzso and zzso or zzso according to the geometry of the zzso chain units in the zzso From the year 1987, many genes zzso zzso were cloned and clearly zzso In contrast, the structure and detailed mechanism of zzso was completely unknown until the identification of a gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso 26 in zzso Not only the primary but also the zzso structure of the zzso zzso is quite different from that of the zzso Multiple alignment of the primary structures of zzso identified from various organisms reveals five highly zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso based on the crystal structure has zzso the basic zzso zzso Moreover, comparison of the structures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveals important zzso acid zzso for product chain length determination, which enabled us to understand the regulation mechanism of the ultimate chain length among zzso
