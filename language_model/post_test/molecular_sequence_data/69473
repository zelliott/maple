The zzso of zzso manifestations of generalized resistance to zzso hormone zzso could result from differential interactions between the zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso response elements zzso in different zzso zzso To explore this hypothesis, the zzso zzso beta associated with zzso A, zzso a zzso beta zzso zzso and a comparable zzso alpha zzso zzso were tested for intrinsic function and for zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression from four structurally distinct zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the rat zzso zzso zzso and the chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative function of the zzso was similarly reduced on the four zzso studied and was zzso concentration zzso The zzso alpha zzso retained the zzso greater potency characteristic of this zzso but remained impaired with respect to zzso zzso alpha even at 500 zzso zzso In general, dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso alpha and zzso function was dependent upon the zzso zzso as expected from the decreased affinity for zzso zzso by this zzso A zzso concentration sufficient to relieve the zzso of zzso zzso function on the zzso zzso and ME zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso of the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso preferential zzso was observed on the zzso zzso and ME zzso by the zzso zzso Thus, both zzso structure and the zzso of zzso active zzso could determine the degree of zzso of a specific gene in zzso zzso Further, the lack of dominant negative zzso does not explain the absence of zzso alpha zzso in zzso zzso
