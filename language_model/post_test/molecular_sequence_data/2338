A spliced zzso spanning the zzso virus zzso gene expresses the zzso protein and is active in inducing the virus productive zzso A deletion zzso which lacks the zzso half of the protein is zzso zzso experiments in zzso zzso cell lines demonstrated that the zzso gene activates the promoter for the zzso + zzso gene in the absence of any other zzso gene zzso These results confirmed that the spliced zzso gene is the zzso gene structure in zzso
