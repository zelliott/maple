zzso zzso involve not only zzso zzso genes but also a number of zzso zzso as zzso zzso sequences of three zzso zzso were readily obtained by long-distance zzso In cases where partner zzso were not determined, we developed a long-distance inverse zzso method, which zzso unknown fragments flanked by known zzso zzso Using these two long-distance zzso approaches, we cloned zzso areas of zzso zzso from a total of 58 cases of zzso zzso zzso sequencing and database searches revealed that 30 cases involved zzso as zzso zzso heavy chain gene in 22, zzso zzso light chain gene in 1, and zzso zzso light chain gene in zzso In contrast, 23 cases affected zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso heat shock protein genes zzso and zzso and zzso zzso On zzso zzso complete sets of the promoters of these partner genes replaced that of zzso in the same zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso gene affected by the zzso is zzso activated by a variety of zzso including cell cycle control, changes in the physical environment, and response to zzso Break points on zzso occurred within the major zzso zzso and we identified a zzso zzso region a short distance from the 3' end of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested the presence of a zzso that bound to this particular zzso
