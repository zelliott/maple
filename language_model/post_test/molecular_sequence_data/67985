Since internal initiation of translation of zzso zzso requires the approximately zzso segment of the viral zzso immediately upstream of the authentic initiation zzso for viral zzso zzso the question arises as to whether the immediately adjacent zzso the start of the zzso coding region, also influence the efficiency of internal zzso zzso a variety of zzso derived from zzso virus and zzso zzso zzso virus retaining various lengths of viral coding sequence were translated in rabbit zzso zzso zzso internal initiation showed no requirement specifically for viral coding zzso but on the other hand certain zzso notably zzso zzso located immediately downstream of the initiation zzso were highly zzso These results suggest a possible explanation for the evolution of zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso signals and are also pertinent to the design of zzso in which the zzso internal zzso entry signal is used to drive the expression of a reporter zzso
