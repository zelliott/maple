The crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso a protein of unknown function, has been determined at a resolution of zzso zzso The molecules form an zzso zzso zzso and associate into zzso The fold is most closely related to the zzso domain of zzso yet the zzso acid sequences of the two proteins exhibit no significant zzso zzso analyses of completely and incompletely zzso zzso reveal that the two adjacent zzso zzso and zzso and their close relatives comprise a new family of zzso with 15 members at the time of zzso The analyses also indicate that this is one of eight families of a large zzso zzso whose members were identified based on the proximity of the zzso and zzso zzso on the respective zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso zzso in the original zzso sequencing zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso and was shown to form a complex with zzso by zzso gel zzso under zzso conditions, zzso size exclusion zzso and dynamic light zzso zzso and zzso DNA binding zzso showed no evidence of DNA binding to zzso or to zzso complex despite the suggestive shape of the putative binding zzso formed by the zzso zzso
