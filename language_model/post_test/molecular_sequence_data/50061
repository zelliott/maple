In recent years, nine neurodegenerative diseases have been found to be caused by the expansion of a zzso repeat in the coding region of the respective zzso resulting in lengthening of an otherwise harmless zzso tract in the gene zzso To facilitate structural studies of these disease mechanisms, a general protocol is described that allows zzso zzso to be introduced into the zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso this protocol involves engineering unique restriction sites into the zzso regions of the zzso repeat and subsequently replacing the zzso zzso repeat with a zzso synthetic DNA zzso containing the desired zzso This method was applied to the zzso zzso zzso such that the zzso zzso acid sequence zzso was replaced by a zzso zzso In this case, the incorporated zzso zzso can be exploited for various chemical zzso lending the host zzso repeat to many structural and zzso techniques for the resolution of a specific zzso The method reported here zzso many problems that can arise from zzso zzso zzso
