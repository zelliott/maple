Under negative zzso stress, long zzso containing repeats experience a zzso multiple zzso zzso We have investigated the effect of the zzso size on this transitional zzso A zzso zzso containing repeat from the zzso region of mouse zzso DNA was inserted in a zzso a zzso and a zzso plasmids and its zzso zzso transition was followed by zzso probing of zzso Our results show a clear correlation between the size of the zzso domain and the extent of the region that converts zzso into zzso at the initial zzso
