The transcript of zzso a zzso delayed zzso zzso channel cloned in our laboratory, is regulated in both tissue and zzso specific zzso In this study we characterized the zzso region of the zzso zzso The gene lacks a zzso zzso box, has several zzso start sites, and the zzso sequence is zzso A zzso response element zzso consensus signal was identified in the zzso zzso zzso regulates the expression of zzso gene in a zzso zzso In primary cardiac cells, zzso zzso a zzso increase in the steady state levels of zzso zzso However, in zzso cells zzso zzso a zzso decrease in steady state levels of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso transcript is 37 zzso and is not affected by zzso Nuclear zzso experiments show that in zzso cells, zzso reduces the zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences revealed that the zzso located at zzso can zzso the zzso zzso to zzso reporter gene zzso and binds to zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso gel shift zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso can increase the steady state levels of zzso transcript in primary zzso cells and decrease it in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso play an important role in regulating zzso channel expression and thus may induce long term effects on the pattern of electrical activity of excitable zzso
