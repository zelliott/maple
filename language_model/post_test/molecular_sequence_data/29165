The expression of the zzso zzso genes is intricately regulated by a series of both general and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is important for zzso differentiation and has been implicated in regulating the expression of the zzso genes including the genes of the zzso zzso In the human zzso zzso cell line, only one DNA region has been identified previously as a putative site of zzso interaction by in zzso zzso zzso We mapped zzso binding throughout the zzso locus by using zzso analysis of zzso zzso We found that zzso binds in a region encompassing the zzso core element, as was previously identified, and an additional region of zzso binding upstream of the zzso zzso This approach will be of general utility for mapping zzso factor binding sites within the zzso locus and throughout the zzso
