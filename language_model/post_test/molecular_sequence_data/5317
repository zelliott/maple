In this study we investigated expression of the two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in sheep zzso Using Western zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso was highly expressed in zzso from Day 8 to Day 17 of development whereas zzso was zzso during this zzso The expression of zzso was zzso zzso It was zzso between Days 14 and zzso There was a zzso increase in zzso content per protein extract between Day 10 and Day 14, corresponding to a zzso increase in the whole zzso The expression of zzso declined after Day 16 to become zzso by Day 25 of zzso zzso was localized in the zzso cells and was not detected in the inner cell zzso The zzso acid zzso zzso by zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso after short-term zzso zzso Day 14 zzso released mainly zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso zzso products were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest an important role for the zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso
