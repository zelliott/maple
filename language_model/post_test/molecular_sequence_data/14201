The chemical constituents of the root extracts and the zzso neutral DNA base sequences were studied for 28 samples of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso collected in zzso and Yunnan zzso of zzso The samples could be classified into four zzso zzso zzso having zzso and zzso skeletons were isolated from two zzso and three zzso samples, zzso Two new zzso derivatives were isolated and their structures were zzso In 18 samples, zzso were the major components zzso In five samples, neither zzso nor zzso were found zzso Despite this large chemical zzso no correlation was found between the zzso and the zzso criteria of species zzso The analysis of the zzso neutral DNA regions also indicated that the samples were not separated into distinct zzso and that zzso was zzso
