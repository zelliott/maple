To identify tumor zzso useful for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with zzso cancer, a zzso zzso zzso library constructed from a high-grade zzso cancer cell line was screened with zzso serum from a patient with zzso zzso zzso Forty-eight distinct zzso were zzso By evaluating the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as zzso zzso with restricted tissue zzso zzso was found to be a putative human zzso acid zzso with a zzso site, zzso that was expressed in zzso cancer cell lines and most zzso cancer zzso as well as normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was detected in 2 of 28 patients with zzso cancer, but not in 30 healthy zzso zzso was found to be a putative human zzso protein that was zzso to zzso zzso with a zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cancer cell lines, most zzso cancer zzso zzso and heart, but not in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was detected in 8 of 28 patients with zzso cancer, but not in 16 healthy zzso zzso zzso T cells were induced from peripheral blood zzso cells zzso by stimulation with one of the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which showed preferential expression in zzso cancer with restricted expression in normal zzso as well as zzso in multiple patients with zzso cancer, may be useful for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic methods for patients with zzso zzso
