zzso zzso zzso is a widely distributed DNA repair protein that protects living organisms from zzso and zzso zzso damage to DNA at the zzso of zzso The search of the zzso zzso zzso database for an zzso protein revealed the presence of a protein zzso with some similarity to known zzso in addition to the easily recognized zzso zzso The predicted protein sequence of zzso contains the zzso acid sequence zzso at the presumed active site of the zzso whereas all other known zzso have zzso A truncated version of the zzso protein was expressed in zzso zzso This zzso zzso protein was able to repair zzso and zzso zzso in DNA in zzso and also reacted with the bulky zzso zzso in zzso This zzso of zzso (104 zzso zzso is the smallest protein possessing zzso activity yet zzso The full-length zzso protein zzso zzso zzso totally lacks the zzso domain present in all other known zzso but has a long zzso extension that has significant zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso in an zzso coli strain lacking zzso zzso activity provided modest but statistically significant resistance to the toxicity of zzso confirming that zzso is an zzso
