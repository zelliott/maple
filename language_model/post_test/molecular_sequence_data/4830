zzso diffusion plays a role in protein folding as shown by kinetic experiments on two zzso zzso domain circular zzso zzso and zzso with different zzso loop zzso zzso of up to 10 zzso zzso does not alter the structure of the folded state nor the overall characteristics of the zzso zzso The apparent level of the energy barrier between the zzso and folded species increases zzso with the number of inserted zzso This suggests that the transition state itself and/or possibly previous transient unstable zzso are zzso with more difficulty when loop length is zzso The fact that the induced impediment is directly zzso to the number of zzso zzso and not to the free energy difference in the folded state indicates that diffusion of different parts of the zzso relative to each other is taking place on going from the zzso ensemble to the transition zzso Our results also suggest that transition state ensembles could be more zzso than recently zzso
