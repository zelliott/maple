The zzso A resolution structure of zzso mouse zzso factor alpha zzso at 100 K has been zzso The zzso are zzso space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, alpha zzso zzso beta zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso The structure was refined to a final zzso R value of zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso protein zzso one zzso zzso one zzso zzso and 240 water zzso Throughout the crystal zzso the zzso are differently packed compared with human zzso which was zzso in the zzso space group zzso and refined to zzso A zzso The structures of zzso and human zzso are very similar, zzso mainly in regions that are either flexible and/or involved in crystal zzso Some zzso in zzso which contain zzso important for zzso binding are better resolved than in human zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are also important for zzso zzso Compared with human zzso the channel formed by the three zzso in zzso is zzso One zzso zzso trapped in the zzso channel could be a lead compound for the design of zzso zzso
