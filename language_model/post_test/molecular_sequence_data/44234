Using a zzso strategy and zzso zzso we isolated a zzso zzso gene that showed high sequence similarity to members of the zzso gene zzso An zzso zzso that disrupted the zzso open reading frame was zzso onto the zzso zzso zzso and analyzed for its effects on production of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso resulted in loss of zzso zzso protein but had no effect on the ability of the bacteria to grow within cultured zzso zzso in spite of the fact that some zzso zzso render zzso zzso unable to grow within zzso the isolation of this defined zzso confirms that production of zzso is not required for zzso zzso
