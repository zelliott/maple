The major zzso grass zzso zzso zzso p 1, resembles the zzso zzso of natural group I grass zzso zzso and is recognized by more than zzso of zzso zzso Our objective was the construction, zzso and zzso characterization of a genetically modified zzso of the major zzso grass zzso zzso zzso p 1 for zzso of grass zzso zzso 

A mosaic protein was generated by zzso zzso and expression of four zzso coding for zzso p 1 fragments and compared to the zzso p 1 zzso by circular zzso analysis, zzso E zzso capacity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso competition zzso zzso responses to the zzso were studied in zzso zzso 

zzso patients exhibited greater than an zzso reduction in zzso zzso to the mosaic as compared with the zzso p 1 zzso and zzso zzso experiments confirmed the reduced zzso activity of the zzso It also induced less zzso p zzso zzso zzso than zzso p 1 upon zzso of zzso However, zzso of mice and rabbits with the mosaic induced zzso zzso that inhibited patients' zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso p zzso zzso of zzso 

We have developed a strategy based on rational molecular zzso to convert one of the clinically most relevant zzso into a zzso zzso for zzso zzso
