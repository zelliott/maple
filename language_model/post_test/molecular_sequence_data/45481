Using zzso two zzso zzso zzso were cloned from a total zzso preparation of the skin of zzso brown zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directs the synthesis of zzso zzso previously isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directs the synthesis of a novel zzso zzso zzso that, atypically for members of the zzso family, zzso the growth of zzso bacteria more effectively than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not detected in skin prior to the onset of metamorphosis zzso zzso but the levels of the transcripts increased markedly during metamorphosis reaching a maximum at stage zzso Exposure of adult animals to zzso M zzso zzso for 72 h enhanced expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso but did not significantly change the level of expression of the zzso zzso Exposure of the animals to zzso M zzso and zzso M zzso A, an zzso zzso chemical that zzso zzso the action of zzso hormones zzso reduced expression of the zzso gene by zzso and the zzso gene by zzso We propose that zzso synthesis of zzso peptides is important in protecting the animal against zzso particularly at metamorphosis and during skin zzso but environmental pollutants can inhibit zzso synthesis and render the animal susceptible to invasion by zzso
