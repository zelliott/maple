A novel zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from a tidal flat zzso in Korea and subjected to a zzso zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso curved zzso zzso growth occurred at zzso degrees C and in the presence of 2-3 % zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso zzso : 1), zzso : 1) and zzso : zzso as major fatty zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso trees based on zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values zzso zzso to the type strains of all other zzso species and various differential zzso properties were sufficient to distinguish strain zzso from recognized zzso zzso On the basis of its zzso properties and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is classified as the type strain of a novel zzso species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
