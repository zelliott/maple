zzso zzso complex zzso is known to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of human zzso virus zzso infected patients before causing zzso and zzso zzso However, the mechanism involved in the gastrointestinal colonization is not zzso 

To identify putative zzso zzso receptors which serve as anchor for MAC zzso 

zzso mouse zzso zzso was subjected to single and two-dimensional zzso and zzso on zzso zzso MAC specific zzso proteins were identified by probing the zzso western blots with zzso proteins derived from zzso strain 101 zzso 

zzso MAC 101 proteins recognized a 39 zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein displaying an zzso point zzso of zzso was found to be zzso sensitive but resistant to zzso zzso I and zzso zzso The internal zzso acid sequence of the 39 zzso protein displayed zzso with zzso zzso B zzso The zzso between MAC zzso and zzso was confirmed by probing rabbit muscle zzso with MAC zzso Furthermore, both 25 and 31 zzso MAC zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso respectively, were found to bind to zzso 

MAC binds to zzso zzso zzso conceivably zzso zzso colonization of the zzso
