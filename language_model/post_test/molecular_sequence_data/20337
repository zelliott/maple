Deciphering the knowledge of zzso zzso specificity and developing zzso tools for detecting its zzso sites in protein zzso chain are very desirable for designing efficient and specific chemical zzso to prevent acquired zzso zzso In this study, we developed a zzso model based on a zzso of variable order zzso chains zzso for zzso sequences and adapted the model for prediction of their zzso by certain zzso The new method, called variable context zzso chains zzso attempts to identify the context zzso based on the evolutionary similarities between individual zzso zzso It was applied for zzso zzso zzso site prediction problem and shown to outperform existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy on a common zzso In general, the method is a promising tool for prediction of zzso sites of all zzso and encouraged to be used for any kind of zzso zzso problem as zzso
