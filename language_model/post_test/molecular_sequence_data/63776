The zzso clock relies on zzso feedback zzso that generate daily zzso of the clock gene expression at zzso and protein zzso In the evening, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso basic zzso zzso zzso zzso factors activate the expression of the period zzso and timeless zzso zzso zzso modifications delay the zzso of PER and zzso which inhibit zzso activity in the late zzso We show here that a zzso zzso of the clockwork orange zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso putative zzso factor displays zzso activity zzso zzso loss of function increases zzso zzso levels but reduces zzso peak levels of the 4 described zzso targets, inducing an almost complete loss of their zzso In addition, the absence of zzso zzso zzso of PER and zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that, in zzso zzso zzso clock gene expression through both zzso and zzso zzso zzso
