zzso zzso is a zzso highly specific, zzso zzso for which a number of zzso are zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso decision by degrading the zzso zzso zzso zzso and by its response to zzso by the zzso zzso gene zzso In order to gain further insight into the mechanism of the zzso activity of zzso zzso we identified the peptides generated following zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso acts as an zzso degrading zzso into small peptides with limited zzso acid specificity at the zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso is also zzso by zzso zzso suggesting that protein structure may play a minor role in determining the products of zzso The majority of the peptides produced were 13 to 20 zzso zzso
