We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of two related zzso zzso of zzso zzso These two zzso have predicted molecular weights of approximately 9 and 26 zzso and detect zzso in zzso of patients with zzso zzso Thus, to maintain consistency with nomenclature of the previously described 39 zzso diagnostic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso are being referred to as zzso and zzso A significant difference between zzso and zzso is the presence of 11 copies of a 14 zzso acid repeat in the open reading frame of zzso The region zzso the repeats of zzso shares a zzso identity with the open reading frame of zzso The zzso proteins zzso by both zzso are very zzso and show zzso migration on zzso zzso zzso of Southern zzso analysis reveal that zzso and zzso are zzso to varying degrees among various zzso zzso Interestingly, the repeat region of zzso is specific to zzso zzso and zzso zzso while the zzso region is zzso among several other zzso zzso levels of zzso are significantly zzso in the zzso stage of the zzso Our results show that zzso zzso is specific in detecting zzso in infection zzso from visceral zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso may complement zzso in a more accurate diagnosis of zzso in the old and the new zzso
