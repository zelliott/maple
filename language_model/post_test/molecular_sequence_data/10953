Human zzso virus 1 zzso zzso is a prime target in the search for drugs to combat the AIDS zzso The zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso the gag and zzso viral zzso at distinct zzso The possession of a twofold axis passing through the active site, has led to the design of zzso zzso in the form of zzso zzso zzso One of the most active compounds of this class of zzso is zzso zzso which contains a zzso zzso central unit zzso zzso Hansen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso & Winkler, zzso zzso European Patent application zzso zzso zzso Hansen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso International Conference on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hansen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso The structure of this inhibitor bound to zzso zzso in two different crystal forms, has been solved at zzso resolution using X-ray zzso In both forms, the details of the zzso interactions revealed an overall zzso binding mode, especially between the central zzso unit and the zzso zzso The main binding interactions comprise several specific zzso and zzso zzso which zzso many of the characteristics of the zzso relationship in the class of zzso zzso zzso In a general analysis of the mobility of the zzso regions, which cover the active site and participate directly in zzso using our structures and the zzso zzso models present in the Brookhaven zzso we found that in most structures the flexibility of the zzso is limited by local crystal zzso However, in one of the structures presented here, no significant crystal contacts to the zzso regions were present, and as a result the flexibility of the inhibitor bound zzso increased zzso This suggests that the mobility and zzso flexibility of the zzso zzso are important in the functioning of zzso zzso and must be considered in the future design of drugs against zzso zzso and in zzso drug design in zzso
