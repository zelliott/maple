zzso zzso that couple the zzso activity of zzso zzso with the unwinding activity of zzso zzso are powerful tools in the study of cell zzso and pharmaceutical drug zzso They are useful for targeting a specific gene as well as screening functional genes to show zzso zzso By zzso the binding arms within the zzso we can create a library of zzso that are capable of zzso any zzso After introducing the library into cells and recovering the sequence information of zzso that alter the cell zzso of interest, genes that are responsible for the specific zzso can be zzso This chapter describes a method known as the zzso system to identify novel functional genes related to a specific zzso Our zzso system should be a powerful tool for zzso zzso
