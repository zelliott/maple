A zzso Y zzso was isolated from the zzso extract of zzso This zzso enhanced significantly the zzso zzso potential difference zzso and zzso current zzso across the zzso of the seawater zzso after zzso with zzso zzso and zzso The effects of zzso on the zzso were zzso with a threshold concentration of 3 zzso zzso M and a zzso effect at 3 zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso curve was obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso Since 9 zzso acid zzso are replaced in the zzso this result indicates that these zzso do not change the potency and the zzso These zzso actions of zzso were not blocked by zzso an inhibitor of neural zzso or zzso an alpha zzso zzso indicating that zzso acts without enteric neural firing or zzso zzso When zzso and adrenaline zzso were applied zzso the effects were additive only at lower dosage (3 zzso zzso M for zzso 3 zzso zzso M for zzso but not at high dosage zzso M zzso zzso M zzso The ceiling effect at high dosage suggests that these two regulators act through common signal zzso systems and affect the zzso zzso system, since both effects were completely blocked by zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso
