The zzso protein specifically associated with high plains disease was characterized by zzso mass zzso after the agent had been isolated in pure culture by zzso puncture zzso a novel mechanical means of zzso Two zzso from different geographic locations each consisted of a mixture of zzso that were highly zzso to an zzso acid sequence derived from a zzso sequence zzso deposited in zzso trade mark by the Nebraska group as zzso probable zzso of high plains zzso However, the zzso sequence was found to be zzso de zzso sequencing of peptides produced by zzso zzso of the zzso band from an zzso separation showed that an additional 18 zzso acid zzso were present at the N zzso zzso zzso local alignment search zzso examination of the sequence showed no significant zzso with any protein in the databases, indicating that the infectious agent of high plains disease is likely a member of a zzso zzso virus zzso
