zzso are zzso toxins produced and exported by both zzso and zzso bacteria as a defense zzso The zzso protein family is highly diverse, which zzso the identification of zzso sequences using alignment zzso The use of zzso zzso zzso irrespective of sequence similarity can be a promising alternative to predict zzso zzso Thus, we present zzso zzso to zzso zzso as an zzso approach inspired in both the zzso zzso zzso Design zzso and zzso zzso zzso for Network zzso and Design zzso zzso zzso allows the calculation of the spectral moments as simple zzso to seek quantitative zzso relationships zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso are major criteria for the zzso activity of zzso the spectral moments zzso were derived for the first time from protein artificial secondary structures based on zzso acid zzso into a Cartesian system of zzso and zzso Several orders of zzso characterized zzso 196 zzso sequences and a control group made up of 200 representative zzso zzso zzso they were used to develop an zzso zzso model allowing a zzso discrimination of zzso proteins from other zzso a relevant result considering the high sequence diversity among the members of both zzso The model showed a prediction overall performance of zzso detecting specifically zzso of zzso zzso whereas the zzso retrieved just zzso As a practical zzso the model also predicted successfully the cryptic zzso function of the zzso zzso zzso domain from zzso zzso zzso which has not been detected by classical alignment zzso
