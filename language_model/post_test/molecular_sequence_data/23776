The purpose of the present study was to investigate the diversity of the genes zzso zzso zzso and their association with class 1 zzso in three zzso clones of zzso zzso The study collection included 106 zzso strains previously allocated to clone I zzso zzso zzso clone II zzso zzso zzso and clone III zzso zzso 6) and a zzso group of other strains zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso The strains were from hospitals of the Czech Republic zzso zzso zzso collected zzso and 12 other European countries zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso at least one of the following zzso genes was detected in 101 (95 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 31), zzso zzso zzso 7) and zzso zzso zzso zzso A combination of two to five different resistance genes was observed in 89 strains zzso zzso with a total of 12 different zzso zzso mapping revealed that zzso zzso and zzso were each associated with a class 1 zzso as was the case with zzso for six strains of clone zzso Six different class 1 zzso variable regions were detected in 78 strains zzso zzso with two zzso regions zzso and zzso zzso in two sets of 34 strains zzso The zzso zzso region contained five gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and differed from the zzso zzso region only by one additional zzso zzso These two zzso regions were confined to clones I and II and were found in strains isolated in seven countries between 1982 and zzso The clone III strains were homogeneous both in resistance genes and in zzso variable regions, whereas clones I and II showed a remarkable zzso diversity of these properties, with no clear-cut difference between the two zzso Yet, within the Czech clone I and II zzso the diversity of resistance genes and zzso structures was limited as compared to those from other zzso The occurrence of identical resistance zzso gene combinations and class 1 zzso associated with these genes in zzso distinct strains indicates that horizontal gene transfer plays a major role in the dissemination of zzso resistance in zzso zzso
