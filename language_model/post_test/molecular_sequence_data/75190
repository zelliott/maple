We report here the DNA sequence of the entire coding region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of two zzso required for zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso is likely a single zzso with multiple zzso We find that zzso zzso is a basic protein of zzso zzso acids corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence for zzso zzso is not significantly zzso to that of other known proteins of similar zzso In addition to the zzso zzso reading frame and several other unidentified open reading zzso we have found two open reading zzso zzso and zzso near the zzso of the zzso structural zzso One of these, zzso produces a divergent transcript which zzso only 125 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso transcript, and is present in approximately the same relative abundance as the transcript for zzso zzso
