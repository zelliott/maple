Although a large proportion of molecules expressed in the nervous system are zzso from zzso to zzso functional properties of such molecules are less zzso Here, we show that highly zzso zzso zzso acts as a novel regulator of zzso zzso plasticity in zzso zzso As zzso animals, zzso zzso migrated to the zzso temperature on a linear zzso zzso after zzso at a particular temperature with zzso Whereas zzso animals cultivated under zzso condition showed dispersed distribution on the zzso zzso zzso exhibited tendency to migrate toward higher zzso Such an abnormal behavior was completely rescued by the expression of human zzso of zzso indicating that the molecular function of zzso is highly zzso between zzso and zzso The behavioral regulation by zzso requires the zzso zzso zzso which ensures the proper zzso zzso of zzso to sensory zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso acts in the same zzso with zzso a zzso G protein alpha zzso Our results unveiled a novel neural protein in zzso confirming its zzso role in behavioral zzso
