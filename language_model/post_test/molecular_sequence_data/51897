In zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso experiments have shown that a number of zzso genes possess an zzso paused zzso zzso on their zzso zzso Here, we examine in zzso promoters that do and do not possess paused zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso are found associated with the pause site of the zzso zzso and zzso heat shock genes and the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso which lack a paused zzso have no comparable region of melted zzso Melting at the pause site persists upon heat shock induction of the zzso and zzso zzso indicating that pausing continues after gene zzso Interestingly, zzso triggers additional melting, both at the start site (in the region where open complexes would be expected to zzso and downstream of the zzso pause zzso In the course of our studies, we discovered that some T zzso of the zzso box were protected from zzso modification in both induced and zzso zzso This protection appears to be a consequence of zzso zzso as a similar protection pattern could be produced in zzso with zzso zzso
