The large number of different proteins zzso by the zzso cell are currently classified and studied in terms of groups of proteins with certain common properties such as physical and chemical zzso function, and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso that are actively zzso during culture on synthetic media represent a particular group of great current zzso At least eight proteins zzso by zzso tuberculosis have been isolated and characterized to various zzso The genes coding for five proteins zzso from zzso tuberculosis and/or zzso zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso All of them contain typical signal zzso The proteins of the zzso 85 complex, which form the main subject of this review, are often the most common proteins in zzso tuberculosis culture zzso The constituents zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by three genes located at different sites in the zzso zzso and show extensive zzso as well as zzso at zzso acid and gene zzso The proteins differ slightly in molecular mass in the zzso to zzso region, and all of them are zzso zzso but the significance of the latter observation and the role of these proteins in zzso physiology and interaction with the infected host remain to be zzso The zzso 85 complex proteins are strongly zzso in natural and experimental zzso infections in terms of both induction of zzso synthesis and zzso zzso The zzso difference in the efficacy of live and dead zzso vaccines should be considered in relation to the group of zzso zzso After zzso live bacteria in vaccines such as zzso multiply in the host, probably releasing several constituents belonging to the class of zzso proteins and hence resulting in more efficient stimulation of the immune zzso zzso zzso zzso are expected to be of particular significance in induction of various immune responses that are responsible for development of protective immunity in some individuals and for clinical symptoms and complications of the ensuing disease in zzso
