The understanding of the structure and function of zzso membrane zzso has been facilitated by studies showing that they belong to larger gene families of cell surface receptors involved in cellular zzso In some instances zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the study of the zzso proteins has served as a zzso for relatively newly described gene families zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In other instances, zzso zzso the background of information on zzso zzso proteins has served to indicate zzso zzso interactions have been characterized at the molecular level, and studies of genetic defects affecting zzso receptors have contributed significantly to understanding zzso zzso Gene zzso studies provide encouraging results that might lead to gene zzso The knowledge about zzso zzso processes contributes not only to our understanding of normal zzso function, but also to a more generalized understanding of adhesive mechanisms used by many cells to interact with their zzso
