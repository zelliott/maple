A zzso technique was used for the in zzso diversification of zzso structures based on expression in zzso coli of six zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso each from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were shown to be zzso in in zzso experiments and modified a broad range of zzso zzso at various zzso Using the zzso zzso as a model zzso we show that the product spectrum produced with the in zzso approach is identical to that found in zzso Additionally, using mixed cultures of zzso coli expressing different classes of zzso genes zzso and zzso the production of zzso zzso zzso was zzso This report demonstrates the potential to increase the structural diversity of plant secondary zzso using a zzso zzso zzso
