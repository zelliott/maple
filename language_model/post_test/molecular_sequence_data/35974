A chick zzso zzso zzso probe zzso the zzso region of zzso was used to screen a zzso zzso chick brain zzso library from zzso zzso A partial zzso zzso zzso was isolated zzso zzso which zzso a protein identical to chick zzso zzso except in the zzso part of the first zzso zzso In the zzso the 22 zzso found in the zzso zzso were replaced by a stretch of 26 unique zzso Analysis of the structure of the zzso zzso gene showed that the region of divergence was zzso by two zzso which are alternatively zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was used to investigate the levels of the zzso transcripts in various zzso The zzso zzso zzso was expressed at low levels in brain, liver and zzso but could not be detected in skeletal zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso was also expressed in brain, liver and zzso The zzso products were zzso by using diagnostic restriction zzso sites and by zzso The zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso gene was also detected in a variety of zzso libraries from both adult and embryonic zzso by zzso Although a transcript zzso this zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso neither of the two zzso would be predicted to be functional, making it unlikely to be a typical zzso zzso which are zzso with respect to binding zzso The two zzso zzso zzso zzso to date also have a zzso of five zzso acids between the two zzso hands, whereas in the zzso the zzso is just four zzso in zzso Further analysis will be required before this zzso zzso which we refer to as zzso can be classified as muscle or zzso zzso We propose a new nomenclature to describe the various zzso genes and their zzso
