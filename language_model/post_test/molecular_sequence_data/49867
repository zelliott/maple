von zzso disease zzso also called zzso zzso is inherited as an zzso dominant zzso It is frequently associated with other tumors in the central nervous system, zzso or adrenal zzso In order to investigate the relationship between zzso and corresponding zzso we performed molecular genetic analysis in a Japanese patient with zzso type zzso 

After informed consent had been zzso the three zzso of the zzso gene were zzso and zzso either directly or after zzso Clinical features were also zzso 

A novel zzso zzso of the 21 base pairs at zzso zzso (the position of zzso zzso of the zzso gene was found in our zzso The clinical zzso of the patient included retinal zzso associated with zzso zzso and traction retinal zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso which corresponded to those of zzso type zzso zzso diffuse vascular leakage was observed in the apparently intact zzso by zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso of the zzso gene is a rare association with zzso type zzso This zzso zzso may interfere the binding between the zzso gene and zzso zzso retinal vascular leakage suggests the possible effects of zzso vascular zzso factors such as vascular zzso growth factor from zzso associated with defective zzso zzso
