We demonstrated two different zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso in spores of zzso zzso with apparent molecular masses of 40 and 43 zzso The zzso zzso was also found in zzso zzso These two proteins are highly similar to each other as well as to other bacterial zzso alpha zzso The zzso zzso is shortened from its zzso in the portion of the zzso required for binding of DNA and zzso zzso The gene for zzso alpha from zzso zzso was cloned and zzso and the corresponding protein was zzso in zzso zzso In zzso experiments using zzso zzso alpha showed that the cell free extract from spores of zzso zzso exhibits zzso activity responsible for the alpha zzso zzso whereas that from zzso cells does zzso This modification of alpha zzso might point to a novel mechanism of zzso control in zzso
