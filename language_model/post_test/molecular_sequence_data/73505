Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of a rat novel zzso zzso zzso which was expressed in the brain and the zzso The zzso encodes the predicted protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with 12 putative zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence has moderate zzso with a zzso zzso zzso found in the zzso When expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced high affinity zzso zzso transport zzso This transport process was inhibited by zzso and zzso but not by free zzso acids such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transport activity was also confirmed by direct zzso zzso By in zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso was widely distributed throughout whole zzso zzso intense zzso signals were found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were located in both the zzso and small zzso cells in these zzso zzso protein could contribute to zzso of zzso which function as zzso and clearance of zzso zzso and be a new member in the growing zzso of zzso zzso and nitrate zzso although its structure, zzso and pharmacological characteristics are unique among these zzso
