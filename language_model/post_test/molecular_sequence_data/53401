We identified a zzso zzso whose zzso of zzso was similar to that of zzso and zzso in most cell lines and conditions, but showed higher fold zzso in response to zzso shock and zzso growth factor treatments of zzso zzso We zzso and cloned this novel zzso zzso which is an alternatively spliced form of zzso with a zzso acid zzso between zzso 340 and zzso of zzso When expressed in zzso cells, zzso exhibited zzso of zzso and zzso activity similar to those of zzso Unlike the uniform pattern of expression of zzso and zzso zzso was detected only in some of the zzso examined and seems to be abundant in the rat and human zzso Interestingly, in zzso zzso cells, there was a zzso higher expression of zzso which was also more responsive than zzso and zzso to various zzso zzso Unlike zzso and zzso zzso failed to interact with zzso as judged from its nuclear zzso in resting cells zzso zzso together with zzso or by lack of zzso of the two zzso Thus, zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso which seems to be the major zzso zzso that responds to zzso stimulation in zzso cells probably due to its differential regulation by zzso
