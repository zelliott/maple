We have identified a zzso complex of zzso zzso isolated at high frequency from cattle in Uganda, zzso Tanzania, and zzso We have named this related group of zzso zzso strains the African 2 zzso zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso strains are defined by a specific zzso deletion zzso and can be identified by the absence of zzso 3 to 7 in their zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso Chad, Nigeria, zzso South Africa, and zzso did not identify any strains of the zzso zzso complex, suggesting that this zzso complex of zzso zzso is localized in East zzso The specific zzso pattern of the zzso zzso complex was rarely identified among zzso from outside Africa, and the few zzso that were found and tested were intact at the zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso complex is localized to cattle in East zzso We found that strains of the zzso zzso complex of zzso zzso have, in general, four or more copies of the zzso sequence zzso in contrast to the majority of zzso zzso strains isolated from zzso which are thought to carry only one or a few zzso
