zzso is an zzso cell surface zzso for zzso that acts as a zzso zzso The properties of zzso human zzso were studied in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso was expressed on the cell surface as shown by the acquisition of zzso protein C zzso Like native zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso had Mr approximately zzso and was inhibited or zzso by zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso expressed by zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso expressed by zzso and zzso cells had similar zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso binding to zzso zzso on zzso cells was identical with that of zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso progressively inhibited the binding of zzso while factor Va did not inhibit zzso Three synthetic peptides were tested for ability to inhibit zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso displaced zzso from zzso but the factor V zzso zzso which is similar in composition and charge to zzso showed no binding zzso The data exclude the significant formation of a zzso complex consisting of zzso zzso and zzso These studies are consistent with a model in which zzso zzso and zzso compete for binding to zzso at the same zzso
