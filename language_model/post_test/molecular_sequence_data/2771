A protein of 75 zzso is found in large quantities throughout the blood stages of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on a partial zzso acid sequence for zzso previously deduced from a zzso clone zzso approximately zzso of the zzso secondary structural predictions were zzso The potential role of long range effects on the zzso structure of the protein stabilized by zzso bridges was determined by reduction and zzso of the fusion zzso Five regions were then chosen for zzso zzso zzso of 16, 28, 49, 64, and 76 zzso were zzso and used to zzso zzso All but the zzso peptides were capable of stimulating zzso zzso zzso responses in zzso but the zzso produced against the 49 zzso did not react with the native zzso zzso Thus, the 28, 64, and 76 zzso peptides represent good zzso models for portions of the zzso zzso zzso protein capable of stimulating both T and B cells in zzso The peptides were also used to probe whether any of the selected regions contain zzso which react with zzso from zzso monkeys immune to zzso zzso Of these zzso two were found to be consistently recognized in zzso by four zzso monkey zzso raised in response to zzso zzso Because these two peptides model a zzso region of the zzso zzso monkey zzso were also used as zzso of the importance of zzso bonding in maintaining the native zzso The results obtained were consistent with a folding pattern for zzso that incorporates a zzso bond between zzso 161 and zzso These results also suggest that most of the zzso recognized in this part of zzso by the immune system of the monkey are created by folding of the zzso
