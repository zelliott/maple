zzso zzso zzso escape terminal differentiation despite exhibiting a skeletal muscle zzso To understand the role of the zzso zzso proteins in zzso we characterized their regulation of zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso show that zzso zzso zzso expression through its 258 zzso core zzso zzso zzso confirm that zzso bind to core zzso sequences showing similarity to consensus zzso zzso We show that while zzso activates the expression of zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso it zzso them from terminally zzso as shown by low zzso and zzso heavy chain zzso and lack of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity via zzso coupled to the lack of cell cycle arrest is the underlying mechanism for the differentiation zzso Lastly, we show that zzso growth factor zzso signaling likely mediates the zzso of differentiation by zzso In a single experimental system we demonstrate that zzso can simultaneously induce zzso while preventing its zzso We propose a model zzso zzso commit a yet undefined precursor cell to the zzso lineage while at the same time inhibit terminal zzso thereby contributing to zzso zzso
