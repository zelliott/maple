zzso is a major zzso zzso in the central nervous zzso One of the receptors zzso the central effects of zzso is the zzso A1 zzso We performed a systematic zzso scan of the coding region of the zzso A1 zzso gene to explore its zzso in the general zzso zzso 40 unrelated healthy subjects by zzso zzso analysis no sequence changes of likely functional relevance were zzso We zzso however, a frequent T to G substitution at zzso position zzso which constitutes the first zzso described in an zzso zzso zzso It was used for fine scale linkage mapping of the A1 zzso zzso a zzso restriction zzso we zzso 7 zzso families zzso zzso du zzso zzso and mapped the zzso in a gene cluster around the zzso gene on zzso zzso In addition, we zzso the zzso zzso to demonstrate zzso expression of the zzso A1 zzso gene in adult human zzso
