A significant percentage of young men are zzso and, for the majority, the underlying cause remains zzso Male zzso is, however, frequently associated with defective zzso zzso wherein the zzso tail is a modified zzso zzso a greater understanding of essential mechanisms involved in tail formation may offer contraceptive opportunities, or more broadly, therapeutic strategies for global zzso zzso Here we have identified zzso 2 zzso as an essential requirement for zzso tail assembly and zzso zzso is a member of a poorly characterized zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly enriched within developing male germ cells, where it zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso Lesser amounts of zzso zzso were observed in other zzso containing zzso zzso Using a zzso approach and zzso affinity columns followed by zzso we demonstrated that within developing zzso germ cells zzso interacts with zzso transport zzso proteins and delivers a specific set of zzso zzso zzso including key members of the zzso pathway, to the zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso proteins is regulated by zzso zzso zzso function, as exemplified by the Mot mouse line that contains a zzso in a critical zzso interaction domain, results in male zzso characterized by reduced zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and short zzso Our data demonstrate a novel function for the zzso protein family, an essential role for zzso in male fertility and a previously zzso mechanism for protein delivery to the zzso
