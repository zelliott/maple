G zzso receptors zzso are integral membrane proteins whose zzso nature enables zzso zzso signal zzso amplification, and diversification via G zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso appear to enable this by being structurally flexible and by existing in different zzso states with potentially different signaling and functional zzso We describe a method for the prediction of the three-dimensional structures of these different zzso of zzso starting from their zzso acid zzso It combines a unique protocol of zzso methods that first predict the TM regions of these receptors and TM zzso shapes based on those regions, which is followed by a locally complete sampling of TM zzso zzso and their scoring that results in a few zzso lowest energy zzso likely to play a role in binding to different zzso and signaling zzso zzso of the structures for multiple zzso of a zzso is starting to enable the testing of multiple hypotheses related to zzso zzso and binding to zzso with different signaling zzso
