Using the zzso chain reaction to study zzso expressed in human zzso tumor cells, a member of a new family of protein zzso was zzso The zzso domain of this zzso has zzso similarity to both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso representing two members of this new family have been isolated from a human zzso zzso zzso library and zzso The predicted zzso sequences of these clones reveal that, in addition to the unusual nature of their zzso zzso zzso they contain two zzso motifs and a basic zzso near their zzso As they possess zzso associated with proteins from two distinct functional groups, these zzso have been named zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso from zzso has been found to be expressed in zzso tumor cell lines of zzso breast and zzso zzso The zzso gene has been mapped to human zzso zzso
