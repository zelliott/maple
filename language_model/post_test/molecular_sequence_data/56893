Human zzso is zzso by cells in culture and is present in both zzso and zzso forms in human fetal serum and zzso zzso We have found zzso zzso in the zzso media of both Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso human zzso and human zzso zzso cells metabolically zzso with zzso zzso acid analysis of this zzso demonstrates that only zzso zzso are zzso Four zzso zzso of zzso can be separated from one zzso form by zzso gel zzso Since we have shown that the zzso form of zzso has a lower affinity for zzso compared to zzso forms and a greater zzso effect of zzso actions, we determined which zzso zzso in human zzso are zzso After metabolically zzso zzso with zzso the zzso zzso was zzso first with zzso and then with zzso zzso By zzso the resulting zzso zzso we found 3 zzso zzso to be zzso zzso zzso of incorporated zzso was attributed to zzso while zzso accounted for approximately zzso and zzso for zzso To investigate the zzso importance of zzso this zzso (and the zzso zzso were changed to zzso by site directed zzso of a human zzso expression zzso followed by zzso into zzso zzso The zzso zzso from the zzso media of these cells had the following zzso 1) when zzso with zzso it contained zzso less zzso than wild type zzso 2) when analyzed by zzso gel zzso it contained none of the most rapidly zzso and most rapidly zzso and most highly zzso zzso more of the zzso zzso and more of the most slowly zzso zzso zzso and 3) its affinity for zzso was reduced zzso and was midway between wild type zzso from zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso represents the major site of zzso of zzso and that while zzso of zzso increases affinity of zzso for zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso also contributes to the high affinity of fully zzso zzso
