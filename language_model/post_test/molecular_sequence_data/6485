We have determined the precise location and structure of the zzso DNA breaks zzso formed during zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined at two zzso hot spots in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso At both zzso breaks occurred at zzso zzso spaced sites in a approximately 150 zzso zzso contained within an area of zzso zzso No consensus sequence could be discerned at or around break zzso zzso of zzso observed on individual strands indicated that breaks initially form with a two zzso zzso zzso Broken strands from zzso zzso cells contained tightly bound protein at their zzso zzso We suggest that, in zzso zzso zzso is initiated by a zzso activity that creates a zzso linked zzso zzso
