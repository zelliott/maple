Most of the sequences determined in current zzso sequencing projects remain at least partially zzso The available software for DNA sequence analysis is usually limited to the prediction of individual elements zzso 1 zzso but does not assess the context of different zzso However, the functionality of biological units like promoters depends on the correct spatial organization of multiple individual zzso 

Here, we present a zzso software package called zzso zzso zzso for further analysis of results obtained with level 1 methods zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso One of the main features of this modular program is its ability to assess distance correlations between large sets of sequence elements which can be used for the identification and definition of basic patterns of functional zzso The program provides an zzso zzso user interface with direct comprehensive display of all results for zzso zzso zzso elements showing spatial correlations can be easily extracted and traced back to the zzso sequence with the zzso zzso identified promoters of zzso zzso in zzso zzso as members of a zzso with unusual location of an zzso zzso zzso on the basis of distance correlation analysis, the program correctly selected those zzso factors within these promoters already known to be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso demonstrating the power of this zzso
