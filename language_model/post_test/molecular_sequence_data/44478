The zzso coli zzso P zzso zzso internal zzso loop and the zzso zzso zzso stem loop are important zzso binding sites for the zzso zzso of zzso Models of zzso coli zzso zzso loop and the zzso zzso zzso stem loop have been constructed using zzso a constraint satisfaction zzso The models use zzso analysis data for suggesting initial base pairings, chemical zzso and zzso results to determine particular pairing zzso and zzso experimental analysis data for zzso P zzso zzso The structures from zzso coli and zzso zzso although different in secondary structure, have similar sequence and zzso Using zzso we are able to illustrate how the 3' end of the zzso is able to interact with this segment of the zzso zzso P zzso In addition, we propose additional hydrogen bonding between zzso in the 3' zzso of the zzso and the zzso region of zzso coli and to the loop of zzso zzso
