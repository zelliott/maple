To identify the essential sequence of the promoter of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso were constructed and zzso for promoter zzso The essential sequence was located within 65 zzso upstream from the major cap site and a sequence that reduces the promoter activity was found in a region upstream from the essential promoter zzso We previously identified two zzso nuclear factors, zzso and zzso that bind to a region around the site of initiation of translation of the zzso zzso In this study, we confirmed the binding site of these factors by gel mobility shift analysis and found that zzso is the major factor that binds to the zzso gene in zzso cells, whereas zzso is the major factor in the zzso line of human zzso zzso To clarify the function of these factors, we examined the effects of the binding of these factors on the promoter zzso Our findings suggest that the binding of zzso enhances the promoter activity of the zzso gene in zzso cells, whereas the binding of zzso zzso the activity of the same promoter in zzso zzso
