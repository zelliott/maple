Pepper zzso zzso zzso contains a range of zzso zzso molecules resembling the zzso of zzso In this work, we have completed the molecular characterization of Pepper cryptic virus 1 zzso from zzso zzso zzso and generated complete zzso sequences of another zzso from zzso zzso zzso designated Pepper cryptic virus 2 zzso The two viruses share limited identical zzso acid content in both zzso segments and appear zzso closer to zzso reported from other crops zzso zzso zzso cryptic virus 3, Black raspberry cryptic zzso than to each zzso Two sets of zzso zzso were successfully used in zzso tests for the simultaneous and zzso detection of these two viruses in pepper leaves and zzso Both viruses were detected in several pepper zzso tested, either as single or mixed zzso
