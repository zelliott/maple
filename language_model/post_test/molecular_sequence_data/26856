Iron is a necessary but often limiting zzso for plant growth and zzso zzso grown on the zzso zzso zzso are especially prone to developing iron zzso zzso and suffering the zzso yield zzso Once iron is transported into the zzso it must be zzso from the root to the shoot where it is needed for photosynthesis and other zzso Previous work has indicated that iron is likely to move through the zzso as zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is zzso into the zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we present the identification and characterization of two soybean zzso zzso and zzso with similar sequence and function to zzso The expression of both zzso and zzso is induced by iron zzso in the zzso reference zzso Williams zzso zzso but not zzso is expressed at higher levels in the zzso zzso Clark than in its zzso near zzso line zzso zzso likely accounting for the higher zzso zzso levels in zzso Increased zzso zzso levels lead to increased zzso of zzso iron in Clark zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that high zzso zzso levels are needed for efficient root to shoot zzso of zzso Along with efficient zzso zzso zzso activity and root iron zzso activity, high expression levels of zzso genes are also proposed as a target for future iron efficiency breeding zzso
