The zzso zzso proteins usually undergo three sequential zzso processing steps: zzso attachment of a zzso group to the zzso zzso zzso zzso removal of the last three zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso of the exposed zzso group of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso major Ras converting zzso 1 zzso zzso of zzso and 285 zzso zzso respectively, have only zzso sequence identity to those from other species but contain the critical zzso for the activity found in other zzso The zzso zzso zzso converting zzso 1 zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso acids with zzso sequence identity to those of other species and contains the consensus zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain predicted zzso regions like other zzso zzso from zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso major showed zzso activity against zzso zzso whereas zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The results suggest that zzso is responsible for zzso removal of the zzso zzso from zzso proteins in these zzso All the three zzso zzso processes are thought to be required for proper cellular functioning of zzso in zzso zzso We carried out zzso interference experiments in zzso zzso of the zzso involved in zzso protein zzso modification to evaluate their importance in cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso resulted in zzso suppression of cell growth and dramatic zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso caused less dramatic effects on growth but induced noticeable changes in cell zzso
