zzso acid zzso is a critical regulator of gene expression during embryonic development and in the maintenance of adult zzso zzso This study was undertaken to identify genetic zzso of zzso which might affect these zzso We zzso zzso in racially diverse individuals and assessed the metabolism of zzso acid by newly identified coding zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso 

zzso was zzso in 24 zzso 24 African-Americans, 24 zzso and 20 individuals of unknown racial zzso zzso zzso for zzso and coding zzso of zzso were constructed in a zzso expression zzso and expressed in zzso zzso A zzso tag at the zzso end of the zzso was used to zzso the zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 13 single zzso zzso zzso were identified in zzso Three zzso produced coding zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso were termed as zzso zzso and zzso respectively, by the Human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Committee at zzso Wild type zzso protein zzso zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins exhibited significantly lower metabolism zzso of zzso than zzso zzso zzso 

This is the first study to identify coding zzso of zzso Two coding zzso zzso and zzso are predicted to be defective based on the metabolism of zzso by the zzso zzso These studies suggest the need for future clinical studies of zzso of zzso in embryonic zzso
