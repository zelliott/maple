Linear zzso sites in the zzso and zzso serum protein zzso P component were investigated using affinity zzso zzso and zzso zzso in conjunction with affinity zzso zzso fragments were generated from zzso P component by treatment with zzso and zzso zzso This zzso mixture was separated by zzso before and after passage through a column of immobilized zzso In addition, the zzso digest was separated by zzso zzso in the presence of various amounts of zzso in zzso zzso shift patterns in the presence of zzso were in agreement with one of the components shown by zzso to interact with immobilized zzso The identity of this zzso was established by mass zzso after zzso zzso and represents a novel zzso zzso The results illustrate the potential zzso in the combination of the two high-resolution separation techniques zzso and zzso zzso has the advantages of high recovery and zzso power while zzso zzso is noted for highly efficient zzso under zzso zzso The possibility of using unmodified zzso in the study of biological activities of protein zzso while consuming very little material makes zzso further zzso
