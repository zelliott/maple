zzso is a widely expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso to focal zzso Previous studies showed that the zzso zzso domain can associate with and zzso the activity of protein zzso C, which is required for focal zzso zzso To examine further the role of zzso in cell zzso we expressed zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to confirm effects seen were specific for zzso zzso zzso full length zzso core protein exhibited a more zzso zzso zzso with increased focal zzso formation and decreased cell zzso zzso of a zzso core protein with either a partial or complete deletion of the zzso domain or of an zzso construct led to markedly decreased spreading and focal zzso formation, a more zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso of zzso changed the adhesive zzso but did not markedly alter focal zzso and zzso bundle zzso The data suggest that zzso is a regulator of focal zzso and stress fiber formation, and influences both zzso and zzso
