zzso boxes are DNA binding zzso present in zzso zzso general zzso factors for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso boxes of zzso an abundant component of zzso interact specifically with zzso zzso DNA structures that are zzso and contain angles of approximately 60 and 120 degrees between their zzso We show here also that the zzso box of zzso the protein that determines the expression of zzso genes in humans, recognizes zzso junction zzso irrespective of their zzso In addition, when zzso binds to linear duplex DNA containing its specific target zzso it produces a sharp zzso zzso the interaction between zzso boxes and DNA appears to be predominantly zzso The production of the recognition of a zzso in DNA can serve several distinct functions, such as the repair of DNA zzso the folding of DNA segments with bound zzso factors into productive complexes or the wrapping of DNA in zzso
