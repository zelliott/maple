zzso measures of zzso gene expression allow the indirect detection of zzso or sequence zzso in regulatory elements or in other zzso regions that may result in significant zzso or pathological changes of gene expression and may contribute to zzso or zzso zzso We have devised a simple method, based on zzso and single zzso primer extension zzso with zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso high performance liquid zzso We established optimal conditions for separation of the extended products corresponding to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which is the most frequent zzso zzso of zzso We then zzso 99 unrelated control subjects and measured the zzso zzso expression in the 40 zzso controls found in this zzso This method allowed us to define a narrow range of normal zzso expression of zzso each zzso contributing between zzso and zzso of the total zzso We then measured the zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso patients with zzso zzso bearing different zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso in order to detect the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that induce zzso instability were identified zzso and the data were consistent with current models of zzso This study provides a sensitive tool to identify indirectly zzso defects that may escape detection in zzso DNA screenings but result in a quantitative change at the zzso zzso
