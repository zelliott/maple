A new mast cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso of the solitary zzso zzso zzso zzso the most common zzso zzso found in zzso The structure was analyzed by zzso together with zzso degradation, which was zzso by zzso zzso The sequence of zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso a mast cell zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and rich in zzso and basic zzso zzso In fact, zzso exhibited similar activity to zzso in stimulating zzso from rat zzso mast cells and zzso zzso It also showed significant zzso activity in human zzso zzso this is the first example that a mast cell zzso zzso is found in the solitary zzso zzso Besides the zzso and zzso activity, zzso also affects on zzso transmission in the lobster walking leg zzso Three zzso zzso approximately 3 were zzso and biologically tested together with zzso resulting in the importance of the zzso zzso structure for biological zzso
