zzso peptides zzso the zzso and zzso terminal region of zzso zzso have been analyzed for their ability to mimic different properties of full length beta zzso zzso zzso containing both the zzso site and the zzso domain zzso is readily zzso by alpha zzso whose activity is zzso zzso Such zzso is accompanied by a weak interaction zzso by zzso zzso but not by far Western zzso and is not reversed by zzso which zzso overcome zzso of zzso zzso by full length beta zzso A strong interaction with alpha is observed with zzso but not with its shorter zzso zzso as judged from far Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso however, affect the regular interaction between alpha and beta zzso altering the zzso pattern and responsiveness to zzso zzso unlike zzso tends to zzso more readily than full length beta zzso This zzso which is reminiscent of the zzso of full length beta zzso would indicate that tight zzso of zzso zzso depends on zzso in the zzso zzso Failure of zzso zzso to mediate responsiveness to zzso peptides and zzso zzso propensity of zzso suggest that other structural elements between the sequences zzso and zzso are required in order to zzso optimal functionality to the beta zzso
