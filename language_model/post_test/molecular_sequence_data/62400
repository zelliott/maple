zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is pivotal in regulating zzso cell zzso however, the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso remains to be zzso Using the zzso bacterial expression system, we investigated the expression patterns of various forms of zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso was successfully expressed in zzso coli and zzso as a zzso active zzso In contrast, the expression of full-length human zzso zzso in zzso coli was barely zzso On the basis of this result, we characterized further the expression patterns of zzso or zzso truncated zzso zzso We found that three copies of the zzso zzso which exist only in zzso might serve as a primary site that is highly susceptible to zzso degradation by host zzso zzso of the zzso region containing the zzso motifs produced a form resistant to zzso degradation during expression in zzso coli and zzso consequently improving the production of a zzso active, mature zzso Our study provides a method for generating useful zzso to investigate molecular mechanism by which zzso contributes to regulating zzso cell death and to identify natural zzso of zzso
