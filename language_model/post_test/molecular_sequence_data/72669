zzso clones from zzso zzso to zzso zzso region of the rat zzso gene locus were isolated for examination of the zzso structure in the region from zzso zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso analysis using rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and 235 zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sites zzso specific for zzso cells were previously shown to be located exclusively in the zzso zzso to zzso zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 23, zzso No other zzso having this specificity was found in the region examined in this zzso Except for these and two other zzso located in a cluster in this region, no zzso could be found from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso having no or less zzso specificity were scattered about in the zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso site of the human zzso zzso zzso gene has been shown present 22 zzso upstream from the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso Jones, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 29, zzso zzso site of the rat zzso zzso gene was shown in this study to be at zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was specifically expressed in zzso cells but not in zzso cells, and thus the boundary region that ensures the zzso expression of each gene would appear to be situated between two zzso The region prerequisite for zzso expression of the rat zzso gene was estimated based on the present zzso
