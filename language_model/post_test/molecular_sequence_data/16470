zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the second zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso with zzso zzso to yield zzso In this study, we have first characterized in detail a plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso protein from zzso zzso Native gel zzso analysis showed that the zzso behaves as a zzso with a calculated mass of zzso zzso It is activated by 5 zzso zzso and is inhibited by zzso which is specific for zzso zzso It has a pH optimum of zzso and a temperature optimum of 35 degrees C, with an energy of zzso of zzso J zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso from chicken and zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not stimulate zzso activity in zzso instead all except zzso were zzso zzso has an apparent zzso of 43 zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was inhibited by one of the zzso zzso and by both products zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in a decreased zzso indicating some involvement of these zzso in zzso zzso Unlike zzso and its soluble zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso did not display zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increased specific zzso Based on these kinetic zzso we generated a novel double zzso zzso which resulted in a zzso increased specific activity, but still lacking zzso by zzso strongly suggesting that zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso of an zzso zzso resulting in loss of zzso zzso has never been previously reported for any zzso
