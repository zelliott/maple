zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a protein consisting of 180 zzso zzso To determine whether zzso in fact encodes a zzso sequences zzso an zzso zzso zzso was inserted at the zzso of the zzso protein in zzso strain zzso Using zzso zzso zzso a zzso band was specifically detected by western zzso analysis in zzso of cells infected with a zzso zzso from strain zzso that carries the zzso but not in cells infected with parental zzso Further characterization of the protein using zzso and zzso studies showed that zzso is an early protein that zzso to the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso exhibited a zzso zzso and could not be zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso protein plays a major role in zzso replication in zzso and likely in zzso
