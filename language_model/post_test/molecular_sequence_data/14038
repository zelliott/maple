The Random zzso zzso DNA zzso technique was used in the identification of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso of approximately 500 zzso was amplified from the zzso of 15 different zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso but was shown to be absent in 26 different zzso and 20 different clinical zzso of zzso zzso When the zzso was used as a probe in a Southern zzso analysis, several radioactive bands common to zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso were zzso However, this zzso zzso specifically to a 2900 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso but failed to zzso in either zzso tuberculosis or zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on a partial zzso sequence of the 500 zzso fragment, two zzso zzso were designed and a zzso zzso was zzso Using zzso zzso DNA samples, only zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso rendered a unique amplification zzso This zzso zzso is able to detect down to 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA, which zzso roughly to two zzso The zzso is also useful for identifying the zzso directly from zzso biological samples, such as zzso
