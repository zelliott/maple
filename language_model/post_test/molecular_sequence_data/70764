The mechanisms by which zzso proteins interact with other proteins to carry out specific cellular processes is poorly zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in many zzso functions in zzso Some of these functions require interaction with the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rose, and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso We have identified a zzso zzso zzso named zzso zzso a protein with sequence and structural similarity to zzso The zzso protein is detected in zzso growing cells but not in mating zzso zzso zzso physically associates with zzso in a complex separate from that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso body region in a zzso zzso zzso concentration of zzso at the zzso poles during zzso growth requires the presence of zzso but not zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso and zzso are involved in different zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes increased resistance to the zzso zzso drug zzso and partially suppresses growth defects of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso partially suppresses the zzso growth zzso of strains lacking the function of two other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results indicate that zzso forms functionally distinct complexes with zzso and zzso to participate in different zzso events within the same zzso
