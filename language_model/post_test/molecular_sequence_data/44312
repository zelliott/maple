Three potato virus Y zzso representatives of distinct zzso groups, identified in potato fields in northern Poland were submitted to biological and molecular zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso belong to the zzso strain and the third one zzso to the common zzso zzso however, did not react with zzso zzso directed against the zzso strain zzso which zzso zzso To zzso the zzso coat protein genes were zzso and compared with sequences from zzso The zzso zzso isolate showed zzso zzso acid zzso with the common zzso and significantly differed from the second zzso isolate zzso zzso based zzso zzso and zzso analysis lead to zzso of zzso into group I, encompassing solely zzso strain zzso whereas zzso falls into a zzso zzso group zzso The sequence analysis allowed for identification of putative group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were identical for zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso coat protein gene and zzso sequences of the common zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso This suggests that tobacco zzso necrosis zzso are located outside the 3' and zzso terminal sequences of the zzso zzso
