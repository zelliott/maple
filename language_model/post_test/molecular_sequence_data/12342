zzso zzso Factor zzso an zzso 6 zzso zzso is an essential growth factor for zzso zzso stem zzso The zzso was known in these cells, but the zzso part of the signal cascade and the zzso factors through which zzso controls its zzso target genes in zzso stem cells, had not been zzso This study shows that the type II zzso element of the rat alpha 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso which mediates zzso and zzso in zzso cells, also functioned as a zzso element zzso in zzso zzso stem cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso It zzso zzso zzso by zzso of zzso reporter zzso in these zzso A characteristic zzso activity interacting with this zzso was induced by treatment of these cells with zzso The complex between this activity and the zzso had identical zzso mobility, zzso and zzso of induction as the complex with the corresponding zzso factor zzso from zzso zzso The zzso factor zzso was part of this complex, as shown by its zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso cells caused the induction of differentiation and the disappearance of this zzso zzso zzso the surface density of zzso zzso receptors was reduced approximately zzso
