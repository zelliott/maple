zzso T cells and T cells from patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso express increased levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the T cell zzso zzso complex and zzso the zzso signal in the cell more efficiently than the zzso zzso zzso The reasons for the increased expression of zzso are zzso In the present study, we found that zzso is regulated by the zzso factor zzso in cooperation with zzso zzso and zzso bound to the zzso promoter in close proximity and increased the promoter activity in a specific zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression by zzso resulted in decreased expression of zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso resulted in increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and had an additive effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso showed a similar pattern in B zzso however, as expected, zzso promoter activity was much higher in B cells as compared with T zzso zzso of zzso led to increase in zzso calcium flux following zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso T cells had increased levels of zzso at baseline and zzso zzso upon zzso Finally, disruption of zzso and zzso in zzso T cells resulted in a decrease in calcium flux upon zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso in cooperation with zzso increases the expression of zzso and contributes to zzso heightened calcium responses in zzso T zzso
