zzso is an important constituent of the outer membrane of zzso zzso zzso is involved in a variety of zzso zzso including crossing of the zzso barrier by zzso coli strains causing newborn meningitis, and elicits a significant response by the immune system of the zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso is also attributed to degradation of the bacterial zzso Here we examined the zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso strains and show that two zzso zzso are zzso among invasive strains of zzso coli and other zzso zzso In addition, there is evidence for zzso evolution, zzso the existence of selective zzso Our results also indicate that large quantities of zzso are zzso into the medium during all zzso of growth, where it is present both in zzso zzso and as a soluble zzso zzso We assume that zzso zzso can play a role in protection of bacteria from zzso by competitive zzso Support for this assumption was obtained from experiments indicating that addition of zzso zzso zzso reduces killing of bacteria by zzso
