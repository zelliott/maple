Given the vital role of zzso in cell zzso the zzso involved in bacterial de zzso zzso zzso are possible targets for drug design against zzso zzso The first reaction in the zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso a zzso that converts zzso to zzso using either molecular oxygen or zzso as electron zzso zzso has considerable sequence zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The crystal structure of the zzso of zzso from zzso coli has been determined to zzso A zzso The zzso shows a novel fold for an zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso an zzso domain with the zzso fold, a zzso zzso bundle domain, and an alpha + beta capping domain, which is zzso similar to the small zzso of spinach zzso zzso The interface between the zzso and capping zzso defines a zzso in which the active site is zzso 

A number of strictly zzso zzso present in all three zzso indicate that zzso zzso and zzso share the same overall folding zzso Many of these zzso zzso are in the zzso site and active zzso suggesting a similar zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso form a class of functionally and structurally related zzso that are all able to reduce zzso and to zzso a zzso zzso
