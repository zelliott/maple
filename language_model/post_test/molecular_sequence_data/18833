zzso zzso zzso have attracted great attention in biomedical and zzso fields for controlled delivery of zzso compounds, as well as a vehicle for therapeutic cell zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso suitable for the realization of smart zzso In this study, we explored the potential of an zzso zzso zzso to realize zzso zzso systems to control the release of zzso Our approach showed that this zzso was susceptible to zzso degradation, and it has been successfully employed to obtain an efficient delivery of a model zzso This setup will constitute a therapeutic agent delivery platform to realize devices capable of responding and interacting with biological systems at the molecular zzso
