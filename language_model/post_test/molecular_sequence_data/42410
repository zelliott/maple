zzso disease is characterized by zzso leading to enhanced production of zzso zzso zzso is primarily zzso by the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso In the past, either zzso cells or zzso zzso were used as a source of zzso to detect zzso zzso Recently, we expressed the zzso domain of the human zzso zzso using the zzso expression zzso In this study, we used zzso protein in an zzso to detect zzso zzso Our data show that this zzso can be used to analyze and zzso zzso specific zzso against the zzso To map zzso zzso on the zzso we tested patients zzso against synthetic peptides derived from two highly zzso regions zzso acid, AA zzso and zzso of the zzso Although zzso from patients with zzso disease reacted with several zzso they showed particularly strong zzso against peptides from a relatively narrow region zzso AA zzso of the zzso The present study demonstrates the usefulness of the zzso zzso to detect and characterize zzso zzso in a simple and sensitive zzso and has lead to the identification of some of the zzso zzso on the zzso
