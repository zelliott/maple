Hundreds of G zzso receptors zzso and at least six zzso zzso have been identified, but the only zzso zzso that has been definitively demonstrated is the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso locus of zzso zzso in zzso result in defects in termination of the light response and cause severe retinal zzso In the current work, we demonstrate that zzso binds to zzso and a zzso in an zzso motif that eliminates the zzso interaction prevents zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso termination of the zzso Our data indicate that zzso is a novel zzso protein zzso and raise the possibility that regulation of other zzso through zzso may be controlled by zzso protein zzso related to zzso
