Human alpha heavy chain disease is characterized by the production of zzso short alpha zzso zzso In previously published cases it has been found that the zzso cells produce abnormal alpha zzso lacking zzso and zzso sequences and composed of a leader sequence zzso sequences of variable length zzso to 84 zzso and of unknown origin, followed by normal zzso and zzso zzso In this study we established the zzso sequence of alpha zzso for six cases of alpha heavy chain zzso We observed that all six alpha zzso lack the zzso and zzso sequences as do those previously zzso They also contain zzso zzso of unknown origin between the leader zzso and the normal zzso and zzso coding zzso These zzso are of variable length zzso to 105 zzso and they are zzso These results suggest the existence of a common mechanism zzso leading to zzso in alpha heavy chain disease rather than a specific interaction between alpha 1 zzso gene with a unique defined molecular zzso
