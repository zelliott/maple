Evidence is presented that the growth factor zzso zzso binds to zzso and the interaction has been characterized by zzso zzso zzso chemical shifts indicate that zzso interacts with both the zzso acid and the zzso forms of zzso The chemical shift data are consistent with a weak zzso binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso form of zzso by the zzso acid form of zzso As the zzso is increased and the zzso acid groups are zzso chemical shift data indicate that ammonium groups of zzso are hydrogen bonded to zzso zzso groups, while the zzso zzso ring occupies the zzso site of zzso Evidence for zzso binding includes displacement of chemical shift zzso zzso for zzso to lower zzso increased shielding of specific zzso zzso by the zzso ring current and displacement of chemical shift zzso zzso for zzso to higher zzso zzso binding zzso were determined for binding of the zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso by the zzso form of zzso from chemical shift zzso zzso zzso zzso
