zzso are a family of naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso yet the target zzso and biological processes they regulate are poorly zzso zzso F is expressed selectively in immune cells and is the only zzso to be zzso as an inactive zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that a major target of zzso F in different immune cell types is the zzso zzso C, which regulates the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in T cells, natural killer cells, zzso and mast zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso F was unable to inhibit zzso C in zzso even though zzso of zzso F suppressed cellular zzso C zzso We predicted, using structural models, that an zzso processing event would be necessary before zzso F can engage zzso C and we show that the zzso form of zzso F indeed has a precise zzso zzso that creates a zzso C zzso Thus, zzso F is a zzso zzso inhibitor itself regulated by zzso in the zzso zzso By targeting zzso C, it may regulate diverse immune cell zzso zzso
