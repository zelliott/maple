The structure of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso is unlike that of any bacterial zzso However, genetic analysis of the genes involved in the formation of these zzso has been lacking until this zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso and shown by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso to consist primarily of zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 17 zzso zzso deletions were created in three zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso proteins with bacterial type IV zzso signal peptides previously identified by in zzso methodology as likely candidates for zzso structural zzso zzso of zzso or zzso resulted in zzso cells completely devoid of zzso on the cell surface, while deletion of the third zzso zzso zzso resulted in cells greatly reduced in the number of zzso on the zzso zzso with the deleted gene in each case returned the cells to a zzso zzso Surprisingly, mass zzso analysis of zzso zzso identified the major structural zzso as another type IV zzso zzso zzso whose gene is located outside the first zzso zzso This protein was found to be zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis confirmed that zzso is required for zzso
