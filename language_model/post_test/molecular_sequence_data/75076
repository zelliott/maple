The zzso zzso is the largest member of a family of zzso proteins that associate with zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso sequences obtained from zzso bovine zzso zzso were used to screen a human zzso zzso library, and the complete primary structure of human zzso zzso was deduced by DNA sequence zzso The protein consists of eight zzso acid repeats separated by linking sequences of variable zzso It is highly similar to the human zzso I and II zzso each of which contains four such zzso The zzso zzso of the three proteins show no sequence zzso however, in the repeated regions the proteins are zzso identical in zzso Analysis of the 16 repeats from the three proteins provides insights into the structural basis for zzso zzso zzso These data place the zzso and the zzso into the same gene family and suggest that these proteins have similar functions and have evolved from a common zzso
