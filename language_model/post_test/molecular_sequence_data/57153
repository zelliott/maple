The zzso carrier of zzso coli couples sugar transport to zzso zzso and zzso while that of zzso zzso zzso only zzso and zzso We made five zzso carriers derived from the two carriers to identify the zzso involved in zzso zzso The zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have the zzso 77, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso derived from zzso coli and the rest derived from zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso zzso through the zzso carriers zzso zzso and zzso was strongly zzso by zzso and zzso as is the case with the zzso coli zzso On the other hand, there was very little stimulation with the carriers zzso and zzso These results suggest that, 1) the zzso 77 zzso acids of the zzso coli carrier, which has 5 different and 4 fewer zzso acids than the zzso zzso carrier, have a crucial role in zzso recognition in zzso transport and 2) the zzso half of the carrier also forms a part of the zzso recognition site which may be distorted in zzso zzso In contrast with zzso zzso there was very little zzso stimulation of zzso zzso transport and no zzso stimulation was observed in zzso transport with any of the zzso carriers, whereas in zzso coli zzso stimulates zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that there is no universal zzso recognition site for all the sugar zzso Instead different parts of the carrier seem to participate in zzso recognition for different sugar zzso
