zzso zzso factor 3 zzso a member of the zzso family, plays a wide-ranging role in gene zzso The human zzso gene generates a major zzso zzso zzso a functional, full-length protein and a zzso zzso zzso The latter is expected to be zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it was reported that zzso zzso was produced under stressful conditions and translated into a truncated zzso protein zzso To disclose unknown functions of zzso we established zzso cells zzso expressing zzso The zzso cells increased zzso and protein levels of positive regulators for zzso to S phase transition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and accelerated their zzso zzso is required for progression through the zzso phase, the mechanism by which involves zzso control of the zzso D1 zzso We also found that the zzso promoter activity was significantly increased in the zzso cells zzso expressing zzso compared with zzso control zzso The zzso cells increased zzso and zzso levels, which are important for the positive zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso may participate in the acceleration of cell growth through zzso zzso zzso progression under stressful zzso
