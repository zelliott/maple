We have developed an zzso that allows the functional efficiency of zzso zzso to be zzso in zzso We show here that the growth rate of the zzso fungus zzso zzso can be used as a sensitive reporter for the ability of zzso zzso to suppress the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso internal deletion zzso and zzso in which zzso zzso were exchanged between different zzso zzso were generated and transformed into the zzso zzso None of the zzso affect motor zzso in zzso but even minor zzso in the tail domain severely compromise zzso performance in zzso The analysis of these zzso has identified zzso in the stalk and tail likely to be involved in cargo binding and/or regulation of motor zzso The zzso of several zzso strongly suggest that zzso requires a folded zzso to achieve full functionality in zzso zzso critically depends on two flexible zzso in the stalk that allow an interaction of the tail with the zzso region near the zzso motor zzso The zzso has proven to be a valuable tool in the analysis of zzso function in zzso and should help to characterize the sites involved in zzso and zzso zzso
