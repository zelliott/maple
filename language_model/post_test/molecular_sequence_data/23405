zzso X syndrome is associated with a zzso zzso repeat expansion in the zzso region of the zzso gene and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cases of clinically normal males zzso have been identified with an expanded zzso zzso however, here, the zzso promoter is not zzso Using classical zzso zzso zzso studies, we analyzed if possible differences in the genetic background between zzso and cells from individuals with fragile X syndrome zzso zzso could have an influence on the zzso status of the zzso zzso We observed that zzso of the zzso zzso promoter can occur when FX cells are zzso (by cell zzso with cells from zzso as well as with cells from control zzso The observed zzso is specific and can happen without DNA zzso In contrast, zzso was not observed when cells from unrelated individuals with fragile X syndrome were zzso indicating that FX cells have lost the necessary zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso
