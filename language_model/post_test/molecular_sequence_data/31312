From gel sequencing experiments with zzso zzso it is shown that treatment of DNA with the powerful zzso zzso followed by heating in zzso causes selective strand zzso at the sites of zzso zzso The same specificity for zzso at zzso was observed with a zzso zzso at either the zzso or zzso and with a single and double stranded zzso On account of its speed and operational zzso modification with zzso is proposed as a zzso alternative to conventional chemical sequencing procedures for locating zzso bases in zzso
