Balancing zzso cell zzso and differentiation is essential for brain development and is regulated by the activity of zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, linking zzso changes to specific pathways that control cortical zzso remains a zzso Here we identify a genetic interaction between the zzso remodeler zzso and zzso a key regulator of zzso zzso zzso mice exhibit zzso zzso arising from increased zzso zzso increased zzso cell expansion, and delayed zzso We demonstrate that zzso binds to the zzso locus at zzso and that the zzso is rescued by reducing zzso zzso thus revealing that zzso and zzso function zzso to regulate brain zzso
