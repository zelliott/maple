The identification of zzso molecules will lead to a better understanding of the physiology of tick reproduction and zzso zzso A gene zzso a zzso protein zzso was obtained by random sequencing from the zzso zzso library of the tick zzso zzso The full-length zzso is 1157 zzso including an intact zzso zzso an expected protein with zzso zzso zzso Three distinct zzso were present in the deduced zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain, zzso and two zzso zzso zzso The sequence shows zzso with the zzso protein zzso which was thought to play some roles in the negative regulation of cellular zzso zzso showed that the gene was expressed throughout the developing stages and mainly in the zzso as well as in fat body, zzso zzso zzso and zzso This gene was expressed in zzso zzso protein with an expected zzso The mouse zzso against the zzso protein recognized a zzso native protein in both tick zzso and zzso The zzso proteins were found to have binding activity for both zzso A and bone zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso showed a decrease in tick zzso which is consistent with the effect of a zzso protein vaccine on the adult zzso These results showed that the tick zzso might be involved in tick zzso This is the first report of a member of zzso family proteins in zzso which include zzso zzso and zzso
