We mapped the zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso gene within a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by Southern zzso using the zzso virus zzso zzso gene as a zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso revealed seven open reading frames zzso showing gene organization similar to that of zzso The zzso gene contained in this region had an zzso of 179 zzso acids zzso a zzso with a putative molecular mass of zzso zzso An zzso region and a zzso termination zzso zzso were found upstream and at the end of the ORF, which is consistent with zzso early gene zzso The consensus sequence of the late promoter zzso also overlapped with the initiation zzso of the zzso The zzso acid sequence similarity between the zzso genes of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso which was lower than the similarities between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of avian zzso of zzso and zzso was supported by zzso zzso We then inserted the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and envelope of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso into the zzso gene of zzso to evaluate its suitability as an expression zzso The zzso viruses obtained were zzso although the foreign genes were expressed efficiently in the zzso cells infected with the zzso
