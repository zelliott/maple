The genetic diversity of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso is critical to lay the groundwork for the design of successful drugs or zzso In this study we aimed to characterize and define the molecular prevalence of zzso zzso F1 currently circulating in zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 36 samples were selected from zzso adult patients residing in zzso Paulo who had previously been diagnosed in two independent studies in our laboratory as being infected with zzso F1 based on pol zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was amplified from the zzso zzso DNA of all 36 blood samples by 5 fragments overlapping zzso followed by direct zzso zzso data were obtained from the 5 fragments of pure zzso F1 and zzso trees were constructed and compared with previously published zzso zzso F1 that exhibited mosaic structure with other zzso were omitted from any further analysis 

Our methods of zzso amplification and sequencing confirmed that only 5 sequences zzso from pol region as zzso F1 also holds true for the zzso as a whole and, thus, estimated the true prevalence at zzso The results also showed a single zzso cluster of the Brazilian zzso F1 along with zzso South American zzso in both zzso and the full-length zzso analysis with an overall zzso zzso divergence of zzso The zzso differences within the South American and Central African F1 zzso in the zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

All together, our findings showed a surprisingly low prevalence rate of zzso F1 in Brazil and suggest that these zzso originated in Central Africa and subsequently introduced to South zzso
