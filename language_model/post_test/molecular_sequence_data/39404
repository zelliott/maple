The present study set out to investigate whether observed relative zzso values of positively charged zzso (with zzso and zzso as representative zzso or zzso zzso (with zzso as the representative zzso were zzso zzso did such measured values vary depending on characteristics of the peptides within which such zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso number of positive zzso and/or properties of the mobile phase zzso zzso of varying zzso and zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso was applied to two series of four synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso net zzso the only difference between the two zzso series being the substitution of one zzso zzso zzso for a zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of varying zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and concentration zzso zzso zzso of these zzso series revealed that the relative zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the peptides increased with zzso zzso In addition the relative zzso of zzso decreased dramatically with an increase in the number of positive charges in the zzso this zzso decrease being of greater magnitude as the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results have significant implications in the prediction of zzso retention times for zzso zzso
