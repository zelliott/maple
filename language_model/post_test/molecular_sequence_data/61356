Little is known about how members of the indigenous zzso interact with their zzso hosts to establish mutually beneficial zzso We have used a zzso mouse model to show that zzso zzso a component of the zzso zzso of mice and humans, uses a zzso zzso as a molecular sensor of zzso zzso zzso coordinates expression of an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso with expression of another locus that regulates production of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies indicate that zzso does this by using zzso as an zzso at one locus and as a zzso at the other zzso zzso this zzso immediate nutritional requirements with production of a zzso energy source is consistent with its need to enter and persist within a competitive zzso
