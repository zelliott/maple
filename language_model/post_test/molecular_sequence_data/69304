The zzso complexes of two zzso bacteria, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were subjected to extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated by gel zzso and fast protein liquid zzso and analyzed by zzso analysis, zzso acid analysis, zzso analysis, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid conversion and zzso zzso studies on the zzso fraction of the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the earlier established collection of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso (where zzso is zzso zzso is zzso and zzso is zzso as the major zzso is zzso to zzso via zzso Using the same approach for the zzso fraction of the zzso complex of zzso zzso it was found that the reported collection of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the major zzso is zzso mainly to zzso and partly to zzso via zzso In both species, the zzso zzso zzso has probably an zzso The zzso chains appear as clusters located in highly zzso zzso regions of the zzso The results are consistent with the notion that the zzso sites are localized in zzso sequences which connect the various binding zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso
