We have found the gene zzso zzso the zzso of the major zzso zzso component in the zzso zzso zzso zzso stock zzso of zzso zzso Gene zzso which encodes a protein consisting of 116 zzso acids zzso had the same sequence as the zzso zzso in this species, with the exception of 10 zzso zzso reflecting 5 zzso zzso The coding region was interrupted at the position between zzso 62 and 63 by one short zzso which was comparable with the second zzso of plant zzso in position, phase and zzso zzso The maximum alignment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence with the other zzso sequences from zzso and lower zzso indicates that these zzso can be classified into two groups: one consists of zzso and zzso zzso of about 120 zzso and the other consists of zzso and other bacterial zzso of about 150 zzso having a significant zzso with higher zzso zzso These proteins share more than zzso zzso with one another in each zzso Our finding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the second zzso of plant zzso suggests that all of the zzso genes have a common origin, and that at least two groups had already existed in the zzso gene before zzso zzso
