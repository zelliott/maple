zzso acid zzso play critical roles in regulating the zzso of zzso fatty acids in all biological zzso As opposed to plants, zzso are so far characterized by the absence of zzso introducing additional double bonds at the zzso site of fatty zzso However, the function of the zzso fatty acid zzso 3 zzso gene remains zzso This gene is located within the zzso cluster and presents a high zzso sequence zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that rat zzso displays no common zzso zzso or zzso activity but is able to catalyze the unexpected zzso of zzso Although there is no standard for complete conclusive zzso structural characterization strongly suggests that the zzso zzso acid zzso produced by zzso from zzso is the zzso zzso In rat zzso zzso of zzso expression specifically reduces zzso zzso Evidence is presented that zzso is the first zzso fatty acid zzso functionally characterized in zzso
