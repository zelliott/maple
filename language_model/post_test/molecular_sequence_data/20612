zzso release of zzso hormone zzso is indispensable to maintain normal zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is associated with zzso electrical activity in the zzso zzso zzso multiple unit zzso zzso which is considered to reflect the rhythmic zzso in the activity of the zzso network that drives zzso zzso zzso However, the cellular source of this zzso rhythm in zzso activity is zzso zzso input from zzso zzso in the zzso nucleus zzso to zzso cell bodies in the zzso zzso area or their terminals in the median zzso could be the intrinsic source for driving the zzso pulse zzso To determine whether zzso zzso could be responsible for producing zzso zzso zzso we studied zzso measured plasma levels of zzso hormone zzso and recorded zzso in the zzso zzso where the majority of zzso zzso cell bodies are zzso zzso zzso of zzso were found to be accompanied by zzso zzso with regular intervals in the zzso where zzso zzso cell bodies were zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso a sustained increase in zzso zzso without influencing zzso suggesting that the zzso pulse zzso as reflected by zzso originated from outside of the network of zzso zzso and could zzso reflect the zzso activity of zzso zzso whose projections reach the median zzso where zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that the zzso zzso in the ARC may be the intrinsic source of the zzso pulse zzso
