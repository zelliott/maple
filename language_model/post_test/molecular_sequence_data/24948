A hallmark of zzso is their often limited spatial flexibility, allowing them to access a distinct set of zzso in zzso Viewing each individual or even the complete ensemble of zzso as potential binding zzso for zzso in zzso zzso it is pertinent to address the question on the characteristics of bound state zzso in zzso Also, it is possible that entering the zzso binding site zzso the low-energy zzso of a zzso zzso As a step to delineate the strategy of zzso selection for zzso a common zzso zzso point, we have performed a zzso study on two zzso zzso showing identical zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso zzso bound to bovine heart zzso and to zzso zzso in solution has been determined by transferred nuclear zzso effect zzso It is demonstrated that the zzso select the zzso zzso of zzso and various structural zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the ensemble of presented zzso No evidence for zzso distortion was zzso zzso of the zzso to the modeled binding sites zzso zzso in structural terms, for exclusive recognition of the zzso zzso despite the zzso design of the binding zzso
