The reduction of zzso zzso and zzso is essential for preventing zzso formation during zzso zzso This report addresses some performances of zzso zzso agents which bind to the adhesive site of zzso This was based on the recent finding that the sequence of the binding domain of the zzso membrane zzso to zzso was identified as zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso entitled zzso The addition of B12 and zzso analogue peptides zzso suppressed zzso zzso and zzso onto a zzso zzso The shorter the zzso acid zzso the less effective was zzso The zzso effect on zzso zzso in zzso was significant under continuous infusion of zzso These zzso effects were compared with those by a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the common active site to adhesive zzso
