Previous studies have shown a significant association between zzso zzso at the zzso gene locus and zzso responsiveness to zzso in zzso zzso zzso We searched for any gross insertions or deletions in the zzso gene in zzso and any associations between zzso zzso at the zzso II and zzso I zzso sites within the zzso gene and zzso and unresponsive zzso and normal zzso We also searched for possible point zzso in the promoter region of the zzso gene zzso to zzso start zzso in peripheral blood and tumor DNA from 59 patients with zzso and in peripheral blood DNA from 39 normal subjects by zzso chain reaction and single strand zzso zzso zzso zzso No large zzso in the zzso gene were observed, and no difference in zzso zzso at the zzso sites were seen between the two tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso or between the zzso group and normal zzso zzso analysis, however, did reveal zzso in the promoter region of the zzso gene zzso to zzso in both peripheral blood and tumor DNA from 8 of 59 zzso patients with zzso compared with only one of 39 normal controls zzso This study suggests that zzso in the zzso promoter region of the zzso gene in zzso may be important in the regulation of zzso zzso and may be involved in the underlying zzso of zzso zzso in at least some zzso
