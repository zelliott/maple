The three peptides pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Y zzso share a similar structure known as the zzso There are four known human zzso coupled receptors for the zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso each of them being able to bind at least two of the three zzso zzso All three peptides are found in the circulation acting as zzso Although zzso is only released from zzso zzso and zzso are primarily found in zzso cells in the gut, where they exert such effects as zzso of zzso zzso zzso gut zzso and pancreatic zzso However, when zzso is administered in an experimental setting to animals, cloned zzso or tissue zzso it can mimic the effects of zzso in essentially all studies, making it difficult to study the effects of zzso peptides and to delineate what zzso and zzso accounts for a particular zzso zzso studies with transgenic animals confirmed the well-established action of zzso on zzso zzso vascular systems, memory, mood, zzso zzso and zzso More recently, using transgenic techniques and novel zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been found to be a key player in the regulation of ethanol consumption and zzso zzso
