By zzso sequencing we have achieved the first, and complete, zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso protein consists of two zzso distinguishable zzso here termed zzso and zzso They share a mean sequence identity of zzso both contain a linear arrangement of eight zzso zzso functional units zzso zzso and in both zzso the zzso zzso possesses an extension of zzso 100 zzso zzso The zzso of zzso comprises zzso zzso subdivided into a zzso of 75 zzso a zzso of 791 zzso and an open reading frame for a signal zzso of 19 zzso acids plus a zzso of zzso zzso acids (Mr zzso 385 zzso The zzso of zzso comprises zzso zzso subdivided into a zzso of 47 zzso a zzso of zzso zzso and an open reading frame for a signal zzso of 16 zzso acids plus a zzso of zzso zzso acids (Mr zzso zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso which are highly zzso the zzso zzso sequence exhibits only four potential zzso sites, and within both zzso a peculiar zzso is present, surrounding the highly zzso zzso site zzso zzso analyses of zzso and zzso compared to the known zzso sequences of zzso and zzso reveal a statistically sound closer relationship between zzso and zzso zzso than to zzso zzso Assuming a molecular clock, the last common zzso of zzso and zzso lived zzso million zzso 50 million years ago, in conformity with fossil records from the late zzso
