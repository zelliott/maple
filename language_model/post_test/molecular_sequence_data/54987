zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a range of zzso hosts and are of major veterinary and economic zzso In this study, the genetic zzso of seven zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated using the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso I and the nuclear gene zzso zzso zzso A total of 156 specimens were obtained from zzso zzso goat and buffalo zzso raised on commercial properties from the southern and zzso regions of Brazil and identified to the species level by sequencing of the nuclear internal transcribed zzso zzso Thirty-four percent of the specimens were identified as zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso Cattle were the preferred hosts for zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was most frequent in the other three zzso zzso Analysis of genetic differentiation between zzso revealed that high rates of gene flow are operating among populations of both zzso species, including among those from different zzso host zzso zzso of zzso zzso were less zzso and presented a lower frequency of single zzso zzso associated with zzso resistance compared with zzso zzso In line with the low amount of genetic structure observed among zzso zzso of zzso 1 associated with zzso resistance were present at relatively high zzso of zzso in zzso of zzso zzso from farms that never used this class of zzso The results presented here are consistent with the hypothesis of multiple origins of zzso associated with zzso resistance, with the trade of animals among properties acting as the main factor promoting the spread of zzso zzso
