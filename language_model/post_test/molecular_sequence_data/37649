zzso are proteins found in high abundance in the zzso of zzso and adult zzso The expression patterns of the genes zzso the house fly, zzso zzso zzso were determined by Northern analyses using zzso as zzso A zzso zzso zzso to a fat zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in larvae until zzso zzso raised to the zzso zzso zzso bind zzso protein zzso by a zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso product of zzso zzso indicating that the A zzso likely represent the genes zzso zzso The zzso zzso and F3 zzso corresponding to genes zzso an adult, zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso isolated from zzso females which has a zzso expression profile similar to that observed for the zzso of zzso Furthermore, expression of the zzso zzso to the F zzso is correlated with the abundance of zzso protein during the zzso zzso The zzso zzso profiles indicate that the zzso and zzso genes are regulated in a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso expression of zzso contrasts with the expression patterns of zzso seen in other zzso The conceptual translation products of zzso zzso zzso showed identity with zzso serum protein 1 zzso zzso while the deduced products of the female zzso zzso showed the highest identity with zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that the zzso zzso and female zzso genes from zzso zzso belong to two distinct zzso zzso
