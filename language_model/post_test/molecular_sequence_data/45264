zzso zzso ticks play an important role in the transmission of a wide variety of pathogens between various zzso species, including zzso zzso transmitted by ticks include zzso zzso and zzso Although ticks may zzso both zzso and zzso zzso little is known about how the diversity of the zzso within ticks may influence the transmission of zzso To begin addressing this question, we examined the composition of bacterial communities present in zzso zzso collected from Westchester and Dutchess Counties, New York State, at different zzso and nutritional zzso zzso fingerprints of bacterial populations were generated by zzso temperature zzso gel zzso zzso separation of individual zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso gene fragments, followed by DNA sequence analysis for bacterial zzso The fingerprints of the zzso bands were grouped into five zzso The most abundant DNA sequence found in all the samples was zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were present as zzso We also determined the prevalence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and DNA sequence zzso zzso analyses indicated significant variations in the bacterial communities depending on tick zzso stage and degree of zzso We suggest that these two elements affect microbial diversity within the tick and may in turn influence pathogen transmission to humans and animals after tick zzso
