zzso zzso oxide zzso an environmental zzso found in cigarette smoke and diesel zzso has been shown to generate zzso in zzso in zzso zzso The objective of this study was to identify which zzso of zzso formed in the gaseous phase from zzso possess zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in 1 M zzso zzso pH zzso were exposed to preparations of nitrogen dioxide zzso zzso zzso zzso or an air zzso The gas zzso were formed in a zzso syringe and were then introduced into 1 zzso zzso The zzso solution was introduced immediately zzso Transformation of zzso coli strain zzso with the treated plasmids allowed analysis of zzso zzso and the types of zzso induced in the target zzso zzso The zzso frequency resulting from zzso exposure was not different from that of the zzso However, zzso produced a substantial number of zzso The zzso frequency and the types of zzso were found to depend on the length of time that the gases were allowed to zzso in the syringe prior to introduction into the 1 zzso zzso zzso frequency was zzso at approximately 2 zzso The most prevalent zzso were zzso transitions zzso followed by zzso transitions zzso similar to previous findings when pure NO was bubbled through zzso zzso These results suggest that it is zzso rather than zzso that is the most likely source of zzso potential from gaseous nitrogen zzso
