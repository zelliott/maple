The zzso zzso c zzso zzso I zzso gene is being used increasingly for evaluating zzso and zzso genetic diversity of zzso zzso However, very few studies focus on assessing genetic divergence of the zzso gene within individuals and how its presence might affect species identification and population structure zzso 

We evaluated the genetic variation of the zzso gene in five zzso species for a total of 147 clones derived from 21 individuals and 7 zzso We identified a total of 90 zzso with several individuals carrying more than one zzso zzso network and zzso tree analyses revealed that zzso diversity had no effect in species identification and only a minor effect on population zzso 

Our results suggest that the zzso gene is a suitable marker for resolving zzso and zzso relationships of zzso zzso
