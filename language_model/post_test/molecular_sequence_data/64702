The zzso binding site of zzso usually comprises associated heavy zzso and light zzso chain variable zzso but in camels and zzso the binding site frequently comprises the heavy chain variable domain only zzso to as zzso In contrast to reported human zzso zzso zzso zzso are well expressed from bacteria and zzso are readily zzso in soluble form and zzso zzso after zzso These desirable properties have been attributed to highly zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which normally interact with complementary zzso zzso Here, we describe the discovery and zzso of an isolated human zzso domain zzso with properties similar to those of zzso zzso zzso is highly soluble at zzso of zzso or zzso zzso essentially zzso and resistant to zzso upon zzso at zzso as high as 56 zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso the zzso framework zzso of the zzso interface are maintained and the only sequence changes from the corresponding human zzso segment zzso are located in the zzso zzso the zzso determining regions zzso The zzso structure of zzso reveals an unusual zzso the zzso of a framework zzso zzso is flipped into a cavity formed by zzso of zzso thereby increasing the zzso of the zzso zzso To evaluate the specific contribution of zzso to domain properties, zzso was introduced into a zzso domain with poor solution zzso This greatly enhanced the recovery of the zzso from a gel zzso zzso but had little effect on its ability to zzso zzso after heat zzso Our results confirm the importance of a zzso zzso interface for zzso of isolated zzso zzso and constitute a step towards the design of isolated human zzso zzso with practical properties for zzso
