zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to exert its effects on cell growth, zzso and migration by mechanisms involving zzso and interaction with its cell surface zzso zzso The functional properties of zzso and the significance of its various zzso for zzso activity were analyzed using human airway smooth muscle cells zzso The zzso zzso zzso inactive zzso with single zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso to zzso together with a deletion of growth zzso domain zzso the zzso domain of zzso zzso and its zzso domain zzso were expressed in zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were apparent at approximately 2 zzso with all the zzso zzso The zzso domain induced cell migration with an zzso of about 6 zzso whereas the zzso zzso and zzso were without zzso zzso zzso was dependent on an association with zzso and a zzso zzso site, determined using a zzso zzso zzso to prevent the zzso interaction, and a zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The binding of zzso zzso with zzso was due to interaction with a high affinity binding site on the zzso and a lower affinity binding site on an unidentified cell surface target, which was zzso exclusively through the zzso domain of zzso zzso binding of zzso to zzso involved an interaction with a single site whose characteristics were similar to those of the low affinity site of zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells specifically bound zzso and zzso via a single, similar type of binding zzso These cells migrated when zzso by zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso expressed two classes of sites that bound zzso however, only a single site was responsible for the binding of zzso Together, these findings indicate that zzso zzso is dependent on the binding of the zzso to the membrane surface of cells and the association of zzso with zzso
