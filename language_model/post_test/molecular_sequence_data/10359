zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso membrane protein zzso are zzso and are the members of the zzso family which is a zzso within the zzso zzso We cloned the zzso for zzso and zzso prepared zzso zzso and examined the zzso of the previously prepared zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso proteins by zzso These experiments revealed that zzso recognizes zzso about 1000 times as efficiently as zzso Moreover, the zzso and zzso peptides which have sequences zzso to the zzso zzso used for the preparation of zzso were 150 times less zzso to zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is a useful tool for specifically detecting zzso in zzso zzso
