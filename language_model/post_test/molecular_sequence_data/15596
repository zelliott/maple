Using published zzso detection of zzso zzso and strain identification using the zzso gene sequence was zzso However, of 21 zzso zzso strains zzso three could not be zzso so a new reverse primer was designed with a target in the zzso region of the zzso zzso This allowed all 21 zzso zzso zzso a further nine strains and also material from 11 zzso samples from zzso zzso birds, to produce a zzso product, suggesting that the method could also be suitable for clinical zzso The protocol was then tested on the type strains of zzso zzso and the other 22 zzso avian zzso species, with amplification of zzso zzso zzso Further testing demonstrated that this zzso was equally or more sensitive than other zzso tests used to detect zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso product based on percent similarity and evolutionary relationship appeared to be a useful tool for strain zzso
