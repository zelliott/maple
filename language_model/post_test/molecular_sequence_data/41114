zzso zzso is a naturally occurring zzso agent isolated from several strains of zzso zzso However, its potential clinical utility is compromised by its severe toxicity and poor water zzso For this reason, considerable efforts are under way to make new derivatives that have both good clinical efficacy and high water zzso On the other hand, zzso is often a step that improves the water zzso and/or biological activity in many natural products of zzso Here, we report the facile production of zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso Five zzso zzso containing zzso aromatic rings were chosen to validate the in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds were determined through the presence of a product zzso and were also verified using zzso zzso Further, the chemical structures of new zzso compounds 6 and 7 were zzso using zzso zzso These zzso compounds showed a dramatic improvement in water zzso compared with that of the original zzso zzso zzso
