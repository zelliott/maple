The present report studies a large zzso zzso with generalized zzso hormone resistance that has varying degrees of zzso dysfunction, hyperactivity, poor attention span, decreased zzso and/or abnormalities in spatial zzso In this zzso there has been found tight linkage of the syndrome with the zzso A beta zzso The present study was performed to identify the presence of a possible gene zzso as a cause for this zzso DNA from peripheral zzso was isolated from 15 unaffected and 8 affected individuals from the zzso zzso encompassing zzso 9 zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso were zzso and used in zzso reactions to amplify these zzso zzso sequencing revealed a consistent substitution in each affected subject, but in none of the unaffected individuals, of a C to T change in one zzso from zzso zzso resulting in an zzso to zzso change in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso human beta 1 receptors were prepared and their translated proteins were analyzed for zzso zzso The WR zzso zzso from affected patients had reduced zzso binding zzso with values approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to about 5 zzso zzso zzso in zzso In zzso we zzso zzso identified a consistent and zzso zzso of a C to T change in zzso zzso in each of the affected but in none of the unaffected individuals of a large well characterized zzso with generalized zzso hormone zzso and zzso noted that the WR zzso causes an approximate 50% decrease in the zzso binding zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
