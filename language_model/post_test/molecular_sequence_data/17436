The zzso zzso zzso zzso has a high capacity to metabolize zzso aromatic zzso zzso which are among the most hazardous environmental pollutants with significant biological zzso In the present study, two novel zzso zzso zzso genes were identified in this zzso One was named zzso the first member of a new family of zzso and the other zzso is the first member of a new zzso zzso Both of these genes are zzso expressed in the worms and zzso by zzso The expression of zzso zzso was observed to be more sensitive to zzso exposure than zzso which indicated that zzso should play a more important role than zzso in zzso metabolism in this zzso Considering the importance of zzso zzso zzso in taking up zzso and other organic pollutants from contaminated marine sediments with the potential for subsequent zzso transfer, our results are important for understanding the molecular basis of zzso and zzso in this zzso and also have evolutionary significance for understanding the diversity and history of the zzso zzso
