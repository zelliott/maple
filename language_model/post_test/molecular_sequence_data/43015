We have developed a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso technique which detects a sequence on the human Y zzso and an zzso sequence in one zzso The method is very reliable for the sex determination, as the detection of the zzso signal ensures the presence of DNA in the zzso even in the absence of the zzso zzso
