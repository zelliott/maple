zzso zzso zzso zzso is a typical DNA virus that is associated with a number of zzso diseases including zzso zzso The zzso open reading frame zzso 4 encodes a complement regulatory protein zzso complement control zzso zzso that binds complement components and zzso the zzso zzso of cells infected by the virus, thus providing a strategy for evasion of the host complement zzso Based on primary sequence analysis and comparison with other functionally and structurally similar zzso zzso zzso were designed to amplify by zzso chain reaction zzso three regions of the predicted zzso 4 from human zzso zzso zzso DNA isolated from a primary zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso products were inserted by zzso into the expression zzso zzso to generate three zzso plasmids for zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso to produce separately the four zzso sushi zzso zzso zzso zzso protein lacking the putative zzso domain zzso zzso and the full-length protein zzso zzso zzso of the viral proteins was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses using a rabbit zzso zzso directed against a selected zzso region that is common to all three zzso zzso zzso directly from expression media could inhibit zzso zzso of zzso sheep zzso by approximately zzso in a zzso zzso This result confirms previous reports that zzso zzso is twice as efficient in zzso the classic zzso zzso of zzso than is the zzso virus complement control zzso which also contains four sushi zzso
