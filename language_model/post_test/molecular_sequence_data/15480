A marine bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from marine algae collected from the South Sea, Republic of zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso belonged to the family zzso and was closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The major fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso and summed feature 3 zzso zzso : zzso zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso Several zzso characteristics served to differentiate the isolate from recognized members of the zzso zzso Data from this zzso study clearly demonstrated that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso In addition, an zzso description of the zzso zzso is zzso
