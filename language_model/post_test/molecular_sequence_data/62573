zzso zzso zzso is involved in the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso We isolated and characterized zzso a gene zzso zzso zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso encodes a putative protein of 267 zzso acids having a molecular weight of zzso zzso and zzso sequence identity to other zzso zzso zzso zzso disruption of the zzso gene showed that it is essential for zzso zzso in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso transcripts are zzso expressed during normal growth but are specifically enhanced by zzso zzso radiation in a zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso expression is zzso enhanced by zzso radiation in zzso zzso
