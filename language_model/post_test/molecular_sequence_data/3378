zzso in which a zzso switches between translation of an zzso and a zzso produces a zzso zzso of an zzso truncated zzso and a zzso zzso zzso by zzso One of the zzso binding zzso a zzso protein S1, has not been found in a group of zzso zzso In this study, the zzso reaction with zzso from zzso zzso belonging to this group was zzso When a truncated gene lacking a termination zzso was expressed in zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso derived from zzso was identified in the zzso of the zzso zzso An identical zzso was also found at the zzso of the products from a truncated zzso when it was zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was functional, although much less zzso in the in zzso zzso zzso synthesis system of zzso zzso A comparison of two bacterial zzso suggests that the rule for determining the zzso point on zzso may be the same in zzso and zzso zzso
