The zzso zzso zzso zzso codes for only 13 zzso which are essential components in the process of zzso zzso of zzso into zzso zzso of these proteins relies on a proper zzso translation zzso While 22 zzso and 2 zzso are also coded by the zzso zzso all other factors including the set of zzso zzso zzso are zzso in the nucleus and zzso Investigation of zzso zzso zzso systems (and zzso translation in zzso gains more and more interest not only in regard of evolutionary considerations but also with respect to the growing number of diseases linked to zzso in the genes of either zzso zzso or other zzso Here we report on zzso approaches for zzso functional, and structural characterization of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for preparation of native and in zzso transcribed zzso are accompanied by recommendations for specific handling of zzso zzso to structural instability and chemical zzso zzso preparation of zzso amounts of highly soluble zzso zzso is a prerequisite for structural investigations that requires particular zzso zzso examples leading to zzso of four zzso and high-resolution structures are recalled and limitations zzso Finally, the need for and the state-of-the-art in setting up an in zzso zzso translation system are zzso zzso characterization of a subset of zzso zzso systems has already revealed a number of unprecedented peculiarities of interest for the study of evolution and forensic zzso Further efforts in this field will certainly be rewarded by many exciting zzso
