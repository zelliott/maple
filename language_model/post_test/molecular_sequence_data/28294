zzso proteins are responsible for the active zzso of organic zzso in zzso zzso zzso provide the driving force for zzso of most zzso into zzso and for a few zzso in some zzso We report here the cloning and sequencing of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso and compare its structure with other cloned zzso At the DNA level and the predicted zzso acid and secondary structure levels, close zzso is evident between the human and rabbit zzso zzso zzso and a significant zzso is found between these and the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso No zzso is zzso with other known zzso We zzso from these results that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso share a common ancestral zzso
