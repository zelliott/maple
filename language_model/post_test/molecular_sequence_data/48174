zzso of the zzso stress genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso Whereas iron repression in zzso bacteria is usually carried out by the zzso zzso previous work showed that this is not the case in zzso zzso as these genes are still iron zzso in a zzso zzso fur zzso An open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso stress zzso was identified in the zzso sequence of zzso zzso The zzso gene was disrupted by a zzso resistance cassette in zzso zzso zzso and fur zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso expression of both zzso and zzso at a much higher level than that obtained by iron zzso suggesting that expression of these genes is controlled by other regulatory factors in addition to the iron zzso Other zzso proteins were not affected by the zzso zzso The fur zzso double zzso showed zzso expression of known zzso zzso Further zzso analysis of the zzso zzso fur zzso and the fur zzso double zzso showed that the zzso zzso made zzso zzso zzso to zzso stress caused by hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso a finding consistent with the high levels of zzso and zzso zzso and showed that these zzso were zzso zzso analysis of zzso expression showed that both the zzso zzso and the fur zzso had profound effects on zzso activity, suggesting additional zzso regulation of zzso and, by zzso zzso The zzso protein is a functional but zzso substitution for the zzso zzso which regulates zzso stress genes in other zzso zzso zzso of zzso stress genes by a zzso zzso has recently been described for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso where zzso regulation of zzso stress genes has been described and zzso
