Two zzso zzso one active against zzso as well as zzso and the other more markedly against zzso were isolated from human zzso by zzso zzso in the presence of zzso M zzso followed by a series of column zzso The zzso zzso appeared homogeneous as judged by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and were tentatively designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso The content of zzso zzso in zzso was much higher than that of zzso zzso The molecular mass of zzso zzso was determined to be 18,000 and 16,000 zzso and that of zzso zzso zzso and 31,000 zzso by zzso and gel zzso zzso The zzso properties and structural features of zzso zzso including the zzso acid composition and zzso zzso acid sequence indicated that its protein zzso is strictly related to a zzso zzso zzso from human urine zzso et zzso 1988, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In particular, the zzso zzso acid sequence up to the 32nd zzso was identical with that of urine zzso zzso reported recently zzso et zzso 1988, zzso 27, zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was zzso indistinguishable from urine zzso zzso but clearly differed from urine zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso similar to urine zzso zzso
