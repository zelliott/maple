zzso and zzso of genes involved in cellular growth control occur frequently in human zzso Here, we report characterization of the full length zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA, zzso zzso zzso a region frequently amplified in zzso and brain zzso This zzso consists of zzso base pairs zzso zzso an open reading frame zzso of 283 zzso zzso The zzso predicts a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a molecular weight of zzso Database searches revealed highly significant similarity between zzso and eight proteins predicted from zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso defines a novel zzso zzso gene zzso Northern and database analyses revealed zzso transcripts in numerous human zzso demonstrating its ubiquitous zzso We also observed zzso of zzso in three cancer cell lines with amplification of this zzso Furthermore, we detected zzso amplification in zzso primary zzso with known amplification of the closely linked marker zzso These results demonstrate that the highly zzso zzso gene is frequently included in the zzso zzso and may contribute to the development of a subset of zzso
