We studied the zzso action of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso generation in whole zzso Human plasma was activated either with zzso or factor zzso zzso delayed zzso generation, but it was unable to prevent the explosive appearance of zzso The zzso zzso of the lag phase of the intrinsic and zzso zzso generation curve was not the result of zzso of zzso activity by zzso but the result of a delayed formation of the zzso converting complex zzso In case of zzso zzso zzso did not affect factor zzso generation, but prolonged the lag phase of the factor Va generation curve, causing its appearance when factor zzso generation was already in the zzso zzso Because of its zzso action on the zzso zzso of factor VIII, zzso prolonged the lag phase of the factor X converting complex that consists of factor zzso and factor zzso Our observations with zzso are in keeping with the notion that zzso of the zzso amplification reactions in blood zzso is a very efficient way to delay or inhibit completely zzso zzso However, although zzso zzso zzso amounts of zzso the interaction between in zzso generated zzso and zzso appears not to be fast enough to prevent trace amounts of zzso to activate factors VIII and zzso zzso an explosive zzso generation is observed even when free zzso is zzso
