The zzso parameters s and zzso are calculated for the zzso transition of zzso The theoretical approach involves evaluating gas phase zzso energies for both zzso and zzso states using the zzso potential function and accounting for zzso effects with various zzso zzso zzso zzso free energies are then incorporated into a zzso developed by Go et zzso for the calculation of s and zzso zzso values for both s and zzso as well as the zzso change associated with zzso formation are in good agreement with experimental data when the zzso zzso zzso zzso method is used to treat zzso zzso The driving force for the zzso transition is analyzed in terms of individual free energy zzso zzso bond formation is found to contribute little to zzso stability because the internal hydrogen bonding energy is largely canceled by the large free energy cost associated with removing polar groups from zzso The zzso cost associated with fixing backbone zzso angles in the zzso zzso is found to be approximately 7 zzso (about 2 zzso at room zzso The major driving force favoring zzso formation can be associated with interactions including enhanced van der zzso interactions in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso These contribute about 2 zzso favoring the zzso zzso The differences in zzso zzso between zzso and zzso are attributed primarily to zzso and packing interactions involving the C beta with a smaller contribution arising from increased zzso freedom for zzso in the zzso zzso The description of zzso formation presented here is consistent with previous conclusions regarding zzso structure formation which suggest that zzso and zzso interactions provide stability while hydrogen bond formation constitutes a structural constraint imposed by the high free energy cost associated with burying unsatisfied hydrogen bonding zzso zzso formation may thus be viewed as a form of zzso collapse constrained by the requirement that polar groups be either exposed to zzso or form hydrogen zzso More generally it appears from this study that for a folding model to be a zzso it must properly account for the chemical nature of the zzso chain, particularly the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
