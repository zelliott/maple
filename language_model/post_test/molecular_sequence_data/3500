The most alkaline form of zzso zzso was zzso from ripe carrot roots and used for structural zzso zzso of an zzso blocking group and of the primary structure allowed comparisons with other forms, and facilitated zzso determination of the three-dimensional zzso The mature zzso has 319 zzso and the zzso blocking group was shown to be a zzso zzso derived from a zzso zzso Few other zzso have been isolated and assigned to exact mature forms, and together with the present zzso only two have been analyzed in three-dimensional zzso However, comparison of 39 forms, mainly from zzso data, reveals clear relationships and identifies zzso of this zzso type, zzso in structure but centering around two functionally important and zzso zzso zzso at positions 136 and 157 in the carrot zzso
