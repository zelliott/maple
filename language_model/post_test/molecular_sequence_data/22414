zzso zzso is a desirable trait for zzso of many kinds of zzso and exotic zzso zzso engineered floral zzso can be imparted by expression of a zzso under the control of a predominantly zzso zzso However, many otherwise desirable floral promoters impart substantial zzso zzso which can impair plant health or make it impossible to zzso transgenic zzso We are therefore developing a floral zzso system that is capable of attenuating zzso background zzso zzso As a first step towards this goal, we compared the zzso expression properties of the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso of the floral zzso gene zzso zzso which could be used to impart male and female flower sterility, to that of three candidate zzso zzso the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso promoter, the zzso zzso zzso promoter fused to the zzso omega element and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The promoters were evaluated via zzso gene zzso in a transgenic zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso In leaves, the zzso promoter conveyed the highest activity and had a mean expression level zzso higher than zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso promoter fused to the omega element and the zzso zzso zzso promoter alone directed mean expression levels that were zzso and zzso that of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso leaves, stems and roots was observed only for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in roots for the zzso promoter, whereas the zzso promoter directed highest expression in zzso The zzso promoter appears best suited to counteract zzso expression of a zzso driven by the zzso promoter where zzso zzso expression is zzso
