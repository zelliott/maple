Human T cell leukemia virus type I zzso causes adult T cell leukemia zzso in zzso of carriers after a long zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso Tax, zzso proliferation and zzso zzso resulting in zzso proliferation of infected zzso However, tax gene expression in ATL cells is disrupted by several mechanisms, including genetic changes in the tax gene and DNA zzso of the zzso long terminal repeat zzso Because Tax is the major target of zzso zzso in zzso loss of Tax expression should enable ATL cells to escape the host immune zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is frequently zzso or deleted in ATL cells, whereas the 3' zzso remains zzso and intact, suggesting the involvement of the 3' zzso in zzso Here we show that a gene zzso by the minus strand of the zzso zzso zzso zzso basic zzso zzso factor zzso is transcribed from zzso in all ATL zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso by short interfering zzso zzso proliferation of ATL zzso In addition, zzso gene expression promotes proliferation of a human T cell zzso zzso of T cell lines zzso with zzso zzso genes showed that zzso promotes T cell proliferation in its zzso form, whereas zzso protein suppresses zzso viral zzso through the zzso zzso Thus, the single zzso gene has zzso functions in two different molecular zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso likely plays an important role in zzso by zzso
