zzso proteins act at various stages of gene expression to regulate and fine-tune patterns of zzso zzso One protein in this class is zzso zzso a nuclear protein that has been previously shown to inhibit the zzso of zzso transcripts by an unknown zzso Here, we have identified several additional zzso that are zzso by zzso These zzso targets include cryptic zzso transcripts from the zzso regulated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso repeated zzso elements within an zzso zzso and zzso transcripts induced by zzso promoter zzso inserted at zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso to investigate the mechanism of zzso function and obtained evidence that these transcripts are zzso by the nuclear zzso and that zzso promotes this zzso Furthermore, we showed that the zzso binding zzso of zzso are important for this effect and mapped the sequences involved to a zzso region of an zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso binds to certain nascent transcripts and stimulates their degradation by the nuclear zzso
