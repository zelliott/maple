zzso mature zzso viral particles from zzso have a zzso activity that uses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso We have previously demonstrated that empty particles derived from mature zzso viral particles have zzso activity capable of zzso minus strand zzso zzso zzso on an added plus strand zzso template to form zzso We report here that empty particles also have zzso activity that uses added viral zzso as zzso The newly zzso zzso was the plus zzso and some of these transcripts were converted to the zzso form by the zzso activity associated with the empty zzso This zzso activity, however, required a much higher concentration of zzso zzso than that used previously for the zzso zzso The mode of zzso was zzso The zzso transcribed zzso from zzso zzso or X (a deletion zzso of zzso zzso but not from other zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or animal zzso zzso indicating the same template specificity as that expected for the in zzso zzso This zzso system, and the zzso zzso system, will allow us to study in zzso all the zzso reactions essential for the viral replication zzso
