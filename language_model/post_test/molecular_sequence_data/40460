zzso is a neglected disease transmitted in many tropical and zzso countries, with few studies devoted to its zzso In this work, the activities of two zzso compound classes were modeled using Dragon zzso and multiple linear zzso and support zzso machines zzso as linear and zzso zzso methods, zzso Both models were highly zzso with zzso zzso validation and external validation zzso of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for the zzso model, improving significantly to zzso zzso and zzso when using zzso zzso zzso novel compounds were proposed using the zzso models built by combining the zzso of the main active compounds of both zzso The most promising structures were zzso into the active site of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating the high affinity of some new structures when compared to existing zzso zzso
