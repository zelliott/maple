The human zzso zzso zzso zzso a liver zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library by zzso to the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Owens, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The two clones have zzso sequence identities in the coding region of zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid protein with an zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso There are three potential zzso zzso sites at zzso 67, 68, and zzso In order to establish zzso zzso the clone was inserted into the zzso zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The presence of a zzso with Mr zzso to 52,000 in zzso cells cultured in the presence of zzso was shown by zzso products with goat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Owens, zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso and analysis by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso The zzso is a zzso as indicated by a shift in Mr zzso to zzso when expressed in the presence of zzso Sixty potential zzso were tested using cells zzso with zzso The order of relative zzso activity was as zzso zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso greater than 6 zzso greater than 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso There were only trace amounts of zzso of zzso and zzso and, in contrast to other cloned zzso no zzso of either the primary zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso or any of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso plot of the effect of zzso concentration on the zzso of zzso shows an apparent zzso of 13 zzso The unique specificity of this zzso for zzso zzso and zzso suggests it may play an important role in regulating the level and activity of these potent and active zzso zzso
