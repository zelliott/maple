Hunter disease or zzso type II zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso disorder caused by the deficit of the zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our aim was to search for molecular defects in the promoter region of the zzso gene in patients with previous zzso diagnosis of zzso II and after we zzso the whole zzso coding region and the zzso boundaries without detecting any zzso zzso zzso of the promoter region of four patients detected in two of them a 178 zzso deletion and in the other two a single zzso substitution zzso zzso upstream of the coding zzso The latter had never been described before in zzso II patients and it turned out to be a zzso Our experience suggests that zzso II patients with no zzso detected in the zzso coding region should be screened in the promoter region of the zzso zzso will hopefully help to clarify the relationship between zzso and zzso and will be useful for the correct molecular diagnosis of Hunter patients and the identification of female carriers, the latter particularly important for genetic zzso
