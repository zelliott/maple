We report the isolation of a full length coding zzso zzso from human fetal zzso The zzso transcript has an open reading frame of zzso zzso and encodes a putative protein of zzso zzso zzso The human zzso gene comprises 24 zzso and lies within a 559 zzso zzso segment on zzso zzso which has zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso segment of human zzso zzso which contains zzso The zzso transcript is expressed in several human fetal and adult zzso and has at least two zzso zzso generated by the alternative zzso of zzso 18 and zzso 22 which maintain the open reading zzso zzso of zzso zzso is restricted to brain and introduces an additional 47 zzso acids into the predicted zzso The predicted zzso protein has a similar structural organization to the other human zzso zzso zzso zzso between these proteins is confined to three zzso regions of their zzso acid sequences which we have designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso contain highly zzso zzso which have been shown to be important for the normal function of zzso and zzso and zzso contains a highly zzso 22 zzso acid motif specific to zzso zzso zzso lies within the critical linkage zzso for several human zzso disorders, including zzso mental zzso The function of zzso zzso zzso remains to be zzso
