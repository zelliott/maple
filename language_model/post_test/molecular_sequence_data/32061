The zzso for goose zzso gamma zzso was cloned from zzso goose peripheral blood zzso cells zzso by zzso This zzso encodes a zzso acid signal zzso and a zzso acid mature zzso which shares a high zzso with duck zzso zzso mature goose zzso gamma zzso generated from both zzso and zzso expression systems effectively inhibited the replication of goose zzso and zzso zzso zzso virus in zzso These zzso activities were zzso by rabbit zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso goose zzso zzso to produce zzso oxide zzso in zzso demonstrating its zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso the availability of zzso zzso and its specific zzso provides valuable tools for studying T cell immunity in zzso
