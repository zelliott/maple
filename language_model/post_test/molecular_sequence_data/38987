zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors plays a critical role in regulating zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso during adaptation to zzso The objective of this study was to isolate the promoter regulatory region of the zzso zzso gene to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso of a rat zzso library using zzso directed to the coding region and to the zzso of the rat zzso zzso resulted in the isolation of several clones containing the zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso of the reported zzso zzso which contains a putative promoter regulatory zzso The 3' end of the clone contained zzso base pairs corresponding to the recognized zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso of unknown sequence located at the end of the sixth zzso domain, probably corresponding to an zzso characteristic of these family of zzso An additional 161 zzso zzso was found in the zzso similar to that described in the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protection analysis mapped two major putative zzso start points at zzso and zzso zzso from the starting zzso Analysis of the putative promoter region showed no indication of a zzso zzso box, but the presence of a zzso box, a zzso box, several zzso and zzso sites and a cluster of zzso sites upstream of the zzso zzso A zzso construct containing a zzso of putative promoter, and part of the zzso including the first zzso showed promoter activity when zzso into zzso zzso and zzso cell lines but not in zzso zzso A similar construct without the zzso and zzso zzso sequence has no promoter activity in the same cell zzso In zzso the zzso zzso gene contains at least 3 zzso and 2 zzso The zzso sequence contains several potential sites for zzso regulation, and induced zzso activity only in zzso containing zzso 1, suggesting that the latter is important for zzso gene zzso The data provide bases for future analysis of the regulatory elements controlling zzso zzso zzso
