A zzso zzso and zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from zzso seawater from the west coast of Korea and was investigated by means of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at zzso degrees C, at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso sea zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The major zzso zzso was zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso revealed that it was a member of the zzso zzso sharing zzso sequence similarity with the type strains of zzso species and being most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences confirmed that strain zzso formed a deep lineage related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso was distinguishable from recognized zzso species on the basis of differential zzso characteristics and DNA zzso zzso Based on these results, it is proposed that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is also zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
