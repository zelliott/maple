The zzso zzso zzso protein is regulated by several mechanisms including zzso zzso One of the protein zzso which has an established role in regulating zzso function is the protein zzso zzso The regulation by zzso occurs both through interaction of zzso with zzso itself (the regulatory beta zzso and zzso at the penultimate zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso event controls several independent functions of zzso including zzso DNA zzso strand zzso zzso repression and the zzso function of zzso However, zzso is a zzso zzso and therefore the mechanism by which the zzso of zzso at zzso zzso is itself zzso or indeed the question as to whether zzso of this site is regulated at all, remains zzso In this paper we provide evidence that zzso zzso is highly resistant to zzso in cultured cells, even though this site can be zzso in zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso These data suggest that, once zzso at the zzso site, a zzso zzso remains in this modified form throughout its zzso To address the issue of whether the level of zzso zzso zzso may be regulated through controlling the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso we examined the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso by zzso zzso Both proteins were present in the zzso and enriched in the nucleus, with minor variations in the intensity of zzso location over the course of the cell zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso or DNA zzso drugs had no effect on either the zzso or levels of zzso even although significant nuclear zzso zzso was zzso A striking observation arising from these studies was the intense zzso of zzso with the zzso suggesting a potentially important role for this zzso in zzso formation and/or zzso zzso
