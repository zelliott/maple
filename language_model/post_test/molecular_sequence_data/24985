The characterization of zzso zzso by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso was zzso In addition to the use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso strong zzso zzso and charge reversal to increase the zzso resolving power, zzso F zzso zzso combined with a basic zzso and zzso combined with an zzso zzso were used to analyze the zzso zzso in zzso B zzso zzso and in a novel zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The structures of zzso zzso sites, and zzso zzso were determined zzso and the differential zzso of Met zzso in zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso was also characterized successfully by zzso The results showed that the zzso attached to zzso B has a structure of zzso approximately 9, and that attached to zzso has a structure of zzso approximately zzso The zzso zzso in these zzso are quite different, with the zzso type zzso in zzso B, and the zzso type, in zzso This method may be useful not only for the characterization of zzso sites and zzso structures, but also for the determination of the relative abundance of individual zzso
