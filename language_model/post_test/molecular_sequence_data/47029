The high prevalence of patients with zzso zzso zzso with zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso in their zzso has been zzso However, the zzso role of these zzso in the development of zzso is zzso We previously reported an experimental model of zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso rabbits for 1 year with synthetic peptides corresponding to the sequence of the second zzso loop of either zzso or zzso zzso Because approximately half the zzso of patients with zzso that recognize one of the two zzso sequences also recognize the second zzso a model was created in rabbits simultaneously zzso with the synthetic peptides corresponding to the second zzso loop of the zzso and zzso zzso 

All rabbits zzso zzso 8) zzso with both peptides had a high zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso in their zzso whereas none of the zzso from control rabbits injected with saline zzso zzso 9) was zzso No significant zzso with peptides other than those used for zzso was zzso The weight of the hearts of zzso rabbits increased zzso The hearts of zzso rabbits showed marked concentric left zzso zzso with mild inflammatory cell zzso In these zzso mild or moderate zzso zzso was also zzso In electron zzso zzso rabbits showed focal zzso zzso loss of zzso and a marked increase in the number of zzso and deposition of dense zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso one of the control rabbits showed scant zzso cell zzso However, in this control zzso no significant zzso was found by electron zzso 

Our results showed the coexistence of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso has zzso importance, shown by their ability to induce cardiac zzso in zzso
