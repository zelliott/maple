We zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of adult zzso zzso monitoring its activity with zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso to zzso zzso with zzso recovery rate through a three-step zzso The zzso zzso zzso has a zzso molecular weight of 28 zzso with an zzso point at zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso did not zzso with zzso from other zzso zzso library was constructed in zzso II zzso and screened with zzso The corresponding gene containing a single open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso 211 zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence exhibited a higher zzso with zzso domain near zzso of class zzso zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso zzso or with class zzso zzso themselves zzso The sequence contained both zzso and zzso that are highly zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The apparent zzso value of a zzso zzso was zzso zzso Both native and zzso zzso showed the highest activity against zzso relatively weak activity against zzso acid and zzso zzso and no activity against zzso The activities were inhibited by zzso zzso blue, and zzso but not by zzso These findings indicate that adult zzso zzso has a class zzso zzso
