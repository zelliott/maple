zzso zzso zzso enhance nuclear spin relaxation in a zzso fashion and can be used as a structural probe of zzso zzso can also serve as a functionally important zzso in zzso Here we investigate the structural basis of zzso zzso of the influenza zzso zzso channel through zzso zzso relaxation enhancement zzso zzso zzso relaxation rates of the central zzso of the zzso zzso domain of zzso are significantly enhanced by zzso and pronounced spectral broadening is observed for the zzso zzso zzso These data yielded quantitative distances of zzso spins to the zzso center and identified the zzso binding site to be zzso of zzso This binding site is surrounded by four zzso rings from the top and four zzso rings of zzso from the bottom, thus explaining the high affinity of zzso zzso Bound at this location, zzso can inhibit zzso currents by zzso zzso zzso exchange, preventing zzso zzso zzso and interfering with zzso zzso zzso The zzso binding site is distinct from the binding site of the zzso drug zzso which is about 10 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso induce distinct zzso changes at several key zzso suggesting the possibility of designing new drugs that target the zzso site to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso binding site, we also examined the weaker and zzso binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso and the extent of the resulting zzso to zzso protein zzso This study demonstrates the feasibility of zzso studies of zzso membrane zzso where the zzso serves as both a functional zzso and a distance zzso
