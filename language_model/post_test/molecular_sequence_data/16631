zzso interference zzso is the process of gene zzso in which the recognition of zzso zzso ultimately leads to zzso suppression of gene zzso zzso induced by small interfering zzso zzso or short hairpin zzso zzso is an important research approach for the analysis of gene function in zzso zzso Here we established a zzso expression zzso zzso in which the sense and zzso sequences targeting wild type human zzso were linked together with a zzso zzso Further, we found that zzso expressed from a zzso zzso III zzso based on the human zzso zzso promoter could effectively inhibit gene expression in a zzso zzso zzso zzso dramatically reduced the expression of wild type human zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso We also found that the zzso zzso could circumvent the difficulty in zzso for the delivery of zzso or zzso and the generation of long-term gene zzso The use of zzso expression zzso for zzso might provide a rapid and versatile method for assessing gene function in zzso cells with possible applications in the treatment of zzso
