To increase the zzso of zzso seven kinds of zzso plasmids were constructed with an expression zzso of barley zzso by zzso The remaining activity versus temperature zzso were used to determine the temperatures zzso at which 50% of the initial activity was lost during a zzso heating zzso These zzso increased the zzso values by amounts ranging from zzso to zzso degrees zzso To express the zzso zzso in zzso coli, zzso zzso was zzso zzso coli harboring zzso zzso produced zzso zzso zzso The zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso was higher than that of not only the original zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso by zzso degrees C but also soybean zzso zzso degrees zzso by zzso degrees zzso The zzso zzso acid replacements were found to have simple additive effects on the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso was found to be stable at zzso up to zzso while the original zzso zzso was unstable at zzso above zzso The data obtained from zzso studies suggested that the zzso zzso acquired enhanced zzso but its function as a zzso remained zzso
