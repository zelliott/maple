Despite the effectiveness of currently available human zzso virus type 1 zzso therapies, a continuing need exists for new drugs to treat zzso zzso We investigated the mechanism by which zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions at a late stage of the virus life cycle but does not inhibit the zzso zzso in zzso or interfere with virus assembly or zzso zzso specifically delays the zzso of zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso resulting in delayed formation of the mature viral core and reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso was resistant to zzso however, a zzso zzso carrying zzso sequences from zzso was inhibited by the drug, indicating that zzso to zzso maps to the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso A single point zzso at the zzso zzso site of zzso zzso strong resistance to zzso confirming the target of the zzso zzso strains that are resistant to a variety of zzso zzso were sensitive to zzso These findings indicate that zzso specifically protects the zzso zzso site from processing by the viral zzso during zzso zzso thereby revealing a novel mechanism for zzso zzso of zzso zzso
