The zzso chains of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced by zzso zzso are assembled using zzso acid zzso as a starter zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso an zzso which zzso the final step of zzso zzso in the recently discovered zzso pathway, has been used to identify two separate zzso zzso gene clusters in zzso zzso In one of these zzso analysis of approximately 20 zzso of zzso sequence has revealed both a cluster of six genes presumed to play a role in the zzso zzso and the beginning of a zzso zzso zzso gene containing an zzso zzso zzso zzso This domain is likely responsible for loading zzso onto the zzso This gene cluster also contains zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is essential for the zzso of the zzso acid zzso of zzso from zzso acid, and a zzso zzso This gene cluster thus seems to control the zzso of zzso which contains a side chain of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso In the putative zzso zzso gene cluster approximately 13 zzso of zzso sequence has revealed a second set of the genes required for zzso zzso In addition the end of a zzso zzso and a gene zzso involved in termination of the chain extension process, formation of an zzso zzso bond between the zzso nitrogen and the zzso group of the fully extended zzso chain, have been zzso Thus, despite zzso in zzso the zzso and zzso zzso gene clusters show clear organizational differences and carry separate sets of genes for zzso zzso
