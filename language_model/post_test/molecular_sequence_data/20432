zzso an abundant component in zzso fluid, is zzso by the potential tumor zzso gene zzso Some New World monkeys carry several copies of this zzso in contrast to most zzso including humans, which have one zzso Here we have investigated the background for the species difference by analyzing the zzso organization and expression of zzso in the common zzso zzso zzso 

Genes were identified in the zzso zzso zzso database using zzso and transcripts were analyzed by zzso and zzso by real time zzso in the presence of zzso zzso 

The common zzso has five zzso one processed zzso and four functional zzso The latter zzso zzso zzso regions of zzso zzso containing the genes of zzso zzso and zzso upstream and downstream regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso One zzso zzso occupies the same position on the zzso as the single human zzso On the same zzso but several zzso away, is another zzso locus situated with zzso zzso and zzso arranged in zzso zzso of transcripts demonstrated that all functional genes are expressed in the male zzso zzso generating very high transcript levels in the zzso The transcript levels in seminal zzso and zzso are two and four orders of magnitude zzso A single zzso zzso accounts for more than zzso of zzso transcripts in both the prostate and the seminal zzso whereas in the zzso around half of the transcripts originate from zzso These genes display rapid evolution with a skewed distribution of zzso zzso in zzso they affect zzso zzso the zzso Greek key domain, whereas in zzso it is the zzso zzso domain that is zzso 

zzso monkeys have four functional zzso that are all expressed in the male zzso zzso but the product from one zzso zzso will predominate in seminal zzso This gene and zzso the zzso zzso zzso have accumulated zzso that affect different parts of the translation products, suggesting an ongoing molecular specialization that presumably yields functional differences in accessory sex zzso and zzso
