The zzso of the recently released zzso zzso zzso has allowed us to characterize extensively the zzso families of the zzso zzso zzso with two zzso separated by two zzso acids zzso zzso are often involved in zzso reactions by promoting the formation, reduction or zzso of zzso bonds or by binding prosthetic groups or zzso We report here the presence of a new protein family in higher plants, constituted of 19 members in zzso zzso 15 in zzso zzso and 17 in zzso zzso These proteins are almost specific to higher plants, with only two zzso genes found in zzso and zzso but none in other zzso While these proteins were predicted as zzso proteins zzso in the automatic zzso zzso they do not share the major zzso features of zzso but instead they display four zzso zzso zzso A zzso of these zzso based on sequence zzso gene structure and predicted cellular zzso is zzso The expression of these genes was also investigated by analyzing zzso databases and zzso zzso zzso
