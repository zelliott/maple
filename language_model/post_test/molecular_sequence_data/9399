zzso gene expression profiling and detailed zzso investigation were used for understanding the molecular mechanism and zzso response of zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of plants in drought zzso Recently, zzso gene expression analysis is commonly used to decipher genes and genetic networks controlling the traits of zzso However, the results of such an analysis are often plagued due to a limited number of genes zzso zzso on zzso On the other hand, zzso of a zzso has the potential to detect rare as well as a large number of transcripts in the samples zzso We used zzso zzso as well as Roche's zzso zzso sequencing for a comparative analysis of cotton zzso in leaf zzso under drought zzso 

Fourteen zzso of zzso zzso were subjected to zzso stress for preliminary zzso two zzso namely zzso and zzso were selected as being the most tolerant and most sensitive to zzso stress, zzso zzso cotton zzso containing zzso probe sets and Roche's zzso zzso sequencing of leaf tissue were used to analyze the gene expression profiling of zzso and zzso under drought zzso The analysis of zzso zzso and gene expression profiling showed that zzso has the inherent ability to sense drought at a much earlier stage and to respond to it in a much more efficient manner than does zzso Gene zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso and other secondary zzso pathways were enriched in zzso under control and drought conditions as compared with zzso Similarly, GO analysis of zzso sequencing showed that the GO terms responses to various zzso stresses were significantly higher in zzso Among the classes of zzso factors zzso uniquely expressed in both zzso zzso showed the expression of zzso and zzso zzso The unique expression of zzso in response to drought conditions reveals that zzso responds to drought by inducing zzso This was further supported by zzso analysis which revealed that zzso responds to drought by inducing many transcripts related to zzso and cell zzso 

The comparative zzso gene expression profiling study of two zzso of zzso under drought stress zzso the differential patterns of gene zzso including zzso and zzso relevant zzso Our results indicate that drought tolerance observed in zzso is not because of a single molecular reason but is rather due to several unique mechanisms which zzso has developed as an adaptation zzso
