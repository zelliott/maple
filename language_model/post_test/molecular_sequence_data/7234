Human zzso zzso coli zzso produces a zzso type IV zzso termed zzso (for long zzso Regardless of the geographic origins of zzso zzso the zzso structural gene zzso was found to have the highest level of association with zzso producing colonization factor zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso producing zzso and zzso zzso bearing the less prevalent zzso and putative colonization factors and zzso negative for zzso and putative colonization factor also contained zzso zzso zzso was found in a considerable number of zzso zzso and was more often associated with zzso producing zzso zzso than with zzso producing both zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was found more often in strains isolated from children with zzso than in strains from healthy children, suggesting an association with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a widely distributed zzso zzso in zzso that is highly associated with known zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso A zzso probe may be a helpful zzso tool to assist in the identification of zzso
