Using zzso zzso nascent strands of tobacco zzso DNA zzso as a probe, replication displacement loop zzso regions were zzso The strongest zzso was observed with restriction fragments containing the zzso genes from the zzso repeat zzso zzso gel analysis of various zzso of tobacco zzso suggested that a replication origin is located near each end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing part of the zzso zzso Analysis of in zzso replication products indicated that templates from either of the origin regions supported zzso while the zzso alone or zzso clones from other regions of the zzso did not support in zzso zzso zzso from both sides of the zzso site in the zzso zzso region were required for optimal in zzso DNA replication zzso zzso extension was used for the first time to identify the start site of DNA synthesis for the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The major zzso end of the zzso was localized to the base of a zzso structure which contains the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extension products were insensitive to both zzso and zzso treatment, suggesting that zzso zzso had already been removed from the zzso end of nascent zzso zzso of an origin in the zzso zzso region of zzso from zzso pea and zzso suggests that zzso replication origins may be zzso in higher zzso
