We constructed zzso zzso with the zzso coli zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso DNA techniques and investigated their zzso and zzso zzso Although most of the zzso could not retain zzso in the zzso the zzso zzso containing zzso zzso of zzso I of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the spectral properties similar to those of the native zzso coli zzso suggesting that both the zzso zzso b and the zzso zzso o are associated with the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso was absent in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso I of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso similar to the counterpart of the zzso coli zzso zzso and further contains two zzso zzso which serve as the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso must be arranged properly relative to zzso VI which provides the third zzso zzso
