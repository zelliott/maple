zzso zzso elimination occurs in several zzso hybrids of zzso We studied the mechanism underlying selective elimination of the paternal zzso during the early development of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The following conclusions regarding the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the process of zzso elimination were zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso triggers the zzso process of zzso zzso elimination in unstable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hybrids; zzso zzso loss of zzso protein rather than zzso zzso of zzso genes causes zzso zzso zzso in stable species combinations, zzso incorporation of zzso occurs despite zzso differences, and not all zzso zzso get incorporated into zzso if multiple zzso are present in species combinations; and zzso zzso barley species zzso two zzso zzso the proteins of which are zzso within zzso throughout zzso and zzso
