The zzso peptides of cone snails are zzso by a large gene family, and can selectively bind to zzso zzso channels zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to membrane receptors zzso zzso zzso To identify novel zzso genes and analyze the evolution of typical zzso zzso genes from different zzso species, we have constructed zzso libraries derived from the zzso ducts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were collected from the South China zzso zzso transcripts from four zzso zzso duct zzso libraries were analyzed and zzso of the transcripts zzso zzso zzso In addition to known zzso 34 novel zzso have been identified and can be classified into zzso zzso some of which showed unique patterns of zzso or different signal zzso zzso The evolutionary trees of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso approaches revealed that zzso zzso from the four zzso species undergo positive selection, mostly located in the mature toxin zzso These findings contribute to a better understanding of the diversity and evolution of zzso from the South China Sea, and some novel zzso are valuable for further functional zzso
