The zzso activity from cucumber zzso grown with their embryonic axis was separated into two zzso having zzso of 90,000 and zzso respectively, by zzso zzso However, from zzso cucumber zzso only one form of zzso having a zzso of 90,000 was zzso The three zzso could not be distinguished from each other either zzso or by their zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso maps of the 90,000 and zzso were zzso In a crude zzso of cucumber zzso the zzso was rapidly zzso to the zzso Thus, it was zzso that the zzso was probably the zzso which had lost a zzso zzso of zzso It is suggested that there is a specific zzso activity for the degradation of zzso zzso of changes in the zzso activity during zzso growth suggests that the activity at least partly contributes to the rapid in zzso degradation of cucumber zzso zzso
