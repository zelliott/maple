Many proteins that contain a zzso zzso sequence zzso including Ras and zzso zzso undergo a series of sequential zzso processing zzso Following the initial zzso of the zzso the three zzso zzso acids are zzso removed, and the newly formed zzso is zzso The specific zzso acids that comprise the zzso sequence influence whether the protein can be zzso and zzso In this study, we evaluated processing of zzso zzso with all possible single zzso acid zzso at either the zzso the zzso or the X position of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso specificity of the two known zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was investigated in zzso Both zzso and zzso were able to zzso zzso with A, zzso zzso I, C, or M at the zzso position, zzso zzso I, C, or M at the zzso position, or any zzso acid at the X position that was acceptable for zzso of the zzso Eight additional zzso zzso with zzso zzso were zzso by zzso but not by zzso In contrast, zzso was able to zzso additional zzso zzso that zzso may not be able to zzso In zzso zzso indicated that zzso was compromised or zzso for 11 zzso zzso that produced no zzso halo in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The isolation of zzso in zzso that improved zzso of zzso indicated that zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso affected its zzso zzso
