zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which, at selected zzso acid positions, mimic zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells and examined for their zzso zzso In one series of zzso the zzso zzso zzso between zzso 2 and the zzso domain of zzso was zzso replaced by an Ala zzso zzso zzso by additional zzso and Ala zzso zzso exchanged for the zzso link between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and an additional Ala zzso The activities of the latter two zzso toward zzso were, in the absence of zzso zzso higher and, in the presence of zzso comparable to or lower than the activity of zzso The kinetic data suggest a short zzso zzso in zzso as most favorable for high zzso stimulation of zzso zzso In a second series of zzso selected zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso domain were replaced by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso chosen for exchange are either close to the active site or are part of a zzso zzso in the variable region preceding the zzso zzso zzso Compared to authentic zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso lower activities toward zzso mainly due to lower zzso zzso zzso values differed only zzso A zzso containing an additional zzso group at the zzso site, zzso zzso had lost the preference of zzso for zzso over zzso as the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
