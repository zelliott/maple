zzso DNA elements representing zzso of the total repetitive DNA in zzso cotton zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso cotton zzso were isolated from a zzso library of DNA zzso with a mixture of four zzso cutting restriction zzso A total of 313 clones zzso containing nuclear repetitive sequences were classified into zzso families, based on cross zzso and Southern zzso zzso The 103 families were characterized in terms of zzso organization, zzso pattern, zzso and DNA zzso As in many other zzso zzso zzso repetitive elements are the most abundant class of repetitive DNA in the cotton zzso zzso of tandem repeat families with high copy numbers zzso may be a unique feature of the cotton zzso as compared with other higher plant zzso Interspersed repeats tend to be zzso while tandem repeats seem to be largely zzso in the cotton zzso zzso variation in repertoire and overall copy number of repetitive DNA elements among different zzso cotton species is consistent with the hypothesis of a relatively recent origin of zzso zzso
