zzso sequences of rice ragged stunt virus zzso zzso segment 9 zzso from a Thai and an Indian isolate were zzso Both sequences are zzso zzso long, contain a single large open reading frame zzso spanning zzso zzso 14 to zzso and are capable of zzso a protein of zzso The two zzso are zzso and zzso identical at the zzso and zzso acid level, zzso The authenticity of these coding sequences was confirmed by identifying a approximately zzso protein in the zzso particle with an zzso zzso acid sequence identical to that zzso from the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso from each isolate incorporated into the bacterial expression zzso zzso produced a fusion protein that reacted with zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso zzso these fusion proteins with zzso factor X liberated a approximately zzso zzso
