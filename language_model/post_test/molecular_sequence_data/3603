The chain length dependence of zzso formation of zzso peptides in lipids was investigated using fragments corresponding to the second zzso domain of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso Seven peptides with chain lengths of 10 zzso zzso 14 zzso 18 zzso 22 zzso 26 zzso 30 zzso and 35 zzso zzso zzso respectively, were zzso CD zzso revealed that zzso was zzso and all of the other peptides assumed partially zzso secondary structures in zzso zzso zzso In 50% zzso zzso assumed a zzso zzso The other six peptides exhibited the same CD patterns as those found in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed zzso structures, whereas the other peptides formed zzso zzso zzso transform infrared zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso assumed zzso in this zzso Another zzso zzso zzso zzso missing zzso zzso from the N zzso and extending to zzso on the C zzso was zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso influence their zzso zzso zzso total reflection zzso transform infrared zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and oriented at angles of 12 degrees, 13 degrees, 36 degrees, and 34 degrees, respectively, with respect to the zzso zzso This study showed that chain length must be taken into consideration when using peptides representing single zzso zzso as surrogates for regions of an intact zzso Furthermore, this work indicates that the tilt angle and zzso of zzso portions of G zzso receptors may be estimated by detailed zzso zzso of single zzso zzso
