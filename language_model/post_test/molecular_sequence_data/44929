The zzso checkpoint ensures proper zzso segregation by delaying zzso until zzso are aligned on the zzso Following prolonged zzso damage, however, cells eventually exit zzso and undergo zzso We show here that a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso checkpoint gene zzso zzso to the zzso during zzso By expressing a zzso zzso we show that zzso is not only required for the checkpoint response to zzso damage, but acts in the timing of a normal zzso In addition, when zzso function is compromised, cells escape zzso and continue cell cycle zzso despite leaving zzso with a disrupted zzso These data demonstrate a role for zzso zzso in regulating exit from zzso and suggest functional links between the zzso checkpoint and subsequent zzso events in zzso
