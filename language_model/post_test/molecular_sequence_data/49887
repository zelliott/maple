zzso zzso species use a type III zzso system to inhibit zzso by zzso zzso At 37 degrees C, the zzso system is zzso forming a zzso structure on the bacterial cell zzso Upon zzso cell zzso six zzso zzso called zzso are zzso into the zzso cell zzso Here, we show that a zzso zzso exports an increased amount of the needle component zzso to the bacterial cell surface but is unable to efficiently zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the inner membrane protein zzso suppress the zzso zzso by reducing the level of zzso zzso and increasing the level of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso regulate the zzso specificity of the zzso type III zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso and zzso act upstream of the cell contact sensor zzso as well as the inner gatekeeper zzso in the zzso of zzso export zzso These results further strengthen the strong evolutionary link between zzso zzso and type III zzso
