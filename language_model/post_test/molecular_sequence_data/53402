The genes from the zzso zzso zzso zzso that code for the putative zzso and regulatory chains of zzso zzso were expressed at high levels in zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene product exhibited zzso zzso A zzso protocol was devised for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso weight zzso of the zzso and zzso gene products revealed that the zzso gene product is a zzso and the zzso gene product is a zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso extract revealed that the zzso has a similar molecular weight to that of the zzso coli zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso extract indicates that the zzso exhibited limited zzso zzso and little if any regulatory zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso with an zzso energy similar to that observed for the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso models of the zzso and zzso gene products were constructed based on the three-dimensional structures of the zzso zzso coli zzso The zzso known to be critical for zzso regulation, and formation of the zzso structure from the well characterized zzso coli zzso zzso were zzso
