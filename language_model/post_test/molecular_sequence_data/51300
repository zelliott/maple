A mouse zzso clone previously isolated from an zzso zzso cell library and shown to zzso zzso I zzso activity on zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA, 87, zzso has been zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences are highly zzso to previously described human and rabbit zzso zzso A zzso zzso portion of the mouse zzso zzso all but the first 34 zzso acids of the deduced protein sequence was zzso expressed in zzso coli and gave rise to a prominent fusion protein of zzso zzso approximately 45 zzso whose presence correlated with high levels of zzso activity in cell zzso zzso generated from the zzso were used to show that the zzso gene is present in a single copy in zzso and that a zzso gene was not zzso (under zzso zzso zzso in DNA from zzso sea urchin, zzso or zzso zzso zzso DNA clones that zzso to zzso generated from the zzso zzso were isolated from a mouse liver zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso and DNA sequence analyses of zzso zzso DNA fragments and a zzso chain reaction zzso product provided evidence that the coding and 3' untranslated regions of the zzso reside in a single zzso However, the mouse zzso gene zzso includes at least one additional zzso zzso of the coding zzso Southern analyses of DNA from zzso zzso cell hybrids and in zzso zzso were used to locate the human zzso gene zzso between positions zzso and zzso on zzso 5, a region of zzso 5 that is zzso with a region of mouse zzso zzso Northern analyses of adult mouse zzso revealed two zzso gene transcripts that are zzso expressed in different zzso
