To investigate the zzso zzso groups in the patients with chronic zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso according to zzso strain found in China, the zzso zzso reverse zzso region, whole S region, X gene and whole zzso zzso amplified by zzso method from the serum of 18 patients with chronic zzso infection, and then the zzso products were zzso into zzso zzso zzso Positive clones with target sequences were selected out for zzso zzso comparison of the selected clones zzso made to find the zzso 

The zzso between clones from one patient of zzso zzso reverse zzso of zzso region, whole S region, X gene and whole zzso are zzso approximately zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso approximately zzso and zzso approximately zzso zzso There was a zzso zzso substitution and core zzso internal deletion zzso in zzso zzso zzso deletion and zzso by zzso or deletion of short sequence were found in 4 open reading zzso zzso in X gene zzso promoter, zzso will not only result in the zzso of X protein at the zzso end, but also regulate the expression of zzso zzso sequence of truncated middle surface zzso and defective zzso zzso could also be detected in this zzso 

There are zzso zzso groups in patients with chronic zzso zzso Hot deletion region in X region zzso will influence the prognosis of the zzso zzso zzso characterized zzso in zzso acid sequence of viral protein is worthy of further zzso
