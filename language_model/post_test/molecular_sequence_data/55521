zzso zzso has recently emerged as a highly troublesome zzso zzso especially in patients in intensive care units and in those undergoing mechanical zzso We have identified a surface protein zzso of zzso zzso designated the zzso zzso zzso zzso that contains all of the typical features of zzso zzso zzso including a long signal zzso followed by an zzso zzso passenger domain and a zzso domain zzso 4 zzso To demonstrate that zzso zzso a zzso we created a fusion protein in which we replaced the entire passenger domain of zzso with the zzso tag zzso which can be tracked with specific zzso zzso and demonstrated that the zzso 101 zzso acids of zzso were capable of exporting the zzso zzso tag to the surface of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso We found that zzso played a role in zzso formation and bound to various zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso including collagen types I, III, IV, and V and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso the zzso of whole zzso zzso cells to immobilized collagen type IV and played a role in the survival of zzso zzso in a lethal model of systemic infection in zzso zzso Taken together, these results reveal that zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso involved in zzso including zzso formation, binding to zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso cells to collagen type IV, and contributing to the survival of zzso zzso in a mouse model of lethal zzso
