The precise zzso site in the zzso origin zzso of zzso a zzso zzso replication zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by electron zzso and zzso zzso In this zzso zzso zzso occurred between zzso zzso and zzso within a zzso sequence zzso located in the stem region of an imperfect hairpin zzso This zzso site sequence was zzso among the zzso zzso zzso including zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso site might be the same for all members of this zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso and zzso were found to be zzso in zzso initiation and termination in a hybrid zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso from zzso zzso in this hybrid zzso system revealed that: zzso the zzso in the middle of the zzso zzso sequence play zzso roles in the initiation and termination process; zzso the left half of the hairpin structure is required for initiation but not for zzso and zzso a zzso sequence containing zzso and the downstream sequence is essential and sufficient for zzso In conclusion, these zzso zzso with novel features that are different from the characteristics of both zzso DNA zzso and bacterial zzso zzso might serve as a good model for studying the evolution of zzso zzso
