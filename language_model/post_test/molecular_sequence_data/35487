zzso zzso of which there are more than zzso species, are extremely important for zzso services and economic purposes, so zzso identity is a major zzso The goal of this study was to zzso the DNA zzso technique based on the zzso c zzso zzso zzso gene zzso This approach has previously been shown to be useful in resolving zzso inconsistencies and for species identification when zzso data are zzso Specifically, we designed and tested new zzso and standardized zzso conditions to amplify the zzso region for zzso focusing on the zzso zzso In addition, zzso were designed to amplify small zzso zzso and tested with pinned zzso Short zzso sequences were easily obtained for some zzso zzso museum specimens and shown to be useful as zzso The new zzso and zzso conditions established in this study proved to be successful for the amplification of the zzso region for all species tested, regardless of the conditions of tissue zzso We saw no evidence of zzso or zzso amplification by these zzso and so we suggest that these new zzso are of broad value for zzso bee identification through DNA zzso
