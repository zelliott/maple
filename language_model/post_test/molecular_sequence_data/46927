Unlike all other zzso examined to date, there is only one zzso class I locus in the zzso zzso On the bases of a nearly ubiquitous and high tissue zzso extensive zzso and zzso linkage, this gene is of the classical or class zzso zzso zzso analysis of class zzso zzso zzso by eight defined zzso zzso reveals two very old zzso lineages that perhaps emerged when humans and mice zzso from a common zzso up to 100 million years zzso The unprecedented age of these lineages suggests that different class zzso genes from ancestors of the laboratory model zzso zzso are now expressed as zzso in this zzso The lineages are best defined by their zzso and zzso zzso zzso and there are highly diverse zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso in each zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso are zzso in both zzso suggesting that zzso gene zzso maintains the high sequence zzso
