Mouse zzso tumor virus zzso zzso zzso influence the zzso T cell repertoire and stimulate a strong mixed zzso response in zzso These zzso are zzso by the open reading frame of the 3' long terminal repeat of zzso termed zzso zzso The T cell response to zzso zzso is V beta restricted and requires expression of the class II molecules of the major zzso complex zzso on the presenting zzso While human T cells respond to bacterial zzso it is not known if human T cells or human zzso class II molecules can interact with zzso zzso A zzso cell line expressing the human zzso class II zzso zzso and the zzso sag gene zzso zzso was used to stimulate human T zzso We show here that human T cells efficiently zzso in response to zzso presented by zzso This T cell response was inhibited by zzso directed against zzso or zzso class II molecules but not by zzso specific for zzso or zzso class I zzso Moreover, the response to zzso was limited to human T cells expressing a restricted set of T cell zzso V beta zzso Human T cells expressing V beta 12, 13, 14, 15, and 23 were selectively amplified after zzso sag zzso Interestingly, these human V beta s share the highest degree of zzso with the mouse V beta s interacting with zzso These results show a strong evolutionary conservation of the structures required for the presentation and the response to zzso zzso zzso zzso raising the possibility that similar elements operate in humans to shape the T cell zzso
