Human zzso zzso can zzso zzso or zzso zzso and cause cervical cancer or zzso zzso zzso with multiple zzso types is a common finding of many zzso zzso zzso it is necessary to develop a zzso which can eradicate established zzso infections and prevent other zzso zzso In this study, we generated zzso virus like particles zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and one artificial zzso zzso zzso 

The artificial zzso zzso gene was designed by zzso zzso point zzso and gene zzso then chemically zzso and zzso behind zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in insect cells by using zzso zzso The generated zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso electron microscope and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso and zzso proteins were well expressed in insect cells and could zzso into zzso whose diameter was about 55 zzso and similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso but not the intact zzso were zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso as efficiently as zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of the 158 zzso acid zzso zzso protein behind zzso did not disrupt the correct assembling of zzso The zzso characteristics and zzso activity of zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso zzso The zzso retained zzso B cell zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein had an internal location in the zzso zzso large modified zzso protein with higher zzso could be incorporated into zzso by fusing to the zzso of zzso which would help to improve the therapeutic effects of zzso zzso
