zzso of zzso impose a heavy economic burden on developing countries in terms of zzso control and human zzso zzso vaccines against all four zzso of zzso are in development, but population replacement with transgenic zzso unable to transmit the virus might ultimately prove to be an effective approach to disease suppression, or even zzso A key element of the zzso transgenic zzso approach is the development of zzso that effectively prohibit viral zzso In this report we test the effectiveness of several zzso zzso for suppressing zzso in zzso zzso cells in an attempt to mimic the transgenic use of these zzso molecules in zzso A zzso zzso that expresses these zzso as a fusion zzso zzso using an zzso aegypti zzso promoter and terminating with a zzso tail zzso optimal zzso zzso and activity of the zzso zzso against the zzso zzso Among the 14 zzso zzso we designed to attack the zzso zzso zzso several appear to be relatively effective in reducing virus production from zzso cells by as much as 2 zzso Among the sequences targeted are 10 that are zzso among all zzso zzso 2 zzso Our results confirm that zzso zzso can be effective in suppressing zzso in a transgenic approach, and provide an alternative or supplementary approach to proposed zzso strategies for zzso suppression in transgenic zzso
