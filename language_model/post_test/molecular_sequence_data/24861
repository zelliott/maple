zzso zzso play important roles in the zzso of several zzso infections and have been proposed as targets for the zzso approach of drug zzso As the first step toward applying this strategy to design zzso as zzso agents for zzso zzso we zzso and characterized the zzso zzso zzso from adult zzso First, the partial zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso was cloned by performing reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and the 3' regions of the zzso zzso gene were amplified using the zzso protocol for the rapid amplification of zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence shares similarity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso L by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was then zzso in the zzso zzso zzso as an active zzso on a large-scale basis zzso zzso The active zzso zzso was zzso from culture media using a zzso affinity column and gel zzso zzso This zzso zzso protein exhibited a zzso preference for zzso zzso compared with zzso and the activity was inhibited by zzso zzso
