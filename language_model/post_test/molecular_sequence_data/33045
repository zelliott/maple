Rapid identification and typing of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is important for understanding the molecular epidemiology and evolution of zzso and offers many advantages for controlling transmission in both health care and community zzso We developed a rapid molecular beacon real-time zzso zzso zzso for zzso cassette zzso zzso zzso zzso The design of this system is based on the established definition of zzso types, zzso the combination of the zzso class complex with the zzso zzso The zzso consists of two multiplex panels, the combination of which results in two targets zzso class, zzso for each zzso zzso zzso panel I targets zzso zzso zzso and the zzso junction zzso class zzso it can definitively identify zzso types II and zzso zzso panel II detects zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso junction zzso class zzso and is therefore capable of identifying zzso types I, III, zzso and VI in combination with panel zzso The method can also detect the recently described novel zzso type VIII zzso with zzso class zzso Our zzso demonstrated zzso zzso when applied to 162 zzso strains previously characterized by traditional zzso typing zzso Four geographically and temporally diverse zzso zzso collections were also successfully classified by our zzso along with zzso clinical zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso As many as 96 zzso can be classified easily within 3 to 4 zzso including DNA isolation, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso is zzso zzso sensitive, and zzso allowing for zzso zzso typing of zzso zzso
