zzso of zzso differ significantly in size and DNA zzso zzso coli is considered a model zzso to analyze the processes involved in bacterial zzso evolution, as the species comprises numerous zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli strains differ in the presence and absence of additional DNA elements contributing to specific zzso traits and also in the presence and absence of additional genetic zzso To analyze the genetic diversity of zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso a zzso approach was zzso Using DNA zzso the presence of all zzso open reading frames zzso of zzso zzso coli K-12 strain zzso was investigated in 26 zzso coli zzso including various zzso and zzso zzso zzso coli zzso 3 zzso island deletion zzso and zzso and laboratory zzso Additionally, the presence of zzso genes of zzso coli was determined using a DNA zzso developed in our zzso The frequency and zzso pattern of zzso variations vary widely in different zzso coli zzso Up to zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso were not zzso in the zzso of the different zzso DNA sequences described for zzso or zzso zzso zzso coli are more frequently zzso in zzso of the same origin than in other zzso Several genes coding for zzso or fitness factors are also present in zzso zzso coli zzso Based on these results, the zzso zzso coli core zzso is estimated to consist of at least zzso zzso zzso The absence of zzso zzso was zzso in all zzso zzso These data demonstrate the great zzso zzso and genetic diversity among zzso coli strains and underline the fact that both the acquisition and deletion of DNA elements are important processes involved in the evolution of zzso
