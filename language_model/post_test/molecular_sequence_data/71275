In rice, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso causing easily zzso zzso patterns on the grain surface, offers a convenient tool to study quantitative aspects of gene zzso in zzso In this paper we analyzed zzso zzso inheritance and environmental effects on the zzso We also report on the cloning of zzso determination of their structure and analysis of transcripts from the zzso zzso The results show that various patterns of zzso appeared in the zzso generation at which most of the zzso became zzso and that they were inherited for five zzso In addition, zzso independently occurred in three generations and zzso to full expression was also zzso Cloning of zzso from a silenced zzso line demonstrated that this line carried two zzso zzso one carried an intact zzso gene and the other carried a rearranged zzso in which part of the zzso gene was in the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso transcripts indicated that partial zzso zzso derived from the rearranged zzso was present in silenced lines and was zzso but that it was absent in zzso zzso zzso analyses suggested that the zzso zzso in the zzso layer was zzso and that it may be caused by interaction of partial zzso zzso transcripts with normal sense zzso zzso involvement of zzso transcripts in zzso zzso is zzso
