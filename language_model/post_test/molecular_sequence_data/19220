zzso proteins form an zzso zzso family of zzso zzso implicated in multiple zzso events in various zzso They lack zzso zzso and act by zzso with other zzso factors, but their precise roles in development are not zzso Here we analyze the role of nab in zzso zzso By employing genetic approaches we found that nab is required for zzso patterning of the wing zzso disc and also for determining specific zzso fates in the embryonic zzso We identified two partners of zzso the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso is zzso with squeeze in a subset of zzso in the embryonic zzso nerve zzso and with zzso in a circular domain of the zzso area of the wing zzso Our results indicate that zzso is a zzso of zzso and is required to limit the number of zzso that express the zzso gene zzso and to specify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso in wing development and is required to limit the expression of wingless zzso in the wing zzso where zzso plays a zzso zzso We also showed by pull-down zzso that zzso binds directly to zzso and zzso via its zzso zzso zzso We propose two mechanisms by which the zzso of zzso expression by zzso in the wing hinge is zzso in the zzso zzso
