zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the first zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, is present in the zzso and zzso of zzso In zzso zzso zzso cloning revealed the existence of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which appear to be localized in zzso In the present study the zzso zzso was sought by searching the expressed sequence tag zzso database and by screening zzso zzso zzso zzso A fourth zzso zzso was identified, but it also encodes a zzso zzso The zzso genes all contain four zzso The zzso are located at identical positions within the coding sequence of each of the zzso zzso A putative zzso box was identified in the promoter of the zzso and zzso zzso but no regions of sequence similarity were found among the other zzso Combined analysis of an zzso zzso and zzso clone revealed that the deduced protein is 469 zzso acids and is most zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was able to functionally complement a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein exhibits a zzso targeting zzso at its zzso zzso that, when fused to green fluorescent zzso was able to target the reporter to zzso zzso zzso was detected at a similar zzso level in roots and leaves, and its expression was not induced by sulfur zzso or by zzso zzso Having identified a fourth zzso zzso zzso the origin of zzso zzso in zzso zzso remains zzso Based on sequence analysis, it is hypothesized that zzso may zzso the zzso zzso zzso
