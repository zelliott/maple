zzso zzso particles zzso are a family of zzso zzso zzso that specify modification sites through guide zzso They also participate in zzso zzso zzso processing and are a component of zzso zzso Here we report the crystal structure, at zzso A resolution, of an entire zzso zzso zzso consisting of proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso revealing a modular organization of the zzso The zzso upper stem is bound to a composite surface formed by zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso lower stem and zzso signature motif are bound to the zzso domain of zzso thereby positioning middle guide sequences so that they are primed to pair with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso may regulate zzso loading and zzso The structure zzso the consensus structure of zzso zzso suggests a functional role of each zzso and provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of zzso zzso as well as various cellular functions of zzso zzso
