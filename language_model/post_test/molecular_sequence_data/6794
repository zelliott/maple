zzso is a several step process that requires genes involved in specifying zzso lineage and genes involved in determining muscle identity, zzso and zzso We report here on the isolation, zzso and expression pattern of a zzso clone zzso by the previously zzso zzso muscle segment zzso zzso gene and its possible role in zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso domain is highly zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso and empty zzso genes and the zzso 7 and zzso 8 family of zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso end of zzso has zzso sequence identity to the zzso end of the empty zzso gene and encodes several stretches of zzso acids rich in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating potential zzso of regulatory zzso The expression of zzso is initially detected at about stage 6 in the zzso lateral zzso of the zzso and later in the developing central zzso and peripheral nervous zzso During germ band zzso zzso zzso zzso continues to be expressed in cells of the nervous system as well as cells of the zzso zzso corresponding mostly to the developing zzso and lateral zzso body wall zzso These zzso cells, which continue to express zzso in zzso zzso zzso undergo an increase in cell number in zzso zzso By late stage 14 of embryonic development, zzso expression is greatly reduced or absent in most or all zzso and muscle but continues in zzso until zzso zzso expression of zzso in the zzso results in altered expression of the zzso and zzso genes leading to a loss of some muscles and defects in the patterning of others, suggesting that the muscle defects are at the level of recruitment and/or patterning of muscle precursor zzso Thus the similarity of zzso zzso expression to that of the zzso zzso zzso 7 and zzso 8 genes together with the effects of zzso expression of zzso in the zzso suggest a role for the zzso family of genes in zzso and muscle differentiation and zzso
