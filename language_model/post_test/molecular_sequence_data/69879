The zzso zzso is frequently activated by zzso zzso leukemia zzso insertions in E zzso transgenic zzso Using a mouse zzso zzso probe a transcript of zzso zzso was detected on Northern blots of human zzso zzso cell zzso We have isolated and zzso zzso clones from a human zzso cell line zzso derived zzso library, using different mouse zzso zzso fragments as a zzso Analysis of zzso zzso sequences reveals a gene structure which is very similar to that of the zzso consisting of at least 10 zzso The human zzso is zzso zzso in length and shows zzso identity to the mouse zzso zzso The open reading frame encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids which shares zzso identity to the zzso acid sequence of mouse zzso zzso In zzso translation experiments show that human zzso derived zzso translates into a protein with a mobility of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso spreads located the human zzso gene to the short arm of zzso 10 zzso a region known to be involved in zzso in various zzso
