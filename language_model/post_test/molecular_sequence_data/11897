In an effort to isolate novel genes involved in inflammation and/or mast cell zzso we have used a combination of differential screening and zzso zzso to isolate genes whose expression are induced upon zzso of a transformed rat mast cell zzso One of the isolated zzso zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids that included a putative zzso zzso domain, a zzso rich zzso zzso domain, and a zzso domain containing three consensus zzso zzso binding zzso The zzso gene is also highly zzso between rat and zzso with the two coding regions being zzso zzso Although the zzso coding region did not contain an obvious signal zzso zzso protein was detected on the surface of rat mast cells, and the cloned zzso produced a cell surface protein when expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso from both mouse and rat zzso alternative zzso producing an zzso containing an zzso deletion of the TM domain, suggesting that a form of zzso protein may be zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso upon zzso of zzso cells and was highly abundant in primary zzso mast zzso zzso of zzso zzso was only observed in primary and transformed mast cells from zzso while in the mouse zzso zzso was also produced in significant amounts by a number of transformed zzso cell zzso Thus, zzso is a novel surface protein whose structure and expression suggest roles in the development and/or zzso of mast cells and zzso
