The zzso domain of the alpha zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso which is connected with the core part of zzso zzso through a long flexible zzso plays decisive roles in zzso zzso by directly interacting with a large number of zzso factors and upstream zzso element zzso Here we constructed a set of zzso zzso zzso each containing a zzso alpha zzso with an altered zzso zzso zzso of three zzso acids from the zzso exhibited 50% zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso zzso of six zzso acids completely knocked out the zzso zzso of three zzso acids did not affect the activity, whereas zzso zzso was observed after zzso of one, two, or four zzso zzso zzso of 10 consecutive zzso zzso resulted in nearly zzso reduction of the zzso activity, whereas 50% activity was retained after substitution of 10 zzso zzso or a sequence expected to form a strong zzso Essentially the same results were obtained with UP zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations altogether suggest that zzso sufficient length of the zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso by the alpha zzso domain, zzso the zzso is not totally zzso but has structural and zzso preferences to facilitate positioning of the zzso domain to a proper location for the interaction with zzso and UP element, and zzso zzso zzso and UP zzso zzso share a common zzso state in which the positioning of the alpha zzso domain is of primary zzso
