Three zzso peptides named zzso zzso zzso zzso have been isolated from zzso zzso blood zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso The primary structures of these peptides have been determined by automated zzso degradation and zzso The results suggest that the peptides belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that among zzso from other animal species, zzso is the most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and also highly similar to human zzso zzso zzso zzso which is produced by zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso with human zzso zzso zzso zzso natural zzso was zzso The primary structures of zzso and zzso are most similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso one of six zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso have been shown to be active against the zzso bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso coli, and the fungus zzso zzso similarly to the human zzso zzso
