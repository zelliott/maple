Plant zzso processes are controlled by both zzso programs and environmental zzso As a zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been isolated and zzso Our detailed characterization has revealed that the zzso is deficient in a variety of stimulus responses, including zzso response and waving growth of roots, as well as zzso zzso zzso In the roots and zzso the zzso zzso also affects zzso and specific cell proliferation such as lateral root formation and secondary zzso Those zzso indicate that the zzso gene is responsible for the regulation of fundamental zzso processes of the plant zzso cell zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso cloning of the zzso gene using a zzso zzso has revealed that the gene encodes a protein with a zzso zzso one of the motifs found in zzso zzso Nuclear zzso of the zzso protein strongly suggests that the zzso gene zzso the signal zzso pathways under the zzso development by controlling expression of genes downstream of these zzso
