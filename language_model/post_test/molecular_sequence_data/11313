We have compared zzso heat shock zzso protein zzso isolated from bovine brain with zzso wild type protein and zzso zzso protein zzso studied as wild type in our zzso Wild type bovine and zzso protein differ by zzso modification of zzso zzso but interact similarly with a short zzso zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in zzso zzso faster release of zzso and lower stability of complexes with zzso zzso zzso zzso rates of the wild type proteins are enhanced zzso by the addition of zzso The zzso zzso has a zzso zzso rate similar to that of wild type protein but a higher zzso rate, yielding a mere zzso zzso All three versions of zzso possess similar zzso zzso shifts, and all show zzso zzso zzso These data support the following model: zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso binding domain zzso the zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso this zzso and zzso the zzso zzso significantly zzso the zzso by the zzso binding domain and zzso zzso zzso
