zzso zzso zzso play a key role in zzso reactions in plant secondary zzso Some of them, which catalyze unique reactions other than the standard zzso increase the structural diversity of plant secondary zzso In zzso zzso zzso several unique zzso reactions have been reported, such as zzso bridge formation, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here the isolation and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from an expressed sequence tag library of cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso had high zzso acid sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso indicated that zzso had zzso zzso zzso activity to produce zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Despite this intriguing reaction, zzso zzso showed typical zzso zzso its zzso zzso reaction required zzso and oxygen and was inhibited by a typical zzso zzso Based on a detailed zzso analysis, this unique reaction mechanism and zzso recognition were zzso zzso may be involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso based on the fact that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could convert zzso to zzso
