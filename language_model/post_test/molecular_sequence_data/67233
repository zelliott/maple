zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the fifth zzso of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and is involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso sequence zzso as zzso was cloned and characterized for the first time from zzso plant species, zzso zzso using zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso was zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso of 239 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso Comparative and zzso analyses revealed that zzso showed extensive zzso with zzso from other species and contained zzso zzso owned by the zzso protein zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso was more ancient than other plant zzso zzso expression pattern analysis indicated that zzso expressed the highest in roots, followed by in leaves, and the lowest in zzso The color zzso zzso indicated that zzso could accelerate the zzso of zzso The zzso characterization and functional analysis of zzso will be helpful to understand more about the role of zzso involved in the zzso zzso at the molecular zzso
