zzso is the newest member of the zzso zzso family and plays an important role in the immune zzso It is composed of two zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Although human and mouse zzso zzso genes have been zzso pig zzso zzso gene has not ever been zzso In the present study, we have cloned and characterized the full-length zzso of zzso zzso from zzso The open reading frame of pig zzso zzso gene is zzso zzso which encodes a protein of 239 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of pig zzso zzso showed a high degree of zzso to human zzso and mouse zzso It was a zzso zzso and belonged to zzso zzso zzso Pig zzso zzso has one zzso region, one signal zzso and one zzso site, two zzso zzso C zzso sites, three zzso zzso II zzso sites and one zzso zzso For the expression of pig zzso zzso protein in a zzso expression system the zzso zzso was zzso The expression of pig zzso zzso in zzso cells were confirmed by flow zzso analysis, zzso and Western zzso The analysis also confirmed a cross zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of cloning and characterization of zzso zzso in zzso
