A strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso 69 degrees zzso zzso in the vicinity of Port zzso zzso The zzso pigmented colonies of strain zzso were round, flat and translucent with irregular margins and a smooth zzso The strain possessed up to three zzso zzso and was zzso by a zzso zzso The strain grew zzso at 37 degrees C zzso growth range zzso degrees zzso in a complex zzso medium with 5 % zzso zzso growth range zzso zzso at pH 9 zzso growth range pH zzso indicating that it was a zzso zzso zzso The strain was sensitive to zzso zzso zzso and zzso but resistant to zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not detected and cells were heat zzso The isolate zzso a range of carbohydrates and zzso zzso gelatin and zzso Growth was not observed on aromatic compounds, zzso 40 or zzso zzso zzso was not reduced and zzso was zzso zzso microscopic examination of thin sections revealed a single thick zzso cell zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that strain zzso was a member of the sixth zzso group of the zzso zzso which includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the closest relative of strain zzso zzso % zzso but a number of zzso differences suggest that strain zzso zzso zzso zzso should be designated the type strain of a new species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
