zzso zzso which are among the most frequently occurring protein interaction zzso in nature, bind to zzso targets ranging in length from 7 to more than 25 zzso Although the bulk of studies on the zzso binding properties of zzso zzso have focused on interactions with relatively short peptides (less than 10 zzso a number of zzso have been recently shown to require much longer sequences for optimal binding zzso To gain greater insight into the binding mechanism and biological importance of interactions between an zzso domain and extended zzso zzso we have investigated interactions of the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso with several zzso relevant zzso target zzso zzso To obtain a molecular model for zzso zzso we solved the structure of the zzso bound to a target zzso from the zzso zzso patch zzso zzso zzso target complexes from binding partners zzso and zzso were also zzso revealing that the zzso uses a common extended interface for interaction with these zzso despite zzso values for these peptides ranging from zzso to 6 zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso across the whole zzso binding site are important both for zzso in zzso binding affinity and for in zzso zzso zzso conservation analysis revealed that both the zzso and its extended target sequences are highly zzso across diverse zzso species as well as higher zzso Our data imply that the zzso must bind extended target sites to function efficiently inside the zzso
