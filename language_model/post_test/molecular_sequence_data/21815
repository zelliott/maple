zzso are the most common cause of epidemic zzso zzso zzso is one of the most frequently detected zzso associated with sporadic zzso We studied the evolution of the major zzso gene from seven archival zzso zzso collected during a zzso study at the Children's Hospital in Washington, DC, from 1975 through 1991, together with zzso sequence from 56 strains available in zzso zzso analysis concluded that zzso viruses evolved at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is similar to that described for the more prevalent zzso zzso The analysis of the zzso acid changes over the zzso period found that zzso viruses evolve at a relatively steady state, maintaining zzso distance, and have a tendency to zzso back to previously used zzso while preserving the same zzso binding zzso In contrast, zzso viruses demonstrate increasing rates of distance over time because of the continued integration of new zzso acids and changing zzso binding zzso In zzso zzso seven sites acting under positive selection were predicted to be zzso zzso in the zzso domain, in contrast to zzso positively selected sites located primarily in the shell zzso Our study suggests that zzso zzso caused disease as early as 1975 and that they evolve via a specific pattern, responding to selective pressures induced by the host rather than presenting a zzso evolution rate lower than that of zzso zzso as previously zzso zzso the evolutionary dynamics of prevalent zzso is relevant to the development of effective prevention and control zzso
