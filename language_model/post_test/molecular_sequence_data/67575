The emergence of drug-resistant bacteria is a severe problem in zzso The ability of drug resistance genes to transfer from a bacterial cell to another is thought to be responsible for the wide dissemination of these genes in the aquaculture zzso however, little is known about the gene transfer mechanisms in marine zzso In this study, we show that a zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from seawater at a coastal aquaculture site in Japan, harbors a novel multiple drug resistance zzso This zzso named zzso can be transferred to zzso coli by zzso zzso sequencing showed that the zzso was zzso base pairs and contained 235 predicted coding zzso zzso showed that zzso did not have known zzso suggesting a new zzso and contained seven drug resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso has a complete set of genes zzso the apparatus for the type IV zzso system with a unique zzso of zzso zzso analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso demonstrated that the zzso transfer system of the zzso belongs to zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso family, closely related to the zzso type of plasmids and zzso widely distributed among species of zzso and zzso Our data suggest that zzso transfer is involved in horizontal gene transfer among marine bacteria and provide useful insights into the molecular basis for the dissemination of drug resistance genes among bacteria in the aquaculture zzso
