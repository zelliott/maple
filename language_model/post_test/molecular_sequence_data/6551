We cloned and zzso the zzso full-length zzso for the chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso of interest because, unlike its zzso zzso it does not bind zzso growth factor II zzso The zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso that includes a putative signal zzso an zzso domain consisting of 15 zzso repeat zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Overall, it shows zzso sequence identity with human and bovine zzso zzso and all but two of 122 zzso zzso are zzso However, it shows much less zzso in the zzso signal zzso in repeat 11, which is proposed to contain the zzso site in zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso segment in the zzso sequence that has been proposed to mediate zzso signal zzso in response to zzso binding by the human zzso zzso expression in zzso cells produced a functional zzso which exhibited zzso binding and zzso zzso of zzso human zzso zzso of the functional chicken zzso in mice lacking the zzso zzso should clarify the controversy over the zzso role of the zzso site in zzso zzso zzso
