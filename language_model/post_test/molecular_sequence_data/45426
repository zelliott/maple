zzso zzso zzso belongs to a group of overlapping skeletal zzso the common molecular basis of which are zzso of zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso The nature of the zzso has been considered the major zzso of the zzso within this group that comprises the zzso syndromes zzso zzso and zzso syndrome besides zzso However, to date the molecular zzso are not well zzso In zzso only few zzso zzso have been reported which do not cluster in a specific region of the zzso We report on a novel de zzso zzso zzso zzso T in zzso 31 of the zzso gene in a girl with manifestations of zzso and zzso This zzso is predicted to lead to the exchange of a highly zzso zzso zzso at position zzso by zzso zzso in repeat 15 of the zzso A rod zzso In a second family with zzso we identified a known zzso zzso in a mother and her zzso In contrast to most previous reports on zzso females or carriers of the zzso skeletal zzso the affected females presented here showed only mild to moderate skewing of zzso against the zzso zzso Our data may indicate that in zzso zzso correlation between certain zzso zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, is less strict than previously zzso We propose that zzso is an important zzso modifier of the zzso in females with the zzso skeletal zzso
