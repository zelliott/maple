Association of the zzso chain zzso with zzso class II alpha and beta chains is central for their functionality and involves the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso sequence in place of the zzso region are shown to form zzso complexes resistant to zzso by zzso at 25 degrees zzso This reflects class II zzso binding site occupancy, since substitution of the major anchor zzso within the zzso zzso sequence of one of these zzso zzso zzso its capacity to form zzso zzso zzso zzso location within zzso is compatible with zzso access to the class II binding zzso However, in zzso zzso this access does not lead to a tight association, which seems to be affected by the zzso zzso zzso This region, together with a region zzso of zzso is shown to contribute to zzso association with zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso with zzso binding sequences in place of the zzso region can still associate with zzso molecules and inhibit zzso zzso
