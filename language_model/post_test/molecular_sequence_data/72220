Spinal muscular zzso zzso is a frequent zzso zzso disease in human characterized by zzso of motor zzso of the spinal zzso The zzso region containing the defective gene zzso is particularly unstable and prone to large-scale deletions whose characterization led to the identification of the survival motor zzso zzso zzso the zzso determining gene zzso a zzso unknown zzso As an initial step toward the generation of a zzso model for zzso we identified and characterized a full-length zzso zzso zzso The coding sequence of the mouse zzso gene was found to be zzso zzso at the zzso acid level, with the human zzso coding zzso The zzso locus was mapped to the segment of mouse zzso 13 exhibiting conservation of zzso with human zzso zzso which contains the zzso zzso However, no evidence for a zzso of the zzso gene was found in the zzso suggesting that the zzso reported in human is a recent evolutionary zzso
