Using the zzso two hybrid system, we isolated a rat zzso zzso coding for a new protein with no zzso to any other protein in the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso that most likely arise through alternative zzso zzso truncated forms of the zzso zzso is the only tissue that predominantly expresses the longest protein zzso When this zzso is zzso with enhanced green fluorescent zzso the protein is located in the zzso
