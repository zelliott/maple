zzso zzso normally inhabits the human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts but is frequently the cause of zzso at various zzso Using the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso gene as a zzso probe, we cloned two zzso located zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and expressed the two zzso genes separately in zzso zzso A comparison of the predicted zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed considerable divergence between the sequences of these two zzso and even less similarity to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso type strain zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso displayed high degrees of zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso showed the highest zzso with the zzso of one of the three zzso zzso classes, whereas zzso and zzso of strain zzso zzso most closely resemble zzso zzso zzso These findings raise interesting questions about potential genetic transfer between different bacterial species, as opposed to zzso zzso
