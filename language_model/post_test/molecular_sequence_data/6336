zzso zzso zzso contains three zzso sets of zzso zzso zzso to structural zzso of a zzso zzso This form is localized in the basement membrane zone of the zzso zzso where it interacts with zzso It has been described that zzso zzso of many proteins contains clusters of basic zzso Here we show that zzso highly basic zzso zzso zzso zzso from the rat zzso zzso starting at 25 zzso and reaching a plateau at 250 zzso zzso We also show that zzso was able to zzso zzso bound to zzso Two synthetic peptides corresponding to the sequence of the zzso tail zzso also release the zzso Finally, we propose that two zzso consensus sequences zzso are present in the tail of zzso Our results indicate that clusters of basic zzso are responsible for the interaction of the zzso zzso with zzso
