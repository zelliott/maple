The functional zzso for insect zzso hormones is a zzso consisting of two nuclear hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is commonly thought to be a hormone precursor and zzso zzso the zzso active zzso little is known about the relative activity of zzso in various zzso As a step toward characterization of potential differential zzso recognition, we have analyzed the activities of various zzso using gel mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed little zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso In contrast, this steroid functioned as a potent zzso for the zzso Aedes aegypti zzso complex zzso significantly enhancing DNA binding and zzso a reporter gene in zzso zzso The zzso zzso also displayed higher zzso DNA binding activity than the zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that the zzso zzso not the zzso zzso was responsible for zzso zzso Using zzso techniques, we made a series of Aedes and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responsiveness was mapped near the C zzso of the zzso binding domain, within the identity box previously implicated in the zzso specificity of nuclear zzso This region includes zzso 9 and 10, as determined by comparison with available crystal structures obtained from other nuclear zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso in Aedes zzso corresponding to zzso in zzso zzso was most critical for zzso specificity and zzso DNA binding zzso These results demonstrated that zzso could function as a bona fide zzso in a zzso zzso
