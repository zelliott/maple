zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso was used as an zzso zzso zzso in order to determine a part of the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso a number of zzso zzso at various zzso rates but not zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso was isolated from human colon zzso cell line zzso zzso by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso The protein was zzso with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and the structure was determined both by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso and by a zzso protein zzso before or after treatment with the zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso sequence derived from zzso proteins was clearly determined by the combined use of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso
