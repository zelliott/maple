We investigated the possible role of zzso zzso zzso in the development of sporadic zzso benign, and zzso zzso zzso DNA extracted from zzso specimens of zzso zzso zzso was screened for zzso zzso point zzso in zzso 10, 11, and 16 by zzso zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso The zzso sequence of samples with zzso band patterns was identified by zzso direct sequencing of zzso chain zzso zzso zzso of seven patients with multiple zzso zzso type 2A zzso zzso and zzso zzso served as positive zzso None of the eight zzso zzso three cases of zzso ten zzso zzso zzso zzso or one normal zzso zzso contained zzso in each of the three zzso zzso zzso Six zzso zzso zzso exhibited identical band shifts in the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso 11, which corresponded to a zzso zzso substitution in the zzso sequence analysis zzso whereas in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a point zzso was found at zzso zzso of zzso 16 zzso causing a Met zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso of the zzso 2 zzso in zzso 10, 11, and 16 are not involved in the development of sporadically occurring benign or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, our results are in accordance with the observation that zzso 2A patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso have a higher risk of developing zzso disease than those with other zzso at zzso zzso
