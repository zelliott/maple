zzso is an integral membrane protein of zzso zzso shown to interact with the zzso zzso release channel, zzso and zzso Several zzso zzso have been zzso to exist in cardiac muscle, but to date none has been zzso zzso Here, we show that only zzso 1 is significantly zzso We cloned and zzso zzso zzso canine cardiac zzso 1 and 3 but found no evidence for zzso zzso From deduced primary structures, zzso against zzso common to all zzso and an zzso against the unique C zzso of zzso 1 were zzso All zzso detected two prominent proteins of molecular masses 35 and 40 zzso on zzso from cardiac zzso including the zzso that recognizes only zzso zzso The zzso mobility form was shown to zzso to the zzso form of zzso 1, not a distinct zzso 2 zzso as previously zzso zzso this, zzso of zzso 1 in transgenic mouse hearts produced both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso mobility zzso The zzso site of zzso 1 was localized to zzso zzso 75, and its zzso arrangement in the membrane was zzso Although a zzso zzso protein could be tentatively identified in zzso as zzso 3, its expression level was insignificant zzso compared with that of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso 1 is the zzso zzso most likely to play a role in zzso release in zzso
