zzso are heavily zzso zzso zzso Given their relevant functions, zzso and their genes have been mainly studied in higher zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to play an important role in the interaction with the surface of the zzso cell during the invasion zzso We show now that this zzso has a family of putative zzso zzso whose organization resembles the one present in zzso zzso Different zzso zzso have different sets of zzso as defined by their central zzso Central zzso rich in zzso for zzso and/or zzso and Pro zzso are made up of either a variable number of repeat units in tandem or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from different genes in different zzso have similar zzso suggesting their common zzso zzso of deduced zzso acid sequences revealed that all members of the family have the same putative signal zzso on the N zzso and a putative sequence for zzso zzso on the C zzso The deduced molecular mass of the core proteins is small (from 17 to 21 zzso in agreement with the zzso size of the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso are located on large zzso bands of about zzso zzso zzso
