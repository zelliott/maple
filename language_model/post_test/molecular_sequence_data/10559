The assembly of the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso gene zzso complex is determined by the interactions of the zzso zzso domain zzso the viral zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso and the C1 factor zzso cell factor, zzso A unique zzso factor, C1 consists of a family of zzso derived from a common precursor by zzso zzso zzso To analyze the role of this factor in the determination of zzso zzso infection, zzso and zzso zzso zzso the mouse zzso have been zzso This factor is nearly identical to the human zzso contains multiple consensus zzso processing sites, and functions efficiently in the assembly of a specific zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the differential expression of the C1 factors in both human and mouse zzso may be important for the determination of zzso tissue zzso in these two zzso
