zzso precise zzso formation is crucial for the zzso zzso to function zzso zzso zzso transfer information to bipolar and horizontal cells at a specialized zzso the ribbon zzso We identified zzso an zzso zzso retinal zzso and observed that it localized to the synaptic zzso in the zzso ribbon zzso zzso zzso mice showed improper zzso of the bipolar cell zzso tips to the zzso ribbon zzso resulting in zzso in synaptic signal transmission and visual zzso zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso at the ribbon zzso Furthermore, we observed direct zzso interactions between zzso and zzso Together, our results identify zzso as a zzso protein and demonstrate that it has an essential role in the precise interactions between the zzso ribbon zzso and the bipolar zzso This may also advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the retinal zzso abnormalities observed in muscular zzso zzso
