In zzso zzso zzso resistance against zzso zzso expressing either of two sequence unrelated type III zzso zzso or zzso An zzso protein zzso zzso from plant cell extracts with zzso zzso or zzso Reduction of zzso protein levels zzso both the hypersensitive response and the restriction of pathogen growth controlled by zzso zzso reduction causes diminution of zzso zzso reduction results in heightened resistance to virulent zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso defense gene zzso Thus, zzso positively regulates zzso resistance yet is, zzso a negative regulator of zzso defense zzso zzso and zzso induce zzso zzso This may enhance zzso activity as a negative regulator of plant defense, zzso pathogen zzso zzso may zzso against pathogens that use zzso and zzso to manipulate zzso zzso
