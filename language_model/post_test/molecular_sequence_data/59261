A novel repetitive DNA zzso zzso has been identified in the barley zzso zzso zzso zzso This 830 base pair zzso DNA sequence has a zzso open reading frame and is present as approximately zzso zzso zzso copies per zzso barley zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed that repetitive DNA elements containing zzso and related sequences were dispersed within the barley zzso zzso similar to zzso were also found in wheat zzso zzso zzso rye zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with copy numbers of 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso were also present in the corn zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but they were not highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and corn showed zzso restriction zzso length zzso of zzso and related zzso zzso similarity searches revealed that zzso is closely related to reverse zzso genes in zzso elements of several plant species and of zzso The highly repetitive nature, zzso distribution, and high degree of similarity to reverse zzso genes suggests that zzso contains the sequence of a zzso reverse zzso zzso
