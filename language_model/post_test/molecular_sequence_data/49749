zzso zzso functions as a zzso to enhance the rate of protein C zzso by zzso approximately zzso The molecular mechanism by which TM improves the zzso efficiency of zzso toward protein C is not zzso zzso modeling of the protein C zzso based on the crystal structure of zzso in complex with the zzso growth zzso zzso 4, 5, and 6 of TM zzso predicts that the binding of zzso to zzso 1 of zzso positions zzso so that a zzso charged region on this domain juxtaposes a positively charged region of protein zzso It has been hypothesized that zzso interactions between these zzso charged zzso of zzso and protein C facilitate a proper zzso of the zzso into the zzso pocket of zzso To test this hypothesis, we have constructed several zzso of zzso and protein C in which charges of the putative interacting zzso on both zzso zzso and protein C zzso have been zzso zzso of zzso protein C zzso studies by such a zzso zzso approach support the molecular model that zzso interacts with the basic zzso of protein zzso
