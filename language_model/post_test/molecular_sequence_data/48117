The enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso gene is a modified version of the green fluorescent protein gene of the zzso zzso zzso with a zzso usage that zzso well to that found in many zzso zzso zzso Here the use of zzso as a reporter for the analysis of zzso and temporally regulated gene expression in zzso zzso zzso is zzso The zzso gene was inserted into plasmids that can replicate in zzso coli, greatly zzso the construction of zzso gene zzso The plasmids can be transferred readily to zzso zzso by zzso zzso two of them zzso and zzso integrate at the zzso attachment site for the temperate zzso zzso These zzso were used to zzso the spatial and zzso expression of zzso which encodes a zzso factor required for spore zzso and of zzso a zzso regulatory gene for the production of zzso one of the four antibiotics made by zzso zzso While zzso of zzso appeared to be confined to developing and mature spore zzso zzso of zzso occurred only in zzso zzso zzso A further zzso zzso zzso was made that lacks the zzso attachment site, allowing the zzso gene to be fused zzso to genes of interest at their native zzso zzso
