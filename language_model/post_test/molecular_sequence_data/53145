zzso analysis of partial zzso and zzso gene sequences showed that a single genetic lineage of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso New Jersey zzso caused the 1995 and 1997 outbreaks of zzso zzso zzso in the western United zzso While distinct from zzso strains causing previous outbreaks in the western United States and those circulating in feral zzso in the zzso United States, this lineage was closely related to viral lineages circulating in the Mexican states of Guerrero, Veracruz, and zzso in 1996, 1989, and 1984 zzso In 1997 and 1998, zzso zzso Indiana 1 zzso re-emerged in the western United States after 30 zzso zzso causing these outbreaks grouped within a single genetic lineage distinct from zzso zzso causing outbreaks in the western United States in 1929 and 1956 but closely related to a strain circulating in the state of zzso in central Mexico in zzso Our data showed that sporadic VS outbreaks in the western United States are caused by genetically distinct viral lineages closer to those circulating in zzso areas of central and southern Mexico than to those causing previous outbreaks in the United zzso The genetic evidence and zzso distribution of outbreaks are not consistent with a pattern of long-term maintenance of zzso in the western United zzso
