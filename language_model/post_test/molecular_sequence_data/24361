During zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure on the zzso face of the plasma membrane is associated with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso is generally attributed to an increase in zzso zzso Various zzso zzso such as specific zzso or proteins from the family of zzso resistance zzso and zzso such as zzso zzso zzso have been proposed to participate in this zzso In this study, we used a zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso site of zzso zzso zzso and linked to zzso B, to investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso in whole zzso The zzso penetrated rapidly into the zzso specifically bound to zzso and induced zzso exposure to a similar extent as zzso or zzso but independently of changes in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso with zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso drastically decreased zzso exposure induced by zzso or zzso In large zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso was strictly required for the induction of scrambling of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso In zzso zzso from zzso zzso the zzso also induced zzso of PC and zzso Our data suggest that, in intact zzso zzso acts as a target of zzso zzso including zzso to promote zzso zzso The use of a zzso and fluorescent zzso which binds to zzso is a promising tool to investigate the role of zzso in various cellular zzso
