The zzso zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso components that participate in energy zzso and zzso We have cloned these genes and determined their zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences zzso to proteins with molecular masses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso None of the protein sequences are especially zzso or look as though they zzso to integral membrane zzso a result consistent with other evidence suggesting that the proteins may be peripheral to the zzso possibly mounted onto the zzso body M zzso The zzso zzso which immediately precedes zzso is of unknown zzso it encodes a protein with a deduced molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso profile of zzso indicates that it is likely to be an integral membrane protein with at least one spanning segment, near its N zzso None of the four proteins exhibit consensus zzso signal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso sequences with the zzso ones in zzso coli reveals ranges of similarities of 77 to zzso at the zzso acid level and 75 to zzso at the zzso level, with the majority zzso to zzso of zzso changes being synonymous zzso
