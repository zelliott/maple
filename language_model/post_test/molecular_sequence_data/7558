zzso cardiac abnormalities have been frequently reported in patients with diabetes probably due to zzso consequences of the zzso zzso 2,000 zzso species from the heart of zzso diabetic and control rats were compared by the zzso differential display method, two of eight candidate clones thus isolated zzso and zzso were confirmed by Northern zzso zzso The expression of clone 13 was increased in the heart by zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased in the zzso by twofold zzso zzso zzso in diabetes as compared to zzso zzso analysis showed that clone 13 is a rat zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in the heart with an expression level zzso higher in the diabetic rats than in control zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso in the hearts of diabetic zzso zzso expression was observed in cultured rat zzso but not in zzso smooth muscle cells or in cardiac derived zzso The expression in zzso was regulated by insulin and zzso concentration of culture zzso The full length zzso of zzso had a single zzso frame with 85 and zzso zzso acid identity to human and mouse zzso beta zzso alpha R beta zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso respectively, a key zzso determining the structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso cells zzso core 2 zzso zzso zzso In zzso core 2 zzso activity was increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso in diabetic hearts vs controls, while the zzso zzso and zzso responsible for zzso zzso were zzso These results suggest that core 2 zzso is specifically induced in the heart by diabetes or zzso The induction of this zzso may be responsible for the increase in the deposition of zzso and the abnormal functions found in the hearts of diabetic zzso
