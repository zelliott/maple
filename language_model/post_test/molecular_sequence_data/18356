A differential library enriched in rapidly evolving human zzso sequences was obtained by zzso zzso of human zzso DNA with an excess of zzso zzso A DNA zzso 110 zzso in length that did not zzso to either zzso or other zzso DNA was identified in this zzso It was shown to be a substantially zzso member of the human beta satellite family of tandem zzso The zzso sequences zzso to the zzso were located on the short arms of human zzso zzso by in zzso zzso The zzso zzso failed to zzso with zzso from different human zzso The zzso zzso exhibits a remarkable level of DNA zzso in humans and may be used in the identification of human tissue samples, in the selection of zzso zzso cell hybrids containing human zzso zzso and in the mapping of these zzso
