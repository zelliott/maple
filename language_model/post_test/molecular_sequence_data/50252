We have isolated a zzso clone zzso zzso zzso zzso The clone contains the entire zzso zzso 300 zzso of zzso promoter sequences and several hundred base pairs of 3' zzso zzso The coding region is interrupted by two short zzso but is otherwise identical to zzso zzso zzso Comparisons between zzso four zzso zzso zzso and 3' boundaries suggest a zzso zzso site consensus of zzso and a 3' consensus of zzso We determined the position of the zzso initiation site used in zzso and show that the same site is used in zzso by zzso nuclear zzso zzso analysis of the promoter region shows that the minimal promoter required for efficient expression in zzso is located between zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start zzso Three regions within the promoter are important for zzso in zzso sequences between zzso and zzso the zzso box and the initiation zzso The initiation region is zzso but appears to position the zzso start site relative to the zzso zzso The zzso box is absolutely required for zzso initiation whereas the upstream region stimulates zzso approximately zzso
