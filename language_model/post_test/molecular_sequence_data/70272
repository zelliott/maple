zzso precursor protein zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso may cause death of differentiated zzso and zzso acid zzso a zzso zzso improves zzso zzso zzso we studied the effect of zzso on zzso zzso gene zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso levels by increasing its degradation, without changing the rate of zzso zzso decreased both steady state and zzso zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso These effects of zzso were associated with zzso of cells suggestive of decreased cell zzso or zzso zzso that was completely zzso when zzso was zzso However, zzso zzso levels continued to remain suppressed in zzso that were actively zzso zzso following zzso of zzso In studies carried out zzso 24 zzso zzso did not damage cells as determined by zzso blue zzso zzso zzso zzso and transmission electron zzso The findings suggest that zzso or steady state levels of zzso zzso may not be essential for the survival and growth of zzso and that zzso suppresses zzso expression without causing cell zzso These observations may be a basis for studying whether zzso or a related compound could zzso regulate zzso levels in zzso
