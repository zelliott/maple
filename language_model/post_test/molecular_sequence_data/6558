Early zzso zzso by an initial massive proliferation of zzso cells followed by a sequential differentiation of the various mature neural cell zzso The regulation of these processes by growth factors is poorly zzso We intend to understand, in a zzso biological system, the embryonic chicken zzso the role of the zzso growth factors in zzso We demonstrate the local presence of signaling elements together with a biological response to the zzso zzso at days zzso of embryonic development zzso expressed zzso and zzso growth factor I zzso zzso as well as insulin zzso and zzso type I zzso zzso In parallel with this in zzso gene zzso zzso cultured zzso zzso and released to the medium a metabolically zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso material with a zzso mobility close to that of zzso was found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso chicken zzso human insulin, and human zzso added to E6 cultured zzso showed relatively close zzso stimulating zzso as determined by zzso zzso with a plateau reached at zzso zzso These factors also zzso zzso zzso indicated by the expression of the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso growth factors, interestingly including zzso are present in the developing chicken zzso and appear to play an zzso zzso role in the progression of zzso
