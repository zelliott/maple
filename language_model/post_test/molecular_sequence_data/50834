Nine zzso of human zzso zzso beta zzso have been created and zzso for their ability to assemble with the zzso alpha zzso to zzso at a zzso zzso ratio, a fully competent zzso zzso as judged by the following criteria: 1) the generation of an active zzso form of zzso exhibiting the expected zzso zzso and 2) the enhancement of zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso deletions of 71 and 44 zzso from the zzso end, but not a 7 zzso deletion (including the zzso zzso zzso prevent both zzso of the zzso and, consequently, stimulation of zzso This indicates that zzso located in the zzso sequence is essential for zzso Also a four zzso zzso deletion zzso the zzso zzso and single to zzso zzso of zzso for the zzso zzso clustered in the zzso sequence give rise to zzso that still assemble with the alpha zzso to give a zzso zzso However, in the case of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso assembly with the zzso alpha zzso was not zzso There were also intermediate complexes, free zzso and zzso found to zzso at various positions in the zzso density zzso In comparison to zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show an increased stimulation of the zzso activity supporting the view that these zzso play a crucial role in determining the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso
