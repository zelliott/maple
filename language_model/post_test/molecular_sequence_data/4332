zzso in the zzso zzso zzso locus lead to a zzso zzso zzso that is characterized by an zzso of zzso zzso and a loss of zzso zzso This indicates that the corresponding gene product zzso is involved in the budding of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Here we report the primary structure of three rat zzso of zzso called zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of these genes are expressed in all zzso zzso All zzso share the same domain structure in which an zzso zzso domain is followed by a zzso domain and a zzso zzso On the protein level, zzso are present in all rat zzso tested, with highest protein levels in brain and zzso In the adult rat brain, they are present in soluble and zzso zzso
