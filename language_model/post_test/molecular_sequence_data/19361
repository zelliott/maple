zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is a novel zzso type III zzso zzso zzso that produces zzso from five molecules of zzso On the basis of the crystal structures of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso triple zzso was constructed and shown to produce an zzso novel zzso zzso by sequential zzso of nine molecules of zzso This is the first demonstration of the formation of a zzso by the structurally simple type III zzso A zzso model predicted that the zzso cavity volume of the triple zzso is increased to 4 times that of the zzso zzso
