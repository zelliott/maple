The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated and zzso expressed in tobacco zzso zzso zzso plants using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso transgenic tobacco lines revealed that the zzso were zzso large and fewer in number compared with zzso tobacco zzso The abnormal zzso were less prevalent in guard cells than in zzso zzso zzso and nuclear gene expression was not significantly different in zzso plants relative to zzso tobacco zzso zzso DNA copy number was not affected, based on the relative level of the zzso gene in transgenic zzso zzso tobacco plants zzso zzso zzso were completely normal zzso with respect to growth and development, and also displayed normal zzso electron transport zzso These results show that the zzso zzso gene also functions in a zzso system and confirm the role of the zzso protein in regulation of zzso zzso
