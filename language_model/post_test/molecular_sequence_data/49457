Using a combination of zzso and molecular biology approaches a zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified, which exhibits sequence and structural similarity with two zzso zzso termination factors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso is zzso as a precursor of 410 zzso acids and is imported into zzso giving rise to a mature product of zzso zzso zzso and zzso I protection experiments show that zzso binds two zzso short, zzso sequences of zzso zzso DNA, located at the 3' end of blocks of genes transcribed on opposite zzso The location of the target sequences zzso with that of two of the putative zzso termination sites previously zzso These results indicate that zzso is the termination factor of zzso zzso in zzso The existence of two zzso binding sites might serve not only to stop zzso but also to control the overlapping of a large number of transcripts generated by the peculiar zzso mechanism operating in this zzso
