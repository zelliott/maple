zzso bacteria zzso have a large potential as a microbial sink for the greenhouse gas methane as well as for zzso zzso However, their application in biotechnology has so far been zzso in part due to the relative slow growth rate of the available zzso To enable the availability of novel zzso this study compares the isolation of zzso by conventional dilution zzso with zzso extinction zzso both performed after an initial enrichment zzso The extinction approach rendered 22 zzso zzso from four environmental samples, while no zzso could be isolated by zzso In most cases, extinction zzso immediately yielded zzso zzso making zzso zzso zzso Both type I zzso zzso and type II zzso zzso zzso were zzso The isolated zzso diversity represented at least 11 different strains and several novel species based on zzso zzso gene sequence zzso These strains possessed the particulate zzso and soluble zzso methane zzso zzso Also, zzso of the strains could be linked to a highly active fast-growing mixed zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso extinction zzso was more efficient in rapidly zzso numerous zzso requiring little effort and fewer materials, compared with the more widely applied zzso zzso This zzso approach allowed straightforward isolation and could be very useful for subsequent screening of desired zzso in view of their future zzso zzso
