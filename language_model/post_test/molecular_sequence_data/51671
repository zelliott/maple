zzso libraries constructed from zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were screened for zzso clones zzso the zzso using colony zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso clones from different zzso species revealed a high degree of sequence similarity both at the zzso and at the zzso acid zzso Apparently, the zzso are translated from zzso species of approximately zzso zzso The primary translation products are zzso which are converted into the mature zzso following zzso zzso In the case of the garlic zzso the zzso encodes a zzso zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso of the signal zzso zzso zzso zzso results in a zzso which extends 10 zzso acids before the first zzso acid of the mature protein of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso DNA has shown that the zzso are most probably zzso by a family of closely related zzso which is in good agreement with the sequence zzso found between different zzso zzso clones of one zzso
