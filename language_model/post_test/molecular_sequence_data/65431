The conversion of fatty acid zzso to zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso in zzso In contrast, in the coral zzso zzso a zzso zzso fused to the zzso zzso was found to function as an zzso oxide zzso This work reports the zzso zzso cloning and functional expression of a zzso zzso analogue of the zzso oxide zzso zzso fusion zzso The zzso zzso zzso codes for a protein with zzso sequence identity to the zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that the zzso fusion protein zzso is used by another coral and zzso zzso represents no zzso
