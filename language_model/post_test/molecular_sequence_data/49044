Using zzso analyses of the unfinished malaria zzso zzso we have identified a novel protein of zzso zzso that contains two zzso growth factor zzso zzso near the zzso of the zzso The sequence contains a single open reading frame of zzso with the potential to zzso a protein of zzso zzso containing zzso regions at the extreme zzso and zzso which appear to represent signal zzso and zzso zzso sites, zzso zzso analysis has confirmed that the novel gene is transcribed in asexual stages of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the novel protein are highly specific and do not zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso expressed as zzso fusion zzso zzso to the zzso fragments react with two bands of 80 and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso to the most zzso fusion protein only zzso the zzso band, suggesting that the novel protein may undergo processing in a similar way to zzso and zzso but with fewer zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso samples reveals that the protein is present in zzso zzso and in isolated zzso The protein partitions in the zzso phase after zzso zzso zzso and is zzso to the surfaces of zzso zzso and free zzso in an zzso zzso Based on the accepted nomenclature in the field we now designate this protein zzso We have shown that the zzso fusion proteins are in a zzso that can be zzso by human immune zzso and that there is very limited sequence diversity in an approximately zzso region of zzso encompassing the two zzso zzso A sequence similar to zzso can be identified in the available zzso zzso zzso zzso offering the possibility of zzso whether this novel protein can induce host protective responses in an in zzso zzso
