The zzso zzso or zzso gene sequences of the type strains of 5 species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The sequence analysis revealed that zzso species, whose zzso membrane systems were characteristically zzso composed a sole zzso zzso zzso whose zzso membrane system was zzso was included in the cluster of zzso The zzso zzso of these bacteria zzso to their possessing of the identical types of zzso zzso zzso which is zzso is a right member of the zzso zzso zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are apart from the other zzso bacteria and have the common deletions of 21 bases at the positions zzso to zzso zzso coli zzso zzso It was demonstrated that the zzso character zzso membrane zzso that has been regarded as a generic criterion does not reflect the zzso in the zzso zzso The transfer of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso is zzso
