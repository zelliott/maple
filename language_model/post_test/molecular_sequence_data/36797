zzso containing a zzso base zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were prepared by chemical modification of zzso and zzso zzso The values of zzso were 29 degrees C for zzso and 32 degrees C for zzso In contrast, no melting was observed for zzso and zzso These data show that the stability of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso and that zzso is less stable than zzso This property is consistent with the incorporation specificity of zzso during DNA synthesis in zzso
