Three zzso class zzso synthetic peptides zzso beta zzso I-A beta zzso and I-A alpha zzso were analyzed for their ability to bind to zzso and zzso zzso class II molecules using a whole cell, competitive zzso binding zzso These studies demonstrated that the A beta zzso zzso was able to specifically bind to zzso as well as to four zzso zzso class II zzso The A alpha zzso zzso bound to self zzso class II molecules with a lower relative affinity and was able to bind to three out of the four zzso cells zzso The binding of the three zzso peptides to the self zzso class II was functionally zzso The A beta zzso and A beta zzso peptides inhibited the proliferation of a heat shock protein 60 zzso zzso clone by zzso zzso Interestingly, the A alpha zzso zzso appeared to interact directly with T cells as zzso of the zzso clone with this zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso This phenomenon was analyzed in more detail and it was found that this zzso could behave as a partial zzso zzso of T cells with the A alpha zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso alpha chain expression and induction of zzso zzso In addition T cells zzso with this zzso were rendered zzso to further zzso zzso Thus, a zzso derived from zzso class II may be used in an zzso zzso
