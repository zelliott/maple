zzso the main component of zzso inclusions in zzso is centrally involved in zzso processes preceding zzso body zzso Here we describe a new zzso gene zzso zzso that is situated upstream to zzso 3 and consists of three different zzso A correlation between zzso length and expression of zzso 126 zzso an zzso lacking zzso 3, was detected in the human cerebral zzso Specifically, when compared with the most frequent zzso zzso the shortest zzso stretch zzso was associated with the lowest zzso 126 expression levels, whereas the longest zzso stretch zzso was accompanied by the highest zzso 126 expression zzso Thus, three different zzso zzso with zzso zzso as low zzso 126 expression zzso and zzso zzso as high zzso 126 expression zzso could be zzso zzso zzso zzso were also analyzed in a healthy control zzso zzso variations in this distribution were observed and showed zzso of low zzso 126 expression zzso at ages under 60 years and high zzso 126 expression zzso at ages over 80 zzso To determine human specificity of the variable zzso zzso the mouse zzso gene sequence was zzso Although zzso is very well zzso in zzso the zzso sequence was found to be absent in mice, and an zzso 126 mouse zzso could not be zzso In conclusion, this newly identified zzso zzso is a zzso zzso its length influences zzso 126 expression zzso and, finally, it seems to exert a specific influence on normal zzso
