Sexual zzso drives genetic diversity in zzso zzso and fosters adaptation to novel environmental zzso Although strictly asexual zzso are often considered as evolutionary dead ends, they comprise many devastating plant zzso zzso it remains unknown how such asexual pathogens generate the genetic variation that is required for quick adaptation and evolution in the arms race with their zzso Here, we show that extensive zzso zzso in the strictly asexual plant zzso fungus zzso zzso establish highly dynamic zzso zzso zzso regions that act as a source for genetic variation to mediate zzso We show that such zzso regions are greatly enriched for in zzso zzso genes zzso zzso proteins that enable host zzso The zzso regions occur at the zzso of zzso zzso and are enriched for zzso and other repetitive sequence zzso Our results suggest that asexual pathogens may evolve by prompting zzso zzso enabling rapid development of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can act as a general mechanism for adaptation in zzso zzso zzso
