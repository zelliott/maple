zzso of zzso to proteins is a crucial step in many cellular regulatory mechanisms and contributes to numerous biological zzso including embryonic development, the cell cycle, growth control, and prevention of zzso In these diverse regulatory settings, the most widespread mechanism of zzso action is probably in the context of protein zzso zzso attachment targets many zzso proteins for degradation by the zzso and zzso is often required for zzso plasma membrane proteins by targeting them to the zzso zzso zzso zzso are highly dynamic zzso While an array of zzso directs the zzso of zzso to zzso there are also dozens of zzso zzso zzso that can reverse the zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that zzso are important regulators of the zzso zzso These zzso are responsible for processing inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso removing zzso from cellular zzso and keeping the zzso zzso free of zzso zzso zzso The present review focuses on recent discoveries that have led to a better understanding the mechanisms and zzso roles of this diverse and still poorly understood group of zzso We also discuss briefly some of the zzso that act on zzso protein zzso zzso and compare them to zzso
