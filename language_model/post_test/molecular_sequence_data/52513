A gene zzso zzso an zzso in peas has been cloned as a zzso of zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso including a zzso putative signal zzso The gene product contains a domain zzso in zzso zzso 9) showing zzso zzso acid identity to zzso zzso zzso was accumulated only in the zzso regions of pea zzso although zzso zzso was abundant in both zzso and zzso zzso However, the level of zzso zzso was not increased by the treatment with zzso and zzso in pea zzso These results suggest that the expression of zzso either requires the presence of other factors related to the zzso effect or occurs independent of zzso in the zzso pea zzso
