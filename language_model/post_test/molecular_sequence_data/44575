We have used 600 zzso zzso zzso zzso data to determine the solution structure of a zzso domain of a zzso class II major zzso zzso zzso This domain, zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso geometry and zzso simulated zzso calculations were performed using zzso and zzso zzso zzso which is mostly zzso is more similar to the corresponding region of the class II zzso protein zzso than to the class I zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso lie on the same side of the zzso and face away from the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso implicated in both zzso and zzso zzso is located midway between the surface defined by zzso and zzso that define the inside of the zzso binding groove, allowing for its participation in both types of zzso
