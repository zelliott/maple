We have isolated a cardiac zzso zzso of 5,000 d from zzso zzso from 500 rats and determined its zzso acid zzso The 5,000 d zzso zzso factor was zzso to be a 45 zzso acid zzso with the sequence of zzso zzso by sequencing the native zzso and its zzso zzso zzso The sequence of this zzso was identical to the zzso acid sequence zzso of the rat brain zzso zzso precursor deduced from the complementary DNA zzso zzso The cardiac zzso zzso with a molecular weight of zzso or rat brain zzso zzso was identified as the major storage form and as the sole zzso form derived from the brain zzso zzso precursor in the rat zzso The rat brain zzso zzso level in the atrium was zzso zzso zzso zzso which represents about zzso of that of zzso zzso zzso zzso brain zzso zzso was also detected in the zzso The ratio of brain zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was approximately zzso and much higher than that in the zzso zzso brain zzso zzso however, was not zzso in the zzso We conclude that the 5,000 d cardiac zzso zzso is rat brain zzso zzso with 45 zzso acids derived from the brain zzso zzso precursor and is zzso from the rat heart as a novel cardiac zzso
