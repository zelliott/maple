In zzso bacteria, type II and type III zzso and zzso zzso assembly systems use related outer membrane proteins for zzso transport across the outer zzso We show here that the specificity domain of the zzso zzso outer membrane protein zzso is contained within the 149 zzso zzso acid zzso When the zzso specificity domain is fused to the zzso domain of the related zzso of zzso zzso the zzso construct supports zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso between the two zzso in this zzso construct is poor and is improved by a single zzso acid change in the zzso domain of the zzso In native zzso two zzso acid changes within its specificity domain are both necessary and sufficient to change the specificity from zzso to zzso zzso Analysis of 39 zzso zzso between zzso and the outer membrane protein zzso of the zzso zzso system failed to identify a comparable zzso specificity zzso These results indicate that the two zzso may not function zzso and suggest that zzso and zzso changes of the entire zzso component rather than of an autonomous functional domain are required for specific zzso across the outer zzso
