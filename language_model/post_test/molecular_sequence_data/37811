DNA sequence data from the zzso zzso zzso zzso are used to address zzso relationships among the major lineages of the grass family, with particular emphasis on the highly zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Thirty-five grass sequences representing all six currently recognized major groups of the family and one zzso sequence were analyzed using both zzso and distance zzso The zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso a traditionally isolated zzso zzso is the most zzso lineage in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso is a sister group to the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso is well separated from the zzso zzso The study further confirmed the recognition of two primary groups in the grass family: the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso it also provided further evidence that the traditional zzso zzso is highly zzso and zzso zzso The data support zzso zzso and zzso as the most zzso lineages among the extant zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are confirmed as two zzso zzso but the zzso zzso including only the woody bamboo tribe zzso and the zzso bamboo tribe zzso is relatively zzso zzso The study also indicated that the zzso zzso region sequence data could be useful in zzso analysis at relatively high zzso zzso
