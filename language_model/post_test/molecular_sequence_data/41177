A collection of zzso isolated from zzso of flowers of zzso zzso zzso and associated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso flies in South Africa, contained 28 zzso that could not be assigned to known zzso Comparisons of the zzso zzso of the large zzso zzso gene demonstrated the existence of three separate zzso with an affinity to the zzso zzso and more specifically to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Twenty-six strains that had similar zzso sequences were mixed in all zzso zzso They were found to mate and give rise to large zzso typical of those in the zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate this novel zzso The ecology of this novel zzso species is discussed in relation to its potential plant and insect host zzso The additional two single strains isolated from zzso zzso represent two novel zzso species zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso As these single strains are probably zzso mating types of zzso species, their description is deferred until the species are sufficiently well sampled to permit meaningful zzso
