zzso zzso zzso has an important position in head patterning and zzso channel evolution, in addition to containing a rich source of zzso In the present study, zzso expressed sequence tags zzso from the zzso zzso library of zzso zzso were zzso The initial zzso consisted of 198 clusters and zzso zzso which revealed approximately zzso unique genes in the data zzso Among these zzso we identified several genes related to head and foot zzso zzso zzso channel gene and genes related to biological activities of zzso Five kinds of zzso inhibitor genes were found in zzso for the first time, and some of them were highly expressed with unknown zzso
