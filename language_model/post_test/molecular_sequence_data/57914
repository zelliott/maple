The ten class II zzso zzso are large zzso and zzso proteins that share three zzso sequence zzso Within this class, zzso coli zzso zzso is the only zzso and is comprised of zzso of 875 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that recreate as few as four base pairs of the zzso stem of zzso A zzso 461 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to have full zzso synthesis zzso However, zzso zzso has zzso but reduced, efficiency of charging of zzso when compared to native zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso We show here that, in contrast, the zzso and the native zzso zzso a 12 base pair zzso zzso C stem zzso and a four base pair zzso zzso with the same zzso We also show that zzso zzso makes footprint contacts both on and outside the zzso zzso of bound zzso With one possible exception, the contacts observed with zzso zzso are identical to those seen with the native zzso In spite of contacts outside the zzso zzso zzso zzso charges the native zzso zzso and zzso with similar zzso Thus, all zzso contacts required for zzso for charging are tightly associated with the zzso synthesis domain and, at least in the fragment, are not influenced by additional zzso contacts outside the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
