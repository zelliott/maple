zzso are zzso by zzso a specialized reverse zzso which contains a template in its intrinsic zzso zzso In zzso zzso the repeats zzso by the zzso zzso are 25 zzso zzso in length and uniform in zzso To determine the role of the zzso repeats defining the ends of the zzso zzso zzso zzso template in zzso zzso we have made zzso in and around them and observed their effects on zzso length and the sequence of newly made zzso zzso These template zzso typically result in zzso that are shorter than those of zzso zzso The zzso between the zzso template and the zzso tip that occur after zzso incorporation of the zzso are normally not zzso Instead, the zzso lead to the synthesis of zzso repeats that range in size from 31 to 13 zzso zzso the specificity with which the zzso tip zzso with the zzso is critical for the production of the uniform repeats seen in zzso zzso In addition, the region immediately 3' of the template may play an important role in zzso of the zzso
