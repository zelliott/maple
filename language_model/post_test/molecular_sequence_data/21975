The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that mediates the cellular zzso of zzso and zzso and a variety of zzso It is widely expressed in zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso is exclusively found at the zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying this polarized expression and targeting to the zzso membrane are not zzso We have explored the role of the 36 zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso trafficking and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and various truncated and zzso proteins were expressed in the polarized zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and the cellular distribution of the fusion proteins was assessed using zzso zzso Whereas deletion of the last seven zzso acids zzso did not alter zzso surface zzso deletion of the next zzso zzso or up to 30 terminal zzso acids resulted in impaired zzso expression and distinct zzso of zzso proteins in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of more zzso acids zzso containing zzso motifs led to a rather diffuse zzso distribution zzso zzso introduced at zzso zzso and zzso zzso also caused an impaired surface zzso zzso zzso revealed a higher zzso rate of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our data suggest that a zzso acid stretch zzso and zzso motifs within the zzso tail of zzso are involved in zzso zzso membrane zzso and membrane zzso zzso
