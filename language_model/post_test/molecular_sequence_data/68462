The alternative zzso factor zzso B of zzso zzso is activated during the stationary growth phase by a regulatory network responsive to zzso zzso On the basis of the results reported here, we propose that zzso B controls a general stress zzso that is induced when cells encounter a variety of zzso zzso zzso of genes controlled by zzso B, including the zzso gene and the zzso zzso that codes for zzso B and its associated regulatory zzso was dramatically induced in both the exponential and stationary zzso by environmental challenges known to elicit a general stress zzso After cells were subjected to salt stress, the increased expression of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso genes was entirely dependent on zzso B, and primer extension experiments confirmed that the zzso zzso zzso start site was used during salt induction of zzso zzso zzso Western zzso zzso experiments measuring the levels of zzso B protein indicated that ethanol addition and heat stress also induced zzso B activity during zzso zzso Salt and ethanol induction during zzso growth required zzso the positive regulator of zzso B activity that is normally necessary for activity in zzso zzso However, heat induction of zzso B activity was largely independent of zzso indicating that there are two distinct pathways by which these environmental signals are conveyed to the zzso zzso
