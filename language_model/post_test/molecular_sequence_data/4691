To zzso the mechanism underlying the interaction between the zzso zzso channel and the zzso zzso contribution of the repeat III was studied by constructing zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso cells and the zzso zzso current zzso was zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso of the zzso sequence completely abolished the zzso and stimulation of zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso K zzso whereas mutating zzso to Met in zzso decreased the affinity for zzso zzso without affecting the stimulating effect of Bay K zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso was necessary for the high affinity zzso zzso The zzso block and stimulation of zzso were transferred to the zzso channel by the zzso of two zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso three zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and three zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso channel was zzso zzso by 1 zzso Bay K zzso and blocked by zzso with an zzso value of 60 zzso These results show that zzso of zzso in the zzso sequence results in a zzso zzso channel and that transfer of the high affinity zzso sensitivity requires zzso of eight zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso
