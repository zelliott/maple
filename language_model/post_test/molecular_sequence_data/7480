Two models have been considered to account for the differentiation of gamma delta and alpha beta T cells from a common zzso zzso zzso In one model, zzso cells commit to a lineage before T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso In the other model, zzso cells first undergo zzso of zzso zzso zzso or both zzso and cells that succeed in generating a functional zzso commit to the gamma delta zzso while those that do not proceed to attempt complete beta and subsequently alpha gene zzso A prediction of the latter model is that zzso gamma zzso present in alpha beta T cells will be zzso We tested this hypothesis by examining V gamma zzso gamma zzso gamma 1 zzso which are commonly found in alpha beta T zzso The results indicate that V gamma zzso gamma zzso gamma 1 zzso in zzso alpha beta T cell populations are almost all zzso The low frequency of productive zzso of V gamma 2 in alpha beta T cells is apparently not due to a property of the zzso machinery, because a transgenic zzso zzso in which the V gamma 2 gene zzso a zzso zzso that prevents expression at the protein level, was often rearranged in a productive zzso in alpha beta T zzso The results suggest that zzso cells which undergo productive zzso of their zzso V gamma 2 gene are selectively excluded from the alpha beta T cell zzso
