The zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso a protein zzso with human bone zzso zzso zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso from zzso derived from stage 26 zzso embryonic zzso zzso this zzso was used as a probe to isolate zzso clones by screening of a zzso zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso Two partial clones zzso and zzso were obtained and the missing zzso of the clone 22 was extended by the anchored zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the resulting clone zzso contained an open reading frame coding for a protein with zzso deduced zzso zzso Three sizes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso and early zzso zzso zzso and in hatched zzso zzso but little or no expression was observed in zzso zzso and late zzso zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in normal embryonic zzso
