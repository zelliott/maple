The zzso zzso zzso gene is fused to the zzso gene zzso in human zzso zzso resulting in the generation of a zzso zzso We demonstrate that both zzso and the zzso leukemia fusion protein bind to zzso zzso II through the zzso zzso domain, which is retained in the fusion zzso however, zzso recruits members of the zzso zzso family of zzso factors through its zzso domain, whereas the zzso fusion protein lacks the ability to recruit zzso proteins due to replacement of the zzso domain by the fusion partner zzso In zzso zzso the zzso fusion protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by these zzso zzso proteins zzso and stable expression of the zzso fusion protein in zzso cells alters the zzso profile of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso fusion proteins may lead to cellular abnormalities by interfering with the zzso of important cellular zzso
