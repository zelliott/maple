Starting from zzso zzso zzso derivatives that contain an zzso zzso specifically at the 3rd, 14th, 20th or 26th zzso acid zzso corresponding zzso with a zzso zzso attached to the respective zzso acid zzso were zzso by means of a zzso reaction zzso by an zzso from zzso zzso zzso The use of a zzso zzso and an excess of a zzso donor led to a yield in excess of zzso zzso derivatives containing truncated zzso were also prepared via zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso Using these zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso structure and zzso site on the three-dimensional structure and the biological activity of the zzso were zzso The zzso of the zzso backbone did not change irrespective of the zzso structure or the zzso zzso However, zzso activity, zzso binding activity and the zzso of the derivatives were affected by the zzso and were dependent on both the zzso structure and the zzso zzso Although the larger zzso tended to hinder zzso zzso the zzso altered by zzso appeared to enhance the zzso activity in some cases, and the magnitude of the effect was dependent on the site of zzso
