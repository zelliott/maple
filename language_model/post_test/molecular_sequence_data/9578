There are a large numbers of tandem repeats in zzso which are highly dynamic components in zzso leading to the unstable zzso profiles in zzso zzso The effects of repeated unite B or D deletion on the function of zzso protein was studied to provide theory basis for constructing genetically stable zzso gene with minimal zzso 

We cloned the intact zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso by zzso and constructed the derived genes zzso and zzso with repeated unite B or D deletion respectively by fusion zzso We analyzed the zzso characteristics of zzso in zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso displayed almost the same level of zzso zzso as zzso However, zzso of zzso and zzso especially zzso was more tolerant to pH change and zzso concentration than strain zzso 

zzso repeats regulate the function of zzso zzso zzso of repeated unite B or D, especially D increases the stability of zzso zzso
