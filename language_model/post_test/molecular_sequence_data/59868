In zzso cells, a specific zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is activated in response to inflammatory zzso injury from heat, zzso drugs and zzso or zzso zzso The mechanisms that link these stimuli to zzso of the zzso zzso in different zzso remain to be zzso We have developed and applied a zzso zzso strategy to identify novel genes that are zzso expressed at specific zzso points in zzso We show that one such zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso encodes a zzso zzso sharing similarity with the zzso domain of zzso zzso specifically activates the zzso zzso after zzso into zzso cells, but does not stimulate the zzso or zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso requires a functional zzso zzso domain and zzso signals via the zzso mixed lineage zzso zzso and the known zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore provides an example of a cell zzso input into the zzso zzso The zzso specificity of its expression suggests a potential role in zzso lineage decisions and growth zzso
