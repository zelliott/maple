In this study we analyzed expression patterns of two zzso zzso and zzso in the developing zzso using in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso were mainly detected in the embryonic central nervous system, but each showed a distinct expression zzso zzso message zzso was expressed after zzso post zzso zzso It was found mainly in small clusters of cells in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and scattered cells throughout the spinal zzso of young zzso (24 zzso zzso expression in the zzso was zzso reflecting a zzso organization, which became more evident at 34 zzso As development zzso zzso expression increased throughout the brain, while its expression in the spinal zzso was greatly zzso zzso was also found in the developing zzso and zzso zzso zzso message zzso expression began much earlier zzso zzso than zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso expression was found mainly in the zzso zzso at 24 zzso but its expression in the zzso and spinal cord, confined mainly to zzso regions of the zzso and anterior spinal cord, was more restricted than zzso As development zzso zzso expression was increased both in the brain and spinal zzso detected throughout the brain of two- and three-day old zzso strongly expressed in the zzso and in lateral regions of spinal zzso in two-day old zzso Its expression in the zzso and spinal zzso was reduced in three-day old zzso Our results showed that expression of these two zzso was both zzso and temporally zzso
