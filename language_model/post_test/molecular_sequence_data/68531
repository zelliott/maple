A zzso zzso from rat lung zzso and a related zzso from zzso canine kidney zzso cells have been analyzed with the primary goal of identifying zzso zzso The sequences show that zzso and the dog zzso are zzso of a zzso designated here as zzso and elsewhere as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso domain, a zzso zzso domain, and an intervening domain consisting of 11 repeating elements rich in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The dog zzso has 14 repeating elements in its zzso explaining its larger zzso The sensitivity of the zzso to bacterial zzso allowed us to isolate the zzso domain and show that the zzso zzso was blocked by zzso and, in the accompanying paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that the zzso domain is zzso In addition, we unexpectedly found an zzso zzso resembling zzso type IV zzso that zzso with zzso and slowly zzso the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso for bacterial and tissue zzso even though the zzso is zzso Moreover, the zzso suggests a zzso interaction between zzso zzso and zzso
