In order to obtain a large quantity of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso its zzso host zzso expression plasmids enabling zzso of zzso from zzso zzso were constructed by inserting the zzso gene into zzso zzso coli shuttle zzso zzso zzso zzso a simple zzso zzso containing the coding and the zzso regions of zzso in the shuttle zzso zzso zzso 22 zzso of zzso into the zzso As this level was lower than that of the natural strain zzso zzso we tried to increase the expression level by constructing a series of hybrid plasmids with the following features: zzso the zzso sequence of the alkaline zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso the promoter and the leader sequences of the zzso gene or of alkaline zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the fused zzso of zzso and zzso By using a variety of hybrid zzso the resulting zzso zzso zzso at levels of zzso zzso The zzso zzso isolated from the medium was indistinguishable from the natural one with respect to its zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and Western zzso as well as its zzso zzso
