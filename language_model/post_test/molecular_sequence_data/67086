zzso characterization of the zzso binding region of zzso is of great value in many fields of research, zzso development and clinical zzso Up to now, there is an zzso clinical need to use zzso as diagnostic markers for the prediction of both prognosis and therapeutic zzso To this end, comprehensive but differentiated zzso need to be zzso We have developed a zzso zzso for the diagnosis and zzso mapping of zzso zzso zzso The primary sequence of the human zzso zzso zzso was represented by a library of 251 synthetic zzso The peptides were zzso immobilized in a zzso procedure first by zzso of zzso peptides to zzso zzso and then utilizing a subsequent zzso reaction between the zzso zzso of the zzso and an zzso coated glass zzso The technology was used to map the zzso of seven commercially available zzso zzso zzso specific for the human zzso zzso zzso A previously unknown zzso recognized by zzso zzso was identified at zzso acids zzso zzso through zzso and the zzso recognized by zzso A9 was also localized zzso zzso Previously identified zzso recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso zzso 49 zzso zzso A7 zzso zzso and A10 zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso exhibited excellent performance in single and multiplex zzso analysis and high zzso This technology may have potential as a zzso in zzso diagnostic zzso for the differential analysis of a zzso of zzso involved in the zzso of zzso zzso
