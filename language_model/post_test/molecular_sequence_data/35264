The zzso profile of zzso a key organ of zzso is explored here by employing two widely used zzso techniques, zzso zzso trap and zzso zzso Strong zzso exchange is used for the zzso of peptides and protein search engine MASCOT is employed for data zzso One hundred and thirty six proteins with zzso peptides were identified by zzso trap zzso while 140 proteins with zzso peptides were characterized by zzso zzso Among the total 198 proteins identified in both experiments, 78 proteins were common in both sets of zzso The rest of the 120 proteins were identified distinctly in both zzso strategies, zzso 58 unique proteins were found using the zzso while 62 were found with the zzso zzso Moreover, these proteins were classified into groups based on their functions performed in the zzso zzso presented here identified some important signal and cellular defense proteins inevitable for survival in stressed zzso Additionally, it is also shown that any single zzso strategy is not reliable for good results due to loss of data depending on sensitivity of the instrument zzso
