We have identified an unusual zzso DNA repeat element specific to zzso zzso zzso which we call zzso element zzso The zzso is a common feature in independently isolated zzso and zzso zzso zzso of labeled zzso sequences to zzso DNA, zzso and zzso zzso prepared from zzso zzso indicate that the zzso are reiterated about 500 times per zzso zzso and that one or more can be found as zzso zzso These features and the degree of conservation of zzso suggest a possible role for these zzso
