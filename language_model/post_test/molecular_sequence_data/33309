The zzso powdery zzso fungus zzso zzso releases zzso materials to the surface of zzso infection structures that facilitate zzso them to zzso plant surfaces prior to zzso however, the chemistry of zzso zzso and the mechanism of zzso remain largely zzso zzso sequence tag analysis led to identification of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso is dramatically zzso during the early stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the surface of zzso cell walls, possesses zzso activity against a broad range of zzso and releases zzso and primary fatty alcohols from the zzso wax of wheat zzso Of the zzso wax components released by zzso activity, zzso zzso are the most efficient cues for triggering zzso zzso zzso of wheat leaves with zzso thereby removing leaf surface zzso severely compromises components of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso formation, and secondary zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso activity releases cues from the host surface to promote pathogen development and zzso
