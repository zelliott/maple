Two genes concerned with zzso degradation were found to be closely linked in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso being separated by an zzso region of 75 zzso zzso is shown to zzso a family F zzso of zzso zzso zzso including a putative zzso signal zzso zzso encodes an zzso of 319 zzso zzso with no obvious signal zzso that shows zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso product of zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with a zzso from zzso zzso together, these three zzso define a new family of zzso The activity of the cloned zzso zzso zzso gene product, but not that of the zzso gene product, shows considerable sensitivity to zzso zzso under zzso conditions, the zzso zzso was found to act as an zzso releasing zzso from zzso including zzso zzso and birch wood zzso but was relatively inactive against zzso zzso zzso A high degree of zzso (up to zzso zzso was found with respect to the release of reducing zzso from zzso zzso zzso when zzso was combined with the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso or with zzso from the zzso rumen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso also zzso zzso release from zzso by zzso In zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso may act zzso in the breakdown of zzso
