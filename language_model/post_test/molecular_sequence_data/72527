The precursor primer zzso for zzso zzso DNA zzso replication remains as a persistent R loop formed during zzso through the zzso DNA control zzso We have examined model R zzso which exist in a novel and zzso accurate zzso zzso as potential zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso processing zzso Mouse zzso zzso accurately zzso an R loop containing the mouse zzso DNA zzso The multiple zzso sites on the zzso zzso match the zzso sites observed in zzso suggesting that zzso zzso alone is capable of generating virtually all of the zzso replication zzso
