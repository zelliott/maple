In order to evaluate the genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso the complete zzso protein sequences zzso from seven recent field zzso from Germany, one isolate from the UK and one German vaccine strain were zzso and zzso along with two American zzso and zzso three Asian and 22 Brazilian partial zzso sequences retrieved from zzso The analysis revealed a high degree of zzso zzso at the zzso level and zzso at the zzso acid zzso zzso analysis defined two German zzso one formed by four German zzso and the English, Asian and American zzso and the second, distinct cluster formed by the other three of the seven German zzso zzso The latter cluster was still observed when the 22 partial sequences zzso zzso of the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso from the Brazilian zzso were included in the zzso indicating that the zzso sequence determines the zzso
