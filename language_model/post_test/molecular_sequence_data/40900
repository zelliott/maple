Cancer stem cells zzso have the characteristics of zzso unlimited zzso and initiating new zzso However, the origin of zzso is still zzso zzso a tumor cell line transformed from human fetal zzso stem cells, was established in our previous zzso Whether zzso exist in this zzso cell line remains zzso In the present study, we isolated zzso from zzso cells based on zzso expression using flow zzso and investigated the biological characteristics of zzso zzso cells zzso We observed that the zzso cells grew faster and had a higher capacity of colony formation than the zzso cells and parental zzso cells in zzso In addition, zzso cells had a higher zzso ability than zzso cells in zzso since 1,000 zzso cells were able to form tumors in nude zzso Cell viability zzso revealed that zzso cells were more sensitive to zzso while less to zzso Furthermore, gene expression profile analysis showed that there were zzso zzso expressed genes between zzso and zzso cells, many of which were involved in key cell signaling zzso Taken together, our findings confirm that zzso cells contain a population of zzso that contribute to its zzso and zzso potential, indicating that transformed stem cells could be the source of zzso and targeting this population may lead to more effective tumor zzso
