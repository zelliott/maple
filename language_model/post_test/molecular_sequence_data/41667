Plant zzso zzso zzso are zzso that typically use molecular oxygen to zzso zzso to zzso These commonly cause zzso reactions following tissue damage, and may be important in plant zzso Some zzso function as zzso or in zzso zzso but in most plants their zzso roles are not zzso To better understand the importance of zzso in the plant kingdom, we surveyed zzso gene families in 25 zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and flowering zzso The zzso genes were then analyzed in zzso for gene structure, zzso zzso and targeting zzso 

Many previously zzso zzso genes were zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained 13 zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso max zzso each had 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso contained a highly diversified gene family with 11 zzso zzso but several flowering plants had only a single zzso zzso By contrast, no zzso sequences were identified in several zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that many zzso contained one or two zzso often near the 3' zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso acid sequence analysis using zzso and zzso zzso predicted that several putative zzso are zzso via the zzso pathway, a unique finding as most zzso are predicted to be zzso zzso zzso reconstruction of these sequences revealed that large zzso gene zzso in some species are mostly a consequence of independent bursts of gene duplication, while the lineage leading to zzso must have lost all zzso zzso 

Our survey identified zzso in gene families of varying sizes in all land plants except in the zzso zzso While we found variation in zzso numbers and positions, overall zzso gene structure is zzso with the zzso relationships based on primary sequence zzso The dynamic nature of this gene family zzso zzso from other zzso zzso and is consistent with a protein important for a diversity of functions relating to environmental zzso
