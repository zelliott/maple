The zzso region of the zzso gene which is specifically expressed in rat and mouse zzso contains the zzso sequence closely resembling the zzso consensus zzso zzso responsive element, zzso We used a transient expression zzso to study whether this zzso sequence can transfer zzso responsiveness either to zzso or zzso promoters linked to a reporter zzso zzso We found that the zzso sequence either as an isolated element or in its natural sequence context does not respond to hormone stimulation in zzso and zzso zzso This observation points to the importance of the zzso in a right zzso of zzso for zzso zzso of zzso
