The skins of closely related zzso species produce zzso zzso zzso that have very similar zzso zzso and zzso but differ markedly in their net charge and zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides are zzso and very potent against zzso zzso with no net charge have only zzso zzso We have used ancestral protein reconstruction and zzso analogue design to examine the roles of zzso and zzso interactions in the biological activity and mode of action of functionally divergent zzso zzso The structure and interaction of the peptides with zzso and zzso model zzso were investigated by circular zzso with zzso or zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance with immobilized zzso The results, combined with zzso zzso the zzso of bacterial killing, and membrane zzso zzso reveal that zzso zzso zzso and zzso can all be zzso in an zzso alpha zzso when the zzso is in a membrane zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso fitted to a zzso interaction model zzso to the membrane followed by membrane zzso The first step is governed by zzso interactions between the zzso surface of the zzso zzso and the zzso The strong binding of zzso zzso peptides to zzso zzso is due to the second binding step and involves short-range zzso interactions that prolong the residence time of the zzso zzso The data demonstrate that evolution has positively selected zzso zzso zzso to generate an zzso zzso zzso of neutral zzso peptides that bind to and zzso bacterial cell zzso
