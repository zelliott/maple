A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso wastewater zzso zzso were zzso zzso rods or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew at temperatures between 15 and 50 zzso zzso 40 zzso and between pH zzso and zzso zzso pH zzso It did not require zzso for growth but tolerated it up to 50 g zzso zzso 2 g zzso In the presence of zzso or zzso strain zzso zzso used zzso zzso and zzso as energy zzso Growth was observed on zzso only in the presence of zzso as carbon zzso In the presence of zzso or zzso the end products of zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used as terminal electron zzso but not zzso zzso nitrate or zzso The zzso DNA zzso content of strain zzso zzso was 70 zzso The profile of polar lipids consisted of zzso zzso zzso and four zzso The main fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that strain zzso zzso was affiliated with the family zzso within the class zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso is proposed to be assigned to a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
