zzso are evolutionary zzso zzso proteins thought to facilitate cell zzso movement or fusion by acting as organizers of different signaling zzso Despite their prevalence and zzso their specific role and functions remain largely zzso as their zzso in various organisms has hindered loss of function zzso Here, we take a gain of function approach to study zzso zzso zzso and its effect on zzso zzso We recently characterized a lethal zzso in zzso a zzso gene that encodes a nuclear zzso protein of unknown function, which is accompanied by abnormal differentiation and proliferation of the zzso zzso tissue in zzso A zzso zzso construct carried by zzso transgenic flies was sufficient by itself to abrogate the zzso defects in zzso zzso zzso This rescue correlated with the zzso of zzso a zzso gene zzso in the zzso zzso The suppression of abnormal proliferation by the zzso construct was not restricted to zzso zzso but was also observed in zzso expressing the zzso forms of zzso or Ras zzso However, it had no effect on zzso zzso by a zzso active form of zzso New zzso lines, in which the zzso gene was silenced or deleted from the promoter, no longer rescued the zzso zzso in zzso zzso nor suppressed the activated zzso zzso zzso change in zzso zzso expression has a strong zzso effect on abnormal proliferation and differentiation of zzso in the context of specific zzso such as zzso of the zzso zzso
