A panel of single and double zzso escape zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso selected with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was tested in zzso zzso with zzso zzso raised against zzso strains of different zzso zzso zzso with an zzso acid substitution in zzso region A zzso acids zzso 87 to zzso resulting in a zzso identical or chemically similar to those present at the same positions in zzso zzso zzso at positions 87 for strain zzso and 96 for strain zzso were significantly more sensitive than the parental strains to zzso with zzso against some zzso zzso zzso Also, one zzso zzso zzso zzso acquired zzso by zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso which react with zzso zzso but not with the zzso zzso parental strain zzso zzso studies suggested that the observed zzso by the zzso zzso was due to the zzso containing zzso zzso with the parental strain plus zzso zzso with the zzso on the zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso specific zzso Moreover, zzso zzso with zzso region F zzso 235 to zzso of zzso might also be involved since zzso to zzso zzso was decreased in double zzso carrying an additional zzso which creates a potential zzso site at position zzso Thus, single point zzso can affect the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso strains with both zzso and zzso zzso and may explain the origin of zzso strains with dual zzso specificity based on sequence divergence of zzso
