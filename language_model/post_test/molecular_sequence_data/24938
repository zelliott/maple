zzso protein is an essential replication factor involved in the initiation of DNA zzso A zzso zzso zzso of budding zzso shows a growth arrest at 37 degrees zzso In the present work, we have isolated a zzso zzso strain, which grows at 37 degrees zzso Interestingly, this zzso zzso zzso cell cycle arrest at 14 degrees zzso A novel zzso zzso is identified by zzso zzso of this zzso We called it as zzso zzso of zzso 10 zzso Furthermore, the experiments of transformation show that cells of zzso zzso with zzso zzso but not zzso zzso grow at 14 degrees C, indicating that zzso of zzso can rescue the growth arrest of this zzso zzso at zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso protein may functionally interact with zzso protein and play a role in the regulation of DNA replication and cell cycle zzso
