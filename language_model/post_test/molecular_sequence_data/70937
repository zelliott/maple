The zzso property zzso a zzso protein zzso that appears normally to be zzso to a zzso protein controlling activity and zzso zzso has been zzso We show here that zzso zzso in human zzso cells the expression of zzso an zzso key zzso which is regulated at zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso indicate that zzso binds to the zzso gene zzso To test for zzso zzso ability as a zzso zzso a zzso binding site was cloned in front of indicator zzso The zzso were used to transform a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso fused zzso in this system, zzso zzso in its native zzso failed to activate the zzso zzso The data indicate zzso to affect gene expression at the level of zzso via an indirect as yet unknown mechanism rather than directly as a zzso zzso zzso
