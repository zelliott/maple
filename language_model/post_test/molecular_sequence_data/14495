In this study we report the isolation and characterization of a heat shock protein 70 zzso zzso the zzso gene and two genes that zzso small zzso zzso and zzso from the Australian sheep zzso Lucilia zzso a major agricultural zzso zzso analyses indicate that the zzso protein is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso level of zzso zzso is relatively high at all zzso stages and only moderately induced by heat zzso In contrast, zzso transcripts are present at low levels and strongly induced by heat shock at all zzso The zzso levels of expression and degrees of heat induction of the zzso and zzso transcripts were more variable across the different zzso zzso zzso heat shock factor binding sites were identified in the zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso The isolation of these zzso gene promoters will facilitate zzso or conditional expression of a gene of interest in transgenic zzso
