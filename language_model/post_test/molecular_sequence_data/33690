The gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of the zzso bond of the zzso to give zzso zzso and a zzso zzso a zzso This zzso is zzso in several zzso and its rate of expression is correlated to the degree of aggressiveness of tumors, which makes it a new and attractive therapeutic zzso We describe here its structural characterization in the presence of two zzso zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso to the zzso form of zzso which is used in the zzso This study reveals an important zzso stabilization of the zzso structure of the zzso The original structural features of zzso will be helpful for designing new zzso
