A way to identify zzso subject to positive selection is to detect the signature of selective sweeps in given zzso zzso It is revealed by the departure of DNA zzso patterns from the neutral equilibrium predicted by zzso zzso We surveyed DNA sequence variation in a region formerly identified as causing zzso zzso drive in zzso zzso We found evidence that this system evolved by positive selection at 2 neighboring zzso which thus appear to be required simultaneously for zzso drive to zzso The 2 regions are approximately zzso distant, corresponding to a genetic distance of zzso zzso The presumably large transmission advantage of zzso carrying zzso drive zzso at both zzso has not erased the individual signature of selection at each zzso This zzso zzso combines a high level of linkage zzso between the 2 critical regions with a high zzso zzso As a result, 2 characteristic traits of selective zzso reduction of variation and the departure from selective neutrality in zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso level indicates that, in the natural population from Madagascar used in this study, the selective sweep may be as recent as 100 zzso
