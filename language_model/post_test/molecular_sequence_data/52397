zzso liquid zzso of zzso zzso growth factor zzso results in the appearance of at least four distinguishable zzso The relative areas of these zzso are, in part, dependent upon the zzso time and the zzso Isolation and zzso of each peak gave zzso profiles comparable to that obtained from zzso zzso zzso the temperature above 60 degrees C resulted in a single peak that, when isolated and zzso at ambient temperature, produced a zzso comparable to zzso which had not been exposed to elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso showed that all four zzso had the same molecular mass as zzso and were active as determined by a zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that multiple zzso of zzso are present and we zzso that their appearance may be a result of zzso structures arising from the presence of zzso bonds within the primary structure of the zzso
