The replication of zzso takes place on zzso double membrane zzso zzso originating in the zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are understood to be membrane anchors of the coronavirus replication zzso zzso is localized to the zzso membrane when expressed alone but is recruited into the replication complex in infected zzso It is revealed to contain four zzso regions and its zzso and zzso are exposed to the zzso 

We have determined the crystal structures of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso from zzso strain zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The highly zzso 89 zzso acid region from zzso to zzso is shown to possess a new zzso The zzso zzso structure features two zzso linked by a zzso zzso bond in one zzso zzso The zzso are arranged with their zzso and zzso in opposite zzso to form an zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso did not affect the zzso structure, although the zzso zzso adopts zzso different zzso by crystal zzso with the zzso zzso and parallel zzso of two zzso forming a zzso zzso The zzso zzso exists as a zzso in solution and can zzso easily into zzso in a reducing zzso 

As zzso is exposed in the reducing zzso the zzso of zzso should be zzso This structure may serve as a basis for further functional studies of zzso
