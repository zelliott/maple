A sequence of 91 zzso acids zzso probably starting from the zzso of the mature zzso was determined for the zzso protein of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The last part of this sequence was similar to parts of the zzso portions of two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with intact collagen zzso and gelatin as zzso showed that the zzso protein had zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein also showed activity against a typical zzso zzso zzso and was inhibited by zzso and zzso We conclude that the zzso protein is a zzso
