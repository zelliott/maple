The zzso is a large zzso zzso that plays a role in the generation of peptides for presentation by major zzso complex class I zzso The zzso zzso core of zzso zzso is assembled from a group of 17 protein zzso that generate a distinctive pattern of spots upon two-dimensional gel zzso The genes for most of these zzso have been cloned from humans and zzso We isolated zzso clones for the mouse zzso of ten of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to complete the cloning of all of the mouse zzso Using zzso raised against these zzso or their zzso we verified the identity of these proteins by two-dimensional zzso
