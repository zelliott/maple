zzso growth factor zzso zzso plays a crucial role in many zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to participate in maturation of various zzso and zzso including zzso zzso zzso heart, and zzso Here we establish a novel zzso zzso discovered in a dominant zzso zzso screen for zzso abnormalities using the optical low zzso zzso zzso The underlying mouse zzso line zzso was originally identified because of its significantly reduced lens zzso zzso studies located zzso to zzso 14 within a zzso zzso spanning zzso containing the zzso candidate genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso While no sequence differences were found in zzso and zzso we identified an zzso zzso zzso at zzso position 770 of the zzso gene leading to an zzso zzso acid zzso In contrast to previously described zzso zzso zzso carriers were fully viable and did not reveal reduced zzso zzso sexual reversal or skeletal zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso as well as its basic functional characterization by zzso zzso did not show any zzso However, the analysis of zzso response of the zzso zzso in a virtual drum indicated a zzso dependent vision loss of almost zzso The smaller zzso in zzso suggested a role of zzso during lens zzso zzso investigations showed that lens growth zzso starts during zzso and continues after zzso Young zzso zzso remained transparent but developed age-related zzso Taken together, zzso is a novel zzso zzso that zzso zzso and reduced vision without effects on zzso and zzso outside the zzso Our data point to a role of zzso zzso in primary and secondary lens fiber cell zzso The results underline the importance of zzso series to fully understand multiple functions of a zzso
