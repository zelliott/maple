Using fusion zzso expression of zzso human zzso growth factor 18 zzso in zzso cells and zzso coli has been extensively used for fundamental research and clinical applications, including zzso and zzso hair growth, and zzso However, high-level zzso expression is difficult and the products are often not zzso Furthermore, zzso protein has higher zzso and lower zzso and the removal of the fused tag is zzso To overcome the limitations of zzso expression of protein and to prepare soluble highly zzso zzso we have developed a rapid and efficient expression zzso zzso zzso gene was amplified by zzso chain reaction and cloned into zzso and zzso zzso then transformed into zzso coli strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso The best combination of zzso and host strain was selected, and only zzso zzso was screened for high-level expressed zzso Under optimal conditions in a zzso zzso the average bacterial yield and expression level of zzso of three batches were more than zzso and zzso respectively, after treatment with zzso zzso for zzso at zzso The target protein was zzso by CM zzso zzso and zzso affinity zzso The purity of zzso was shown by zzso to be higher than zzso and the yield was zzso In zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso could stimulate significant proliferation of zzso cells, and animal experiments showed that zzso could effectively regulate hair zzso In conclusion, this may be a better method of producing zzso to meet the increasing demand in its pharmacological zzso
