The function of zzso zzso response elements zzso may be classified into two classes according to the location of the zzso in the zzso II zzso promoter: located upstream of the core promoter, or located within the core zzso Thus, the zzso factors zzso can serve as zzso zzso factors that activate zzso gene zzso and they can participate in zzso complex zzso In the zzso and human zzso zzso genes the zzso is located within the core promoter zzso For this reason, it is important to isolate zzso zzso protein factors that can bind to this zzso and determine their functional roles in the regulation of expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have isolated three groups of zzso that zzso zzso Here we report on clone 38 zzso which contains an open reading frame zzso a protein of 277 zzso acids that is designated zzso The C zzso of zzso is extremely zzso and contains a high percentage of zzso zzso zzso zzso shares marked similarity with some gene products of the zzso group of zzso These gene products are potent zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso
