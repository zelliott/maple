The zzso zzso zzso is associated with increased plasma zzso levels and risk of zzso The mechanism by which this zzso leads to increased zzso expression is as yet unclear and still the subject of zzso 

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the zzso zzso on zzso and protein zzso 

We made a set of zzso containing the zzso zzso region, the zzso zzso reporter gene and the zzso zzso downstream zzso The latter element contained either the zzso or A zzso and was inserted either as a single unit zzso zzso and zzso or in tandem zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso followed by zzso of the products and determination of the ratio of zzso zzso zzso sequencing was used for determination of the actual site of zzso in zzso from zzso zzso and A1 and from zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells and human liver zzso 

The A1 zzso expressed zzso more protein than the zzso zzso The double zzso expressed zzso more protein zzso zzso zzso Similar results were found in a set of zzso in which an zzso promoter replaced the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso site usage zzso as ratio zzso site 1 and 2) for the tandem zzso were similar for zzso with two zzso or As at both zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratios were zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso with different zzso sites, indicating that the zzso with the zzso zzso is favored over the normal zzso In zzso zzso the G at zzso was the last zzso zzso in the majority of zzso whereas in most zzso zzso the last zzso zzso was the C at zzso Over zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells and human liver tissue is zzso at position zzso 

The zzso zzso has a more effective zzso site, leading to increased zzso and protein zzso irrespective of the promoter and zzso It does not affect the position of zzso zzso
