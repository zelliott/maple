Previous zzso acid zzso at the zzso domain of the zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso suggested that the location of the substitution relative to the zzso interface and perhaps to the zzso pore can be critical to the channel gating mechanism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Butler, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hung, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 35, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso Hung, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we introduce zzso zzso at 12 positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso along this zzso zzso segment zzso so that we can examine functional consequences on channel zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were almost the same as that of the wild type, whereas other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had relatively lower expression levels compared to that of the wild type as measured by zzso zzso binding zzso Two positions zzso and zzso had less than zzso of the wild type expression zzso zzso gave no zzso zzso binding on the surface of zzso suggesting that this position might be involved in the zzso zzso zzso or transport to the cell zzso The zzso zzso exhibited a significant increase in the open channel probability with a moderate increase in the zzso response at higher zzso zzso very likely due to channel zzso The zzso for the zzso of zzso assembly and zzso channel function seems to favor a potential zzso zzso zzso that have lower levels of expression are clustered on one side of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that display normal expression and functional activity have been shown previously to face the membrane lipids by independent labeling zzso The functional analysis of these zzso will be presented and discussed in terms of possible structural zzso
