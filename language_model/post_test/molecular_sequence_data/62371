A previously isolated zzso zzso zzso was used to detect its host cell, zzso coli zzso The zzso small outer zzso zzso protein was used as a platform to present a marker zzso green fluorescent protein zzso on the zzso zzso The DNA zzso around zzso was amplified by zzso and zzso The gene alignment of zzso and its upstream region was zzso which is the same as that for zzso zzso zzso was introduced into the zzso and zzso regions of zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Fusion of zzso to zzso did not change the host range of zzso On the contrary, the binding affinity of the zzso zzso to the host cell zzso However, the stability of the zzso zzso in alkaline solution zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso coli cell surface enabled zzso of cells under a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not only zzso on zzso zzso coli cells but also on viable but zzso or pasteurized zzso The coexistence of insensitive zzso coli K-12 zzso cells did not influence the specificity and affinity of zzso zzso zzso on zzso coli zzso After a zzso incubation with zzso zzso zzso at a zzso of infection of 1,000 at 4 degrees C, zzso coli zzso cells could be zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso could be a rapid and sensitive tool for zzso coli zzso zzso
