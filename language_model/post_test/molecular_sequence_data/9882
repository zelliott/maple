We have developed a code generating language, called zzso zzso for the production and subsequent manipulation of complex dynamic programming methods for biological sequence zzso From a relatively simple text definition file zzso will produce a variety of zzso of a dynamic programming method, including database searches and linear space zzso The speed of the generated code is comparable to hand written code, and the additional flexibility has proved invaluable in designing and testing new zzso An innovation is a flexible zzso system, which can be used to zzso the original sequences with biological zzso We illustrate the zzso syntax and flexibility by showing definitions for dynamic programming routines zzso to align two protein sequences under the assumption that they are both zzso zzso zzso with the simultaneous assignment of zzso zzso and zzso to align protein information to zzso DNA, allowing for zzso and sequencing zzso
