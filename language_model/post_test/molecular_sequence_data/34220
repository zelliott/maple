zzso zzso zzso in budding zzso embraces multiple zzso targets grouped into zzso defined by their genetic requirements for zzso optional zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso modifications zzso zzso Here, we genetically zzso a complete zzso zzso zzso by the criterion of zzso bypass of the requirement for the governing zzso regulators to execute zzso We thereby show that the zzso and zzso zzso embrace four essential zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Whereas zzso also regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso is not needed for zzso by zzso zzso Our results show that there are no essential zzso zzso missing from the known roster of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is composed of three zzso zzso flanked by zzso leader and zzso tail zzso We find that the zzso and zzso zzso and their putative zzso sites, are essential for zzso zzso whereas the leader, tail, and zzso zzso are zzso
