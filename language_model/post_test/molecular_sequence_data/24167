Beyond the rewards of plant zzso analysis and gene zzso zzso of protein activities, zzso modifications and protein complex composition remains a challenge for plant zzso zzso methods should allow rapid isolation of proteins from plant material achieving a high degree of zzso We tested three zzso strategies based on the zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity tags for enrichment of a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and a soluble zzso At zzso from leaf zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso to almost complete zzso in less than 60 zzso and was directly suitable for zzso or zzso zzso allowing the identification of in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso via zzso tag yielded partially zzso protein of low zzso At zzso could be isolated after transient expression from zzso zzso or from transgenic zzso zzso as either zzso or zzso zzso While zzso zzso achieved similar yield and high purity as the zzso strategy, it was considerably easier and zzso Using either tagging strategy, a protein was zzso with At zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso leaf zzso suggesting that both the zzso and TAP tags are suitable for zzso of protein complexes from plant zzso We propose that the zzso zzso in particular, may serve as a generally zzso tag to further our understanding of protein functions, zzso modifications and interaction dynamics in zzso
