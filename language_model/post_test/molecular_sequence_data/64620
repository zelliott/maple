The zzso for two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso from the zzso zzso blood fluke zzso zzso One of these encodes a putative zzso zzso named zzso whilst the second encodes a potential zzso zzso zzso These zzso possess the key structural features common to all zzso but they are unusual in that they have very large zzso zzso spanning zzso and zzso Overall, the zzso and zzso proteins share 37% identity and zzso zzso but excluding the zzso of the zzso domain this rises to zzso identity and zzso zzso zzso comparisons with other zzso zzso indicate that both zzso are most similar to the zzso zzso zzso identified in insects and zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Outside of the zzso domain, zzso and zzso respectively, of the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso in the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that the zzso share a common lineage with members of the zzso group as well as zzso and zzso zzso studies revealed distinct and zzso patterns of distribution for zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso was zzso within the zzso and on discrete cell bodies within the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was zzso exclusively to the surface zzso suggesting it may contribute to the regulatory zzso we have zzso zzso In zzso zzso expression studies, zzso did not form functional channels on its own or in combination with zzso or the chick zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso in which the zzso domain of zzso was replaced with that of chick zzso was also zzso We discuss our findings in the context of the proposed role for surface zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso in the zzso and the potential exploitation of these receptors as targets for zzso zzso
