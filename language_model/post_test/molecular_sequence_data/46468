Old yellow zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso that catalyze the zzso zzso of the double bond, representing a promising alternative to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by 28 zzso zzso belonging to 16 different species was zzso Growing cells of most of the strains reduced zzso via zzso and showed high zzso producing zzso as major zzso Competition by zzso zzso zzso activity was observed in several zzso The best performing zzso belong to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited yields of zzso zzso up to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the sole strain lacking the zzso zzso reduced zzso only to zzso alcohols via zzso Nine zzso zzso genes were zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso a zzso that showed negligible zzso and zzso zzso Compared with the corresponding zzso zzso growing cells of the zzso strains zzso zzso with improved yields of zzso products, minor competition by zzso activity, and lower zzso In particular, resting cells of zzso zzso zzso presented the best performance in zzso zzso Based on the results zzso reported, selected strains of zzso zzso and novel zzso genes can be zzso used as innovative zzso in zzso zzso
