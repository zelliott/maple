We isolated zzso clones zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso from a salmon zzso zzso zzso library prepared from the zzso In the zzso sequence combined, an open reading frame coding for a protein of zzso zzso was zzso The deduced sequence showed a considerable similarity zzso to that of red sea zzso zzso By comparison of sequence similarity to other zzso the structure of salmon zzso was like tissue type zzso rather than zzso type or plasma type zzso As a structural feature of salmon zzso 3 zzso zzso were zzso in the 25 zzso sequence around the active site zzso zzso which is zzso among several tissue type zzso The critical zzso thought to form the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in the highly zzso region, but the region surrounding zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso interactions of active center domain, was less similar to other zzso except for red sea zzso zzso These finding suggests that the overall structure of fish zzso resembles zzso zzso but has some unique zzso
