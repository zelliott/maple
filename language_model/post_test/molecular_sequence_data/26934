Due to instability of zzso motif triplex zzso acid under zzso pH and low zzso zzso zzso stabilization of the triplex under the zzso condition is crucial in improving its therapeutic potential to artificially control gene expression in zzso To this end, we investigated the zzso and kinetic effects of zzso zzso modification of zzso zzso zzso on the triplex formation under the zzso zzso The zzso analyses indicated that the zzso modification of zzso not only significantly increased the zzso stability of the triplex but also increased the binding constant for the triplex formation by nearly 2 orders of zzso The consideration of the observed zzso parameters suggested that the increased rigidity of the zzso zzso in the free state relative to the corresponding unmodified zzso may enable the significant increase in the binding zzso zzso data demonstrated that the observed increase in the binding constant resulted from the considerable increase in the association rate constant rather than the decrease in the zzso rate zzso This information will be valuable for designing novel chemically modified zzso with higher binding affinity in the triplex formation under zzso conditions, leading to progress in therapeutic applications of the zzso strategy in zzso
