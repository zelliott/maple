zzso of zzso zzso known zzso zzso zzso sites were used to confirm the presence of the zzso in DNA isolated from zzso zzso zzso It was expected that the zzso chain reaction products derived from the zzso template would be larger than those from the zzso zzso template due to the presence of the zzso zzso Instead, it was observed that the zzso template yielded a product of almost the same size as that yielded by zzso zzso We present evidence to indicate that the zzso product from the zzso template is a direct result of secondary structure of the template resulting from an zzso repeat sequence present in the zzso zzso
