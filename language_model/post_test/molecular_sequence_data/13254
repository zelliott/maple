The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso factor and is altered by zzso arrangements in its zzso zzso region in approximately zzso of diffuse zzso zzso zzso We report here that, in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in other tumor types, the zzso gene is also altered by multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso often zzso zzso zzso in its zzso zzso zzso These zzso are of zzso origin and are found in cases displaying either normal or rearranged zzso zzso indicating their independence from zzso zzso and linkage to zzso zzso These zzso identify a mechanism of genetic instability in zzso B cells and may have been selected during zzso for their role in altering zzso zzso
