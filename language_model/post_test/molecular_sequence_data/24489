A survey is presented on the last 50 years of zzso R & D activities in the Institute for Drug Research, zzso In the 1950s and 1960s this Institute played an important role in the industry of antibiotics in Hungary, contributing to the development of manufacturing processes for zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the late 1950s a microbial screening program was zzso which led to the discovery of several new antibiotics and the isolation of zzso producing medically important, known antibiotics and other zzso agents of microbial origin from natural zzso In the 1970s and 1980s the zzso research group elaborated new industrial processes for the production of several zzso zzso such as zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso B and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In the last 15 years new processes have been developed for manufacturing the zzso zzso A and zzso acid and the zzso agents zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso a zzso zzso Research on steroid zzso has also been continued from the mid 1950s up to zzso In the early 1960s manufacturing processes were developed for the zzso zzso and the anabolic drug zzso The results on microbial transformations zzso reduction, zzso were zzso in the synthesis of contraceptive zzso Since the mid 1960s several new microbial processes have been discovered for the selective side chain zzso of natural zzso resulting in various key zzso for the synthesis of a wide variety of steroid zzso
