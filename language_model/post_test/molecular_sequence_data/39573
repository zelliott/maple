To investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on differentiation of zzso stem cells zzso into zzso related cells and probe into the possibility that zzso affects zzso zzso 

Mini zzso zzso was used to purify human zzso cells from zzso cell zzso the purity of the zzso cells was evaluated by flow zzso Alpha fetal zzso in cultured zzso cells and their zzso were measured with zzso zzso Liver tissue markers on zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso Western zzso zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso on zzso zzso Nest zzso was used to measure the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso cells, the product of zzso was chosen to measure the zzso 

zzso showed that human zzso cell contained zzso and zzso but no zzso zzso When human zzso cells were cultured with zzso for 14 days, the concentration of zzso within zzso cells was decreased from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso revealed that zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso faded, compared to that of zzso Both human zzso blood zzso and zzso cells expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso the sequence of the product of nest zzso for zzso matched completely with the sequence of zzso in zzso 

Human zzso blood zzso cells have been note to express zzso related markers such as zzso and zzso although there is no evidence of zzso zzso These findings suggests the possibility that human zzso could be zzso into zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso on human zzso cells depressed by zzso indicate that zzso might inhibit the zzso of zzso
