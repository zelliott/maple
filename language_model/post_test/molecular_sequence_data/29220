The zzso genes directing the synthesis of zzso zzso the main zzso acid in zzso zzso strain zzso were zzso They are organized in two zzso transcribed zzso zzso and zzso as are the tag genes specifying zzso zzso synthesis in zzso zzso zzso The features of the zzso genes as well as the putative participation of their products in the proposed zzso zzso of zzso zzso are zzso The zzso and zzso zzso which are most likely involved in the synthesis of the linkage unit (the entity zzso zzso acid to zzso are separated by 508 zzso zzso of the outer segments of this regulatory region are similar to the two divergent promoter regions identified upstream of the zzso and zzso genes in strain zzso However, in zzso these regions, which also included functional zzso are separated by an additional DNA segment of about 100 zzso on which two new zzso starts, one in each direction, were zzso The regulatory regions of zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and eight strains of zzso zzso were cloned and zzso In four zzso zzso strains and in zzso zzso their length and sequence are similar to the regulatory region of zzso In the others, including zzso zzso they are of the zzso Analysis of zzso sequences of a zzso zzso hole, present in the tag region of strain zzso revealed higher similarities to zzso than to tag zzso This suggests that at least part of the tag genes specifying the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso in strain zzso was introduced by horizontal gene transfer into a strain originally zzso a zzso zzso zzso
