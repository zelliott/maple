We have studied the zzso of zzso through a zzso zzso zzso zzso transcribes the first approximately 25 zzso of zzso DNA zzso but then hits a barrier and continues slowly to the zzso zzso zzso Here, the barrier disappears and the transcript is completed at a rapid rate, as if on free DNA, indicating that zzso zzso transfer is completed as zzso reaches the zzso If DNA behind the zzso is removed during transcription, the barrier does not appear until the zzso has penetrated up to 15 zzso farther into the zzso On a longer template, the barrier is almost zzso We have shown previously that the zzso is transferred around the zzso zzso via an intermediate containing an zzso DNA zzso Our results exclude the possibility that zzso has difficulty breaking zzso contacts and suggest instead that zzso pauses because it has difficulty zzso DNA in the zzso
