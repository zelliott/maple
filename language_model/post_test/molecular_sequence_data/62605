In zzso the late zzso domain has been defined as a zzso motif in the zzso zzso precursor that, when zzso leads to the emergence of virus particles that fail to pinch off from the plasma zzso These zzso have been observed to contain the zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso which include bovine leukemia virus zzso and human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso and zzso have a zzso zzso motif in the zzso region of the zzso zzso domain of zzso while zzso also encodes a zzso motif in zzso In this study, we analyzed the roles of the zzso and zzso motifs in the C zzso of MA in zzso particle zzso zzso of either motif zzso zzso changed to zzso or zzso changed to zzso reduced budding zzso zzso buds and zzso regions of plasma membrane were observed by electron zzso When the locations of zzso and zzso were zzso particle release was zzso zzso the replacement of the zzso motif with either the zzso or zzso motifs did not influence the release of virus zzso but the replacement of the zzso motif with either zzso or zzso eliminated particle zzso This indicates that the role that zzso plays in zzso budding cannot be replaced with either zzso or zzso A similar observation was made with the zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso particle release was found to be sensitive to zzso zzso implicating a role for zzso in zzso zzso In zzso our observations indicate that zzso the zzso motif plays a crucial role in virus budding and zzso the zzso motif plays a more subtle role in zzso particle zzso Each of these motifs may play an important role in virus release from specific cell types and therefore be important in efficient virus spread and zzso
