The zzso zzso receptors zzso are members of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso These zzso zzso factors are implicated in the regulation of zzso metabolism and zzso differentiation and in the regulation of zzso zzso In order to bind to DNA and activate zzso zzso requires the formation of zzso with the zzso X zzso zzso We have previously reported that replacement of a single zzso by an zzso at position 433 of zzso alpha zzso located in a highly zzso region of the ninth zzso repeat of a zzso motif in the zzso binding domain, abolished zzso of zzso with zzso and hence its zzso zzso The aim of our present work was to investigate if other zzso zzso acids of the zzso binding domain are important for zzso of zzso with zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso motif of zzso zzso as well as a highly zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain are necessary for zzso with zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso acids within the zzso motif do not affect zzso zzso Surprisingly, we found that some zzso deficient in zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso were still functional on specific zzso zzso response elements zzso Both zzso could zzso on a zzso from the zzso zzso promoter zzso whereas only the zzso zzso zzso could zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and, when zzso with the zzso zzso zzso also from the zzso zzso zzso We therefore zzso either that: zzso these zzso might be able to zzso with a protein other than zzso and the affinity for this novel partner may depend on the nature of the zzso and to some degree on the choice of the zzso or zzso zzso that additional nuclear proteins might compensate in zzso for the decreased binding of zzso to these zzso zzso observed in zzso
