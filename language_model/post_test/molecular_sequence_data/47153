zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are characterized by the possession of a zzso island designated the zzso island zzso This zzso to zzso island carries an iron zzso system named the zzso zzso While the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are subject to zzso spontaneous deletion from the zzso we were initially unable to obtain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, using a positive selection strategy, we identified three zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso In these three independent zzso the zzso deletion was not limited to the zzso but zzso a larger DNA zzso of approximately 140 zzso Loss of this fragment, which occurred at a frequency of approximately 5 zzso zzso resulted in the disappearance of several zzso traits, such as growth in a minimal zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso and in a decreased zzso for zzso However, no precise zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso To gain more insight into the molecular basis for this phenomenon, the putative machinery of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was analyzed and compared to that in zzso zzso We show that the probable reasons for failure of precise zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso are zzso the interruption of the zzso zzso gene located close to its right-hand boundary by a premature stop zzso and zzso lack of conservation of zzso zzso sequences at both zzso of the zzso These zzso may represent a process of zzso stabilization in the species zzso zzso
