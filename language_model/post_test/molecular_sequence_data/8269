This study examined zzso zzso dynamics in the zzso of male obese rats zzso treated for two weeks with a zzso low dose of 17 zzso compared with zzso zzso An increased binding capacity for zzso 17 zzso in the zzso consistent with binding to the zzso zzso was demonstrated in treated males relative to control males zzso zzso zzso These observations were confirmed using zzso techniques with zzso analysis, ammonium zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso techniques to isolate the zzso binding from other interfering zzso Increased zzso nuclear zzso zzso levels in treated males zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that the liver was under zzso zzso This interpretation was supported by an increase in serum zzso levels, reflecting increased very low density zzso zzso by the zzso zzso in testosterone levels and in the weights of seminal zzso and the zzso in treated males indicated zzso effects on zzso An interpretation of increased synthesis of zzso zzso with 17 zzso treatment was supported by the observation of an increase in the zzso for zzso zzso Taken together, these observations indicate that zzso zzso 17 zzso treatment zzso zzso action in the zzso of male rats and also increases zzso zzso zzso probably zzso via an increase in its zzso
