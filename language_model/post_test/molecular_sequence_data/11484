zzso zzso contains single zzso zzso zzso zzso that functions in the signal zzso zzso conducting the cell's mating zzso To understand the zzso basis of zzso zzso zzso we have zzso the zzso protein and compared the major zzso zzso with those of zzso protein from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein showed a remarkably high zzso value for zzso binding zzso zzso and for binding with zzso In contrast, the zzso value for zzso binding and the rate of zzso activity were 64 zzso and 77 zzso zzso zzso at 37 degrees C, zzso both were higher than normal zzso zzso but at the same level as the zzso zzso We directly measured rate of zzso binding and zzso binding which were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at 30 degrees C, zzso On the other hand, exchange rates between bound and free zzso remained almost constant throughout the tested combination of zzso and zzso and were zzso lower than the binding zzso These results suggest that the release of the zzso zzso is the zzso step in the zzso zzso As a whole, the zzso properties of the zzso protein are close to those of the zzso zzso although these two proteins function differently in the signal zzso zzso in the zzso
