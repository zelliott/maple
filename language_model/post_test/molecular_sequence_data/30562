zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso were identified using synthetic zzso zzso based on partial zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso peptides of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is predicted to contain zzso zzso acid zzso and to have a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso sequence similarity was found between parts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the similarity of the reaction mechanisms of the two zzso we propose a function for the similar zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in liver, heart, and zzso zzso zzso and, to a much lesser extent, in brain, small zzso and zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso zzso is increased zzso in rat liver by feeding a diet high in zzso or fat, consistent with the zzso significance of the zzso in fatty acid zzso
