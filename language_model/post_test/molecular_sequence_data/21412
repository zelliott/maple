zzso amplification can drive zzso instability zzso which is a major source of tumor zzso The present study aimed to investigate the impact of nuclear factor zzso B zzso on zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso was performed to display zzso zzso was used as an inhibitor of zzso to assess the zzso of zzso amplification, and zzso zzso 2 zzso ensuring cell cycle cycle coordination with zzso cycle was detected by Western zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso of the zzso promoter was analyzed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso including a series of truncated zzso promoters and site zzso was carried out to determine zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift and zzso zzso zzso were applied to confirm whether zzso indeed binds to the zzso region of the zzso zzso To reveal the clinical significance of zzso expression in zzso zzso cell cancer, zzso and protein levels were assessed by zzso and Western zzso zzso We found that the zzso factor zzso plays a role in zzso amplification in zzso zzso zzso amplification is reduced by zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, expression of the zzso zzso of zzso is sufficient to promote zzso amplification and increase in zzso protein zzso We further identified a functional zzso binding site located in the zzso zzso Single zzso of the zzso site III zzso zzso however resulted in zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso shift zzso and zzso zzso results suggest that zzso indeed binds to this responsive element zzso with zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso results revealed that both zzso and protein levels of zzso were significantly higher in tumor zzso than those in paired adjacent normal zzso zzso
