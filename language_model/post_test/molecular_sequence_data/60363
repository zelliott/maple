A new DNA repair gene from zzso zzso with zzso to zzso was identified and zzso Comparative analysis showed highest similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a predicted zzso protein with an zzso of zzso The zzso zzso was highly sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso radiation zzso and, to a lesser degree, zzso These zzso were enhanced at low temperatures, similar to deletions in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Many zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso and an increased DNA zzso The zzso zzso showed minor deficiencies in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso efficiency and spore viability were significantly zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso acts in one DNA repair zzso with zzso and zzso zzso of the budding zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso is in a different zzso group for repair of zzso zzso or zzso DNA damage than is zzso a putative zzso zzso of zzso zzso The structural and functional similarity suggests that zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene and we propose that the functional diversification of zzso genes in budding zzso is zzso zzso
