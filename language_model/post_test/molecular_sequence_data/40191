zzso cell zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein having zzso zzso and zzso zzso Originally isolated as a zzso promoting the differentiation of B cell zzso it was recently suggested to act as an insulin analog via the insulin zzso Here, we describe the first crystal structure of zzso in three different zzso zzso and in complex with either zzso zzso zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso which was developed as an zzso agent, interferes with zzso zzso showing a particularly high specificity for zzso The crystal structures of the complexes with either zzso or zzso show that the zzso active site of zzso is zzso for zzso binding and that the zzso site is important for zzso by zzso Interestingly, zzso mimics insulin signaling by binding to the insulin zzso with an affinity similar to that of insulin and does not share the binding site with insulin on the insulin zzso To predict binding sites, the potential interaction patches of zzso and the zzso domain of insulin zzso were generated and zzso Although the relationship between the zzso property and the zzso function of zzso has not been clearly established, our structures raise the intriguing possibility that the zzso metabolism and the zzso zzso are linked by zzso
