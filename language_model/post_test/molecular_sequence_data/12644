The X-ray structure of the zzso protein bound to DNA containing the zzso recognition sequence has been refined at zzso zzso The zzso interactions between the basic domain and DNA are revealed, and combined with a more accurate description of the direct zzso further clarify how binding specificity is zzso Water molecules extend the interactions of both zzso basic domain zzso zzso 235 and zzso zzso beyond their direct base zzso The slight zzso of the basic domain zzso around the DNA zzso the linking of zzso zzso 243 and 245 to zzso zzso oxygen atoms via water zzso apparently stabilizing interactions with the zzso
