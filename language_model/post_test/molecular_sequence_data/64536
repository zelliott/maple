Three point zzso zzso zzso and zzso distinguish the sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso assumed to be responsible for zzso zzso resistance in the zzso strain of zzso zzso To determine the impact of each zzso on the function of zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was expressed in zzso coli as well as three zzso carrying a single zzso the double zzso zzso and the triple zzso zzso All zzso zzso were less stable than the zzso zzso Two activities enhanced in the zzso strain were measured with all zzso zzso namely testosterone zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso at the zzso position with little quantitative variation among the zzso In contrast, metabolism of zzso was strongly affected by the zzso The zzso zzso had an enhanced metabolism of zzso producing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The apparent affinity of the zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and testosterone was not significantly different as revealed by the type I difference zzso zzso alignments with zzso provided clues to the positions of the zzso acids zzso in zzso These zzso were found zzso clustered in the vicinity of the zzso end of zzso I relative to the zzso recognition zzso Thus this area, including zzso J, is important for the structure and activity of zzso Furthermore, we show here that point zzso in a zzso zzso can have a prominent role in zzso zzso
