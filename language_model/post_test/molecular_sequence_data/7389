zzso zzso to zzso of persons in the general population are zzso for a zzso zzso defective form of zzso zzso However, only a small percentage zzso to zzso of all zzso zzso develop type III zzso zzso with other genetic and environmental factors are required for the expression of this zzso zzso We sought to investigate the possible role of zzso gene zzso in the development of zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso As a first step, we performed DNA sequence analysis of all 10 zzso coding zzso in 2 patients with the zzso zzso who had type III zzso and identified a single zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 6 of the zzso zzso The zzso was then found in 5 of 18 patients with type III zzso who had the zzso zzso zzso frequency zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and 6 of 22 zzso zzso zzso patients with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso frequency zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, this zzso was found in only 3 of 230 zzso controls zzso frequency zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso had approximately zzso of zzso zzso activity and approximately zzso of specific activity compared with zzso zzso The zzso affinity of the zzso zzso was not zzso Our data suggest that the zzso zzso substitution is likely to be a significant zzso factor contributing to the expression of different forms of zzso when associated with other genetic factors such as the presence of zzso
