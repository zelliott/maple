zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso C virus zzso requires the zzso zzso located in the zzso domain of zzso To identify zzso within zzso determining zzso zzso a zzso analysis was zzso Using sequence alignments and three-dimensional structure predictions, zzso acids assumed to be important for specificity were replaced and the zzso were tested in an zzso zzso zzso for their effects on zzso of an zzso zzso For some of the zzso at positions zzso 134, zzso zzso zzso 152, zzso zzso and zzso slightly reduced processing efficiencies were observed but in no case was the zzso specificity zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso at position 154 resulted in a modified zzso pattern, suggesting an important role for this zzso in zzso zzso To substantiate this zzso a panel of zzso zzso carrying different zzso zzso at the zzso site were tested for zzso by these altered zzso We found that substitution of zzso by zzso by zzso and particularly by zzso generated zzso with the following affinities for zzso zzso zzso C zzso L zzso I zzso V for 154 F zzso A, C zzso L zzso I zzso V for 154 F zzso V and L zzso C zzso I zzso V for 154 F zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso nor zzso was accepted by the parental zzso zzso showing that zzso is an important zzso for zzso zzso Furthermore, we present evidence that zzso plays an additional but minor role for this zzso
