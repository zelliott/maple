The zzso hormone zzso gene is an important gene functionally concerning the regulations of body fat content, feeding behavior and energy zzso In this study, the full-length zzso of chicken zzso gene was amplified by SMART zzso zzso The single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene were screened by comparative sequence zzso The obtained zzso coding zzso zzso were designed for zzso zzso Its effects on growth, carcass characteristics and meat quality traits were investigated employing the zzso resource population of zzso chicken crossed with zzso broiler by zzso zzso Our results indicated that the zzso of chicken zzso shared zzso and zzso zzso with that of human and bovine zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso identical to those of human and bovine zzso zzso The zzso protein sequence is predicted to have several functional zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and some low complexity zzso It has 8 zzso sites and no signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting site was predicted in the 3' untranslated region of chicken zzso zzso In addition, a total of seven zzso including an zzso and a synonymous coding zzso were identified in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to be in moderate zzso state zzso zzso and the zzso for zzso zzso AB and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso associations between the locus and zzso force of breast and leg were zzso This zzso site may serve as a useful target for the marker assisted selection of the growth and meat quality traits in zzso
