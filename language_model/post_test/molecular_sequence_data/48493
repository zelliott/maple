zzso loss of the zzso gene has been identified as a zzso link to intellectual disability disorders in zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso in transfer zzso zzso yet the identification of zzso zzso in other zzso species has been hampered by the lack of sensitive and reliable molecular zzso Here, we describe zzso as an additional approach for identifying zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso is a customized version zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We confirm zzso zzso in zzso and additional zzso and zzso zzso zzso Among these, vault zzso contained six zzso zzso three of which were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso Using patient cells lacking the zzso zzso we further show that loss of zzso zzso in vault zzso causes zzso into zzso small zzso fragments that can function as zzso Thus, impaired processing of vault zzso may contribute to the zzso of zzso human zzso
