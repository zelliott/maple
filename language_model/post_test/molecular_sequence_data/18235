The zzso zzso and its cellular zzso zzso are both DNA binding proteins capable of zzso zzso and are implicated in the regulation of the switch between growth and differentiation in zzso zzso Studies attempting to define the zzso zzso of zzso and activated zzso genes zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso as zzso both these events appear to increase the affinity of the zzso protein for zzso zzso genes have been found in organisms ranging from zzso through plants, to zzso in the more zzso related cases, only the zzso DNA binding domain, situated at the zzso of the zzso has been zzso
