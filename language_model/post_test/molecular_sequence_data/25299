A zzso zzso DNA zzso of the zzso zzso zzso isolated from an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, and which zzso zzso resistance and zzso production on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso DNA sequence analysis of this zzso revealed three large open reading frames zzso The incomplete zzso does not contain the zzso end of the coding zzso zzso which uses the same reading frame as zzso is identical to the 3' end of zzso and encodes a putative protein of zzso zzso acids zzso and of Mr zzso zzso encodes a putative protein of 344 zzso and of Mr zzso The zzso acid sequences deduced from zzso and zzso display strong zzso to those of the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is therefore proposed that the incomplete zzso termed zzso zzso encodes part of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso whereas the complete zzso termed zzso zzso encodes the zzso of the same zzso zzso is responsible for zzso resistance and zzso production due to a zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from zzso termed zzso is highly zzso to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso in zzso activity by a factor of zzso was measured for zzso zzso cells zzso high zzso plasmids with the zzso zzso zzso zzso
