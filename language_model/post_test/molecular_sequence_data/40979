Over the years development of selective zzso zzso zzso zzso has been of great concern to researchers involved in the chemistry and pharmacology of zzso drugs, resulting in numerous zzso selective zzso zzso zzso In this work, a data set of 82 zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso activities was built, and quantitative zzso relationship zzso methods based on the two linear (multiple linear regression, zzso partial least squares regression, zzso and a zzso statistical method zzso zzso neural network, zzso were applied to investigate the potential relationship of molecular structural features related to the activity and selectivity of these zzso For zzso and zzso the performances of the zzso and zzso models are superior to the zzso model, giving more reasonable statistical properties zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso method is also more powerful than other two methods for generating the zzso selectivity models, resulting in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the molecular zzso method was also used to explore the possible binding modes of the zzso and a relationship between the zzso modes and the zzso structural features of zzso was further zzso The results show that the binding affinity strength for both zzso and zzso is more correlated with the atom zzso type, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso in position 8 of the zzso or the zzso plane and the space orientation of these two planes contribute the most to the zzso selectivity on the basis of similar hydrogen bond interactions between binding zzso and both zzso zzso The zzso models built together with the zzso procedure should be of great advantage for screening and designing zzso zzso with improved affinity and zzso selectivity zzso
