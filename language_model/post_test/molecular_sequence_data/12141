zzso at the end of zzso shorten with each cell division, resulting in cellular zzso zzso cells, unlike normal zzso cells, express a zzso that maintains the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso on zzso 3 is common in human zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso of a normal zzso 3 into an zzso zzso cell line restored the program of cellular zzso The loss of indefinite growth potential was associated with the loss of zzso activity and zzso of zzso in the zzso cells with a normal zzso zzso However, zzso hybrids that escaped from zzso and zzso hybrids with an introduced zzso 7 or 11 maintained zzso lengths and zzso activity similar to those of the parental zzso Thus, restoration of the cellular zzso program by zzso 3 is associated with repression of zzso function in zzso zzso
