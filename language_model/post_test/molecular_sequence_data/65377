Whereas zzso cells harbor two double strand zzso repeat binding factors, zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been thought to harbor solely the zzso zzso zzso to perform comparable zzso Here we report the identification of zzso repeat binding factor 1 zzso a second zzso zzso in zzso zzso Like the zzso the identified zzso shares zzso acid sequence zzso as well as structural and functional zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This family of proteins shares a common architecture with two separate structural zzso An zzso domain is necessary and sufficient for the formation of zzso and a zzso zzso mediates sequence specific recognition of zzso zzso zzso The identified zzso binds zzso zzso zzso DNA with high sequence specificity in zzso zzso deletion of the zzso gene reveals that it is essential for survival, and zzso of the zzso gene leads to zzso zzso in zzso which is dependent upon the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso like zzso have two factors that bind zzso zzso DNA and perform distinct roles in zzso length zzso
