Low temperature plays a crucial role in seasonal development of woody plants and may directly impact crop production, more particularly in temperate fruit zzso Given its high genetic zzso and zzso to different zzso conditions, almond zzso zzso zzso is an interesting model to understand the mechanisms regulating low temperature sensing in fruit zzso In this paper, we report the cloning and characterization of two genes zzso and zzso belonging to the zzso factor zzso family of zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that this family is composed of at least five zzso In almond shoots zzso in zzso zzso of these genes was rapidly induced by low temperature, suggesting an involvement in cold zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso could bind to zzso responsive zzso containing zzso as zzso of gene zzso In addition, induction of both zzso by cold was higher towards the end of the day, which agreed with the expression pattern of zzso a predicted zzso target zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso were also zzso induced by zzso acid and drought zzso Considering the bin mapping analysis that correlated zzso and zzso zzso in linkage groups 5 and 7) with two different quantitative trait zzso blooming time, it is relevant to perform further association studies that may validate their effect on this zzso
