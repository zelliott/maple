We examined the affinity and the specificity of triplex formation for different zzso zzso directed against two portions of a zzso sequence derived from the mouse zzso zzso As expected, the zzso zzso to the zzso strand of their target can form triplex zzso One parallel zzso showed binding to its target zzso We explain this unusual binding by an interaction of the zzso with a zzso repetition present in the zzso We further examined the interaction of this zzso with a target composed of 14 zzso zzso zzso one zzso shows higher affinity for a partially complementary zzso target relative to its completely complementary zzso For another zzso the binding to the zzso target is weaker and might involve skipping of bases in a way that resembles alternate strand triplex zzso
