In order to study the role of signal zzso pathways in the regulation of zzso in zzso zzso we cloned and characterized a zzso zzso termed zzso The predicted protein product of this gene is composed of 229 zzso acid zzso and contains all the consensus sequences shared by the zzso protein zzso The gene is located in linkage group zzso An zzso zzso showed zzso characteristics very similar to those of the zzso zzso which also maps to linkage group zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso a single base deletion in the zzso zzso which is predicted to result in the zzso of the protein zzso Introduction into the zzso zzso of an zzso clone yielded stable zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited very slow zzso growth and the rate of zzso formation was approximately one zzso of wild zzso The zzso zzso causes both the changes in the pattern of zzso growth and the defects in cell wall zzso Both the diameter and the length of the zzso compartment were shorter in the zzso of the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is identical to zzso and that the signal zzso zzso zzso by the zzso protein regulates the zzso growth of zzso cell wall zzso and zzso formation in zzso zzso
