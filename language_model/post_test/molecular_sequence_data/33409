This study aimed to identify zzso that zzso to the highly zzso sequence of zzso zzso promoter region zzso (named zzso by the zzso zzso Cloning System and finally a paired related zzso zzso factor, zzso known as a key factor for zzso was zzso zzso analysis of fetal and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso starts to be expressed at around fetal days zzso just before the beginning of zzso and that the level of zzso increases after zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that some zzso cells overlap some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso cells revealed that zzso plays a zzso dependent role in zzso of the zzso promoter, showing stimulation in zzso cells and repression in zzso cells via the regions of zzso and zzso The binding ability of zzso to the regions of zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso I zzso revealed that broad regions of zzso were bound by zzso and that zzso contained seven zzso zzso The zzso method using a random zzso zzso pool demonstrated that zzso zzso binds to a zzso zzso which is present in zzso and zzso However, the binding of zzso to zzso with a single zzso and its zzso repeat with two molecules could not induce zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated in cultured cells is not introduced by zzso zzso Thus, this study demonstrated for the first time that zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso and at least in a part of zzso in which zzso may play a role in repression of the zzso zzso
