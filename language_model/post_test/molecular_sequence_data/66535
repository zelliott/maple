The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first split zzso identified in zzso Its zzso zzso zzso is attached to the end of the zzso half of the zzso protein zzso to form the precursor zzso while the zzso zzso zzso precedes the zzso half of the zzso protein zzso to form the precursor zzso zzso and zzso fragments in the separate precursors zzso in concert, a protein zzso process to zzso the zzso zzso and zzso into a functional zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso They then release themselves from the zzso Previously, the zzso zzso zzso has been used to zzso a protein zzso mechanism in zzso transformed zzso zzso resulting in successful zzso of an intact and functional zzso from two halves of a split zzso zzso In this report, transient expression using a zzso particle zzso approach is described for functional analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso zzso could catalyze protein zzso not only in model plants but also in zzso and zzso zzso It also demonstrated that when up to 45 zzso acid zzso were removed from the zzso of the zzso fragment, the zzso zzso was still able to function in the protein zzso zzso
