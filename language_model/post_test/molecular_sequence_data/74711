The zzso zzso zzso zzso produces zzso as a major zzso on an industrial scale, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly zzso We cloned and characterized a zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso to zzso genes in other zzso using zzso zzso in conjunction with inverse zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso open reading frame zzso a putative zzso of 388 deduced zzso acids with a molecular mass of 42 zzso zzso The zzso gene consisted of an zzso zzso domain and a central zzso domain, whereas seven stress response elements were found in the upstream zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transformed with zzso were restored to the zzso zzso when cultured in high zzso media, suggesting that it is a functional zzso zzso zzso also accumulated zzso zzso and zzso activity increased significantly when stressed with zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso transformed with the empty zzso showed only slight zzso The full-length zzso gene sequence including upstream and downstream regions has been deposited in zzso under zzso zzso zzso
