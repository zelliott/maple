zzso zzso zzso stress zzso zzso is an zzso response regulator essential for the viability of zzso zzso a leading zzso pathogen causing human zzso zzso Despite importance, the function of zzso remains completely unknown mainly because of cell death caused by its knockout zzso To overcome this technical zzso in this study, zzso technology was used to investigate the regulatory function of zzso by modulating the level of zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso was performed to identify the zzso zzso either by suppressing zzso expression with zzso zzso zzso acid zzso or by zzso zzso in zzso zzso According to the results of zzso zzso regulated 32 proteins involved in various cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated a few key proteins of the zzso stress response of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso positively controlled zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that zzso directly bound to the promoter region of the zzso stress zzso zzso I zzso zzso identified zzso zzso binding sequences in the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting zzso specifically recognizes and binds to the regulated zzso Interestingly, the level of zzso protein was significantly reduced by zzso (a zzso zzso but not by hydrogen zzso zzso with the overall negative regulation of zzso stress defense proteins by zzso the zzso zzso by zzso rendered zzso zzso more resistant to zzso stress compared to the wild zzso Overall, this study reveals the important role played by the essential response regulator zzso in the zzso stress defense of zzso zzso
