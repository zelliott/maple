It is well known that zzso receptors for zzso zzso on zzso mediate the zzso of zzso complexes and signal the release of inflammatory and zzso zzso zzso are also expressed at high levels on B cells where they are less involved in zzso than in modulating zzso zzso by membrane zzso Although zzso of membrane zzso can result in zzso differentiation and proliferation through stimulation of zzso C, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of protein zzso C, zzso zzso with membrane zzso zzso a dominant zzso signal that prevents or zzso zzso This form of regulation may have a role in the induction of tolerance by zzso and in controlling the zzso repertoire by zzso The different functions of zzso on B cells and zzso may reflect the fact that these cell types express closely related but distinct zzso zzso We have recently found that the main zzso zzso zzso zzso is unable to mediate zzso by way of coated pits and coated zzso zzso to an zzso zzso of 47 zzso acids in its zzso zzso Here we show that this zzso absent from the zzso zzso zzso also contains zzso zzso sites that may have a role in the ability of zzso to regulate zzso zzso through membrane zzso
