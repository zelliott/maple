zzso associated with the cluster of zzso zzso from zzso zzso is deduced to zzso a type II zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso production by zzso zzso of the disrupted zzso with intact zzso restored the production of zzso suggesting that zzso is crucial for zzso zzso zzso I, the gene zzso type I zzso from zzso zzso zzso cannot complement zzso deficient zzso distinguishing zzso from type I zzso zzso Type II zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso could complement zzso in zzso zzso indicating that the two genes are equivalent in their zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso production providing an alternative approach for yield zzso
