Recently it has been established that both a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso B zzso zzso mediate the actions of zzso peptides in zzso Five different classes of peptides that function as zzso zzso zzso have been zzso however, it is unknown whether similar strategies will yield zzso for the closely related zzso zzso In the present study we have used either native cells possessing only one zzso zzso zzso zzso or cells zzso zzso with one zzso to determine whether using the strategies that were used successfully for zzso receptors would allow zzso zzso zzso to be zzso zzso zzso des zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of substance P zzso or zzso were all zzso and each functioned as a zzso zzso zzso All of these zzso had low affinity for the zzso zzso Application of similar strategies to zzso by formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not result in any potent zzso zzso zzso zzso acid SP and zzso zzso were zzso selective zzso zzso zzso No zzso fragments of zzso or zzso functioned as a zzso or zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that none of the known strategies used to prepare zzso zzso zzso zzso are successful at the zzso zzso suggesting that a different strategy will be needed for this zzso such as the formation of zzso zzso or zzso zzso substance P zzso These results suggest that even though there is a close zzso between zzso and zzso and their zzso their zzso relations are markedly zzso These results indicate that the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso for newly discovered zzso zzso of gastrointestinal zzso may be difficult because the strategies developed for one well-studied zzso may not apply to the other even though it is structurally closely zzso
