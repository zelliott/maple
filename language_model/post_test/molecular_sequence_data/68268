A single zzso zzso has been placed at various positions in individual peptides for which the zzso reference zzso is zzso neutral, and the zzso contents of the peptides have been measured by circular zzso The dependence of zzso zzso content on zzso position has been used to determine the zzso propensity zzso Both the charged zzso and zzso zzso forms of the zzso zzso are strong zzso breakers and have identical zzso of zzso at 0 degree zzso The interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso affects zzso stability at positions throughout the zzso not only near the zzso where the interaction is zzso stabilizing, and the zzso where it is zzso zzso of the zzso contents at zzso pH zzso and at neutral pH zzso shows that the zzso zzso interaction is screened slowly with increasing zzso zzso and screening is not complete even at zzso M zzso Lastly, a zzso zzso interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso i + 4) has been zzso This zzso interaction is specific for both the orientation and spacing of the zzso and zzso zzso and is resistant to screening by zzso
