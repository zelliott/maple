Mice zzso for the zzso mismatch repair zzso gene exhibit a predisposition to lymphoma, zzso repeat instability, and failure of zzso To study the role of zzso in the maintenance of in zzso zzso integrity in zzso cells, we characterized zzso zzso in T cells and zzso of 129 zzso zzso zzso zzso The spontaneous frequency of zzso T zzso as a consequence of zzso was increased zzso Point zzso which accounted for less than zzso of the zzso zzso clones in zzso mice, was zzso in the zzso T cell clones from zzso zzso These point zzso were predominantly zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice exhibited only a modest increase in the frequency of clones with point zzso such that zzso zzso was still the primary cause of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso is zzso which may be related to the zzso tumor zzso of zzso zzso
