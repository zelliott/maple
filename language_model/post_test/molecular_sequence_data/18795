Many zzso association studies pointed out that zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as one of the most influential genes for serum zzso zzso zzso is reported to zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso only difference being at their zzso We investigated zzso zzso of zzso in the human kidney and role of zzso zzso acids in differential sorting in zzso 

zzso specific zzso against zzso were developed and human kidney sections were zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso side of the collecting duct while zzso was expressed in the zzso side of the zzso zzso zzso fused zzso were expressed in zzso cells and zzso zzso was zzso zzso was expressed at both zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso was expressed only at the zzso zzso Although zzso has a putative zzso motif at zzso and 34th zzso deletion of the motif or replacement of zzso did not affect its zzso zzso When up to 16 zzso acids were removed from the zzso of zzso or when up to 25 zzso acids were removed from the zzso of zzso there was no change in their zzso zzso of 20 zzso acids from zzso was not expressed in the zzso More than 30 zzso acids deletion from zzso resulted in expression at both zzso and zzso zzso as well as in the zzso When zzso acids from 25th and 30th were changed to zzso in zzso expression pattern was the same as zzso 

zzso was expressed in the zzso membrane of kidney zzso zzso in humans and this zzso is likely to responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso acids unique to each zzso played an important role in protein stability and zzso
