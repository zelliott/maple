A test that allows for early detection of zzso contaminated coastal water would enhance public health zzso zzso Water zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rapid zzso test that has recently been developed to detect total zzso and zzso coli in coastal zzso We performed a zzso evaluation of the zzso product, testing it in parallel with the multiple tube zzso zzso method for 86 coastal water samples in southern zzso zzso analysis was performed by using paired zzso tests and linear zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso and genetic zzso The results of this study showed a strong correlation between the traditional zzso and the zzso method for detection of total zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso zzso in ocean water zzso zzso zzso results indicated that the zzso and zzso were equivalent in detecting zzso coli and that the zzso may be more sensitive in the detection of total zzso We conclude that zzso would be a useful tool with which to monitor coastal beach zzso
