zzso companies and regulatory agencies are pursuing the complete characterization of protein zzso in every detail as a means to mitigate risks of product quality related safety zzso During the characterization of a zzso humanized zzso zzso zzso to as zzso zzso mass zzso analysis suggested that the light chain was highly zzso The zzso and zzso materials, separated using zzso affinity zzso were fully characterized using zzso zzso mapping and tandem mass zzso Using an automatic zzso search of the single protein database for this zzso and extensive manual investigations of the mass zzso of the matched zzso multiple tentative zzso sites in the light and heavy chains were observed in the highly zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso site was identified and confirmed to be zzso 49 on the light chain, by performing extensive sequence analysis on an isolated zzso zzso utilizing zzso degradation analysis and zzso mass zzso zzso alignments of zzso with 12 other zzso zzso zzso and computer modeling of the zzso part of zzso suggest that the unusually high level of zzso of zzso zzso 49, which is located adjacent to the second zzso region zzso in the light chain, is due to a spatial proximity effect in catalyzing the zzso zzso by zzso acid zzso 31 in the zzso on the light zzso
