zzso analysis and zzso based on a zzso interaction model were used to identify zzso of zzso in the zzso regulator zzso a member of the zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the putative regulatory domain of zzso was essential for driving the zzso of zzso zzso fusion zzso The interaction surface of a different zzso and zzso was mapped onto a multiple sequence alignment of the zzso zzso This mapping identified putative contacts in the zzso regulatory domain zzso zzso which were targeted for zzso zzso zzso was zzso by the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso to assemble in zzso coli revealing interesting similarities and differences between zzso and zzso
