zzso zzso zzso is the leading cause of cancer mortality in many zzso zzso of new zzso risk factors is therefore warranted in order to explore means to improve the survival zzso Here, we report on a novel zzso gene known as zzso protein zzso 4 beta zzso that has two zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso zzso differs from zzso zzso in that it contains one copy of a zzso zzso whereas this sequence is duplicated in zzso zzso in zzso 1 of zzso In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between zzso zzso variation and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was analyzed in the blood samples from 102 zzso patients and 135 healthy individuals by zzso The zzso distribution of zzso was analyzed using the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso were zzso and zzso in the zzso group and control group, respectively, representing a significant difference between these two groups zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso appears to be associated with genetic zzso of zzso and may therefore be considered as a risk zzso
