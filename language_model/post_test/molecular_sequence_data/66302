zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso In the unfolded protein response zzso they function as zzso sensor of the unfolded proteins in the zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso by zzso stress, zzso performs an unconventional zzso zzso of zzso zzso and thus allows the synthesis of active zzso which activates zzso target genes to restore the zzso of the zzso zzso signaling is hence essential for zzso but its function during zzso is yet zzso The transcripts of the two zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed during zzso We found that zzso is sufficient for zzso zzso of zzso zzso Although gain of zzso function had no significant effect on zzso zzso zzso of both, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A induced zzso formation, suggesting that an enhanced activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, while loss of zzso function promotes zzso formation, the loss of zzso function led to a reduction of zzso formation, probably by action of zzso being different from the zzso zzso zzso both gain and loss of function studies demonstrate that zzso is required for zzso formation in zzso zzso
