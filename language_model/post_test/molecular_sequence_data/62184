zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the penultimate zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso strongly associated with the outer surface of the inner zzso zzso It is attached to this membrane by an unknown mechanism that appears not to involve a zzso zzso The zzso for its import to zzso and zzso into the inner membrane has not been zzso We have fused human zzso containing zzso zzso zzso deletions or zzso zzso to yellow fluorescent protein zzso and have used these zzso to investigate the zzso import of zzso in human zzso We show that all the information required for efficient import is contained within the first 250 zzso acid zzso of human zzso and that targeting to zzso is prevented by fusion of zzso to the zzso zzso of between 151 and 175 zzso from the zzso is required to abolish import, whereas shorter deletions impair its zzso zzso efficient targeting appears to require both a major targeting zzso the whole or part of which is contained between zzso 151 and zzso and which may be involved in zzso to the inner zzso zzso together with interaction between this region and a zzso within the first 150 zzso These features suggest that the mechanism for import of human zzso to zzso differs from those identified for the zzso of zzso zzso inner membrane zzso In addition, a zzso zzso outside this region zzso prevented targeting to zzso and delayed the appearance of zzso zzso This zzso appeared to prevent import by a direct effect on protein folding rather than by altering a sequence required for zzso It may lead to zzso of the zzso construct in an unfolded zzso followed by zzso degradation, possibly through enhanced binding to a zzso zzso zzso
