zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso zzso locus reverse the zzso of zzso zzso induced by the gypsy zzso element in zzso zzso This gene encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of zzso that contains an zzso domain and 12 copies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso in zzso coli and zzso cells, and partially zzso It was shown to interact specifically in zzso with a zzso DNA zzso that contains 12 copies of the sequence zzso located in the zzso region of zzso between the zzso long terminal repeat zzso and the first zzso initiation zzso This sequence shows striking zzso to some zzso zzso zzso zzso supporting a role for the zzso protein in the control of gypsy zzso In addition, the zzso protein is present at approximately zzso sites on zzso zzso zzso suggesting that it also interacts in zzso with DNA and might be involved functionally in the regulation of normal cellular zzso
