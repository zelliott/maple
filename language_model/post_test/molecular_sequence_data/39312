zzso zzso is a convenient model of zzso B virus zzso infection, but the lack of zzso zzso zzso investigation of zzso and vaccine zzso The aim of this study was to define zzso zzso in the surface zzso recognized by vaccinated immune zzso zzso zzso were used to test the zzso response of zzso zzso cells to synthetic peptides spanning the zzso region in 22 zzso and 13 zzso and challenged immune zzso Roughly zzso or zzso 50% of the immune ducks responded to five zzso peptides zzso a statistically greater zzso response than in zzso zzso Fewer ducks responded to an additional six zzso No statistically significant difference could be shown for the response to 11 peptides between the immune ducks and the zzso zzso There was no zzso of the zzso peptides which were located throughout the surface zzso at sites of major swings in zzso A number of peptides which induce zzso in vaccinated immune ducks have been zzso Their role in spontaneous recovery from duck zzso B infection merits zzso
