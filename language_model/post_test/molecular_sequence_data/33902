A fundamental challenge in analyzing zzso data is distinguishing zzso zzso from background zzso To address this problem in the context of a genetically zzso disease, zzso zzso zzso we devised a zzso zzso strategy called zzso mapping that zzso zzso data for the zzso zzso factor zzso to rank candidate zzso zzso sequencing combined with this approach identified a zzso nonsense zzso in male germ zzso zzso zzso in the single affected member of a zzso Turkish family with zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein zzso whose function is zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso in mice and other model organisms result in zzso long zzso and, in mice, rapid zzso zzso zzso sequence analyses of additional individuals with zzso identified five zzso with zzso zzso in zzso Two of these zzso alter zzso acids that are zzso in all known zzso and an zzso zzso zzso indicates that these zzso result in a loss of zzso zzso Thus, zzso activity appears to be critical for zzso function in zzso This study highlights a previously underappreciated role for zzso as a direct zzso regulator of zzso genes in zzso In addition, it demonstrates the effectiveness of zzso zzso mapping in zzso candidate genes from zzso data and suggests that this strategy should be generally zzso to a range of retinal zzso
