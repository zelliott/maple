zzso zzso avian influenza virus H5N1 has spread across zzso and Africa, and outbreaks are now endemic in several countries, including Indonesia, Vietnam and zzso Continuous circulation of H5N1 virus in Egypt, from a single infected source, has led to significant genetic diversification with zzso zzso zzso providing an opportunity to study the impact of genetic evolution on viral zzso zzso In this study, we zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes in influenza viruses isolated in Egypt from 2006 to 2011 and investigated the effect of zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso genes in each of the zzso on their zzso The analysis showed that viruses in at least four zzso still persisted in poultry in Egypt as of zzso Using reverse zzso to generate zzso viruses with specific zzso zzso we found zzso drift in the zzso in two influenza virus zzso compared with the other currently zzso influenza virus zzso in zzso Moreover, the two zzso with significant zzso drift were zzso zzso Our findings suggested that zzso divergent H5N1 zzso which were not zzso zzso were zzso in Egypt, indicating that there was a problem in using a single influenza virus strain as seed virus to produce influenza virus vaccine in Egypt and providing data for designing more zzso control strategies in zzso zzso
