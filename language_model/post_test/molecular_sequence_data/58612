zzso a recently identified zzso dominant condition characterized by the recurrence of zzso zzso leading to zzso was previously mapped to zzso zzso within a zzso zzso zzso No zzso event was observed with zzso a highly zzso zzso marker isolated from a zzso mapped to this zzso We recently identified within this zzso a zzso sequence that we used to screen a fetal brain zzso library and isolated an ubiquitous and abundantly transcribed zzso We did not detect any zzso of this gene in zzso patients, suggesting that it is not implicated in this zzso Interestingly, this gene encodes a putative protein zzso to several zzso zzso proteins previously identified in bacteria, zzso and zzso The proteins with the highest degree of similarity were the zzso zzso zzso which, in zzso are involved in the zzso chain zzso acid zzso pathway, raising fascinating questions on the yet unknown function of this gene in zzso
