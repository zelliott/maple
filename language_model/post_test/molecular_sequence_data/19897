We examine the zzso characteristics of zzso acid representations based on physical zzso We demonstrate that sequences zzso using contracted zzso based on physical properties do not zzso local folding information zzso The best zzso alphabet can only zzso approximately 57% of the maximum possible amount of structural zzso This result suggests that zzso representations that operate on a local length scale are not likely to be useful in zzso searches and zzso zzso
