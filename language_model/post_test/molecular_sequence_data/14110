zzso from nine populations belonging to three African zzso zzso and zzso and four European zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso subspecies were scored for seven zzso zzso A large amount of genetic variation (between seven and 30 zzso per zzso was zzso Average zzso and average number of zzso were significantly higher in African than in European subspecies, in agreement with larger effective population sizes in zzso zzso analyses confirmed that zzso zzso evolved in three distinct and deeply differentiated lineages previously detected by zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis of workers from a given population indicated that zzso cluster together when using a sufficient number of zzso data whereas zzso do zzso An index of zzso was derived to zzso the zzso of different zzso levels in large zzso trees based on individual zzso Finally, individual population zzso zzso data were used to test the zzso of the two alternative zzso models, the infinite zzso model zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The better fit overall of the zzso probably results from the majority of the zzso used including repeats of two or three different length motifs zzso zzso
