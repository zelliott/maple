zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso factors that are involved in several zzso processes in zzso zzso They are similar in structure, containing two zzso zzso and have partially redundant functions in zzso organ zzso zzso and functional analyses of zzso and zzso zzso have been performed previously in almost all zzso In this study, one zzso zzso and two zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso and were named zzso zzso and zzso zzso is the first reported zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on a gene tree constructed with sequences of all zzso zzso zzso zzso it is likely that zzso and zzso and likewise zzso and zzso are zzso The expression patterns of zzso were examined with Southern zzso of the quantitative zzso products and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso had almost identical expression patterns in the analyzed zzso and zzso were continually expressed in the developing female zzso Our analysis suggests that zzso have zzso to both zzso and zzso and that the most recent common zzso of extant seed plants has two type zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in the development of female zzso zzso
