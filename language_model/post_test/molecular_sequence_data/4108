A complete three-dimensional model zzso zzso code zzso ) for the zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso protein zzso including zzso zzso is zzso We have used the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso available zzso data about zzso variations in the primary sequences of zzso among various zzso zzso strains and secondary structure zzso zzso surface probability and zzso plots for zzso to build our zzso In our zzso model, the first 137 zzso possess a structure similar to the zzso but the remainder is zzso Though the ladle shape is still zzso zzso possesses a larger ladle head or zzso domain compared to zzso Using this model, it has been possible to identify two kinds of zzso zzso zzso those forming the core of the zzso zzso and zzso those involved in the zzso interactions leading to zzso zzso zzso on the zzso exterior, important in the mediation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso show more zzso in comparison to those of zzso and zzso
