zzso genes are zzso regulated in zzso zzso according to temporally and zzso restricted patterns which are affected by zzso vitamin A derivatives which have a function as, or at least mimic the action of, zzso zzso In the human zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso gene clusters are activated by at least two zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso in a 3' to zzso sequential cascade which reproduces the zzso pattern observed in early zzso We have studied the regulation of the early activated zzso zzso which is expressed in human zzso in multiple transcripts generated by the zzso controlled use of alternative zzso start sites and zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso upstream zzso region linked to a reporter gene in zzso cells, allowed the identification of two different promoters and a zzso zzso element necessary for zzso gene zzso This element zzso to a zzso promoter the ability to be induced by zzso in zzso cells, and zzso by zzso beta and gamma zzso acid receptors zzso but not zzso X zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso I zzso analysis allowed the identification of four sequences which bind nuclear factors from both zzso zzso cells and embryonic zzso with similar zzso The use of specific zzso allowed the identification of at least zzso beta in some of the zzso complexes, although the four sequences bind single zzso zzso in zzso cells much less zzso or not at all, when compared to a zzso zzso responsive zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the presence of a selective zzso alpha zzso indicated that the zzso zzso zzso beta zzso is nevertheless a necessary step in zzso gene zzso Our results indicate that the zzso activity of zzso upon specific, zzso regulatory elements may have a key role in the induction of early activated zzso genes in response to zzso However, zzso represent only a fraction of the zzso factors interacting with the zzso zzso zzso which appears to be a complex element requiring specific combinations of nuclear factors for its proper zzso
