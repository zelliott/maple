A zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were zzso from a single strain of zzso In contrast to the previously characterized zzso hybrids zzso and zzso which can coexist zzso with a zzso zzso is not packaged into viral particles and shows no viral zzso The virus and zzso carry zzso of 15 135 and zzso zzso zzso For zzso 33 predicted zzso are zzso organized with a strong preference for zzso stop zzso three-quarters of which overlap with either the zzso motif or the start zzso of the following zzso zzso carries seven zzso three of which zzso an zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso A fourth zzso exhibits a high zzso sequence identity to the zzso zzso zzso which suggests that it has been transferred to the zzso from zzso A single point zzso within an otherwise identical 500 zzso region of the zzso gene occurs in the viral attachment site zzso which zzso to the zzso region of the targeted zzso gene in the host zzso This point zzso zzso on zzso the ability to integrate into the zzso zzso which differs from the integration site of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also shown zzso to integrate into separate sites on the host zzso This is believed to be the first report of a zzso zzso sharing its natural host with a zzso and carrying a highly similar zzso zzso
