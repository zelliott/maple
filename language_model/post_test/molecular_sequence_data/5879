To characterize expression patterns of active genes in human zzso and to isolate novel genes that are uniquely expressed in this zzso 

A zzso complementary DNA zzso library that faithfully represents the composition of zzso zzso zzso was constructed with an zzso preparation from a zzso human zzso A total of 925 3' terminal sequences were collected by sequencing randomly selected zzso of which zzso were regarded as representing zzso coded genes zzso signatures zzso zzso were compared with each other and searched against zzso The resulting expression profile, listing gene species and their frequency, represents the composition of zzso in the zzso By comparing this expression profile with those obtained from 10 other source cells or zzso genes uniquely active in the zzso were discovered, including some not previously zzso A zzso zzso corresponding to one of these was isolated and zzso Its expression was analyzed by zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso It was then mapped on human zzso 

In the expression profile, 108 genes were detected zzso suggesting that they are very zzso Fifty-five of them were identified in zzso including the most abundant zzso gene and several other genes for zzso Among the remaining novel and active zzso 19 were considered unique to zzso on the basis of their representation status in other expression profiles and in zzso One of these was identified as a gene that encodes a novel zzso protein expressed in a rod zzso that maps to zzso zzso 

The expression profile of active genes in the zzso represents the composition of zzso which reflects the relative activities of genes in this zzso A comparison of this expression profile with those obtained with other zzso resulted in isolation of a novel zzso specifically expressed in the rod zzso It is anticipated that additional novel genes that are uniquely active in the neural zzso may be obtained with the same strategy, leading to further clarification of the zzso or zzso characteristics of this zzso
