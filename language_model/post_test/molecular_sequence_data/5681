zzso is a zzso within the zzso compartment of zzso which carries an unusual zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The soluble pool of zzso from crude extracts resolves zzso into two zzso that differ in their zzso Previous zzso studies indicating the existence of two zzso suggested that the zzso zzso might be zzso by different zzso To address this issue, the two genes were cloned and zzso leading to the prediction that the protein products would differ by only a single zzso acid, zzso or Ala, at zzso zzso zzso sequence data on zzso fragments of zzso zzso showed that both gene products are found in both zzso of the soluble zzso After further zzso the two zzso were no longer zzso zzso and there was no evidence for charge zzso as determined by zzso gel zzso of whole zzso Thus, the initial separation of the different soluble zzso of this protein appears to be due to distinct molecular complexes, possibly related to differential zzso and is not the result of the zzso zzso acid zzso
