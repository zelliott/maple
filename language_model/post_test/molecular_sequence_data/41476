Iron storage and elimination of toxic zzso iron are the responsibility of zzso in bacterial zzso zzso are capable of zzso iron using molecular oxygen and import iron zzso into the large central cavity of the zzso where they are stored in a zzso zzso We isolated, zzso zzso from the zzso purple zzso zzso zzso zzso and determined its zzso acid sequence and X-ray zzso The structure and sequence revealed similarity to other purple bacterial species with substantial differences in the pore zzso zzso 3- and zzso pores do not allow the passage of iron zzso even though structural dynamics may assist the iron zzso On the other hand the zzso is open to water and larger zzso in its native zzso In order to study the mechanism of iron import, multiple soaking experiments were zzso Upon zzso and zzso treatment the zzso site zzso reorganization as seen in zzso from zzso coli and zzso zzso When soaking with zzso only, a closely bound small molecular zzso is observed close to zzso and the coordination of zzso to zzso changes from zzso to zzso zzso calculations indicate that the bound zzso is most likely a water or a hydroxide zzso representing a product zzso On the other hand the different soaking treatments did not modify the zzso of other pore zzso
