zzso are cell zzso molecules that mediate numerous zzso processes in addition to a variety of acute zzso zzso Two reports zzso a zzso beta zzso zzso in zzso zzso To further investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso we used zzso expression of zzso interference zzso zzso to knock down expression of zzso zzso the gene that encodes zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the wing reduced zzso zzso and produced zzso defects associated with zzso zzso in zzso demonstrating that this strategy knocked down zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and mushroom bodies via two zzso lines, zzso and zzso disrupted zzso behavior but did not alter locomotor abilities or central nervous system zzso zzso behavior was normal in flies that expressed zzso zzso via other zzso lines that specifically targeted the zzso the projection zzso the mushroom bodies, bitter and sweet zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Our studies confirm that zzso is important for the development or function of the zzso zzso zzso Additionally, our studies demonstrate that zzso is required for normal behavioral responses to both aversive and attractive zzso Our results are consistent with a model in which zzso mediates events within the zzso zzso that influence zzso zzso
