zzso zzso plays important roles in modulating protein structure and zzso The direct impact of the modification on protein zzso is not yet well zzso 

Here we zzso the dynamic changes following zzso H trimming of high zzso zzso in zzso by means of zzso zzso exchange mass zzso 

The results revealed that zzso zzso extensive zzso in backbone zzso affecting regions both adjacent to and zzso from the zzso zzso 

The overall exchange rate is reduced in the zzso state, which indicates rigidity enhancement due to the attached zzso
