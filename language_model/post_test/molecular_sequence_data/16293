Human zzso is a zzso zzso protein that interacts with zzso viral and cellular zzso elements to stimulate zzso of selected zzso Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a human zzso clone containing the entire zzso region of zzso The deduced primary zzso acid sequence of zzso does not contain a domain resembling any previously identified DNA binding zzso However, an interesting feature of the zzso protein is a clustered arrangement of zzso and zzso zzso that have been found recently within the zzso zzso of other zzso zzso zzso of the zzso clone in bacteria yields a protein that binds to DNA and activates zzso in zzso in a comparable manner to native human zzso zzso of zzso clones into zzso cells indicates that the zzso gene product can also activate gene expression in zzso in a DNA zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso in a zzso cell line and zzso following zzso differentiation of a human zzso cell zzso This indicates that zzso may be a zzso factor involved in the control of zzso regulated gene zzso
