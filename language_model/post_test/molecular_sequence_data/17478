zzso administration of zzso zzso (5 zzso a zzso zzso induced barrel rotation in zzso zzso with zzso (40 zzso g zzso zzso zzso 3 days or 7 days prior to the injection of zzso zzso significantly inhibited the response rate of barrel rotation induced by zzso zzso but not that induced by zzso (1 zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on barrel rotation could be partially countered by zzso a selective peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect the barrel rotation induced by zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso specifically suppresses the barrel rotation evoked by zzso zzso in a long-lasting manner possibly acting through zzso zzso
