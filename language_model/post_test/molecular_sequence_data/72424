zzso zzso zzso zzso produces at least two type I zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso 2 zzso A zzso sequence zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso leaf zzso using degenerative zzso and codes for a 22 zzso acid signal zzso followed by a protein of 267 zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso forms in zzso coli yielded proteins of 267 (to the natural stop zzso and 247 zzso acids (to the putative zzso site yielding the mature zzso that had identical protein synthesis zzso activity as compared to native zzso The substitution of zzso for zzso at position 189 near the active site reduced the ability of zzso to inhibit protein synthesis by zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was well tolerated in zzso with zzso values of 40 zzso in mice and zzso zzso in zzso A crystal of mature zzso protein was used to collect X-ray zzso data to zzso A zzso The zzso crystal structure was solved and showed extensive zzso with other type I zzso and A chains of type II zzso The studies described here demonstrate that zzso retains full zzso activity and serve as a guide for using this zzso yet zzso zzso in the construction of zzso zzso fusion zzso
