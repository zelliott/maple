zzso human zzso zzso corresponding to alpha and beta zzso were zzso zzso was similar to zzso isolated from skin zzso it was a zzso zzso model zzso zzso and was functionally unstable when incubated under zzso zzso zzso was lost rapidly zzso approximately 1 zzso by a zzso process similar to that observed for the spontaneous zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso of active zzso corresponded to those of active zzso and upon spontaneous zzso zzso decreased in parallel to activity zzso zzso differed from zzso in zzso ability and zzso zzso did not react with model zzso an active site zzso or a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso and CD zzso were similar to those of the active and not the spontaneously zzso form of zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso zzso decreased at a rate zzso slower than that observed for zzso and zzso remained zzso when examined by size exclusion zzso at zzso salt zzso Thus, zzso is a stable zzso form of zzso Three active site zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso 192 and 216 zzso numbers for zzso 191 and 215 of zzso lie at the entrance to the primary specificity zzso pocket, and the zzso converted them to the zzso of zzso While zzso displayed the same properties as zzso the zzso and stability characteristics of zzso and zzso progressively approached those of zzso Thus, the contrasting zzso properties of zzso and zzso are largely related to differences at the zzso zzso On the basis of the properties of the zzso we suggest that the side chain of zzso is blocking and stabilizing the zzso pocket and that this stabilization is sufficient to prevent spontaneous zzso
