The zzso zzso binding protein 1 zzso is a gigantic zinc finger protein zzso zzso zzso acids and belonging to the zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso is suggested to be a zzso factor involved in various biological zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso zzso from the major promoter, zzso zzso by the zzso zzso system revealed that the zzso protein interacts with the zzso protein zzso In zzso pull-down zzso and in zzso zzso experiments confirmed this zzso The zzso region of zzso was found to be the site of interaction with the zzso half of zzso In zzso zzso analysis using developing rat zzso revealed that the zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso but the expression in immature zzso is zzso The expression of zzso in adult rat brain is also predominantly in zzso cells, indicating that zzso is involved in the physiology of mature zzso zzso
