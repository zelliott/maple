A zzso from zzso zzso similar to microbial zzso zzso and designated zzso was isolated using a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso as a zzso Multiple zzso yielded only zzso zzso and a few zzso zzso zzso zzso (also similar to microbial zzso zzso suggesting the absence of any other highly similar zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso sequences predict zzso identity at the protein level, except for an zzso zzso extension zzso zzso zzso also not seen in microbial zzso zzso and zzso show less similarity zzso zzso zzso including respective zzso extensions that are themselves mostly zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals a single zzso with three zzso in the coding sequence and one in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso delta zzso zzso to be approximately the size of microbial zzso zzso zzso were zzso respectively, in zzso and zzso coli zzso hypersensitive to ultraviolet zzso The absence of significant effects on resistance suggests either that any putative zzso DNA repair activity requires zzso not present in zzso or zzso coli, or that zzso encodes a zzso zzso rather than a DNA repair zzso
