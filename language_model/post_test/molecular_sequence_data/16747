zzso zzso is a cellular zzso in the zzso synthetic zzso that mediates the synthesis of zzso from zzso zzso The zzso function as critical regulators of a number of cellular zzso including the acute and chronic inflammatory response, zzso and the innate immune zzso Human zzso zzso which does not zzso a viral zzso zzso has been shown to induce cellular zzso zzso zzso although the precise role of zzso in zzso replication is unknown, zzso induction was shown to be critical for normal zzso zzso In an earlier study, we identified an open reading frame zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso a putative protein zzso zzso with high zzso to cellular zzso In the current study, we show that zzso is expressed with zzso zzso during zzso infection, resulting in production of a zzso zzso zzso with the expression of a viral zzso zzso cellular zzso expression was not induced during zzso zzso Finally, analysis of growth of zzso zzso with zzso deleted identified zzso as a critical zzso for replication in zzso zzso
