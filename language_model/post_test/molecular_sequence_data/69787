The primary structure of the plant zzso genes has been deduced from the comparison of the zzso sequences of 23 genes and 14 zzso from eight different zzso These data confirmed the extreme conservation of zzso zzso and zzso in plant and animal zzso zzso zzso is more variable than zzso and the zzso zzso is the less zzso zzso Some interesting observations concerning the zzso regions of zzso and zzso in their extended zzso and zzso regions are zzso Only three plant zzso genes were found to possess intervening zzso one zzso gene and two zzso like zzso The most striking differences found between the two zzso are the absence from plant zzso genes of the zzso structure existing downstream of the animal genes and the fact that plant zzso zzso are zzso This suggests that the zzso regulation of expression of zzso genes is different in the two zzso In plants the multiple copies of the zzso genes are organized into zzso zzso In the complex zzso of zzso the multiple copies of the genes are highly dispersed on the zzso
