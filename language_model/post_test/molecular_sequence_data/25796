The spreading of freshly isolated zzso smooth muscle cells on a zzso of zzso is zzso by an zzso zzso on the cell zzso It is associated with organization of zzso filaments in stress fibers and marked changes in cell zzso and function, collectively referred to as a transition from a zzso to a synthetic zzso To study further how zzso zzso components affect smooth muscle zzso we have analyzed the expression and organization of zzso zzso in freshly isolated rat zzso smooth muscle cells cultured on a zzso of zzso under zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the expression of zzso for smooth muscle zzso but not for zzso zzso was strongly zzso during primary zzso On the other hand, the cellular content of zzso was only moderately changed during the same zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso was rapidly organized in stress zzso which did not stain with a zzso zzso against smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso containing zzso were most prominent in the central parts of the zzso and gradually disappeared as the spreading of the cells zzso In contrast to the situation with zzso zzso there was no apparent overlap in the zzso for zzso and the zzso zzso zzso 5 beta 1), indicating that this zzso zzso with zzso zzso during the initial spreading zzso Taken together, the results show that the expression and organization of smooth muscle zzso are changed during interaction of the cells with zzso early in primary zzso They support the notion that zzso interactions between zzso zzso components and zzso smooth muscle cells take part in the control of smooth muscle zzso
