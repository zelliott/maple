Nuclear migration and positioning within cells are critical for many zzso processes and are governed by the zzso zzso Although mechanisms of zzso attachment are zzso growing evidence links a novel family of nuclear envelope zzso proteins that share a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso has implicated zzso in zzso nuclear positioning by regulating zzso zzso of a giant zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso as a zzso zzso protein in a zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is an integral membrane protein located at the inner nuclear zzso While the zzso domain of zzso is responsible for zzso association with the nuclear zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso expression is not required for zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso does not interact with type B zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is ensured by binding to an additional nuclear zzso most likely zzso zzso we find that the zzso zzso domain of zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 via their zzso zzso zzso Our data provide evidence of a physical zzso connection that is likely to be a key mechanism in zzso communication and regulation of nuclear zzso
