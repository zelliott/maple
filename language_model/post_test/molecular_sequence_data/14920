A novel zzso positive, zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso was isolated from a soil sample collected at soil forest in zzso county of Yunnan province, zzso zzso Its zzso position was investigated by a zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the novel strain zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and was closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso as the zzso zzso The whole zzso zzso mainly consisted of zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso trees further showed that strain zzso zzso belong to zzso and had a distinct zzso within the evolutionary radiation of the zzso zzso On the basis of its comparative analysis of zzso and zzso zzso it is proposed that strain zzso zzso represent a novel species of the zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso AA zzso zzso zzso
