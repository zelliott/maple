A novel class of zzso virus zzso called zzso is expressed immediately zzso and prior to the onset of late gene zzso Intermediate zzso is dependent on zzso factors which are present in an active state in zzso cells prior to the onset of DNA zzso zzso intermediate genes zzso into zzso infected cells are expressed prior to DNA zzso whereas the copies within the viral zzso are zzso DNA replication is essential for zzso of viral intermediate zzso and de zzso protein synthesis is not required zzso In contrast, zzso of late zzso depends on DNA replication and continued de zzso protein zzso zzso a subset of intermediate proteins is likely to be zzso of late gene zzso zzso extracts zzso transcribe early, intermediate and late genes in a way similar to the zzso expression observed in zzso A cascade model is discussed for the regulation of gene expression during the viral zzso
