The nuclear zzso appears to play an important role in zzso gene expression during zzso zzso To better understand this role, we examined nuclear zzso zzso proteins that are zzso and interact with the zzso gene zzso Multiple zzso interactions involving two distinct nuclear zzso proteins occur within the zzso regulatory sequences zzso zzso to zzso One of these zzso zzso is a zzso cell zzso protein that is related to the zzso factor zzso and resides in both the nuclear zzso and the zzso nuclear zzso The other zzso zzso is a cell zzso zzso promoter factor that recognizes binding sites resembling the consensus site for the zzso protein zzso and is localized exclusively on the nuclear zzso zzso and zzso each interact with two nuclear zzso zzso zzso These elements are present near key regulatory sites of the zzso gene promoter, such as the principal steroid hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso in this region of the zzso gene promoter suggests transient associations with the nuclear zzso that are distinct from the stable interactions of zzso attachment zzso Our results are consistent with involvement of the nuclear zzso in concentrating and/or zzso zzso factors that mediate the zzso and steroid hormone responsiveness of zzso gene zzso
