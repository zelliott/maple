African zzso fever virus zzso growth and plaque formation were inhibited by zzso acid zzso zzso of 200 zzso or zzso One spontaneous zzso and two zzso isolated from zzso virus were resistant to zzso zzso and showed practically normal viral DNA synthesis in the presence of zzso DNA zzso activity present in the zzso fraction from cells infected with the zzso required zzso higher zzso of zzso for zzso compared to equivalent zzso of the zzso zzso Like zzso virus, the zzso zzso were resistant to zzso by zzso zzso rescue analysis with zzso DNA fragments covering different regions of the zzso DNA zzso gene mapped the zzso within a zzso which was cloned and zzso A single zzso and zzso acid change was assigned to each zzso Two of the zzso zzso lie within the highly zzso region II common to zzso DNA zzso which has been implicated in zzso binding and probably also in zzso zzso The other zzso was localized to within a region of moderate zzso among viral DNA zzso close to one of the motifs allegedly considered as zzso the zzso zzso active zzso
