zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso play an important role in development and maintenance of cellular organization and in tissue zzso Several zzso proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso contain zzso with zzso to zzso growth factor zzso and exhibit growth promoting zzso The zzso activity of zzso is restricted to a zzso which consists of about 25 repeating zzso with partial zzso to zzso and comprises the zzso inner regions of the three short arms of the four armed zzso The zzso activity does not correlate with promotion of cell attachment and zzso outgrowth for which major functional sites have been found in other regions of the zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso zzso in zzso in other zzso proteins and in the zzso portions of some membrane proteins are signals for cellular growth and zzso Because they are integral parts of large molecules and often of zzso zzso these zzso are well suited to stimulate neighboring cells in a specific and zzso zzso This concept of localized growth or differentiation signals offers an attractive mechanism for the regulation of cellular zzso
