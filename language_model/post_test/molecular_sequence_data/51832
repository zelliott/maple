This manuscript describes the design of new vaccines based on synthetic zzso To this end, we first analyze the structural basis of zzso zzso and specificity and the various types of zzso that form the mosaics of zzso zzso as well as the regulatory mechanisms involved in immune zzso A distinction is made between sequential or continuous zzso and zzso or zzso ones, which are the majority of zzso in zzso zzso In this context it is of particular interest to identify zzso reacting with B cells and T cells, respectively, or with zzso T cells, in association with the major zzso zzso zzso and the role of these interactions in protective zzso Identification of such zzso in proteins of zzso zzso or zzso organisms led to the synthesis of zzso which when used in conjunction with appropriate carriers and/or zzso induced zzso zzso zzso examples are zzso zzso bacterial zzso and mainly those of toxins of diphtheria, zzso and zzso leading not only to zzso zzso but also to protective immunity against the deleterious effects of the respective zzso zzso zzso such as those leading to zzso zzso based on either the zzso or the zzso stage zzso viral zzso leading to protective zzso with special emphasis on influenza virus where induction of zzso is zzso and finally, synthetic zzso vaccines against zzso which should lead to broad specificity protective immunity while avoiding the risks of a vaccine based on the infectious zzso The rapid recent progress in this field, as described in this review, increases the prospect of constructing successful synthetic zzso vaccines in the not too distant zzso
