We previously described the integration of a zzso zzso zzso virus zzso into the zzso of a zzso Marek disease virus zzso following both long-term and short-term zzso in cultured zzso The long-term zzso occurred in the course of attenuating the zzso of the zzso strain of zzso and was sustained for zzso 100 zzso The short-term zzso which spanned only 16 passages, was designed to recreate the zzso phenomenon under controlled zzso We found that zzso zzso into zzso were common and could occur within the first passage following zzso Now we have mapped the integration zzso After zzso passages in zzso 17 out of 19 zzso junction sites are clustered in two zzso regions at the junctions of the short unique and short repeat region of zzso In the long-term zzso experiment, 6 out of 10 insertions also mapped in this zzso In both cases, integrated zzso are unstable and undergo subsequent zzso zzso often leaving a solitary long terminal zzso The long terminal repeat sequences are, however, zzso maintained for many rounds of zzso in zzso This zzso of insertions presumably is influenced by selection for viable and fast-growing zzso and occurs in a region of the zzso zzso which shows significant size zzso in several zzso
