zzso changes of the zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the development of resistance to zzso therapy in zzso zzso We have isolated zzso zzso fragments from seven tumor specimens derived from patients with advanced zzso zzso zzso In one zzso obtained from a patient who failed to respond to zzso and zzso therapy we have detected a point zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso This zzso zzso is a zzso transition at zzso zzso that leads to substitution of zzso for the wild type zzso at position zzso It is a zzso zzso because it was not present in the zzso zzso DNA fragments isolated from zzso and zzso zzso of the same zzso The zzso zzso was recreated in an expression zzso and zzso expressed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso does not differ from the wild type zzso in its ability to bind zzso The zzso constant for the synthetic zzso zzso was 3 zzso for both zzso There was also no significant difference in binding of other steroids and zzso zzso as revealed by competition binding zzso However, zzso experiments to determine the zzso potential of the zzso zzso produced differences in the action of this zzso compared to the wild type zzso zzso and the synthetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso were equally zzso in zzso zzso activity to both the zzso and wild type zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso a higher zzso through the zzso than through the wild type zzso These data demonstrate that the exchange of a single zzso into zzso at position zzso in the zzso promoters zzso not only by zzso but also by adrenal zzso and zzso This pattern of zzso zzso may have significance in the process controlling the progression of zzso zzso
