zzso a 34 zzso zzso produced by strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts zzso activity against zzso bacteria at the zzso zzso The structural aspects of zzso which facilitate membrane interaction and zzso have been investigated in zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso fragments and zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments zzso and zzso had little effect on zzso mobility, on zzso electrical zzso or on zzso release from zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso A zzso induced a zzso reduction in zzso mobility, indicative of zzso surface zzso as well as a decline in membrane zzso rise in zzso and zzso release from zzso In these respects zzso zzso A is similar to native zzso zzso zzso were also engineered to generate zzso and zzso zzso A zzso both of which were similar to zzso zzso A with respect to an overall reduction in zzso zzso While the zzso zzso A zzso zzso a higher increase in membrane zzso and electrical zzso than zzso zzso A, the zzso zzso A zzso zzso weaker zzso These results point to a substantial role for zzso charged zzso in controlling zzso flow through zzso zzso Native zzso and zzso elicit an enhanced release of zzso from zzso composed of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso bearing no net charge, suggesting that an zzso attraction encourages the initial zzso zzso The results are discussed in the context of other recently proposed models for zzso zzso
