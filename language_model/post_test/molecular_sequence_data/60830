zzso analysis of the zzso zzso 68 zzso zzso revealed an open reading frame zzso 4) which is zzso to a family of proteins known as the regulators of complement zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted gene 4 product has zzso to other zzso zzso RCA zzso as well as to the zzso proteins zzso factor and membrane zzso zzso zzso by Northern zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends revealed that gene 4 is transcribed as a zzso zzso transcript of the late kinetic zzso Three zzso RCA protein zzso zzso to 65 zzso 50 to 55 zzso and 40 to 45 zzso were detected by Western zzso of infected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A soluble zzso to zzso zzso was detected in the zzso of zzso infected zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso RCA protein was expressed on the surfaces of infected zzso zzso from zzso infected cells contained an activity that inhibited zzso complement zzso as measured by zzso of zzso deposition on activated zzso zzso zzso zzso RCA zzso containing the four zzso short consensus repeats, inhibited zzso zzso deposition on zzso via both classical and alternative pathways and inhibited deposition of human zzso on activated zzso zzso zzso of this inhibitor of complement zzso both at the cell surface and in the fluid phase, may be important for zzso zzso via the zzso of innate and zzso zzso
