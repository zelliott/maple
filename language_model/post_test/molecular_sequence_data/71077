zzso zzso possesses a complex zzso system, which is essential for both its growth and evasion of host defense zzso In this report we zzso both at a protein and zzso level, a novel zzso of this system with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso and its zzso activity and zzso properties were zzso The zzso acid sequence at the zzso zzso and of internal zzso fragments enabled identification of the gene zzso this zzso which we refer to as zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene encodes an zzso zzso which contains a zzso zzso characteristic for members of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso However, it does not share any structural similarity to other zzso zzso which belong to the zzso zzso The production of zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso of zzso tissue destruction through the mutual interaction of this zzso host and bacterial zzso and zzso zzso in the degradation of collagen during the course of zzso
