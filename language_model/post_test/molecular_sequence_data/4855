zzso zzso zzso zzso has been found in the zzso of many bacterial species but its biological function is zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The predicted protein sequence shows only zzso identity to zzso zzso zzso and from this its zzso location and its immediate proximity to a zzso zzso zzso in zzso is speculated to have been acquired by zzso horizontal transfer from an unknown zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso on zzso growth in rich medium but showed enhanced sensitivity in zzso to the zzso action of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed reduced zzso in a mouse model of oral infection and persisted in significantly lower numbers in zzso and zzso after zzso infection, suggesting that zzso plays a role in zzso protecting zzso against oxygen zzso host zzso There was, however, no zzso difference compared with wild type in the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso mouse zzso or zzso zzso in zzso perhaps reflecting the zzso capacity of different zzso lines to kill zzso the most efficient overwhelming the proposed protective effect of zzso zzso
