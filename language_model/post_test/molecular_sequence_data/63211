The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso are zzso proteins zzso by almost 200 genes in the zzso zzso Despite of their high number, the available information on the potential function of zzso is very zzso In this report, the sequence analysis and the gene expression pattern of 14 members of one of the zzso zzso families zzso class zzso are zzso zzso comparison indicated that gene zzso played a significant role in the formation of the zzso family and that several members carry an zzso zzso stress zzso zzso zzso In order to gain insight into the potential function of the zzso VI zzso real-time quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was used to determine the relative transcript levels in the various zzso of the zzso plant as well as under a series of zzso zzso treatments in zzso The obtained data revealed the zzso regulated expression of the genes in agreement with a high zzso of sequence elements in their zzso The divergent expression patterns indicate that the zzso zzso proteins may be involved in a wide variety of signal zzso pathways related to plant development and stress zzso The significance of gene zzso and expression divergence in the extension of the zzso zzso VI family during evolution is zzso
