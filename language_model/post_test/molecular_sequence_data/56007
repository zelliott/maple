A soluble zzso zzso whose synthesis is induced by and that binds zzso was zzso to apparent zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso had a zzso molecular mass of zzso zzso as determined by zzso and a zzso of zzso The electronic zzso spectrum indicates that the native zzso in the absence of zzso is predominantly in the zzso state zzso zzso state in 50 zzso zzso pH zzso 25 degrees zzso zzso binds to the zzso with a zzso zzso constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pH zzso 25 degrees zzso and zzso a zzso transition of the zzso iron to the zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso activity zzso it was demonstrated that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso to produce zzso The zzso binds other zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso The affinity of zzso for these compounds is lower than that of zzso and they are less effective than zzso at inducing a transition in the zzso iron to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not induce a spin zzso
