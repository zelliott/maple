The zzso gene product of zzso zzso is required for the zzso of two sets of zzso zzso the zzso genes zzso only in a zzso and the zzso genes zzso only in alpha zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso prepared by in zzso zzso and translation, is capable of forming complexes with zzso DNA fragments from two zzso zzso zzso zzso but not a zzso zzso produce a factor that forms complexes with labeled DNA from these same two zzso We use zzso with zzso extracts to zzso the binding site for the zzso zzso This site zzso to the sequence identified as the zzso induction element, which is responsible for increased zzso of genes when cells are exposed to zzso or zzso Thus the zzso protein may be an ultimate zzso in the signal zzso zzso triggered by zzso
