Small heat shock proteins zzso form large zzso that are zzso by their dynamic zzso zzso complex zzso and extensive zzso zzso These processes are interrelated with zzso zzso zzso bind a broad spectrum of unrelated zzso proteins under zzso zzso zzso knowledge about the binding process and regions critical for zzso interaction is zzso In this study, we screened zzso zzso spot libraries derived from a bacterial zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to detect zzso and zzso interaction sites, zzso In line with previous results, it was demonstrated that multiple contacts involving the zzso and zzso extensions and the central zzso domain are required for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso membrane with zzso revealed a putative zzso interaction zzso A soluble zzso with the sequence zzso zzso corresponding to that site inhibited zzso activity of zzso presumably by blocking their zzso zzso
