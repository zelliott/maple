A deletion of the long arm of zzso 5 is a recurring zzso in zzso zzso zzso In previous studies, we identified an approximately zzso segment in zzso that was deleted in all patients zzso As part of a zzso cloning project to identify transcribed sequences in this region, we identified and characterized the zzso zzso This gene contains 10 zzso that extend over 19 zzso The composite zzso is approximately zzso zzso and encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso with a predicted molecular mass of 55 zzso The zzso half of this putative protein contains an internally repeated domain of 43 zzso zzso which resembles the zzso half of an zzso domain from the immense skeletal muscle protein zzso The zzso gene is expressed in multiple muscle tissue types as well as in zzso zzso and bone zzso We evaluated the gene as a candidate tumor zzso gene by searching for zzso in zzso zzso disorders with abnormalities of zzso zzso However, we detected no zzso zzso A single zzso change zzso to zzso was identified at zzso position 1889 in the untranslated region of the zzso which may represent a zzso zzso zzso is unlikely to be the candidate tumor zzso gene involved in zzso zzso zzso
