zzso zzso zzso zzso are one branch of a zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that are known for their relatively high levels of expression in male zzso However, zzso expression has been observed at low levels in female antennae of the zzso zzso and zzso and at relatively high levels in members of the zzso The function of female zzso expression is zzso as female zzso are consistently noted for their failure to respond zzso or zzso to zzso In this study, the sexual zzso of zzso expression was examined in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso clone was isolated from female zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated relatively high levels of zzso expression in both male and female zzso though females consistently expressed about 50% that of zzso Western zzso analysis of male and female zzso expression supported these relative zzso zzso analysis indicates discrete expression localized beneath zzso zzso of both male and female zzso These results suggest female zzso possess the zzso to detect at least components of their zzso zzso these results may suggest that zzso have a more general function in zzso possibly reflecting behavioral and life history differences that distinguish this the zzso from other zzso zzso
