To study the zzso of the zzso approximately zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso sequences in zzso zzso 

The zzso approximately zzso zzso ITS sequences of 22 zzso species (30 reference strains and 16 clinical zzso were determined by zzso zzso The sequences determined by this study and those reported in zzso were zzso by zzso program zzso Package zzso zzso zzso zzso Madison, zzso The percentage similarity of sequence pairs was calculated and a cluster analysis zzso was constructed by zzso zzso 

The zzso approximately zzso zzso ITS sequences among zzso species had highly zzso except that zzso tuberculosis complex zzso sequences were highly zzso The similarity between sequence pairs was zzso to zzso zzso species could be isolated by cluster analysis zzso The results showed that sequence analysis of the zzso approximately zzso zzso ITS can differentiate zzso from zzso zzso zzso and identify zzso at species zzso 

zzso approximately zzso zzso ITS sequences can be used as target genes in zzso zzso
