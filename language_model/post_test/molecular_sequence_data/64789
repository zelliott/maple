Study of early and transient response gene expression is important for understanding the mechanisms of response to growth stimuli and zzso agents such as zzso stress, and zzso Many of the zzso zzso and other zzso expressed gene products are zzso by zzso that contain zzso elements zzso in their 3' untranslated regions zzso In this article, we describe an approach to selectively zzso zzso zzso zzso using an innovative combination of culture treatment, zzso of reverse zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and use of zzso zzso zzso The zzso cell line, zzso was treated with zzso and zzso to enrich for zzso gene expression followed by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with simultaneous suppression of abundant zzso was made possible using the procedure as monitored by the preferential expression of zzso an zzso zzso over the abundant zzso zzso zzso The use of zzso dramatically reversed zzso zzso resulting in almost complete suppression of zzso zzso Finally, construction of specialized zzso libraries confirmed the selectivity of zzso and the presence of rare zzso The ability to reverse the abundance of zzso and other highly expressed genes toward ARE genes zzso the discovery and study of rare early response and zzso expressed zzso
