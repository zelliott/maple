zzso acid zzso is a zzso involved in signal zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of PA to zzso zzso an important precursor for the synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso We describe in this study the isolation and characterization of a human zzso clone that encodes zzso acid sequences zzso to zzso coli, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of this human zzso under the control of a zzso promoter in a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso its growth zzso and produces zzso activity when induced with zzso zzso of this zzso into zzso cells leads to increased zzso activity in zzso extracts using an in zzso zzso that measures the conversion of zzso to zzso This increase in zzso activity also leads to increased zzso of tumor necrosis zzso and zzso from zzso zzso cells upon stimulation with zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may amplify cellular signaling responses from zzso
