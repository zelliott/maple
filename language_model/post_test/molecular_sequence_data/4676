The structural and functional organization of the zzso complex was addressed by genetic analyses of zzso interactions and zzso zzso among five of the eight different essential zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing zzso at the zzso putative zzso zzso zzso are zzso whereas single and multiple replacements of the corresponding motif in zzso are well tolerated by the zzso We demonstrated zzso that zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso specifically suppresses the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that this suppression can be modulated by zzso in a putative zzso zzso zzso and the putative zzso pocket of zzso Our results suggest that the zzso ring is comprised of a single zzso containing eight zzso of differential functional zzso in which zzso zzso of zzso takes place in a sequential manner different from the concerted zzso proposed for zzso
