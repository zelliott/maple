We have studied the effects of zzso in a zzso segment of zzso zzso zzso zzso which lies within a zzso domain whose sequence and secondary structure are zzso in zzso from many divergent organisms, including the zzso component of human signal recognition particle zzso Surprisingly, many changes in this region can be tolerated under normal growth zzso An exception is the zzso of several zzso at positions 159 and zzso 2 zzso previously shown to be protected from zzso zzso by the zzso canine zzso zzso zzso 160 is, in addition, the most highly zzso base in a consensus sequence for the most common zzso loop in zzso zzso zzso that are likely to affect the stability and/or zzso of the zzso give rise to a conditional zzso when zzso of the medium is raised, the zzso become partially or completely defective in function at high zzso
