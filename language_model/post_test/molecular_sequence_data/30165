The zzso transport zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso has been zzso in zzso coli zzso The DNA sequence of a zzso zzso that codes for the zzso carrier has been determined and the gene product has been characterized with the zzso promoter zzso The DNA zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso base pairs and codes for a protein of zzso zzso zzso The zzso profile suggests that the protein is very zzso and contains 12 zzso segments centered around a zzso zzso The gene for the zzso carrier has zzso similarity with a zzso carrier zzso from a naturally occurring zzso responsible for secondary transport of zzso across the zzso membrane of zzso zzso
