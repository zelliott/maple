zzso produce several proteins that induce zzso zzso zzso Although cockroaches are abundant in warm and humid areas, zzso to zzso zzso has not been investigated in zzso 

The aims of this study were to investigate the frequency of zzso zzso among patients with zzso zzso or both in Brazil and to identify American zzso zzso 

zzso tests using zzso extracts were performed on children and young adults with zzso zzso or zzso A zzso zzso complementary zzso library was screened by using zzso zzso from Brazilian patients allergic to zzso zzso of an zzso directed to zzso zzso zzso against zzso tissue was examined by zzso 

zzso zzso was present in zzso and zzso of the patients, as determined by using skin prick tests alone or combined prick and zzso tests, zzso Five zzso clones reacted with zzso zzso and contained the same zzso A representative clone zzso zzso zzso 12, coded for a protein that reacted with 50% of the zzso from patients allergic to cockroaches on plaque zzso and showed a high degree of zzso to zzso particularly those from zzso P zzso zzso showed zzso zzso and zzso sequence identity to zzso from D zzso D zzso and shrimp, respectively, which have been previously defined as important zzso An zzso directed against D zzso zzso which also recognizes shrimp zzso showed binding to zzso zzso zzso 

Our results support the recommendation that zzso extracts should be routinely used for the evaluation of patients with zzso zzso or both in zzso The identification of P zzso zzso as an important zzso will make it possible to investigate zzso among cockroaches, zzso and food derived from zzso
