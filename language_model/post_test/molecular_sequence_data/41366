A ring of zzso identical zzso is essential for zzso by the rotary zzso of the ubiquitous zzso Here we present the crystal structure at zzso resolution of the zzso from zzso of a higher plant zzso zzso determined using a native zzso The crystal structure was found to resemble that of an zzso zzso Using elastic network modeling to investigate the zzso zzso we found five dominant modes of motion that fell into three zzso They revealed the following zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso opposite twisting of the zzso circular surface of the ring against the zzso surface, and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the middle, resulting in zzso of the zzso Extension of the elastic network analysis to rings of different zzso revealed the same classes of dominant modes as in zzso zzso zzso We suggest the following functional roles for these zzso The first and third classes of modes affect the interaction of the zzso with its counterparts in zzso namely zzso a and zzso These modes are likely to be involved in zzso and zzso zzso The second class of zzso along with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso might serve to zzso buffer the zzso transmission between zzso and zzso
