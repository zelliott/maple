We have shown zzso zzso zzso gene expression in transgenic zzso plants using an zzso zzso with a zzso zzso spanning the translation start zzso of the zzso zzso was expressed from the zzso zzso zzso promoter and the zzso zzso was expressed from the zzso zzso promoter of zzso zzso A range of zzso zzso from 0 to zzso was obtained by screening a small population of transgenic plants and the specific levels of zzso observed were zzso inherited in two zzso An zzso zzso dosage effect was observed in plants which were zzso for zzso zzso detection results suggest that duplex formation with the 41 base pair zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and that an excess of zzso zzso was not zzso Our results demonstrate the potential of zzso zzso as a strategy for obtaining plant zzso especially zzso zzso in essential genes where only a short zzso sequence of the zzso is zzso They also suggest that the zzso zzso on gene expression could be used in conjunction with an zzso zzso strategy to provide a versatile approach for crop zzso
