We have developed zzso for identifying zzso with highly restricted expression within the zzso One zzso zzso restricted to sparse zzso zzso of the cerebral zzso and zzso encodes zzso the precursor of a zzso zzso that shares 11 zzso acids with zzso zzso binds to all five cloned zzso receptors when they are expressed in zzso cells and zzso zzso activity, but, unlike zzso it reduces locomotor activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso whose zzso accumulates during sleep zzso apparently acts by zzso the effects of zzso on cortical zzso thereby causing synchronization brain slow zzso A single zzso acid difference with zzso accounts for the dramatic differences in the effects of the two peptides on physiology and zzso A second zzso zzso restricted to zzso large zzso cell bodies of the zzso zzso encodes zzso the precursor of two peptides that share zzso with each other and with members of the zzso zzso zzso The peptides are detected zzso in zzso zzso at zzso of fibers that project to zzso zzso and diverse targets in other brain zzso The peptides are zzso when applied to cultured zzso zzso Recent studies by zzso and colleagues zzso have identified the zzso peptides (called the zzso by those zzso as zzso for two orphan receptors at which they stimulate zzso zzso zzso and collaborators showed that the zzso for these peptides accumulates during food zzso The zzso projections suggest additional zzso roles for the zzso These studies suggest the common mechanism of regulation for necessary, but zzso behaviors zzso and zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso that create a pressure for the voluntary zzso
