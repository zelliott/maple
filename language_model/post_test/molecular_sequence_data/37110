Isolation of zzso peptides from the zzso has contributed to the understanding of T cell zzso However, these zzso peptides have been isolated from various zzso and human cell zzso The specific zzso responsible for the zzso of inflammatory zzso disease is zzso We examined zzso peptides bound to the class II major zzso complex zzso groove in human zzso by zzso tandem mass zzso equipped with online zzso high performance liquid zzso We detected 55 parent proteins from 4 controls, 9 patients with zzso zzso and 9 patients with Crohn's zzso The calculated molecular masses zzso of these peptides ranged from zzso to zzso representing zzso zzso acid zzso Fifty-one of these 55 parent proteins were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides were found frequently in patients with inflammatory zzso zzso The present results suggest that in zzso zzso processing by zzso cells and T zzso in human zzso participate with zzso zzso zzso Increased immune responses against zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso found in patients with inflammatory zzso may participate as zzso immune responses to enteric zzso in the zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso
