Although zzso zzso was discovered as a potent vascular zzso zzso zzso its presumed zzso and zzso roles are now considered much more diverse than originally zzso zzso in the brain is thought to be deeply involved in the central zzso control and zzso zzso zzso possibly as a zzso or a hormone that functions locally in an zzso manner or widely through delivery by the zzso fluid zzso This notion is based on the following lines of zzso zzso zzso zzso its zzso converting zzso and receptors all are detected at strategic sites in the central nervous system zzso especially those controlling the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is present in the zzso at zzso higher than in the zzso zzso There is a topographical correspondence of zzso and its receptors in the zzso zzso The zzso is released by primary cultures of zzso zzso zzso When zzso binds to its zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso An zzso or topical application of zzso to zzso sites elicits a pattern of zzso changes accompanied by responses of zzso and respiratory zzso zzso Recently generated knockout mice with disrupted genes zzso zzso zzso along with zzso in a subset of the zzso of neural crest cell zzso zzso abnormalities including zzso of zzso pressure, sympathetic zzso and impairment of the respiratory zzso zzso evidence is expected from thorough analyses of knockout mice by applying conventional experimental zzso
