The zzso protein zzso is involved in cellular transformation and zzso but is also a potent zzso of programmed cell death, or zzso Whether these apparently opposite functions are zzso through common or distinct molecular mechanisms remains zzso zzso and its partner zzso Max, zzso and bind DNA in zzso and in zzso through zzso zzso motifs zzso By using complementary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso efficiently with each other but not with their zzso partners, we demonstrate that both cell cycle progression and zzso in zzso zzso zzso are induced by zzso zzso zzso or zzso alone are zzso but zzso restores ability to prevent withdrawal from the cell cycle and to induce cell death upon removal of growth zzso Thus, zzso can control two alternative cell fates through zzso with a single partner, zzso
