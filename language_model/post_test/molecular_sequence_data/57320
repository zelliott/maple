The T cell zzso response to dengue 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed in zzso using either killed virus or zzso fragments or synthetic zzso zzso dengue virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cells from zzso primed zzso mice proliferated in zzso in response to three zzso zzso zzso fragments expressed in zzso coli as zzso fused to zzso zzso zzso zzso To further determine T cell zzso in the zzso synthetic peptides were selected using prediction zzso for T cell zzso zzso zzso responses were obtained after in zzso exposure of zzso zzso cells to peptides zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was able to induce specific B and T cell responses in zzso mice of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two peptides zzso corresponding to two dengue zzso and Sri zzso zzso and differing only at position 71 zzso at the B but not at the T cell level in zzso zzso This analysis of zzso T helper cell response to dengue zzso may be of use in dengue zzso vaccine zzso
