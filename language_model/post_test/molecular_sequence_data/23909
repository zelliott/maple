A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 45 zzso zzso was identified by screening the zzso expression library for zzso cells with serum from an zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of zzso was determined to be zzso zzso and to zzso zzso zzso acids with an apparent molecular mass of 45 zzso The zzso transcripts were detected in different zzso and were relatively rich in human liver and lung zzso but scarce in brain zzso zzso with zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is strongly expressed in zzso and cannot be seen in zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and fusion proteins zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso zzso into 1-2 dots in the zzso and always near the nuclear zzso The zzso zzso of zzso appeared to be slightly larger than zzso and in some cases were found to zzso with zzso After effectively zzso the zzso by zzso the growth and proliferation of the cells were significantly zzso and zzso was detected to be zzso The zzso of zzso also resulted in an appearance of zzso and zzso cells, which finally went to zzso Our results suggest that zzso is a highly zzso novel zzso which is expressed in a cell zzso manner and seemed to be involved in cell cycle progression and cell zzso
