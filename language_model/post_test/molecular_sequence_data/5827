Previously we described an embryonic cell surface zzso zzso associated with the zzso lethal zzso of the mouse zzso zzso This zzso is expressed on the cell surface of both early mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso is localized to areas of zzso contact in zzso lines and redistributes to the outer edges of the zzso during zzso thereby indicating a potential role in embryonic zzso zzso We now report that this zzso zzso is zzso to the mouse zzso membrane zzso zzso Limited protein sequence analyses of the zzso terminal and an internal zzso indicate considerable zzso with the zzso zzso zzso parameters such as protein core size, zzso and zzso status, and resistance to zzso also demonstrate zzso While we detect only a single message with a mouse zzso zzso probe via Northern zzso Southern analyses indicate the existence of at least two zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we present evidence suggesting that zzso serves as a zzso which may be zzso zzso by the activities of the gene products of the different zzso zzso
