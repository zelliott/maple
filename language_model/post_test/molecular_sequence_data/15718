Many human zzso including zzso zzso the zzso agent of diphtheria, use host compounds such as zzso and zzso as essential iron zzso In this study, we examined the zzso zzso zzso transport region, a genetic cluster that contains the zzso genes zzso a previously described zzso zzso zzso and three additional zzso which we have designated zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene cluster is composed of three distinct zzso zzso The zzso gene appears to be part of an zzso and zzso zzso that includes zzso while zzso and zzso are transcribed from unique zzso zzso zzso deletion of either zzso or the zzso genes resulted in a reduced ability to use zzso as an iron source, while deletion of zzso had no effect on zzso iron zzso in zzso zzso A comparison of the predicted zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso showed that they share some sequence zzso and both proteins contain leader sequences and putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso showed that zzso is associated predominantly with the cell envelope when the zzso is grown in minimal medium but is zzso during growth in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected primarily in the zzso membrane fraction regardless of the growth zzso zzso binding studies demonstrated that zzso and zzso are able to bind zzso suggesting that these proteins may function as cell surface zzso receptors in zzso zzso
