We have isolated a zzso clone zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso by screening a zzso zzso library in zzso zzso with zzso from sheep infected zzso with zzso zzso This zzso termed zzso was zzso and expressed in the zzso zzso as a soluble fusion protein with zzso zzso having an apparent molecular mass of 46 zzso zzso raised against the zzso fusion protein recognized a native zzso of 25 zzso in zzso of zzso zzso In an zzso with zzso from zzso infected zzso the zzso zzso zzso could differentiate infections with zzso zzso from those with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso the research described here reports the identification of the first zzso zzso zzso zzso that may be useful for zzso of a zzso test for the diagnosis of zzso infections in zzso
