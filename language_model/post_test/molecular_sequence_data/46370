A zzso variable zzso zzso zzso against zzso Re zzso was constructed and applied to an zzso zzso zzso zzso for determining the total concentration of zzso in various zzso The variable heavy and light chain genes were cloned directly from the zzso of the zzso zzso cell line and assembled by means of zzso by overlapping extension zzso zzso using specific zzso designed to have flexible zzso zzso between the variable heavy chain and light chain zzso The constructed zzso gene was zzso into the zzso expression zzso and transformed into zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso zzso against zzso zzso was expressed as a zzso protein containing the zzso at its zzso zzso by immobilized metal zzso affinity zzso zzso and zzso by a zzso dialysis zzso The yield of zzso after zzso was zzso zzso per liter of culture zzso zzso of zzso revealed that it retained the characteristics of the parental zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso which has wide zzso with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso range for zzso in zzso using zzso zzso was zzso zzso Based on validation analysis, the use of zzso in zzso is a precise, accurate, and sensitive zzso In light of the time-consuming and zzso procedures for the preparation of zzso speedy bacterial expression of zzso is a powerful alternative tool for producing zzso to use in zzso for quantitative analysis of total zzso zzso
