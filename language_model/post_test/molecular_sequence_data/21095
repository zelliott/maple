The basic zzso zzso zzso factors zzso comprise one of the largest families of zzso involved in zzso and zzso processes in zzso Here, we describe the functional characterization of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated from tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso originate from two ancestors of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso share high sequence similarity with other known zzso zzso zzso and are predominantly expressed in zzso zzso expression driven by the zzso promoter is consistent with zzso transcript profile in tobacco zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso using zzso cells and tobacco zzso zzso expression of zzso or zzso enhances zzso zzso in tobacco zzso In transgenic tobacco expressing zzso or zzso both zzso of early and late zzso zzso genes were zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso proteins interact with the previously characterized zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex activated the promoters of two key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The promoter zzso is severely zzso by dominant repressive forms of either zzso or zzso created by fusing the zzso zzso domain to the zzso Our results show that zzso and zzso act in concert to regulate the zzso zzso in tobacco flowers and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso
