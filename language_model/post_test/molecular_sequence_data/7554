zzso zzso are the most common pelvic tumors, occurring in one of four women, and they represent the single most common indication for zzso The genesis and zzso factors responsible for their development are poorly zzso We speculate that growth hormone may play a role in the initiation of these zzso women with zzso have a higher zzso of zzso and growth hormone promotes zzso growth in rats, with or without the addition of zzso We evaluated the presence of growth hormone zzso zzso zzso acid in the human zzso and zzso to investigate whether growth hormone might act directly rather than by zzso generation of zzso growth zzso 

zzso samples of zzso and adjacent normal zzso from nine zzso women (32 to 52 years old) were collected at zzso Three patients received a zzso hormone zzso for 3 months before the surgical zzso six did not receive any zzso zzso We used a zzso zzso sharing no zzso to the growth zzso protein or to the zzso zzso to investigate whether growth hormone zzso zzso zzso acid was present in tissue sections or amplified complementary zzso acid from zzso and the surrounding zzso 

The ratios of growth hormone zzso zzso zzso in zzso and the surrounding zzso as assessed by zzso analysis of zzso chain reaction products were similar and were not altered by zzso hormone zzso zzso In zzso zzso localized the growth hormone zzso zzso zzso acid to the zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso 

The presence of growth hormone zzso zzso zzso acid suggests that the human zzso is a target tissue for growth hormone zzso Future investigations are needed to investigate further the role of growth hormone in the development of zzso
