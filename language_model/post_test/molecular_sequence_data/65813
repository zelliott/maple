zzso zzso zzso from different zzso organisms are attracting attention as relevant players in zzso biology, and consequently being considered as candidates for drug and vaccine zzso In fact, the highest protection level achieved in zzso zzso by a native zzso was previously reported by us, using a zzso zzso as zzso in a sheep trial against zzso Here, we report the cloning of a full-length zzso from adult zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso and functional expression and characterization of the corresponding zzso zzso was closely related to zzso zzso but interestingly distant from their zzso zzso zzso and was expressed in all stages of the zzso life zzso The zzso zzso functionally expressed in zzso coli, showed a marked zzso preference against the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso and was also active against zzso and zzso Both native and zzso zzso were zzso by the addition of zzso zzso predominantly zzso and strongly inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso properties, zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis, and zzso of zzso immune serum demonstrated that the zzso zzso was identical to the previously zzso zzso zzso from adult zzso zzso zzso trials using zzso for rabbit zzso showed a strong zzso response and a highly significant level of protection after experimental infection with zzso zzso zzso confirming that zzso is a relevant candidate for vaccine zzso
