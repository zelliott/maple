The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso contains four structural zzso two zzso open reading zzso and more than five potential genes of unknown zzso Despite this relative zzso the molecular regulation of zzso replication and assembly is not zzso Here, we report that two viral zzso zzso the zzso membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso are necessary and sufficient for formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these two proteins were zzso by using preferred human zzso When M and N expression plasmids were zzso into human zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso formed zzso The addition of a third zzso zzso the spike zzso zzso facilitated budding of particles that contained a zzso halo resembling zzso when examined by transmission electron zzso with a buoyant density characteristic of zzso zzso zzso interactions of these proteins were also shown in zzso The zzso M, and N proteins of the zzso are, therefore, necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso These findings advance the understanding of the zzso of zzso and enable the generation of safe, zzso zzso of the SARS virus that may facilitate the development of vaccines and zzso zzso
