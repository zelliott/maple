The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which is involved in the central regulation of appetite and zzso Despite the great interest in this zzso tools for detecting this zzso (as expressed on the cell surface in its native zzso have been zzso zzso or otherwise labeled zzso showed low zzso specificity to this particular zzso zzso zzso Also, the zzso were only available for zzso that were displayed in the zzso To produce zzso that enable the detection of this zzso (as expressed on the cell surface without disruption of the target zzso a candidate zzso was selected from the zzso zzso by a zzso analysis of the zzso secondary zzso This particular region was then zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice with the zzso proteins induced a specific immune reaction, which resulted in the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the specificity of these zzso To examine whether this tool also zzso with native cell zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with the human zzso zzso They were analyzed with these zzso using Western zzso and flow zzso zzso and exclusion of zzso of these zzso to other zzso receptors were further confirmed by an zzso analysis of the zzso cells that were zzso with other zzso zzso zzso It is evident that with the availability of this zzso studies on the zzso and zzso as well as the regulation mechanism of the zzso zzso will be largely zzso
