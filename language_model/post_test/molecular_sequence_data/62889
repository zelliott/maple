Animal zzso are membrane proteins controlling cell zzso zzso and zzso In zzso the zzso zzso controls an zzso function required for the penetration of zzso zzso into host zzso An zzso of zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso plant pathogen zzso zzso We constructed a zzso zzso zzso by targeted gene zzso zzso is not zzso on intact plant zzso of zzso tomato or rose, but it zzso wounded plant zzso Both wild type and zzso differentiate zzso on plant and artificial surfaces, a process involving an arrest of polarized growth, zzso swelling and its cell wall zzso Although zzso zzso allowed the penetration of the fungus into the host plant within zzso zzso no successful penetration events were observed with zzso suggesting that its zzso are not zzso An zzso zzso fusion showed that zzso was specifically expressed in zzso germ tubes and zzso during host zzso Our results indicate that zzso is required for the penetration of zzso zzso into intact host zzso The zzso in zzso of zzso also demonstrates that functional zzso zzso zzso are required for a successful penetration zzso As zzso and zzso zzso penetration defects are similar, zzso zzso are likely to be required for an essential zzso function widespread among zzso
