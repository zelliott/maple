The zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso is the most powerful and ubiquitous intrinsic inhibitor of zzso We have shown previously that the translation of zzso is controlled by a potent internal zzso entry site zzso zzso zzso translation of zzso is increased in response to cellular stress, suggesting the critical role for zzso translation during cellular zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso nuclear zzso C1 and C2 zzso and zzso are part of the zzso complex that forms on zzso zzso Furthermore, the cellular levels of zzso and zzso parallel the activity of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso specifically enhanced translation of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso may zzso zzso zzso Given the central role of zzso in the regulation of zzso these results are important for our understanding of the control of zzso
