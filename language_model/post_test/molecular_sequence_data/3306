zzso yellow mosaic virus zzso zzso emerged as an important pathogen of zzso within the last 20 zzso Its origins and mechanisms for evolution and worldwide spread represent important questions to understand plant virus zzso zzso analysis on a 250 zzso zzso including the zzso part of the coat protein coding region, revealed one major group of zzso and some highly divergent zzso from distinct zzso Within the major group, three zzso of strains were defined without correlation with geographic origin, year of collection or biological zzso zzso was first observed in Martinique and zzso in 1992 and 1994, zzso We studied the evolution of zzso zzso on both islands in the few years following the putative virus zzso In zzso molecular divergence remained low even after 6 years, suggesting a lack of new zzso zzso between strains resulted in a stability of the high biological zzso while the zzso diversity decreased and molecular divergence remained zzso In zzso as in Martinique in 1993, zzso zzso was high shortly after virus zzso While the first introduction in zzso was independent from zzso the zzso type was detected in 1998, suggesting further introductions, maybe through zzso zzso or imported plant zzso
