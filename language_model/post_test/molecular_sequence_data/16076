The zzso operators of two naturally evolved zzso resistance zzso differ by a zzso to zzso transition at the sixth base zzso This zzso prevents zzso recognition of these zzso operators by their respective two zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid side chains responsible for this zzso distinction of operators were zzso For this purpose in zzso zzso of the two zzso genes were zzso zzso sites were introduced by zzso zzso in both genes followed by the exchange of different coding segments between zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were expressed and their operator recognition specificity was scored in zzso zzso gradually smaller coding segments led finally to a single zzso acid exchange in both genes at position 40 of the primary zzso Each zzso zzso containing zzso at this position recognizes the zzso operator while those with Ala recognize the zzso operator regardless of the rest of the zzso This result demonstrates clearly that the zzso acid 40 of zzso zzso contacts and recognizes base pair 6 of zzso zzso zzso interference of the large zzso side chain with the zzso group of zzso and a possible involvement of the zzso in hydrogen bonding to the operator are discussed as the molecular basis of this differentiation between zzso and zzso base zzso
