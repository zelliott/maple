The genetic cascade that zzso zzso zzso zzso is starting to be zzso In the zzso the lateral asymmetry of the body axis is revealed first by the zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso in the left lateral plate zzso of the zzso zzso Here we describe a novel zzso zzso essential for the correct expression of the key zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso deficient in zzso show also zzso heart looping and delayed neural tube closure, and fail to undergo the critical zzso step of zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso is predicted to contain at least three zzso zzso Our results show a novel key player in the genetic cascade that determines zzso zzso and suggest a zzso link between this process and zzso zzso
