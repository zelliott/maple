The release of the zzso zzso zzso from isolated nerve terminals zzso of the rat zzso was characterized with respect to the zzso distribution, the release upon addition of various zzso agents, the release zzso the zzso of release and the relationship between zzso release and zzso of the zzso free zzso zzso A highly specific zzso was developed for determination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed negligible zzso zzso zzso zzso is enriched in the zzso zzso fraction of rat zzso zzso and is released in a strictly zzso manner upon chemical zzso or stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso A correlation exists between the release of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso are able to replace zzso in triggering zzso zzso The release of zzso is initiated within 20 s after zzso and is terminated after 3-5 zzso although zzso and zzso zzso are zzso At this time, zzso zzso of the initial zzso is still present inside the zzso zzso and renewed stimulation again evokes zzso release of this retained zzso It is concluded that zzso release from isolated nerve terminals is zzso and that zzso is terminated by a regulatory mechanism in zzso after 3-5 zzso of zzso a process which can be reversed by zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
