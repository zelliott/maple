We have zzso the binding sites of four zzso and one zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso Using the predicted structural models of zzso we have further predicted the binding sites of these zzso zzso We used the zzso method zzso to map the differences in zzso structure stabilized by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso flexibility lead to a single binding mode for the zzso compounds, that has not been possible previously using a single zzso structural model and fixed zzso zzso zzso There are several notable differences in the zzso zzso stabilized by zzso zzso compared to a zzso zzso The loading of the zzso zzso in the zzso compounds, shrinks the size of the zzso rings and the zzso zzso plays an important role in bonding to the copper zzso in the zzso compounds while zzso zzso is important for the zzso zzso
