In a subset of zzso zzso the genes zzso members of the zzso D zzso are juxtaposed to zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso Here, we identified the gene zzso zzso E1 as novel zzso partner of the zzso heavy chain zzso locus involved in a zzso in a case of zzso zzso zzso diffuse large zzso zzso The zzso zzso were cloned and mapped to the switch region zzso of zzso in zzso and approximately zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso of the zzso E1 protein in this case, which to a comparable extent was observed in zzso independent zzso These data indicate that zzso E1 may act as a novel zzso in zzso zzso
