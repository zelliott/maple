The mechanisms and zzso pathways by which many zzso zzso enter cells to exert the desired zzso effects are not fully understood and remain a matter of zzso In this study, we describe the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso and show their use to examine zzso zzso distribution within zzso zzso B zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso distribution shows the same zzso fate, suggesting that zzso modification does not interfere with zzso zzso Double zzso studied by conventional zzso and zzso zzso with zzso to the labeling zzso and to zzso membrane protein indicate that zzso mainly accumulate in the zzso zzso zzso labeling offers an alternative to study zzso zzso and distribution by zzso zzso Two different approaches have been zzso zzso labeling in heavily fixed and zzso cells and zzso labeling in lightly fixed and zzso processed zzso The results confirm the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso and demonstrate that the zzso capacity of zzso is not damaged by any of the procedures zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso end of zzso zzso provides a new tool in the study of zzso zzso and zzso distribution at both cellular and zzso zzso
