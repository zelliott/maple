Using a direct binding zzso based on zzso zzso we studied the interaction of T cell zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso on living zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was reacted zzso with zzso and at the zzso contact zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso salicylic acid zzso to make zzso zzso T zzso zzso clones derived from mice zzso with this zzso recognized this zzso but not a related one lacking the zzso group nor the parental zzso zzso The clones were zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso lacking zzso from zzso revealed a diverse fine specificity pattern and indicated that this group zzso directly with the zzso The zzso of four clones could be zzso labeled by zzso This labeling was dependent on the zzso binding to the zzso zzso and was selective for the zzso alpha (2 zzso or beta chain (1 zzso or was common for both chains (1 zzso zzso sequence analysis showed a preferential usage of J alpha zzso containing alpha chains that were paired with V beta 1 expressing beta zzso The zzso that were zzso labeled at the alpha chain expressed these J alpha and V beta zzso The zzso zzso by the J alpha zzso segment is rarely found in other J alpha zzso Moreover, we show that the zzso group interacts zzso with zzso in zzso zzso We thus propose that for these zzso zzso labeling of the alpha chain occurs via the J zzso zzso zzso
