We have previously identified a new rat zzso zzso named zzso which showed a strong, but zzso induction in the zzso in response to acute zzso We report here the cloning and sequencing of the human zzso zzso The human zzso zzso is 82 zzso acids long and shows an overall identity of zzso with the rat zzso The complete structure of the zzso gene was also zzso The zzso gene comprises three zzso separated by two zzso and the gene was mapped to zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso primary structure suggested the presence of a zzso motif of nuclear zzso indicating that zzso may function within the zzso This presumption has been confirmed by zzso of zzso cells with the zzso zzso followed by zzso with specific zzso zzso zzso expression is induced in some, but not all, cells by serum zzso and zzso To analyze the zzso function, we zzso zzso zzso cells with a zzso expression zzso and measured their growth and their sensitivity to zzso Response to zzso alpha and zzso zzso was not modified by zzso zzso However, cells expressing zzso grew significantly more zzso
