We studied a sample from the zzso 2 zzso Ice zzso zzso ice core to determine the diversity and survival of zzso trapped in the ice at least zzso years zzso Previously, we examined the zzso relationships among zzso zzso DNA zzso sequences in a clone library obtained by zzso amplification from zzso DNA extracted from zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of nearly 800 zzso organisms that were grouped by zzso and amplified zzso restriction analysis patterns to select zzso for further zzso The zzso analyses of 56 representative zzso sequences showed that the zzso belonged to four major zzso groups: the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The most abundant and diverse zzso were within the zzso zzso cluster that had not been represented in the clone zzso The zzso evolutionary distance zzso results suggested that at least 7 zzso represent new species within characterized zzso and that 49 are different strains of known zzso The zzso were further zzso based on the isolation conditions, temperature range for growth, zzso activity, zzso resistance, presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso A significant observation with implications for the development of novel and more effective zzso methods was that preliminary incubation in zzso and zzso liquid prior to zzso on zzso media greatly increased the recovery of zzso from the ice core zzso
