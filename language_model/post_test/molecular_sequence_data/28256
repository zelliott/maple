A temperature sensitive zzso mapping in the zzso region of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been found to abolish 3' processing of zzso zzso cells grown for a few generations at the zzso temperature were found to specifically lack mature zzso and to accumulate 3' zzso precursors of this zzso The zzso of precursors of other zzso zzso was also observed under the same zzso After longer incubation times, a generalized decrease of zzso transcripts could be zzso The zzso was genetically mapped in a limited region surrounding the zzso gene and found, by sequencing, to consist of a zzso greater than T transition at position 61 of the zzso zzso
