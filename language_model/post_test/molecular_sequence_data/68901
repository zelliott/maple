In the present study, we report the application of zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis to the screening of seven functionally important factor IX gene zzso regions zzso length zzso zzso in 9 unrelated zzso B patients of Portuguese or African zzso In eight of the patients an altered migration pattern of zzso DNA was zzso zzso sequencing of the relevant DNA fragments unveiled the following sequence zzso two novel zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at position zzso or zzso five zzso previously reported in other ethnic groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a normal zzso zzso zzso at position zzso in zzso zzso We propose hypothetical models for the generation of the 9 zzso zzso zzso We have performed molecular modeling studies in order to predict the structure of the zzso zzso zzso
