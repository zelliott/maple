zzso system zzso within the central nervous system zzso is involved in zzso and neurodegenerative disorders, but the role of complement in the zzso process or in the repair remains zzso Besides the direct zzso effects of complement on target cells zzso or zzso complement can exert other functions through interaction of complement fragments with specific zzso The zzso zzso an inflammatory zzso which is formed during complement zzso might play a role in the zzso zzso and zzso and recruitment of zzso cells by binding to its zzso zzso on zzso zzso Using zzso zzso corresponding to zzso regions between human and mouse zzso zzso we have cloned a rat zzso zzso probe from rat zzso zzso after zzso zzso The rat zzso probe isolated by this procedure allowed us to clone the rat zzso zzso sequence using a library screening cloning zzso This probe was also used to study the expression of the zzso zzso in the rat zzso Northern zzso and zzso experiments demonstrated the zzso expression of zzso zzso in brain, zzso kidney and zzso This transcript was also observed in primary culture of rat zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso expressed by zzso in culture is functional since the addition of zzso induced a zzso increase of zzso calcium zzso The expression of the zzso by zzso suggests new roles for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso to zzso zzso
