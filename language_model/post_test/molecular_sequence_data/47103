The crystal structures of two group III zzso toxins from the scorpion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined at zzso A and zzso A resolution and refined to R factors of zzso and zzso zzso The first high-resolution structures of the zzso scorpion toxin show some striking features compared with structures of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso bond between zzso 9 and 10 unusually occurs in the five-member reverse turn zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso mediates the spatial relationship between the turn 8-12 and the zzso stretch zzso through a pair of zzso hydrogen bonds between zzso 10 and 64 to form a unique zzso arrangement which features the special orientation of the terminal zzso zzso Finally, in consequence of the peculiar orientation of the zzso zzso the functional groups of zzso which are crucial for the zzso interaction, are exposed and accessible in zzso zzso and zzso rather than buried as in the classical zzso zzso alignment and characteristics analysis suggested that the above structural features observed in zzso zzso and zzso occur in all group III zzso zzso Recently, some group III zzso toxins were demonstrated to occupy a zzso site different from the classical zzso zzso the distinct structural features of zzso zzso and zzso presented here may provide the structural basis for the newly recognized zzso binding site zzso Besides, the zzso zzso zzso bonds found in these two structures play a role in the formation of the structural characteristics and in keeping accurate positions of the functionally crucial zzso This zzso a way to achieve high levels of molecular specificity and atomic precision through the strained backbone zzso
