zzso of the human zzso type 11 E1 and zzso genes is necessary and sufficient to support viral DNA zzso The full-length zzso protein is a zzso zzso that also interacts with the E1 zzso to form an zzso complex at the viral origin of zzso Previous studies indicated that efficient binding of this complex to the replication origin is zzso and that the zzso zzso was required for efficient E1 zzso Human zzso type 11 zzso and E1 proteins have been zzso and their cooperative binding to the zzso type 11 viral replication origin has been zzso zzso E1 binding to the zzso type 11 replication origin was demonstrated and found to be largely zzso DNA binding by E1 does not require complex formation with zzso and appears to be independent of zzso binding or zzso E1 binding zzso increased with the addition of increasing amounts of zzso and zzso in the zzso binding site demonstrated that the zzso site is required for E1 and zzso to specifically bind as a zzso complex at the replication zzso Analysis of the zzso E1 binding site via zzso showed that it was zzso for zzso zzso complex zzso Thus, although the replication functions between the animal and the human zzso are well zzso there are subtle differences in the DNA binding requirements for zzso which may portend zzso differences among the DNA replication systems of various zzso zzso
