A critical role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is recognized in the regulation of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms of this regulation, we sought to determine the nature of the protein interactions with this zzso zzso We used a zzso synthetic zzso zzso to probe a high density protein expression array zzso zzso human zzso for high affinity zzso A number of potential zzso proteins were zzso One such zzso a zzso channel regulatory zzso zzso was characterized further because its affinity for the zzso zzso was highest as was its expression in zzso We verified the presence of zzso in human zzso by zzso Western zzso zzso and its zzso with zzso by surface zzso zzso The affinity of this interaction was zzso zzso zzso zzso in a cell free zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso demonstrating that this interaction is zzso zzso Furthermore, immobilized zzso zzso but not control zzso zzso specifically extract zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to 5 zzso a pharmacological inhibitor of the zzso zzso channel, specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso without affecting zzso P expression confirming a specific role for zzso in zzso zzso In zzso a zzso zzso corresponding to the potential zzso domain on zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso Thus, we have identified, verified, and characterized a novel functional interaction between the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso
