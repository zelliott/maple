zzso syndrome zzso is a rare, often zzso zzso zzso disorder in which zzso bleeding and zzso storage are associated with defects of diverse zzso zzso including zzso zzso dense zzso and zzso Similar zzso defects occur in the zzso syndrome zzso as well as in a large number of different mouse zzso The zzso gene is located in zzso and two genetically distinct mouse zzso pale ear zzso and zzso zzso both with zzso zzso similar to human zzso map close together in the zzso region of zzso zzso 19, suggesting that one of these zzso might be zzso to human zzso We recently identified the human zzso zzso which encodes a novel zzso zzso protein of unknown zzso Here, we describe characterization of the mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso and identification of zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso but not in zzso mice, establishing mouse pale ear as an animal model for human zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso mice encompasses those of both zzso and zzso suggesting that these disorders may be closely zzso In addition, the mouse and human zzso genes both contain a rare zzso zzso and comparison of the sequences of this zzso in the mouse and human genes identified zzso sequences that suggest a possible role for zzso secondary structure in zzso of this rare class of zzso
