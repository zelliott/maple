Basic zzso zzso proteins often belong to a family of zzso factors that bind to the DNA target sequence zzso zzso that is present in the promoter or zzso regions of numerous zzso regulated zzso In this study, we report the isolation and initial characterization of a novel zzso factor, termed zzso that was identified by virtue of its ability to interact with zzso regulatory elements in a zzso zzso screening zzso Northern analysis revealed that zzso transcripts are expressed in several adult zzso including stomach, liver, zzso and zzso but no expression is detected in the heart, brain, zzso or zzso During mouse zzso zzso zzso is first observed at zzso in the primitive gut and in the developing lung zzso zzso persists through zzso and remains restricted primarily to the zzso zzso zzso also is detected in skeletal muscle zzso beginning at zzso zzso throughout all embryonic stages examined although in older zzso and in the adult expression becomes severely zzso At later zzso times, zzso transcripts also are found in the zzso zzso zzso and adult zzso As predicted, the zzso protein is nuclear and binds efficiently to zzso sites as a zzso zzso also is capable of binding to zzso elements when zzso as a zzso with the widely expressed zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, although zzso binds to zzso in zzso the zzso protein lacks a functional zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso may function as a unique regulator of gene expression in several different embryonic and zzso cell zzso
