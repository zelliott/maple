zzso patterns of zzso zzso diversity reflect the relative roles of gene flow and selection in determining geographic variation within a zzso We zzso color differentiation and genetic divergence among 20 populations of the zzso tree zzso zzso zzso in lower Central zzso zzso analyses revealed 5 zzso zzso DNA zzso and we zzso from our zzso that geographic barriers have played a large role in structuring zzso Two zzso characters varied independently among isolated population groups: zzso zzso distinguished Caribbean from Pacific individuals, whereas leg zzso exhibited a more complex geographic zzso We detected 3 generalized spatial patterns of genetic and zzso zzso 1) zzso differentiation in the presence of historical zzso 2) zzso uniformity across genetically differentiated regions, and 3) zzso of genetic and zzso zzso These patterns indicate that zzso diversification is highly zzso and can result from spatial variation in localized zzso geographic isolation, genetic zzso and/or evolutionary zzso Although the mode of selection underlying color variation was not the focal objective of this study, we discuss the possible roles of natural and sexual selection in zzso population zzso Our study underscores the fact that selection zzso vary across relatively small spatial zzso even in species that occupy relatively homogeneous zzso
