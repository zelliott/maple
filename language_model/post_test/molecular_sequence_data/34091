A comprehensive analysis of zzso structures of zzso zzso zzso genes is of significant interest for deeply understanding zzso development and male zzso zzso In this study, we zzso zzso clones from a zzso zzso full-length zzso library and obtained zzso zzso high-quality full-length zzso zzso Comparative analysis between human and zzso showed that 78 zzso zzso zzso most of which were yet zzso had undergone severe structural changes zzso at the zzso zzso zzso alternative zzso variations and fusion zzso on zzso and transcript levels throughout zzso zzso Specifically, among the 78 zzso zzso zzso 39 including zzso zzso and zzso showed markedly zzso structural zzso Through zzso analysis, we found that 56 transcripts (including seven zzso zzso zzso had values of greater than one when comparing human and zzso DNA zzso whereas the values were less than one when comparing humans and zzso Gene zzso zzso and expression profiling showed that the zzso zzso zzso was enriched with genes that are associated with zzso male germ cell zzso Taken together, our study provides the first comprehensive molecular evidence that many zzso zzso zzso genes had experienced severe structural changes over the course of evolution on zzso and transcript zzso
