In our search for novel human zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso DNA was zzso amplified using sets of zzso zzso based on zzso sequences in human and rat zzso The sequence of one of the zzso zzso products revealed zzso to a sequence in the 3' region of the human zzso gene following a zzso search of zzso zzso A search for open reading frames zzso in the zzso zzso sequence resulted in identification of two novel putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso The recent submission of sequence overlapping the downstream zzso sequence revealed a possible zzso insert containing a third zzso zzso zzso sharing zzso zzso acid identity with zzso followed by a fourth zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, occur downstream from zzso a gene previously localized on zzso zzso The four putative novel human genes zzso new members of the zzso family and share little zzso with zzso
