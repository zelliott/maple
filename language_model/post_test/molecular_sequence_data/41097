zzso a member of the zzso protein family, binds directly to zzso and the zzso tails of a subset of zzso zzso to mediate their zzso zzso We identify a cluster of zzso zzso at the zzso end of zzso proteins that are necessary and sufficient to mediate zzso zzso While loss of zzso binding renders zzso zzso for zzso zzso the zzso zzso capabilities of the zzso protein are not significantly zzso We establish that the zzso status and zzso properties of zzso largely account for the zzso capacity of the protein and identify an zzso interaction as a potential contributing factor in zzso zzso membrane zzso
