The aim of this study was to provide molecular detection and characterization of the goat isolate of zzso zzso from Ankara province of zzso For this purpose, zzso amplification of small zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial sequencing of zzso zzso c zzso zzso 1 zzso genes were performed in a zzso dead zzso According to zzso results, zzso were identified as zzso zzso and partial sequence of zzso gene was corresponding to zzso zzso At the end of the study, we concluded that molecular tools can be used to define species of zzso in cases where the key zzso features cannot be zzso zzso sequence data of Turkish goat isolate of zzso zzso was submitted to zzso for other researchers interested in this zzso By this study, molecular detection and characterization of zzso zzso was done for the first time in zzso
