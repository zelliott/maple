A zzso zzso having a sequence corresponding to the zzso domain of the zzso protein with slow zzso zzso channel activity, has been incorporated into synthetic zzso zzso zzso The zzso complexes have been characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso electron spin resonance zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso differential scanning zzso and zzso X-ray zzso From zzso zzso it is found that, when zzso into zzso by dialysis from zzso the zzso has a predominantly zzso secondary structure in which the zzso backbone is oriented at an angle of approximately 56 degrees relative to the membrane normal in dry films of zzso zzso of the dry film in the gel phase does not appear to affect the orientation of the zzso zzso and a relatively small change in orientation occurs when the zzso zzso the transition to the fluid zzso The zzso and zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso respectively, indicate that the incorporated zzso restricts the zzso motion of the zzso without appreciably affecting the chain order, in a way similar to that found for integral membrane zzso The characteristic zzso zzso zzso from zzso lipids further indicate a selectivity in the interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso The zzso restriction of the chains of the zzso zzso and the reduction in the zzso of the zzso zzso transition indicate that, on average, approximately two to three zzso molecules interact directly with each zzso zzso which is consistent with a limited degree of zzso of the zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and X-ray zzso indicate that the zzso complexes have a zzso structure up to the highest zzso concentration studied zzso zzso zzso The surface area occupied by zzso molecules zzso 30 zzso per zzso in the zzso complexes, deduced from the zzso repeat zzso at defined water content, is very similar to that in pure fluid zzso zzso consistent with the zzso zzso zzso The additional membrane surface area contributed by the zzso is approximately 112 zzso per zzso This large value for the zzso area in the fluid zzso is consistent with the zzso studies of dry zzso films which suggest that the long axis of the zzso is strongly zzso with respect to the zzso normal zzso degrees in the dry zzso
