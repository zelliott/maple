zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso was used to measure the extension efficiency for all zzso of matched and mismatched base pairs at zzso zzso The transition zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were extended zzso to zzso less efficiently than their correctly paired zzso Relative efficiencies for extending zzso zzso were zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso about zzso for zzso and less than zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso was extended with high efficiency, about zzso compared to a correct zzso zzso The unexpected ease of extending the zzso mismatch was not likely to have been caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed to bind with similar affinities to each of the correctly paired and zzso zzso zzso Thus, the failure of zzso zzso to extend zzso efficiently appears to be an intrinsic property of the zzso and not due to an inability to bind to zzso zzso For almost all of the zzso zzso being the exception, zzso zzso exhibits about 100 to zzso greater discrimination against mismatch extension compared to avian zzso reverse zzso and zzso reverse zzso which extend most mismatched zzso zzso Relative mismatch extension efficiencies for zzso zzso were measured at 45 degrees C, 55 degrees C and 70 degrees C and found to be independent of zzso The zzso extension data should be important in designing experiments using zzso to distinguish between sequences that vary by a single zzso
