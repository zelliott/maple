Recently, we have reported the identification of several genes that exhibit genetic interactions with the zzso zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso synergistic lethal with zzso zzso zzso products required for the second zzso step of zzso To analyze the specific roles of zzso and zzso we have determined how zzso influence the relative usage of competing 3' zzso zzso We find that zzso in zzso eliminate the normal zzso preference for 3' zzso sites located zzso 22 zzso downstream of the zzso In contrast, zzso in zzso inhibit usage of all 3' zzso sites, regardless of their zzso This suggests that zzso is involved in the process of 3' zzso site choice, whereas zzso fulfills a generic requirement for the second zzso We show that zzso is an essential gene that contains a small motif with striking similarity to the zzso zinc zzso of zzso zzso zzso which has been implicated in zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso indicates that this motif influences the efficiency, but not the sequence zzso of 3' zzso site zzso The identification of a component of the zzso zzso machinery that can promote 3' zzso site choice has potentially important implications for alternative zzso
