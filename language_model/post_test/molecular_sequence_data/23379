The assembly and maturation of box zzso zzso factors essential for zzso zzso occur in the zzso To investigate this process, we have analyzed zzso factors associated with the zzso human zzso zzso We show that both the precursor and mature length zzso zzso zzso are present in larger zzso complexes that contain the core box zzso proteins as well as many zzso factors linked to zzso assembly zzso zzso zzso zzso processing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso we show that most of these factors are essential for box zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the core proteins undergo a restructuring event that zzso their binding to the zzso zzso zzso which may be zzso by the putative zzso factor zzso appears to be linked to zzso zzso We believe that the assembly complex coordinates zzso processing, zzso zzso zzso and zzso
