zzso zzso denotes a collection of processes in which cells respond to zzso environments by producing zzso zzso that grow well, apparently violating fundamental principles of zzso In a well-studied model, zzso of zzso zzso coli cells on zzso medium zzso zzso at higher zzso than predicted by usual zzso zzso These zzso carry either a zzso zzso zzso or a greater than zzso amplification of the leaky zzso zzso A crucial distinction between alternative hypotheses for the mechanisms of zzso zzso hinges on whether these amplification and zzso zzso events are zzso or whether amplification is a molecular zzso producing an intermediate cell type, in colonies on a zzso to zzso zzso The latter model allows the zzso conservative idea of increased zzso zzso zzso without increased zzso rate (by virtue of extra gene copies per zzso whereas the former requires an increase in zzso rate, potentially accelerating zzso To resolve these models, we zzso early events leading to rare zzso zzso and report several results that show that amplification is not the precursor to zzso zzso but rather is an independent zzso zzso zzso Using new high-resolution selection methods and stringent analysis of all cells in very young zzso zzso zzso we find that most zzso colonies contain no zzso zzso cells, in contrast with previous zzso zzso Analysis of nascent zzso as young as the zzso stage, revealed zzso zzso with no zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments show that zzso of zzso cells grow to form visible colonies of zzso not zzso zzso zzso zzso cells do not zzso zzso cells in zzso fast enough to mask the zzso zzso zzso cells are not zzso as was proposed to explain elevated zzso in a sequential zzso zzso zzso and not zzso zzso requires DNA zzso I, demonstrating that zzso is zzso from amplification, and also illuminating the amplification zzso We conclude that amplification and zzso are independent outcomes of zzso genetic zzso We suggest that the availability of alternative pathways for zzso adaptation and zzso expansion under stress may be exploited during processes ranging from the evolution of drug resistance to cancer zzso
