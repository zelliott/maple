The zzso of zzso compartments is essential for zzso activities, zzso trafficking, and zzso transport of various zzso zzso are mildly zzso in most plant cells because of the action of zzso and/or zzso zzso pumps but are zzso in specific cells by mechanisms that remained zzso we show that the blue zzso color of zzso zzso zzso is due to a failure to zzso zzso We report that zzso encodes a zzso zzso known as zzso zzso in bacteria only, that resides in the zzso membrane zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance and genetic data show that zzso is required and, together with the zzso zzso zzso zzso sufficient to zzso zzso zzso has no zzso transport activity on its own but can physically interact with zzso and boost zzso zzso transport zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso and possibly other zzso relies on a zzso zzso zzso
