zzso factor zzso inhibitor zzso is a primary regulator of the initiation of blood zzso zzso is zzso and zzso by zzso cells through the zzso zzso protein zzso but also binds another zzso present on the cell surface at zzso zzso the abundance of zzso zzso zzso and Schwartz zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 91, zzso When zzso cells are washed with zzso or zzso zzso a substance that binds zzso is removed from the cell surface and can be detected in a zzso zzso zzso with zzso destroys the zzso of the zzso component in the zzso zzso suggesting that it is a zzso In addition, when the zzso of zzso zzso is prevented by growing the zzso cells in the presence of 30 zzso sodium zzso zzso binding is zzso whereas the binding of bovine zzso zzso a protein known to associate with zzso zzso falls to 50% of control zzso zzso zzso washes of zzso cells grown in sodium zzso have an equal zzso in zzso experiments to that of zzso cells, suggesting that zzso are not totally responsible for the binding activity zzso By using the slot zzso to follow binding activity and conventional protein zzso techniques, a protein species that zzso at 40 zzso after reduction was identified in the zzso cell zzso The binding of this protein to zzso was confirmed with immobilized zzso zzso acid sequence analysis identified this protein species as a zzso zzso of zzso (also called zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso
