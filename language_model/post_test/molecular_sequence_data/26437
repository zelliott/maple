The zzso sequence of the zzso gene which is essential for zzso transport was determined in zzso zzso and compared to zzso genes from zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed and their products were active in zzso zzso The primary structure of the three zzso proteins was highly zzso Changes were mainly clustered in a relatively large zzso region of the protein zzso 40 to zzso In contrast, other zzso segments were more zzso and most remaining changes occurred in the zzso putative zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso in this inner membrane protein may be functionally zzso These results prove new insights into the functional sites in zzso
