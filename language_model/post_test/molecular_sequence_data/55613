We have used a technique of zzso zzso coupled with zzso chain reaction amplification for simultaneous analysis of the zzso and 3' zzso of zzso zzso derived from the S zzso of zzso zzso virus during an acute infection of zzso zzso These zzso possess 1 to 7 zzso zzso of apparently random sequence at their zzso zzso The zzso zzso species have 4 or 5 zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso also have properties consistent with the presence of a zzso cap zzso The 3' zzso of the zzso lack zzso tails, and we have shown that zzso termination occurs at zzso positions within the zzso region of the S zzso The identification of several distinct zzso in the vicinity of a putative zzso structure in the zzso templates suggests that zzso termination may be zzso by a structural signal rather than a precise sequence zzso
