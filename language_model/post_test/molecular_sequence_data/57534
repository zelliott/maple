zzso from mice zzso deficient for zzso alpha chain synthesis were examined for the status of their zzso beta chain zzso by DNA sequencing and by a novel technique that analyzes populations of gene zzso zzso beta chain genes were predominantly zzso zzso in contrast with the statistical prediction for a zzso zzso zzso zzso productive zzso beta chain gene zzso appears to be a critical step in zzso zzso independent of zzso alpha chain zzso Moreover, the beta chain gene zzso in zzso zzso are typical of those found in the zzso and periphery of normal zzso Thus, the extent of zzso diversity is a property of zzso genes that is imposed prior to selection on the mature alpha beta zzso
