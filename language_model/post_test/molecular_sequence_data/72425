Although structurally very similar, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso coli differ in both regulatory and zzso zzso Most notably, zzso stimulates the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been zzso These zzso characteristics contradict the traditional logic developed from the zzso coli zzso in which zzso and zzso function together as end products of the zzso zzso to zzso control the zzso zzso In this study, five divergent zzso zzso of the regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso have been replaced with their zzso coli zzso These zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso binding domain at the junction of the zzso and zinc zzso of the regulatory zzso In spite of the fact that the zzso zzso zzso retained 455 out of 460 zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso it possessed characteristics similar to those of the zzso coli zzso zzso the zzso decreased from 40 to 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was greatly zzso zzso zzso was converted from a strong zzso to a strong zzso and zzso the synergistic zzso by zzso and zzso was zzso The zzso zzso is located at the outer surface of a zzso zzso of the zzso domain, providing a potential structural mechanism defining the zzso of this zzso
