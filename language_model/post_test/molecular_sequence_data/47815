Using zzso zzso analysis between zzso zzso and zzso zzso human zzso cells, we have identified a gene not previously described as being expressed in zzso The gene is more highly expressed in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the gene has already been cloned as a transcript present in embryonic brain, with unknown zzso zzso of the gene was found not to be restricted to the zzso and not regulated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso In concert with the zzso system, zzso analysis of gene expression in zzso using a panel of human zzso zzso demonstrated that the gene is more highly expressed in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso The gene could be mapped on human zzso zzso The zzso arm is known to be frequently amplified during zzso progression and harbors several zzso potentially involved in cancer zzso Since expression of the gene is positively correlated with zzso progression and its zzso zzso zzso we zzso that the gene may be involved in the development and progression of prostate zzso
