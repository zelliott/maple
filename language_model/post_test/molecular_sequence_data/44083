The zzso zzso III from zzso zzso is a zzso protein which contains two zzso zzso one of which is zzso and can readily and zzso lose one zzso under zzso conditions to yield a zzso zzso This zzso cluster has an S zzso zzso ground zzso state zzso of S zzso 1/2 in the reduced zzso state zzso Armstrong, zzso and Thomson (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso to this cluster is unusual in that an zzso zzso zzso is found where a zzso zzso normally zzso Using a zzso protein obtained from the zzso in zzso coli of a synthetic gene in which zzso the putative zzso to the removable Fe, has been changed to zzso we have studied the cluster zzso properties of the zzso zzso Analysis by zzso and zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso both with S zzso 1/2 in the reduced zzso Also, unlike in native zzso zzso zzso zzso III, the zzso zzso zzso cluster zzso reaction was found to be sluggish and did not go to zzso It is zzso that the zzso of the reaction in the native protein is due to the presence of the zzso zzso at position 14 and that this zzso might protect the zzso cluster from further zzso
