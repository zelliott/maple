Small zzso proteins such as those from the zzso family are zzso signal zzso proteins that often are involved in processing of zzso zzso Plant zzso proteins are implicated in regulation of plant cell architecture, secondary wall formation, zzso zzso and defense against zzso We isolated a zzso zzso from barley zzso zzso to study its role in resistance to the barley powdery zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in the barley zzso and its expression level was not strongly influenced by zzso with zzso zzso However, after zzso zzso of barley leaf segments with zzso zzso zzso zzso interference with zzso function inhibited zzso zzso establishment in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso compromised in function of the zzso zzso gene and the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso that are moderately susceptible to zzso zzso showed no zzso in powdery zzso resistance upon zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso was apparently dependent on the same processes as zzso broad resistance, which is suppressed by zzso We conclude that an zzso small zzso protein is required for successful zzso zzso establishment and that this function may be linked to zzso zzso
