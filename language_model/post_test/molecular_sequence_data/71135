A zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained in a previous study contained a set of triple zzso acid zzso To further improve the stability of the zzso we used a random zzso technique and identified two additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso that separately endowed the protein with further zzso We introduced the two zzso into a single zzso zzso thus constructing a zzso with overall zzso zzso Other studies have suggested that an improved zzso zzso interaction and a rigid type II zzso play important roles in enhancing the protein zzso Based on those zzso we successively introduced zzso acid zzso into the zzso with the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso at the zzso interface was replaced by zzso to increase the zzso interaction between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso that were involved in the formation of the turn were replaced by zzso zzso and zzso respectively, to make the turn more zzso The zzso stability of the zzso was determined based on remaining activity after heat treatment and zzso rate constant of zzso zzso which showed gradual increases in zzso stability as more zzso were zzso
