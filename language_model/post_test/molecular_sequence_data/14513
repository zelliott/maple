zzso of zzso outer membrane zzso zzso has dual zzso in normal zzso and energy exchange between zzso and zzso and thus in control of zzso and in zzso by release of zzso factors into the zzso However, the mechanism of this regulation involving the zzso zzso channel zzso the major channel of zzso remains zzso For example, one of the long-standing puzzles was that in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso is less accessible to zzso zzso than in isolated zzso Still another puzzle was that, according to zzso experiments, zzso regulation of zzso is limited to zzso exceeding zzso which are believed to be much too high for zzso We have solved these puzzles and uncovered multiple new functional links by identifying a missing player in the regulation of zzso and, zzso zzso zzso - the zzso protein zzso We have shown that, depending on zzso zzso state and applied zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso induce functionally important zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso The zzso sensitivity of the zzso equilibrium is truly zzso It is described by an effective zzso zzso of more than ten elementary charges, thus making the zzso reaction as responsive to the applied zzso as the most zzso channels of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso state demonstrated that although this state is still able to conduct small zzso it is zzso to zzso and other zzso zzso because of the reduced zzso and zzso zzso The findings, obtained in a channel zzso zzso were supported by experiments with isolated zzso and human zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest a previously unknown mechanism of regulation of zzso zzso governed by zzso interaction with zzso at the zzso zzso Immediate zzso implications include new insights into zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity in health and disease, especially in the case of the highly dynamic zzso network which is characteristic of zzso and cell zzso In the present review, we speculate how these findings may help to identify new mechanisms of zzso action of zzso zzso drugs, and also to understand why and how cancer cells zzso use inefficient zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso structure, function, and regulation of zzso zzso
