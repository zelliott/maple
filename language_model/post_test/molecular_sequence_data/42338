zzso and zzso carriers transport zzso and zzso across the inner zzso of zzso in exchange for zzso and zzso zzso Both carriers belong to the zzso carrier protein family, characterized by a zzso structure made up of related sequences about 100 zzso acids in zzso The results obtained on the zzso of the zzso and zzso carriers are consistent with the six zzso model proposed by zzso and zzso In both carriers the zzso and zzso regions are exposed toward the zzso In addition, the zzso carrier has been shown to be a zzso by means of zzso zzso The bovine and human genes coding for the zzso carrier are split into eight and six zzso respectively, and five zzso are found to the same position in both zzso The bovine and human zzso carrier genes have the same organization with nine zzso separated by eight zzso at exactly the same zzso The zzso carrier of zzso zzso is zzso with a zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso carrier and the other members of the zzso carrier zzso The precursor of the zzso carrier is efficiently zzso zzso zzso and correctly assembled in isolated zzso The zzso zzso carrier is imported with an efficiency of about 50% as compared with the precursor of the zzso carrier and is correctly zzso demonstrating that the mature portion of the zzso carrier contains sufficient information for import and assembly into zzso
