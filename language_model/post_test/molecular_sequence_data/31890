zzso zzso is a major pathogen that results in considerable economic loss to fish zzso zzso availability of iron is a huge obstacle to survival for zzso bacteria during infection, and iron acquisition is important in bacterial zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso was shown not to produce zzso zzso zzso but rather to require zzso proteins for growth under zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso (ABC) zzso system zzso which is zzso by four downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was identified as responsible for zzso zzso of zzso Analysis of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso indicated that it is a putative zzso which plays a role in zzso zzso and is produced in zzso during infection with zzso zzso and therefore may be a potential candidate zzso for a zzso zzso
