The two zzso zzso of human protein zzso zzso zzso have been produced in bacteria as individual zzso folded protein zzso and their functional properties have been compared to those of intact zzso The two individual zzso were very similar in their functional properties, and there were no indications of zzso between them, so it is unlikely that they have zzso different functions in zzso Both zzso efficiently introduced zzso bonds into unfolded model proteins and peptides but were less efficient than zzso with folded zzso protein zzso Relative to zzso neither domain had substantial activity in catalyzing zzso bond zzso This pattern of activities is very similar to that of the bacterial catalyst zzso and probably reflects similarities in the zzso mechanisms of these zzso The differences in activity between zzso and its zzso zzso suggest that other features of the zzso zzso are also required for its complete range of zzso exchange zzso
