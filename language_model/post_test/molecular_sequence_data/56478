zzso of human zzso zzso zzso was replaced by Ala, Met, or zzso by zzso zzso to evaluate the role of the zzso zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso were approximately zzso and zzso higher than that of the zzso respectively, while the value of the zzso zzso was almost the same as that of the zzso These results indicate that the positive charge at position 110 is important for zzso zzso The zzso value of zzso was not affected, indicating that the zzso only zzso in the binding process in the reaction by forming an zzso interaction with zzso group of zzso
