zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are members of a zzso of zzso that add zzso to a variety of zzso and zzso containing zzso or zzso functional zzso To characterize related zzso genes further, we used zzso zzso zzso to generate three distinct sizes of amplification products from human zzso DNA or from zzso zzso library zzso each of which contained zzso gene zzso One of the zzso fragments contained a new zzso zzso zzso corresponding to a recently published zzso clone that encodes a zzso with zzso specificity distinct from that of the previously described zzso and zzso Additional upstream sequence information was obtained using a second zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is composed of eight zzso and seven zzso with zzso sizes ranging from 95 to 181 zzso zzso zzso lengths and locations of the zzso junctions were identical to those in both the zzso gene and an zzso gene published independently by another group zzso The zzso gene maps to a zzso location zzso that is the same as that previously determined for both zzso and zzso The characterization of the zzso gene provides further insight into the organization, regulation, and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
