In an attempt to zzso the regulatory mechanism of vessel zzso we isolated zzso a novel zzso gene of zzso zzso that is expressed specifically in zzso zzso elements zzso The zzso transcript was shown to accumulate zzso at the time of secondary wall zzso of zzso in zzso culture of zzso zzso In zzso zzso indicated specific zzso of the zzso transcript in immature vessels in zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso showed that the zzso protein is abundant in zzso especially at their secondary zzso For zzso characterization of zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso was produced in tobacco cultured cells and zzso The zzso zzso His protein had a zzso activity preferring zzso alcohol as well as zzso alcohol as a zzso with a narrow pH optimum around zzso The zzso activity required calcium zzso and was elevated by increasing zzso concentration in the range of zzso zzso An zzso zzso of zzso zzso was examined for expression patterns with transgenic plants carrying a yellow fluorescent protein zzso gene under the control of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso expression of zzso in the zzso zzso Taken zzso our results strongly suggest that zzso and its zzso play an important role in zzso of secondary cell walls in zzso zzso
