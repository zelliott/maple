The zzso zzso zzso gene was isolated by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing of the region upstream of the zzso zzso zzso gene reveals the presence of the zzso gene in the opposite zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that expression of these two genes is zzso by DNA damage, and zzso in both cases, on the direct repeat zzso zzso according to the direction of zzso zzso zzso of the sequences of zzso and zzso promoters from different bacterial species of the alpha group of the zzso has identified the direct repeat zzso as the zzso box in this zzso zzso
