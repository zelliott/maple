We have previously identified and characterized a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso To analyze the zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso that may be involved in zzso binding and zzso we constructed a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid replacements and characterized the ability of these zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was employed to introduce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso into zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Point zzso at zzso and zzso and in the zzso motif of zzso resulted in decreased binding to zzso zzso and human serum zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso sites and motifs led to reduced growth of zzso zzso when human serum was used as the zzso zzso Analysis using a three-dimensional zzso model of zzso indicated that zzso zzso and the zzso motif are present on zzso or zzso zzso of zzso while the zzso motif is present on the barrel zzso Taken together, these results support a role for zzso zzso and the zzso motif of the zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso binding and zzso of serum zzso and the zzso zzso motif in serum zzso zzso
