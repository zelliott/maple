The mechanisms responsible for the development of the zzso resistance zzso are zzso and are likely explained by multiple zzso To understand the molecular changes associated with drug resistance more fully, a zzso zzso derived from the human zzso cancer cell line zzso was established through selection by culture in zzso increasing zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso by differential display identifies a new zzso zzso zzso Resistance Associated zzso zzso In comparison to the parental line, zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso cell line zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso that predicts for a protein product of 110 zzso zzso A zzso search identifies a zzso clone containing a zzso sequence corresponding to that of zzso DNA and protein analysis reveals that zzso has no zzso to any known zzso or zzso Northern analysis demonstrates that zzso is zzso in the zzso breast cancer cell line zzso zzso as well as the zzso multiple myeloma cell lines zzso and zzso A survey of normal tissue shows minimal or absent zzso zzso zzso zzso of a wide variety of cancer cell lines demonstrates zzso expression in many cell lines derived from different tissue zzso In zzso zzso is a novel gene whose expression is associated with the zzso and zzso zzso
