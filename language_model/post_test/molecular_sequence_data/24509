The zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso essential for growth on zzso as the sole carbon zzso The zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso has been previously cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained via zzso walking experiments and zzso The fully zzso open reading frame encodes zzso zzso acids with a deduced zzso of zzso zzso consistent with the observed zzso zzso zzso of most zzso zzso reported so zzso The cloned zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli zzso cells, from which zzso was zzso as a zzso product and its functionality zzso Furthermore, the relationship between the carbon sources, growth and zzso activity in zzso zzso were zzso Rapid growth was observed when the cells were cultured on zzso zzso zzso while delayed growth was observed when cells were grown on zzso zzso zzso However, in both cases, high levels of zzso activity coincided with a zzso of growth, suggesting a late zzso role played by zzso in the natural host, zzso zzso
