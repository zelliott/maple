We have examined the zzso zzso expression profile of six different human cell lines derived from Ewing zzso using zzso chain reaction and found each to zzso express a characteristic zzso Furthermore, each cell line differed in the levels of zzso zzso We also analyzed the expression of several zzso in zzso zzso zzso and their zzso stable progressive zzso Each zzso tumor also zzso expressed a large number of zzso and in some cases, the more zzso zzso differed from their parental zzso These results demonstrate that tumors of the same type, and even in the same zzso can have distinct zzso expression and/or zzso zzso Some zzso may stimulate tumor growth while others may have zzso zzso zzso therapy may be tailored depending upon the zzso profile of the individual zzso
