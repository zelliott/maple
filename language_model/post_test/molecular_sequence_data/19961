zzso derived from zzso zzso play important biological roles in a variety of living zzso In previous works we showed that the zzso zzso of bovine zzso zzso and its zzso zzso analogue zzso exhibit zzso activity and we determined the zzso structure of zzso bound to sodium zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso is lethal to zzso zzso at zzso zzso probably through disruption of its plasma zzso In addition, we show that, even when used at 50 zzso zzso zzso produces low zzso zzso zzso zzso Recognizing that one of the key steps to study new compounds with potential pharmaceutical application is to identify the structural elements essential to express biological activity, we also investigated the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso exhibits the same minimal zzso concentration as zzso whereas zzso and zzso are significantly less zzso zzso for all the peptides tested, we observed that zzso zzso produces a zzso of their zzso activity and we associate that increased biological activity to a preferred structural and spatial organization of the zzso region favored by zzso Finally, the data show that the most active peptides zzso and zzso are characterized by a central hinge joining the zzso region that zzso containing a zzso followed by and a zzso element, to the zzso region that presents only a zzso We zzso that these two structured regions, by fluctuating independently in the zzso environment, may act in a coordinated fashion zzso the zzso plasma zzso
