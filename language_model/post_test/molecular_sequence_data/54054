The zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso were determined in zzso zzso transgenic zzso The zzso zzso zzso which exhibits a zzso zzso zzso was used as the rescue marker zzso Studies of zzso zzso among different zzso and zzso were simplified using this system because of the short coding sequence zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso administration to transgenic mice significantly elevated the zzso zzso in various adult zzso Two distinctive patterns of zzso spectrum were observed, depending on the zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso and zzso were predominantly zzso to zzso zzso as expected for zzso zzso zzso zzso like the liver and brain, however, carried many fewer zzso to zzso transitions but significantly more single base zzso of which the spectrum was very similar to that of background zzso in the zzso transgenic zzso This spectrum difference among more and less zzso zzso was confirmed by the zzso occurrence of zzso to zzso transitions in fetal liver cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso In addition, most zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso transitions induced by zzso were detected in the first zzso of some zzso or zzso zzso many of which corresponded to the middle zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso It is thus suggested that at particular sites, the neighboring bases in both the zzso side and 3' side seem to influence either the zzso to DNA damage or the ability to repair zzso zzso
