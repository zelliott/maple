Bird species show a high degree of variation in the composition of their zzso zzso zzso For instance, zzso birds like chicken contain fatty acid zzso of zzso while zzso like goose or zzso like barn zzso contain wax zzso in their zzso zzso zzso The final zzso step is zzso by wax zzso zzso which have been identified in zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso similarities enabled us to identify six zzso zzso putative wax zzso proteins in chicken and two from barn zzso and zzso zzso studies in zzso under in zzso and in zzso conditions showed that three proteins from chicken performed zzso activity while a sequence from chicken, goose and barn zzso zzso a zzso zzso catalyzing both wax zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to differ in their zzso zzso especially with regard to zzso alcohols and zzso zzso According to the expression patterns of their transcripts and the properties of the zzso avian zzso proteins might not be confined to zzso zzso 

We provide direct evidence that avian zzso zzso possess both zzso and zzso zzso proteins which have different expression patterns and zzso activities with different zzso zzso
