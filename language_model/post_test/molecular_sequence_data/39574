The zzso of terminated zzso to the synthesis of zzso fragments of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso The reactions of terminated zzso were carried out with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso as terminating molecules were also zzso The primary formation of zzso products of zzso zzso zzso was observed in almost all the zzso Only the experiments with the zzso based on the zzso zzso under the conditions of the zzso reaction led to reduced yields zzso of the zzso zzso However, even in this case, the desired terminated zzso were generated in approximately zzso yield and mainly were the products of single zzso of the zzso by the zzso These experiments allow the conclusion that, under the examined conditions, the reaction of terminated zzso could not result in the synthesis of zzso with a high molecular zzso
