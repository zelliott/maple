Many zzso genes when cloned into bacterial expression zzso are poorly expressed because of an inefficient zzso binding site zzso We have constructed a zzso which expresses human zzso zzso where the level of expression is limited by the zzso zzso was increased by placing the zzso sequence immediately downstream of a small translated zzso The production of zzso was dependent upon the efficiency of translation of this upstream zzso and could be increased to very high zzso The same upstream zzso would greatly improve the expression of zzso in a zzso where the zzso was very poor due to zzso secondary structure at the zzso end of its zzso However, it would not improve the efficiency of a poor zzso containing a weak zzso zzso The general utility of the zzso expression strategy to diagnose a weak zzso is zzso
