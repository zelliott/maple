It has become well known that zzso obtained by zzso with the ground state of peptides can display zzso zzso Our zzso light chain produced by zzso with the zzso zzso a highly zzso sequence in envelope zzso of zzso showed the ability to cleave this zzso Moreover, its heavy chain also zzso the zzso although this occurred at lower activity levels compared with the light chain, while the whole zzso did not show any zzso zzso From molecular zzso the light and heavy chains of the zzso were deduced to possess zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in their zzso zzso which may be responsible for the observed zzso zzso
