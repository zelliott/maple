zzso a protein associated with cell death, has been suggested as a marker of zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene expression with changes in zzso function and quantitative measurement of zzso protein levels after zzso obstruction have not been previously zzso With unilateral zzso obstruction in rabbits as the experimental model, the time course of zzso in zzso function, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein in serum, zzso and zzso tissue were zzso zzso zzso and zzso concentrating ability zzso sodium zzso and urine zzso all decreased zzso zzso zzso in the zzso kidney from control values within 1 day of zzso zzso zzso zzso levels started to rise in the zzso kidney within 12 h of zzso obstruction and increased up to zzso above control levels after 3 days of zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was initially zzso in collecting ducts and zzso zzso within 12 h of zzso zzso After 7 days of zzso increased zzso of zzso zzso was also zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression remained elevated in collecting ducts after 60 days of zzso zzso expression in the zzso kidney was increased twofold over control values after 12 h of zzso No increase in zzso zzso zzso was zzso after 24 h in the zzso zzso Total zzso protein in the zzso kidney increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso after 7 days of zzso obstruction zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
