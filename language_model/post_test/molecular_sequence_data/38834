The zzso coat protein II zzso is responsible for zzso budding from the zzso zzso zzso zzso functional zzso for all zzso zzso zzso except for zzso have been zzso We have cloned a zzso zzso whose product zzso is about zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso Data base searches also revealed another partial sequence zzso a zzso zzso that is zzso identical to zzso Northern analysis revealed that zzso transcripts are zzso and abundantly zzso while zzso transcripts are particularly enriched in the zzso and zzso but present in very low levels in other zzso zzso is localized to zzso structures that scatter throughout the cell but are concentrated at the zzso zzso The structures marked by zzso contain zzso a component of zzso that is well characterized to mark the zzso exit zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso with zzso in structures with extensive zzso zzso zzso raised against a zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso and inhibit zzso transport of zzso zzso zzso G protein in a zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso failed to support zzso zzso G protein zzso which can be rescued by a high molecular weight fraction of the zzso containing both zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso represents a functional zzso zzso of zzso zzso
