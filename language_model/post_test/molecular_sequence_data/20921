The zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso disease virus zzso are important for host cell binding during the initiation of zzso They are also known to determine virus zzso This study presents a complete genetic and zzso analysis of these proteins (and the genes that code for them) to allow comparison of the selective pressures acting on each and the correlation of genetic sequence data with zzso zzso numbers, gene and protein sizes, zzso positions, zzso zzso terminal zzso start and stop zzso and zzso relationships are all zzso The results show that zzso is highly zzso is under great pressure to adapt and can be correlated with zzso While also zzso zzso appears to be under less zzso pressure than zzso but still shows some correlation with zzso Seven zzso of zzso have been defined in this study, although the results do show that some zzso are extremely closely zzso highlight the benefit of using both molecular and zzso zzso Analysis of the terminal zzso showed that the zzso zzso is under greater zzso selection than the zzso Evidence is also presented that both segments 2 and 6 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso have grown via gene zzso and subsequent zzso
