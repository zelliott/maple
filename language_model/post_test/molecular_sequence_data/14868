Among zzso the zzso stand out with a high prevalence of blood zzso Four of 5 species in this family have been found to be infected with zzso however, complete species descriptions with molecular zzso are zzso Seventy-five samples from 4 species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso minor, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were screened for infections caused by species of zzso Four different zzso zzso were found infecting zzso based on the sequencing of a zzso of the zzso b zzso Two zzso belong to the zzso zzso and the other 2 zzso to zzso within the zzso zzso zzso The more prevalent and cosmopolitan zzso zzso zzso was zzso grouped with other zzso zzso infecting zzso birds, but it could not be detected from the single sample from zzso zzso The other zzso zzso zzso was not zzso clustered with zzso infecting zzso birds, and it was zzso from a single (1 each) zzso zzso and zzso zzso Blood zzso from zzso zzso infected only by zzso zzso showed sufficient zzso to allow description of a new species, zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso the only previously known blood zzso infecting zzso and described from zzso minor from Galapagos Islands, zzso from zzso zzso zzso are shorter with no contact of zzso with host cell zzso zzso have fewer zzso zzso and zzso have wider zzso with a smaller host nuclear zzso In contrast, patent single infections corresponding to the cosmopolitan zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were also found in samples from 1 zzso zzso 1 zzso minor, and 1 zzso zzso In all these cases, the number of zzso was very low, resembling zzso zzso which lacks zzso in the original zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso differ significantly from all the characteristics measured from zzso zzso In addition, it also differs from all characteristics of zzso zzso despite being genetically identical in the analyzed zzso
