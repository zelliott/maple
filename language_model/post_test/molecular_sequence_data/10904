The zzso locus of zzso zzso zzso zzso was previously defined by a zzso that reduces the amount and alters the composition of zzso zzso zzso Sixty independently derived zzso zzso zzso were isolated from stocks that carried the zzso zzso zzso A DNA zzso that contains a zzso zzso and that zzso with one of these zzso zzso was identified and zzso DNA zzso the zzso zzso was shown via zzso zzso experiments to represent the zzso zzso The zzso probe revealed a zzso transcript present in zzso zzso leaves and, in lesser zzso in other zzso and at other zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from an apparently full-length zzso zzso exhibits highly significant sequence similarity to a group of zzso from plants, zzso and zzso that zzso the reduction of zzso This finding suggests that the zzso protein probably functions as a zzso during fatty acid zzso in the zzso wax zzso zzso
