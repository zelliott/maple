Not enough muscles zzso zzso of zzso reveal defects in the development of embryonic muscles, a subset of zzso cells, the zzso and derivatives of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso not enough muscles zzso reveals reduction of the zzso embryonic muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular analysis of the zzso locus shows a complex zzso zzso One zzso unit was identified as zzso zzso Within the first zzso of zzso we find another independent zzso zzso zzso which is not affected in zzso zzso zzso transcripts are zzso zzso in zzso and may prefigure the zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso is zzso distributed during early zzso due to maternal zzso Later, some enrichment of zzso is observed in the nervous system and the zzso The muscle zzso shows deletions as well as zzso of specific muscles which is reflected in a change of zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressing zzso Our data suggest a role for zzso in the zzso process of a subset of muscle zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso the eve expressing zzso cells of the developing heart are significantly reduced in zzso
