Mass zzso tissue profiling and imaging are technologies that allow identification and zzso of protein signals directly on thin sections cut from fresh frozen tissue zzso These technologies were zzso to evaluate protein expression profiles in the normal mouse prostate during development zzso weeks of age), at sexual maturation (6 weeks of age), and in adult prostate (at 10, 15, or 40 weeks of zzso The evolution of protein expression during normal prostate development and maturation were subsequently compared with zzso prostate tumors derived from genetically engineered mice carrying the Large T zzso gene under regulation of the zzso zzso promoter zzso mouse model for prostate zzso This approach identified proteins zzso expressed at specific time points during prostate zzso zzso expression of some of these zzso for example zzso and zzso zzso were associated with prostate zzso and prostate tumor formation resulted in their loss of zzso zzso A, a protein found in other zzso was zzso zzso on the N zzso and both zzso appeared during normal prostate and prostate tumor zzso Imaging mass zzso localized the protein signals to specific zzso zzso or zzso Thus, tissue profiling and imaging can be zzso to analyze the zzso of protein expression during prostate zzso and zzso and identify proteins that could potentially serve as zzso for prostate zzso
