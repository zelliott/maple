zzso in zzso is said to occur when the combined response from two DNA elements for the binding of zzso factors is greater than the sum of the responses from each element in zzso The zzso of steroid receptors with themselves or with other zzso factors at zzso zzso of steroid has proved to be an important component of zzso gene zzso We have recently described a zzso zzso element zzso of the rat zzso zzso gene that, in conjunction with a zzso factor, zzso the zzso activity of zzso and zzso complexes with zzso and zzso genes and promoters zzso zzso and Simons, zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso 6, zzso We now report that, under certain circumstances, the zzso displays synergistic activity with a zzso element zzso However, several properties of zzso action are different from those previously observed for zzso The effects of the zzso were marked at zzso or zzso zzso of zzso but insignificant at zzso zzso which are the established conditions for zzso The zzso was found to increase the zzso activity of partial zzso while zzso involving zzso has yet to be zzso Furthermore, the zzso was active in conjunction with two tandem repeats of a zzso which was a combination that did not support conventional zzso Most importantly, the effects of the zzso were greater than with any other zzso factor binding element tested, indicative of a zzso zzso The efficacy of the zzso was also insensitive to the spacing between zzso Thus, the zzso provides a mechanism for selective zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and by zzso of a common class of genes that are under the control of two or more zzso
