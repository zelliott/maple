The zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso B zzso has been modified for optimal expression in zzso zzso zzso to the zzso gene and its expression cassette include: zzso removal of all upstream start zzso zzso conversion of the region around the start zzso to the consensus sequence associated with efficient translation zzso and zzso removal of downstream zzso donor and zzso zzso The resulting zzso gene is an efficient dominant zzso marker that is useful for studies requiring resistance from a zzso gene driven by a promoter of moderate zzso The zzso gene was also tested for its zzso with zzso zzso Mouse zzso cells harboring zzso plasmids exhibited properties of zzso cells and were resistant to toxic levels of zzso The zzso were stable as zzso and present in high zzso The zzso gene thus joins the zzso zzso gene as the only dominant zzso markers that are known to be compatible with zzso zzso
