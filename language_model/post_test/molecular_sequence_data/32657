zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso gene result in the most common form of zzso muscular zzso zzso There are currently three models for the molecular basis of cellular pathology in zzso zzso lack of zzso leads to zzso weakness and failure, followed by cellular zzso as is the case in zzso muscular zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso signaling during the development and maintenance of muscle tissue results in zzso proliferation and fusion zzso zzso loss of zzso from the basement membrane of the zzso cells surrounding the peripheral nerves results in a lack of motor zzso leading to effective zzso zzso Here we show that the degenerative muscle zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results from zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis of mechanically loaded fibers and membrane zzso zzso suggest that, unlike zzso fiber detachment is not initially associated with zzso zzso Early muscle formation and zzso fusion are normal, indicating that any zzso in early zzso signaling does not lead to muscle zzso In addition, zzso by the primary motor zzso is zzso and fiber detachment stems from muscle contraction, demonstrating that muscle zzso through lack of motor zzso activity does not contribute to pathology in this zzso Using these and other zzso we present a model of zzso function where fiber detachment external to the zzso is mechanically zzso and zzso fibers with uncompromised zzso undergo subsequent zzso
