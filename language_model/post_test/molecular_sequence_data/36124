zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has been shown to be rare in human zzso zzso the most common primary liver cancer and one usually associated with chronic viral zzso To reveal the association of zzso zzso with zzso under different zzso backgrounds, the zzso of point zzso at zzso 12 and 13 of the zzso zzso was examined in three groups of human liver zzso with differentiation to zzso zzso zzso Group 1, zzso zzso in Japanese with normal zzso Group 2, zzso zzso in zzso who had lived in an area where the liver fluke zzso zzso is zzso and Group 3, combined zzso zzso a rare type showing features of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso in Japanese with chronic viral zzso with or without zzso The zzso chain reaction and direct sequencing of its product were used to detect the zzso Point zzso at zzso 12 of the zzso gene was detected in five zzso of nine cases in Group zzso In contrast, the zzso was not detected in any of the cases in Groups 2 and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not seem to be involved in the development of primary liver zzso associated with apparent chronic irritation of liver cells or zzso zzso cells caused by zzso zzso or viral zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso may be involved in zzso in liver without zzso zzso or viral zzso
