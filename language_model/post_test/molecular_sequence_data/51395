A zzso zzso the zzso protein A was modified by cloning the spa zzso including its signal zzso zzso downstream of the translation initiation sites of the zzso zzso zzso gene and under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression from this construct was studied using the zzso coli zzso gene as a reporter gene after fusion to the spa zzso zzso of alkaline zzso activity, 1 h after temperature induction of expression at 42 degrees C, revealed an zzso increase over host strain background zzso The presence of the alternating zzso markers on the described zzso zzso which are essential for efficient zzso construction of zzso by the gapped duplex DNA method, allows the construction of zzso and zzso forms of zzso protein A fusion proteins and efficient expression of spa gene zzso without changing the zzso zzso
