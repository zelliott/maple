To investigate as to whether a zzso derived from zzso E zzso can inhibit the zzso activity of this protein or not, several peptides were examined for their efficacy to inhibit the zzso activity of the protein against human red blood cells zzso It was found that a zzso zzso zzso derived from an zzso zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso acid region zzso inhibited the zzso activity of zzso E against zzso To understand the basis of this zzso several functional and structural studies were zzso Western zzso analysis indicated that the zzso of zzso with zzso did not inhibit its binding to zzso The results indicated that zzso but not its zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso of zzso after incubation with either protein or zzso complex suggested that zzso prevented the zzso zzso damage of the membrane organization of zzso zzso zzso and circular zzso studies showed that zzso induced a zzso change in zzso which was accompanied by the enhancement of an appreciable zzso zzso Fluorescence studies with zzso peptides showed that zzso zzso zzso in zzso environment, which raised a possibility that the zzso zzso could interact with its counterpart in the protein and thus disturb the proper zzso of zzso resulting in the zzso of its zzso zzso The peptides derived from the zzso segments of other members of this toxin family may also act as zzso of the corresponding zzso
