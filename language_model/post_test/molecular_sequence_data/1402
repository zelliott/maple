Human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso is associated with a number of human diseases; therefore, its zzso is a potential target for zzso To compare the specificity of zzso zzso with that of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso representing naturally occurring zzso sites in various zzso were zzso The number of zzso peptides as well as the specificity zzso suggested a substantially broader specificity of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso sites were replaced by equivalent ones of zzso zzso Most of the single and multiple zzso had altered specificity and a dramatically reduced folding and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso are not well tolerated in zzso zzso The zzso most efficient zzso was that with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso profile of the zzso was also determined for five zzso used in clinical practice and inhibitor zzso of zzso zzso zzso Except for zzso the zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit wild type and most of the zzso zzso zzso The wild type zzso zzso was inhibited by the reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso showed various degrees of weakened binding zzso Most interesting, the zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso region was the most sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso and least sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso plays an important role in defining the specificity differences of zzso zzso
