zzso zzso produces outer zzso proteins that include the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso We analyzed the zzso zzso outer membrane zzso and identified numerous proteins with zzso zzso similar in sequence to those of zzso zzso and zzso indicating that these zzso may have a common zzso Using zzso as a model to investigate the role of the zzso domain, we expressed zzso as a full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso or with the zzso 72 zzso acids deleted zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso active and located predominantly attached to the outer membrane of both background zzso zzso was inactive and outer membrane zzso with a typical attachment profile for both background strains according to sodium zzso zzso gel zzso but in zzso the zzso was not zzso Thus, in zzso zzso export and membrane attachment are independent of the zzso activity of zzso zzso or zzso However, for maturation involving zzso processing of zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso or zzso is zzso The zzso zzso was not attached to the outer membrane and was located as largely zzso discrete zzso and zzso zzso in the culture zzso and the zzso These results suggest that the zzso domain is essential for outer membrane attachment and may be involved in a coordinated process of export and attachment to the cell zzso
