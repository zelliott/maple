zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso have been reported in patients with various zzso disorders and zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso to other zzso such as the zzso zzso In addition, zzso against zzso forms of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been found in patients suffering from zzso and zzso In this study, we screened zzso for zzso zzso from patients with active and inactive systemic lupus zzso zzso and primary or secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso of all zzso patients were positive for zzso zzso The zzso regions of zzso were determined using full length zzso and fragments of zzso prepared in zzso and zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso peptides corresponding to the major zzso region of zzso zzso acids zzso each one overlapping by 12 zzso zzso were used to map the B cell zzso on the zzso protein recognized by zzso zzso Major zzso zzso were found to be associated with the zzso half of the protein in zzso of the zzso zzso from active disease patients, while the zzso was not zzso Major zzso were found to be zzso with zzso in zzso from zzso patients with both active and inactive disease, spanning different regions of the N and zzso zzso from both healthy and disease controls and primary zzso syndrome patients were zzso to these zzso Limited zzso of zzso with two major zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso G, demonstrated that an zzso region of zzso is resistant to zzso Interestingly, some of the zzso with the highest zzso belong to the fragments of the protein which bind to zzso and inhibit complement zzso Whether zzso association with zzso is a pathological or protective interaction between these two proteins is currently under zzso
