zzso zzso interacts with host zzso via distinct surface zzso One of these components is the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso now specified as class zzso an zzso that represents a protein family with characteristic zzso Here we present the complete structure of a novel zzso protein of zzso zzso designated zzso which is distinct from the previously described zzso zzso The zzso gene originated from a zzso zzso library of zzso DNA from group A zzso strain zzso and coded for a 113 zzso protein exhibiting features of zzso surface proteins of zzso zzso The expression of biologically active fusion proteins allowed the determination of the location of the zzso domain within the zzso part of the zzso It consisted of two and a half repeats which share common motifs with zzso repeats of other zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion protein containing this domain competitively inhibited the binding of zzso to the parental zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso against the binding domain specifically blocked the zzso zzso site on the zzso zzso No zzso could be detected between zzso zzso and the zzso gene product, and vice versa, indicating that the two proteins do not share common zzso zzso Southern zzso experiments performed with specific zzso gene zzso revealed the presence of the zzso gene in more than zzso of 93 zzso zzso zzso The majority of the strains also zzso the zzso zzso and zzso carried at least one of the two zzso zzso
