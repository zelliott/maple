zzso protein surface regions zzso recognizable by zzso zzso zzso is at the heart of new zzso zzso discovery and vaccine design, and zzso methods for zzso zzso prediction provide crucial means to serve this zzso Many linear zzso zzso prediction methods were developed, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso towards this zzso However, effective zzso research demands more robust performance of the prediction method than what the current zzso could zzso In this work, a new method to predict linear zzso zzso is zzso Support zzso zzso has been zzso by combining the zzso similarity and zzso scores zzso zzso to zzso zzso linear zzso extracted from zzso zzso achieves a sensitivity of zzso and a precision of zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso value is zzso The combination of similarity and propensity of zzso zzso can improve the prediction performance for linear zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is capable of recognizing viral peptides from a human protein sequence zzso A web server based on our method is constructed for public zzso The server and all zzso used in the current study are available at zzso
