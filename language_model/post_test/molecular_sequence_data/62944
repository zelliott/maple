A set of 146 Antarctic marine zzso from the Ross Sea was characterized by a combination of molecular techniques in order to determine the degree of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by amplified zzso restriction analysis zzso using the zzso zzso zzso resulting in 52 different groups, corresponding to at least 52 different bacterial species, indicating a high degree of zzso zzso The zzso position of bacteria belonging to some zzso groups was obtained by sequencing of zzso zzso Random amplified zzso DNA zzso analysis, carried out on the largest zzso groups, revealed a high zzso genetic zzso zzso The analysis of zzso content revealed the existence of horizontal gene transfer between strains belonging to the same and to different zzso A comparison of the whole body of zzso zzso and zzso data was finally carried zzso
