Many viruses express zzso of programmed cell death zzso thereby countering host defenses that would otherwise rapidly clear infected zzso To counter this, viruses such as zzso and zzso express recognizable zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso In contrast, the majority of zzso lack viral zzso zzso zzso that are readily identified by sequence zzso One such virus, zzso virus, which is the zzso agent of zzso expresses a zzso factor that is a potent inhibitor of zzso In spite of the scant sequence similarity to zzso zzso virus zzso adopts an almost identical zzso zzso We used zzso as bait in a sequence similarity search for other zzso proteins and identified six putative zzso proteins from zzso Some are potent zzso of zzso in particular zzso virus zzso which inhibited cell death induced by multiple zzso zzso zzso compensated for the loss of zzso zzso in zzso virus and acts to directly counter the cell death zzso zzso and zzso zzso also engages a unique subset of the zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso This suggests that zzso may have been selected for specific biological roles as a zzso factor for zzso zzso
