zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are localized either at the zzso zzso or plasma membrane zzso As limited information is available on structural zzso required for targeting of plant membrane zzso we performed gene zzso and domain swapping experiments of zzso zzso A 7 zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso and zzso was required for zzso zzso and sufficient to redirect not only zzso zzso or zzso but also zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso scanning zzso identified zzso and zzso of zzso to be essential for zzso zzso while only one zzso zzso acid at position 5, 6 or 7 was required, revealing a zzso zzso or zzso motif with at least one upstream zzso zzso Similar zzso motifs could be identified in other plant zzso zzso indicating a broader role of this targeting motif in zzso zzso to the PM required the loop between zzso domain 6 and 7 of zzso or zzso zzso of either PM or zzso targeting signals resulted in retention in internal zzso indicating that zzso trafficking to these destination zzso requires distinct signals and is in both cases not by zzso
