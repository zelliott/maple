The zzso C virus zzso protein has been recently implicated in virus particle zzso To further understand the role of zzso in this process, we conducted a reverse genetic analysis of zzso in the context of a zzso zzso zzso infectious cell culture zzso Of 32 zzso tested, all were capable of zzso replication and 25 had zzso defects in virus zzso Through forward genetic selection for zzso capable of virus spread, we identified zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that suppressed zzso defects in zzso Two zzso zzso E1 zzso and zzso zzso were further characterized by additional genetic and zzso zzso Both zzso were shown to suppress other zzso zzso often with mutual zzso Thus, several zzso zzso were enhanced by zzso zzso and inhibited by E1 zzso while others were enhanced by E1 zzso and inhibited by zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso zzso zzso lowers the affinity of native, full-length zzso for functional zzso zzso These data reveal a complex network of interactions involving zzso and other viral structural and zzso proteins during virus zzso
