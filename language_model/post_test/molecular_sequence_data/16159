The 2 zzso zzso of zzso zzso is maintained by the action of zzso gene products that control copy number and promote zzso of zzso copies at cell zzso We show that the zzso and zzso zzso gene products are master regulators that act in concert to zzso the level of their own transcripts and to regulate transcript levels of the zzso gene that promotes zzso copy zzso zzso and zzso are also shown to repress zzso at zzso the zzso site essential for zzso zzso We propose a model in which zzso acts by zzso zzso zzso that otherwise cause zzso molecules to adhere to the mother nucleus and segregate zzso On the basis of their ability to generate specific zzso structures, we also propose that the zzso and zzso gene products interact with different specific sequences found zzso in the 2 zzso zzso
