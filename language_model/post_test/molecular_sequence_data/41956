zzso hormones induce transient zzso zzso of zzso during the early zzso of zzso stimulation of target zzso This is zzso by a functional zzso response element zzso that in the human zzso gene is localized zzso zzso of the zzso start zzso This is the first known example of transient zzso zzso induced by a steroid hormone acting via its nuclear zzso Starting with the hypothesis that the product of zzso zzso interferes with zzso zzso zzso activity on this gene promoter, generating in this way a feedback zzso mechanism responsible for the rapid zzso zzso detected in zzso we tested the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso expression zzso is followed by zzso zzso of reporter genes zzso the zzso zzso linked to its own zzso zzso of zzso in the cell zzso a significant reduction in the activity of zzso on the reporter zzso zzso antagonism is effective on both zzso zzso functions of the zzso zzso and is independent of the nature of the target zzso Furthermore, under the same experimental conditions, the zzso complex zzso zzso of an zzso test gene by zzso zzso zzso deprived of the zzso domain are efficient zzso of zzso activity, indicating that zzso antagonism is likely to be zzso by the formation of inactive complexes between the two zzso These results reveal the existence of a functional interference between the zzso and zzso for regulation of zzso zzso zzso It is the first case in which the product of an zzso zzso gene is shown to exert a negative feedback control on zzso regulation of its own zzso
