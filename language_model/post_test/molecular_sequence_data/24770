zzso recognition by zzso coupled receptors zzso is reviewed with an emphasis on the indirect approach used to determine the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This approach was developed in response to the lack of detailed structural information available for these zzso Recent advances in the structural determination of zzso (the zzso of the visual zzso by zzso have provided a scaffold for zzso modeling of the inactive state of a wide variety of zzso that interact with zzso zzso Additionally, the ability to mutate zzso and zzso compounds of similar chemical structure to test a common binding site on the zzso provides a firm experimental basis for zzso zzso zzso zzso common in other well-studied systems such as zzso zzso and major zzso class receptors zzso are reviewed briefly to provide a basis of zzso Finally, the development of true zzso is contrasted with zzso zzso discovered through zzso zzso In many systems, the evidence suggests that the zzso zzso bind at the interface between the zzso segments and the zzso zzso while zzso zzso bind within the zzso zzso zzso models of zzso and the mechanism by which they activate zzso on binding peptides are beginning to zzso
