DNA damage generated by oxygen zzso includes zzso zzso (AP) sites and strand breaks that bear zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso repairs such DNA zzso by using a single major zzso We have cloned the zzso structural gene zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso by zzso screening of a zzso zzso DNA expression library in zzso zzso Gene disruption experiments confirm that the zzso protein accounts for greater than or equal to zzso of both zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso activities in zzso zzso zzso The DNA and predicted zzso acid sequences for the zzso gene are zzso to those for the zzso gene zzso DNA zzso IV of zzso zzso This conservation of structure between a zzso zzso and its zzso counterpart underscores the fundamental nature of their roles in DNA zzso
