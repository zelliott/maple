zzso zzso by the complexes of zzso and zzso zzso plays a key role in cell cycle progression in all zzso The amplification by zzso chain reaction of a zzso box from developing root zzso and root zzso of soybean showed the expression of a number of different molecular species of zzso zzso in plant zzso and they were classified into five distinct groups based on their sequence zzso The complete soybean zzso zzso zzso to zzso corresponding to each group were isolated, and their predicted zzso acid sequences showed clear similarities to zzso zzso identified from various zzso These genes are expressed predominantly in such zzso zzso as root and shoot zzso and young developing zzso zzso in zzso zzso involving zzso zzso as an zzso marker allowed us to estimate the zzso during which these zzso genes are abundantly zzso The results indicated that zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and zzso is expressed from late zzso zzso These expression patterns, together with the sequence criteria, strongly suggest that zzso and zzso zzso the plant zzso for A- and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the expression of zzso was restricted during a short period in S phase, suggesting that it belongs to a novel class of plant zzso zzso comparison of 18 plant zzso zzso cloned thus far showed that they can be divided into four distinct structural groups with different functions in cell cycle zzso
