We report the zzso sequence of melon, an important zzso crop zzso We assembled 375 zzso of the zzso line zzso representing zzso of the estimated melon zzso We predicted zzso zzso zzso which we analyzed by reconstructing zzso zzso trees, allowing mapping of the zzso and zzso relationships of zzso plant zzso We observed the absence of recent zzso zzso in the melon lineage since the ancient zzso zzso and our data suggest that zzso amplification may in part explain the increased size of the melon zzso compared with the close relative zzso A low number of zzso zzso repeat disease resistance genes were zzso suggesting the existence of specific defense mechanisms in this zzso The zzso zzso was compared with that of its parental lines allowing the zzso of sequence zzso in the zzso The use of the zzso sequence in future investigations will facilitate the understanding of evolution of zzso and the improvement of breeding zzso
