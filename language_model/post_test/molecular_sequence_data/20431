We previously showed that zzso zzso C viruses elicit potent but highly zzso zzso zzso zzso within the first year of zzso In order to determine the specificity and evolution of these zzso zzso we examined zzso escape in four individuals whose responses against the earliest envelope differed in magnitude and zzso zzso escape occurred in all participants, with later viruses showing decreased sensitivity to zzso zzso although they retained sensitivity to new zzso zzso Early zzso responses were very zzso occurring zzso and targeting only two regions of the zzso In zzso limited zzso acid changes often involving zzso or zzso zzso partial or complete escape, with zzso targeting the zzso region directly in 2 zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was also a zzso target, with zzso escape associated with changes to positively charged zzso In one individual, relatively high zzso of zzso zzso were required to drive genetic escape, taking up to 7 weeks for the resistant zzso to zzso zzso zzso waned but were still zzso Development of this single zzso zzso specificity was associated with a zzso drop in zzso viral load and a zzso rebound as the escape zzso zzso Overall, our data suggest the development of a very limited number of zzso zzso zzso during the early stages of zzso zzso C infection, with zzso fluctuations in zzso as escape zzso While the mechanism of zzso escape appears to vary between individuals, the involvement of limited regions suggests there might be common vulnerabilities in the zzso zzso C transmitted zzso
