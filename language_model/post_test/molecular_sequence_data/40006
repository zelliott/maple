zzso editing is a process that zzso the information in transcripts of almost all zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to determine the frequency and distribution of zzso zzso editing in zzso zzso zzso were zzso and compared to the published zzso zzso zzso C to U zzso were identified across the 31 known protein genes and zzso in zzso the fewest so far for a plant zzso zzso zzso patterns in the putative gene zzso indicate that it is most likely a functional zzso zzso indicating that patterns of editing can be a useful zzso of gene zzso zzso also contains a zzso repeat region whose members are nearly identical yet zzso zzso most likely due to differences in the sequence context of the editing zzso In addition, we show that partial editing in zzso is common at silent editing sites but rare at zzso editing sites, extending previous observations to a complete plant zzso zzso Finally, the degree of partial editing observed for certain genes was dependent on the choice of zzso used, demonstrating that care must be taken when designing zzso for use in editing zzso
