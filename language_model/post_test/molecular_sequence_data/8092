It has been shown that the zzso cap structure plays important roles in zzso zzso and nuclear export of zzso As a candidate for the factor involved in these nuclear events we have previously zzso an 80 zzso nuclear cap binding protein zzso from a zzso cell nuclear extract and isolated its full-length zzso In this report, in order to obtain a clue to the cellular functions of zzso we attempted to identify a zzso that interacts with zzso Using the zzso zzso system we isolated three clones from a zzso cell zzso zzso We designated the proteins zzso by these clones zzso zzso interacting zzso zzso and zzso have an zzso zzso zzso binding domain, whereas zzso contains a unique domain of zzso or zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso requires zzso for binding to the cap zzso zzso roles of zzso in zzso nuclear processes are zzso
