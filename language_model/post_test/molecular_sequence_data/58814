Identification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as the gene that is defective in diabetes zzso mice and fatty zzso rats provides an important candidate gene for the study of the zzso of human zzso We defined the boundaries of the 18 coding zzso for the long form of zzso and zzso the immediately adjacent zzso zzso These sequences can be used to generate zzso for genetic analysis zzso direct sequencing, zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso of the possible role of zzso in the regulation of zzso in zzso In addition, we have identified two highly zzso zzso zzso that can be scored with the zzso chain zzso
