zzso and separate models able to apply different combination of substitution rate zzso zzso and zzso rate variation model zzso to each locus are frequently used in zzso studies of zzso zzso A zzso model assumes that branch lengths are zzso among partitions and a separate model assumes that each partition has an independent set of branch zzso However, the selection from among zzso zzso a common combination of models is applied to zzso zzso zzso zzso and separate models is usually based on the zzso preference rather than on any information zzso This study describes two programs, zzso (for DNA zzso and zzso (for zzso zzso which allow the selection of evolutionary models based on several types of information zzso The programs can handle both zzso and zzso data, in addition to providing an zzso wizard interface and a zzso command line zzso In the case of zzso data, zzso and zzso are compared at each locus and at zzso zzso zzso after which zzso zzso and separate models are compared based on information zzso The programs also provide model zzso files for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to support further zzso analysis using a selected zzso When zzso are zzso by zzso the zzso models were found to differ depending on the data zzso Furthermore, differences in the information criteria among zzso zzso and separate models were much larger than those among the zzso zzso These findings suggest that selecting from zzso zzso and separate models results in a better zzso zzso zzso and zzso are available at zzso They are licensed under zzso zzso and are able to run on Windows, zzso X and zzso
