It is known that the two types of zzso proteins zzso and zzso are tightly associated with the skeletal zzso and cardiac zzso receptors zzso respectively, and their interactions are important for channel functions of the zzso In the case of cardiac muscle, three zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso could be essential for the selective binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso Rogers, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study to identify zzso acid zzso of zzso that are important for the selective binding to zzso we zzso 9 zzso acid zzso of zzso that differ from the counterparts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and we examined binding properties of these zzso to zzso by in zzso binding zzso by using zzso zzso proteins of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso rabbit skeletal zzso zzso zzso Among the nine zzso tested, only zzso and zzso lost their selective binding ability to zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso with 33 various zzso for the 9 positions produced by introducing different size, charge, and zzso revealed that an integration of the hydrogen bonds by the irreplaceable zzso and the zzso interactions by the zzso zzso and zzso could be a possible mechanism for the binding of zzso to zzso zzso these results suggest that the zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso are essential and unique for binding of zzso to zzso in skeletal zzso
