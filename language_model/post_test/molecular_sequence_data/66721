zzso form zzso pores in the outer membrane of zzso bacteria with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso coli being zzso expressed depending on environmental zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso has been determined to zzso A resolution by X-ray zzso As expected from the high sequence zzso zzso adopts the zzso zzso hollow zzso fold with three zzso associated to form a tight zzso Unlike in zzso the zzso zzso form a continuous wall at the perimeter of the zzso common to the three zzso due to a zzso zzso in loop zzso The pore zzso and the zzso outlet are very similar to zzso with zzso of the pore lining zzso being zzso Overall, only few zzso zzso are exchanged at the pore zzso The zzso structure suggests that not pore size, but zzso pore potential and particular atomic details of the pore linings are the critical parameters that zzso distinguish zzso from zzso
