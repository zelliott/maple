Bennett's zzso zzso zzso and growth hormone zzso were zzso from an zzso extract of zzso zzso The extract from 202 zzso zzso g wet zzso was processed by gel zzso on zzso zzso gel zzso on zzso zzso zzso and then zzso zzso on zzso zzso The yields of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso Since recovery of zzso from the zzso exchange column was zzso zzso exchange was performed in the presence of zzso zzso in a subsequent zzso Recovery from this column was markedly increased to zzso The zzso hormones each gave a single band on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso with a molecular weight under reducing conditions of zzso and 23,000 for zzso and zzso zzso Each hormone was positively identified by its zzso zzso acid zzso which showed high sequence identity with the equivalent zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of zzso hormone was used to demonstrate that each hormone remained as a zzso in zzso zzso Each zzso hormone was tested in the zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been used in many earlier studies to measure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was less potent than zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso at 50% zzso and the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso were raised against zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso was developed for each zzso The sensitivity of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso which is similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with a number of zzso zzso hormones or zzso was zzso zzso The zzso zzso detected zzso zzso which is similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with a number of zzso zzso hormones or zzso was zzso zzso The zzso zzso detected zzso zzso zzso with zzso from several zzso species, and showed low zzso with zzso zzso zzso In both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from several species of zzso diluted in parallel with the zzso standard, suggesting that these zzso will be of use in studies of a number of zzso zzso
