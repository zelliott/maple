A zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso carried by the zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso was zzso and its zzso sequence was zzso Four complete open reading frames zzso and two partial zzso were zzso The translation product of the first partial zzso is the zzso end of a protein zzso to the zzso gene product from zzso zzso A zzso sequence containing a potential zzso promoter and zzso regulatory sites separates this zzso gene from the first complete zzso which encodes a protein zzso to zzso gene products from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso in strain zzso and the zzso zzso of strain zzso are located within this zzso zzso The zzso downstream from zzso predicts an zzso acid sequence with a zzso zzso pattern that is characteristic of zzso No similarities were found between the translation product of the third complete zzso and those of zzso genes from other zzso At the zzso end of the predicted translation product of the fourth complete ORF, 30 of 60 zzso acid zzso were identical with the sequence of the zzso gene product from zzso zzso The partial zzso located at the end of the zzso encodes the zzso part of a potential protein with an unknown zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis indicated that transcripts from the region containing the four complete zzso were zzso zzso and that the zzso products were identical in cells zzso under conditions of Mo zzso or Mo zzso or in the presence of zzso In contrast to the zzso strain zzso which is zzso under all conditions, zzso that carry zzso affecting the zzso end of zzso or genes located immediately downstream from zzso grew under all zzso zzso However, in the presence of zzso most of the strains required 1,000 times the amount of zzso that is sufficient for zzso growth of the zzso strain CA under zzso zzso Growth data from strain zzso which carries a zzso zzso in zzso indicate that zzso in zzso zzso is not required for zzso fixation in the presence of zzso or under zzso zzso Growth studies and zzso reduction zzso performed on two zzso deletion strains showed that zzso and zzso are required for zzso fixation under Mo zzso as previously observed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Weiss, zzso zzso Newton, and zzso zzso Dean, zzso zzso zzso zzso but not under conditions of Mo zzso or in the presence of 50 zzso zzso
