The zzso gene coding for rat zzso zzso was isolated from a rat liver zzso DNA zzso The gene spans 12 zzso and contains four zzso zzso I encodes the zzso region, zzso II encodes the zzso region, zzso III encodes the mature zzso sequence up to zzso acid 139 and zzso IV encodes the zzso two zzso zzso a stop zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of these zzso yields the zzso zzso zzso which is the zzso transcript observed in the zzso rat zzso cell tumor and several normal rat zzso The overall zzso organization of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is similar to that of the zzso gene and emphasizes the likelihood that zzso and zzso arose from a common ancestral zzso A comparison of the single promoter region of the rat with the second promoter of the human gene indicates zzso zzso and zzso box zzso zzso box regions zzso binding zzso putative zzso binding sites, and a vitamin D responsive zzso When compared to the seven zzso human zzso zzso which uses multiple promoters and encodes three zzso zzso the simpler organization of the rat gene zzso in zzso the zzso use of a single promoter and generation of a zzso acid zzso as the major molecular zzso
