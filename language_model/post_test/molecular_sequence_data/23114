A direct interaction between zzso and several zzso and zzso members of the zzso family has been demonstrated by effects on the assembly of zzso from pure rat brain zzso zzso Bid, and Bad inhibit assembly zzso whereas peptides from zzso and zzso promote zzso zzso at near zzso zzso These opposite effects on zzso assembly are mutually zzso The zzso zzso zzso common to all members of the family, are involved in the interaction with zzso but do not themselves affect zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso show that zzso is associated with the zzso zzso whereas Bid remains primarily with the zzso zzso These interactions require the presence of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as they do not occur with zzso S in which the zzso have been zzso While in no way ruling out other zzso such direct associations are the simplest potential regulatory mechanism for zzso resulting from disturbances in zzso or zzso zzso
