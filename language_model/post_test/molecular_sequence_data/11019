This study examines the diverse maximum wavelength zzso zzso found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the associated genetic variation in their zzso zzso We measured the wavelength zzso in the zzso of six species that inhabit environments of different light zzso zzso zzso streams, standing waters, and subterranean zzso Our results indicate that there is relatively little variation in zzso zzso zzso among species from different zzso and zzso The existing variation did not correlate with the habitat differences of the zzso zzso We simultaneously zzso the zzso gene to identify the zzso acid replacements that affect shifts in maximum wavelength zzso We then related these to changes that correlated with shifts in zzso by reconstructing ancestral character states using a zzso zzso Using zzso acid sequences obtained from five species (all were 301 zzso acids in zzso we identified a number of candidates for producing shifts of 4 to 8 zzso in zzso These zzso acid replacements occurred in similar regions to those involved in spectral shifts in zzso
