The recently discovered zzso zzso is a promising target for the development of new zzso The zzso involved in this zzso are crucial for the zzso of the essential zzso respiratory compound zzso and as the zzso is limited to few bacterial species such as the gastric pathogen zzso zzso it is a potential target for specific zzso In this report, the crystal structure of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso with broad specificity and activity towards zzso which is involved in the second step of zzso zzso has been zzso at a resolution of zzso and refined with R factors of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies on the wild type and zzso zzso show that the zzso of zzso follows a mechanism similar to that of zzso coli zzso Further evidence for this mode of action is supplied by the crystal structures of zzso zzso Through the use of reaction zzso the structures give additional evidence for the previously proposed zzso zzso These structures and the confirmed reaction mechanism will provide a structural basis for the design of new zzso targeting the zzso zzso
