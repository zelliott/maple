zzso cells lining the adult human colon do not normally express zzso releasing zzso zzso or its zzso zzso but both can be up regulated post zzso zzso However, controversy exists as to the contribution these proteins make to tumor cell behavior once zzso Since zzso zzso promotes zzso it has been assumed that their zzso expression promotes colon cancer zzso growth and zzso Yet we have contended that when zzso zzso benefits the host since in zzso studies demonstrate they enhance tumor cell attachment to the zzso zzso and promote zzso zzso by natural killer zzso Thus the aim of this study was to ascertain the effect of zzso zzso expression on patient zzso To do this we identified all zzso diagnosed at a single institution from 1998 to 2002 that were classified as zzso stage II or III zzso zzso zzso of these 50 zzso had sufficient zzso remaining for zzso zzso expression and natural killer cell density were determined zzso at the leading edge of each zzso and survival assessed by Kaplan zzso zzso zzso of high levels of zzso alone, or both zzso and zzso was associated with delayed zzso recurrence zzso months, zzso P zzso zzso and increased survival zzso months, zzso P zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso were associated with significantly fewer zzso zzso zzso than tumors not expressing these zzso and contained significantly more zzso + natural killer cells, than tumors not expressing these zzso These findings demonstrate that patients whose zzso express zzso are associated with a survival advantage as compared to those whose zzso do not express these zzso
