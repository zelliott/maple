The serum zzso P component zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a recently discovered, distinct zzso species, of known structure, which does not bind zzso and whose zzso sequence has been shown to differ markedly from the highly zzso N zzso of all other known zzso crab zzso The complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso and the derived zzso acid zzso the first zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso Two sequences were identified that differed only in the length of the 3' untranslated zzso zzso zzso is zzso as a precursor protein of 234 zzso acid zzso the first 17 zzso zzso a signal zzso that is absent from the mature zzso zzso analysis clusters zzso zzso zzso with the zzso crab zzso proteins zzso rather than the zzso zzso which are clustered with zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shares zzso identity with both human zzso and zzso which are 51% zzso and zzso with zzso crab zzso These analyses indicate that gene zzso of zzso (or zzso followed by sequence divergence and the evolution of zzso and/or zzso function, occurred independently along the zzso and zzso evolutionary lines rather than in a common zzso They further indicate that the zzso gene zzso event in zzso occurred before both the emergence of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso which does not exhibit the zzso characteristic of zzso binding to zzso is established as a zzso species distinct from all other known zzso crab zzso that exist in many zzso forms sharing a high level of sequence zzso
