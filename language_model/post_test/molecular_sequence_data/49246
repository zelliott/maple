We have performed an exhaustive unbiased zzso zzso analysis to identify interaction partners of two human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using their zzso regulatory domain as zzso A total of 20 different human proteins were found to interact with zzso zzso Several of these interactions were novel and an extensive zzso evaluation was performed for zzso The novel putative interactions include a zzso zzso zzso zzso and two new putative protein zzso The zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso was found to interact with all 20 proteins and to achieve zzso zzso Since similar putative zzso are present in a variety of protein zzso zzso the data suggest that the zzso may function as a major zzso interaction domain of these zzso We propose possible functional consequences of these novel zzso zzso
