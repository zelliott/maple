The four synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso acid sequence to the zzso zzso binding regions of four strains zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso solution structures of the trans forms of the peptides show zzso zzso which have been implicated in zzso and zzso zzso The interactions between these peptides and a zzso zzso zzso zzso have been studied using two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso in order to map the zzso zzso recognized by the zzso zzso for which spectral changes were observed upon zzso binding differed from zzso to zzso but were mostly confined to one or both of the turn regions and to the zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso and zzso pockets of these peptides upon zzso binding were also monitored by examination of the pattern of nuclear zzso effects zzso versus transferred nuclear zzso effects zzso for the free versus the bound zzso Although zzso developed strongly between side chain zzso in the zzso pockets of the zzso no additional backbone zzso were observed in the presence of zzso suggesting no major zzso changes in the secondary structures of the peptides upon zzso This implies a flexible zzso combining site, a feature which is discussed with respect to zzso strain zzso and the design of a synthetic zzso vaccine effective against a broad spectrum of zzso zzso zzso The binding of the zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also studied using zzso zzso in order to map the zzso recognized by the zzso zzso changes observed in the zzso spectrum with the binding of zzso were similar to those seen for the binding of zzso suggesting that the zzso recognized by the zzso is structurally zzso with the zzso recognized by the zzso The zzso of this result is discussed with respect to zzso versus zzso and the proper design of a vaccine which could prevent the zzso escape of the pathogen away from the zzso zzso zzso
