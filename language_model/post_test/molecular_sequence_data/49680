The family of zzso zzso channels zzso is a unique group of highly zzso channels consisting of two members, zzso and zzso We used zzso terminal zzso and zzso to delineate the molecular zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso To this end, rabbit zzso was expressed zzso with green fluorescent protein zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells using a zzso zzso zzso of the last 30 zzso acids of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso decreased the zzso sensitivity zzso Another critical sequence for zzso zzso of zzso was found upstream in the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso at zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso disclosed a critical sequence involved in zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso showed decreased zzso sensitivity, comparable to zzso while zzso lacked zzso zzso Interestingly, the number of green fluorescent cells, which is an index of the number of zzso cells, was significantly smaller for cells zzso with zzso shorter than zzso than for cells zzso with zzso zzso However, the expression level of zzso was restored in the presence of the zzso blocker zzso red, suggesting that these zzso resulted in deleterious zzso zzso In conclusion, we have identified two zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso that control zzso zzso
