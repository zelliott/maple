Basic zzso growth factor zzso is known to elicit various zzso effects on zzso in zzso but these effects were studied mainly over short-term zzso In this work we asked the question whether zzso could induce long-term effects on rat zzso in zzso This factor was found to induce only a transient zzso effect lasting less than 48 zzso even when the treatment was carried on for 4 zzso By contrast, it induced long-term effects on the rate of synthesis of several proteins as seen by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso after labeling the cells with zzso The most zzso protein was extracted from zzso gels of soluble extracts of cultured zzso zzso and of normal zzso It was characterized by internal zzso acid zzso Two zzso digest peptides had zzso sequences similar to rat lens zzso zzso This protein was also expressed in zzso and zzso cells in culture, but it was not zzso by zzso zzso zzso is thought to be involved in a minor zzso of zzso metabolism and in diabetic zzso Its long-term regulation by zzso will possibly help in the understanding of its actual zzso zzso
