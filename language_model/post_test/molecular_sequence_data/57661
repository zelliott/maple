zzso zzso zzso and its endemic form, zzso zzso zzso are zzso disorders characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that recognize a surface zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to bind zzso zzso a zzso zzso classified as a member of the zzso family of zzso cell zzso zzso In the present study we report the isolation of three overlapping zzso clones representing greater than zzso of the zzso domain of human zzso zzso proteins zzso by these zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso were produced in bacteria and analyzed for zzso zzso zzso with a panel of zzso zzso and control zzso zzso and zzso zzso possessing zzso with each of the three zzso fusion proteins zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso 123 zzso acids of the membrane zzso region of the zzso zzso showed zzso with the largest number of patient zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso 205 zzso acids of the zzso region of zzso could be eliminated by zzso of the zzso portion of this zzso indicating that zzso were not binding the zzso zzso zzso zzso with two of the three zzso were predominantly restricted to zzso the zzso shown to be zzso in the passive transfer mouse zzso The findings of this study demonstrate that the zzso domain of zzso contains at least three zzso sites recognized by zzso and zzso zzso The region near the zzso domain of zzso appears to contain an zzso zzso This study is the first to document zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso forms of zzso The use of such molecular tools should facilitate the identification and characterization of relevant zzso systems in zzso and zzso
