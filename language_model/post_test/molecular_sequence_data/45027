The zzso zzso zzso of embryonic zzso mouse zzso shows zzso zzso and zzso kidney disease, both of which result from the lack of the zzso zzso Previously, we suggested that zzso may be important for the zzso axis formation, not only in mice but also in zzso and that zzso regulates this zzso protein zzso Here, we isolated and characterized two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the mouse zzso zzso and performed functional analysis of the zzso zzso motifs that interact with zzso zzso expresses early in development in the same manner as mouse zzso zzso zzso a full-length zzso zzso zzso did not zzso cardiac orientation when injected into zzso zzso which is different from mouse zzso zzso zzso to mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso The present study indicates that zzso binding sites zzso zzso are crucial in controlling the biological activity of both mouse and zzso zzso zzso Although mouse and zzso zzso genes have a quite similar structure, the interaction with zzso and zzso motifs of zzso zzso and mouse zzso proteins may regulate their function in different zzso
