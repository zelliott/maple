Species zzso of the lens protein zzso was correlated with those of alcohol zzso of classes I and III and zzso zzso in the same protein zzso The extent of overall zzso nature of zzso zzso and patterns of segment zzso all fall within the limits typical of the zzso group of zzso alcohol zzso This shows that zzso is subject to restrictions similar to those of classical liver alcohol zzso and therefore derived from a metabolically active zzso like other zzso zzso Special zzso at the active site, however, differ zzso including an apparent lack of a zzso zzso This is compatible with altered functional properties and makes the spread within this zzso zzso family resemble the wide spread within the zzso zzso zzso plotting is useful for illustrating the differences between zzso and zzso zzso
