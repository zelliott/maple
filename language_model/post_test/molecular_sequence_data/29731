High zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in the zzso of diabetic zzso Here we report 200 zzso identified using zzso zzso that are zzso expressed when human zzso cells are zzso in high ambient zzso in zzso The major functional classes of genes identified included zzso and products of zzso zzso protein zzso regulators of cell growth and zzso and a cohort of zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso is a prominent feature of diabetic zzso The induction of zzso zzso regulatory gene expression by high zzso was attenuated by the inhibitor of zzso oxygen species generation, zzso cyanide zzso but not by the protein zzso C inhibitor zzso zzso and was not zzso by the addition of transforming growth factor zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso regulatory genes was also observed following disruption of the zzso cell zzso zzso by zzso zzso In aggregate, these results suggest that the induction of genes zzso zzso zzso regulatory proteins zzso is a prominent component of the zzso cell zzso response in diabetic zzso and zzso is dependent on zzso stress, is independent of protein zzso C and transforming growth zzso and represents an zzso response to zzso zzso zzso
