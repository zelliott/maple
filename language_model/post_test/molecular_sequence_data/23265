zzso zzso of the lung is a feature of both allergic and zzso zzso and zzso is the key zzso regulating the production and zzso of these zzso Despite many studies focusing on the zzso promoter in both humans and mice there is as yet no clear picture of how the zzso gene is zzso The aim of this study was to determine if zzso regulatory elements contribute to appropriate regulation of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter was compared to expression of the zzso zzso gene in zzso T zzso The zzso promoter was not sufficient to reproduce a zzso pattern of zzso zzso Further, functional analysis of the zzso and 3' zzso regions revealed a number of novel regulatory zzso We have identified a zzso zzso located approximately zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso This region contains two potential zzso sites and increases expression from the zzso promoter by up to zzso
