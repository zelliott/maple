zzso zzso zzso protein is required for DNA replication and repair and is associated with multiple zzso activities: zzso zzso DNA zzso and DNA zzso To investigate which of these activities is important for the cellular functions of zzso we have identified separation of function zzso that selectively zzso the zzso or zzso We describe the effect of six such zzso on zzso zzso and zzso after zzso of the zzso proteins from zzso or zzso insect zzso A zzso in the Walker A box in the zzso third of the protein affects zzso and zzso but not zzso a zzso in the zzso domain zzso acid zzso affects zzso zzso and zzso Two zzso in the zzso domain abolish zzso but do not reduce zzso activity zzso acids 657 and zzso and identify the putative zzso active zzso Two zzso immediately adjacent to the proposed zzso active site zzso acids 640 and zzso impair zzso activity in the absence of zzso but completely abolish zzso activity in the presence of zzso These results suggest that, although the zzso zzso and zzso activities can be independently affected by some zzso the two activities appear to zzso and the zzso activity is regulated in a complex manner by zzso zzso analysis shows that both zzso and zzso are important for the essential function of zzso in DNA replication and for its role in zzso break zzso Four of the zzso zzso are not only loss of function zzso but also exhibit a dominant negative zzso
