The ability of zzso nuclear zzso A, zzso B, zzso C, and zzso from zzso zzso tumor cells to bind zzso acids was investigated in zzso via a quantitative filter binding zzso At low zzso strength, zzso bound more zzso acid than the nuclear zzso and showed a preference for zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso A and C were quite similar in their binding properties and bound zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso The binding of zzso by the zzso A and C was reduced in competition experiments by both zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso B bound only zzso and zzso no other zzso acids tested were bound or could compete with the binding of zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso C specifically bound a synthetic zzso human zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso X zzso zzso was approximately zzso higher than those for zzso A zzso X zzso zzso and zzso C zzso X zzso zzso zzso B did not bind zzso amounts of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso A- and zzso zzso acid complexes, formed at low zzso strength, with solutions containing 150 zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso of bound zzso and zzso of bound synthetic zzso zzso zzso These results, using zzso individual zzso are in good agreement with data from competition experiments with zzso but are at odds with data obtained previously using a crude preparation of nuclear zzso proteins containing all three nuclear zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso 34, zzso The nuclear zzso A and C and zzso possess zzso zzso properties that might permit their binding to specific base sequences and/or unique DNA structure, such as that observed for the binding of the zzso zzso The significance of the higher affinity binding of zzso acids by the zzso protein zzso zzso with the nuclear zzso remains to be zzso
