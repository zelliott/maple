zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein which potentially zzso in the zzso zzso zzso During development, zzso is required in limb discs to repress zzso zzso target zzso zzso wingless zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso signal zzso zzso These repression functions have been proposed from studies using weak zzso zzso Interestingly, experiments with strong zzso zzso have revealed additional mechanisms in which zzso is required, such as leg zzso zzso We have isolated new zzso of the zzso gene in a screen for new negative regulators of zzso several zzso zzso by genetic and molecular zzso and a zzso zzso By performing zzso clone experiments with these new zzso zzso zzso we have determined that regulation of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso could be different from what has already been zzso We show here that in leg discs, lack of zzso function zzso the zzso of zzso independently of zzso zzso We present evidence that zzso legs resulting from zzso clone induction only come from zzso zzso in the normal zzso domain, as zzso zzso axis are induced zzso and adult zzso legs are often perfect with respect to zzso zzso In wing discs, zzso of zzso which is normally independent of zzso zzso is also zzso in the absence of zzso zzso We also describe, in discs bearing zzso zzso clones and in discs of two other zzso zzso a novel pattern of zzso expression consisting of an enlargement of the normal zzso zzso Strong evidence indicates that this zzso modification can be linked to zzso disc zzso following zzso cell zzso We have investigated the fate of zzso zzso which disappear before adulthood, and found that two mechanisms of cell elimination can account for zzso cell zzso an early zzso and a mechanism of zzso which excludes all zzso clones from all zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso is likely to be involved, in addition to its repression role on zzso and zzso in some other essential cellular zzso as in the absence of zzso cell affinities are dramatically modified regardless of the zzso zzso and of the type of zzso zzso
