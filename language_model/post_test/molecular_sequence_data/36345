Previous studies have shown that zzso B cells predominate during development of the immune system and frequently zzso zzso zzso some of which appear to influence the development of the adult B cell zzso In addition, we now show that a high frequency of zzso derived zzso react with zzso zzso derived from zzso liver and zzso B cells and from zzso of adult zzso and zzso mice were screened by zzso on zzso zzso zzso all of the zzso zzso were detected at a high frequency from zzso zzso but none were obtained from adult zzso These zzso zzso were zzso because they stained different zzso of peripheral T and B zzso Although the zzso recognized by these zzso were zzso with respect to their sensitivity to a variety of zzso 13 of the 19 zzso recognized zzso which were modulated by zzso C zzso zzso experiments suggested that six of these 13 zzso shared the same molecular zzso and that they recognized the same T cell subset zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, three of these zzso zzso the same 100 zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso in reducing zzso The related molecular specificity of some zzso zzso was also reflected by their restricted V gene zzso Three of the five zzso specific for the 100 zzso protein used very similar or identical zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to using the same zzso D and zzso zzso they also exhibited identical zzso zzso despite originating from distinct zzso Analysis of light chains also showed some restriction by preferential use of zzso V zzso 4 and J zzso 5 zzso Together, these results suggest that the restricted zzso repertoire characteristic of mouse fetal and zzso B cells is also reflected in the production of zzso zzso These B cells appear consistently in early development, use zzso V zzso and express a characteristic zzso zzso
