We examined zzso of the zzso zzso protein of human zzso type 16, using zzso zzso protein expressed from various zzso zzso viruses in zzso and zzso zzso A minority of zzso protein was zzso and all four potential zzso sites appeared to be zzso zzso was of the zzso type, as shown by zzso with zzso zzso A and by zzso zzso A series of zzso zzso proteins were used to establish that an zzso zzso zzso common to all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was a major zzso of the proportion of zzso protein zzso whereas zzso nuclear zzso signal sequences were zzso zzso zzso studies showed that whereas the majority of zzso protein was found in the cell nucleus, zzso zzso was retained in the zzso zzso and was neither exported from the cell nor zzso to the cell membrane or the cell zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is unlikely to be an important component of the zzso zzso a finding of importance for the design of zzso zzso
