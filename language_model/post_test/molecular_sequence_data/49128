zzso zzso class switching occurs in activated B cells and results in production of zzso zzso zzso or zzso It involves a DNA zzso event and is partly regulated by zzso zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso is an abundant nuclear protein expressed in zzso zzso Many different functions have been ascribed to zzso such as zzso zzso or repression, cell cycle control and tumor zzso A typical feature of zzso is its expression in large clusters in the nucleus of activated zzso We give evidence that zzso can bind to several sites in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso heavy chain zzso in a cooperative zzso Using a promoter reporter zzso we found evidence that zzso can suppress zzso zzso and zzso promoter activity in a B cell zzso When a zzso zzso form of zzso was introduced into primary activated B cells by zzso zzso the zzso zzso clusters were zzso In spite of this, there was no effect on zzso or zzso class zzso The data are discussed in relation to the different hypotheses for the function of zzso
