The zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso which involves zzso zzso is crucial for the zzso zzso zzso were designed based on the zzso zzso zzso resource, and these facilitated the cloning of a gene coding for zzso from a local clinical zzso The DNA sequence of the cloned gene revealed an zzso frame that encodes a protein of 313 zzso zzso After induction in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso of the expressed zzso zzso by affinity zzso exhibited significant zzso activity of about 50 zzso where one unit zzso of zzso activity is defined as the amount of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso Based on its zzso status amongst zzso and zzso zzso zzso the cloned gene was clearly defined as belonging to the zzso zzso zzso It is noteworthy that zzso zzso unique structural characteristics potentially useful for screening drugs specific for disabling zzso zzso
