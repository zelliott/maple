zzso zzso of zzso zzso are exceptionally resistant to stress and an important part of this tolerance involves zzso a small heat shock protein which functions as a molecular zzso Cloning and sequencing of randomly selected zzso zzso produced by zzso with zzso zzso from zzso zzso as template yielded 10 clones zzso identical zzso The zzso zzso sequences extending from the termination zzso to the zzso tail of each clone were also zzso These data indicated a single zzso gene is expressed during zzso zzso However, two-dimensional gel zzso showed that zzso zzso consisted of four zzso providing evidence for zzso modification of the zzso a possibility supported by mass zzso and zzso of Western zzso The major zzso observed in two-dimensional gels, termed zzso is the primary gene product, whereas zzso c is zzso at zzso 50, a zzso located in a protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso b and d were generated zzso but by unknown zzso The results represent the first description of zzso modified small heat shock proteins in crustaceans and they expand the zzso range of organisms that possess zzso zzso of these zzso At least two small heat shock proteins from other organisms contain zzso zzso equivalent in position to zzso 50 of zzso but neither is zzso
