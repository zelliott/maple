zzso zzso of zzso III zzso has been proposed as a significant contributor to the increased zzso of zzso events in zzso zzso isolated from normal human plasma by means of zzso affinity and zzso zzso was incubated with zzso M zzso in neutral zzso buffer at 37 degrees zzso The extent of zzso zzso could be monitored by zzso of zzso as well as by binding to a zzso affinity zzso which effectively zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso bound zzso nearly as efficiently as zzso zzso The two zzso preparations were equally active in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Following incubation with zzso structural analyses of zzso peptides of zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso were distributed over many sites on the zzso This lack of specificity contrasts with the restricted sites of modification on zzso zzso and zzso A, and explains why zzso zzso of zzso has little if any effect on its zzso
