zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso proteins undergo zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso a zzso factor for acute phase response zzso was found to act as an adapter zzso in signal zzso from the type I zzso zzso zzso bound to a zzso sequence in the zzso tail of the zzso chain of the zzso and underwent zzso zzso zzso The zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso which activates a series of zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso and subsequently underwent zzso zzso Thus, zzso acts as an adapter to couple another signaling zzso to the zzso zzso
