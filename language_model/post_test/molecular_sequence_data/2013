To identify an zzso promoter zzso zzso protection studies with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso The zzso binds specifically both at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso component zzso and zzso zzso The binding region of the zzso zzso extends from 30 base pairs zzso upstream zzso to 20 zzso downstream zzso from the in zzso zzso start zzso This finding indicates that the zzso zzso recognizes promoters without zzso zzso zzso The DNA segment protected from zzso zzso by bound zzso zzso contains an zzso sequence centered at zzso which is zzso between the zzso and the stable zzso zzso According to the specific binding of the zzso to only zzso zzso this zzso we propose the sequence zzso as the major recognition signal of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this motif with published zzso DNA sequences revealed the presence of zzso sequences at the same location upstream of 36 zzso We therefore consider the overall consensus zzso as a general element of promoters in zzso In spite of the specific binding of the zzso most preparations of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are unable to initiate zzso at the correct sites in zzso Here we present first evidence for the possible existence of a zzso factor zzso the ability to the zzso to initiate and terminate zzso specifically in zzso
