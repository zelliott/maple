zzso of elastic fibers in zzso can result in the development of disorders that include zzso zzso and loss of skin zzso zzso is the precursor of the zzso zzso and its expression is triggered by zzso factors as a response to zzso zzso like zzso radiation not only increase the expression of zzso but also potent zzso such as zzso zzso zzso The development of zzso diseases, moreover, is a chronic process during which zzso and zzso are repeatedly exposed to attacks by zzso zzso in this work we report the in zzso zzso of zzso and the potential of zzso to generate zzso This work provides evidence that zzso is substantially and rapidly zzso by zzso even at very dilute zzso zzso zzso zzso at least 86 sites in zzso Analysis of the generated peptides revealed that some small peptides contained the motif zzso that may enable them to bind with the zzso binding protein zzso Furthermore, using zzso peptides it was confirmed that several sites in the sequence zzso by zzso 24 which contains repetitive units of biologically active zzso zzso are susceptible to attack by zzso provided that the active zzso in zzso zzso to zzso are zzso Such zzso events have lead to the generation of zzso that may bind to zzso
