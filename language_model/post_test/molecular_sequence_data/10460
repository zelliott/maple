zzso of zzso coli by the zzso zzso zzso is initiated by binding of the zzso to the tip of the F zzso zzso via the gene III zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA requires the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso after the zzso presumably has zzso bringing the zzso to the bacterial zzso Of these three zzso zzso is proposed to span the zzso since it contains a long zzso domain zzso zzso which connects a zzso membrane anchor domain zzso I) to the zzso domain zzso zzso By using a zzso zzso the requirement for zzso in an zzso strain was found to be zzso The role of zzso zzso II and III in the zzso process was examined by analyzing the ability of various deletion zzso of zzso to facilitate zzso The zzso domain III was shown to be essential, whereas the zzso region separating zzso I and II could be deleted with no zzso zzso of zzso domain II reduced the efficiency of infection, which could be restored to normal by retaining the zzso half of domain zzso zzso domain III, expressed in the zzso but not in the zzso or in the zzso zzso with infection of a zzso zzso The essential interaction of zzso domain III with zzso via gene III protein appears to require interaction with a third zzso either the zzso tip or a zzso zzso
