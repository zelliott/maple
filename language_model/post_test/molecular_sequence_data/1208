zzso zzso is the most common form of zzso zzso We previously reported a novel form of zzso with zzso zzso deposits following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated the role of zzso zzso related zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso by producing several zzso zzso against zzso zzso surface zzso and determining the zzso of deposited zzso in patients with zzso zzso 

Cell membrane proteins were isolated from cultured zzso zzso Mouse zzso zzso against these proteins were generated, and their target zzso were determined by zzso affinity zzso and zzso acid sequence analysis, and by zzso zzso screening of zzso coli clones zzso with plasmids from the Lambda zzso zzso zzso zzso Renal biopsy specimens from 116 patients with zzso zzso and 122 patients with other forms of zzso disease were examined for zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso The major zzso recognized by zzso zzso against zzso zzso cell membrane was identified as the zzso zzso cell envelope zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso biopsy specimens from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso cell envelope zzso was localized in the zzso and the data confirmed that zzso zzso cell envelope zzso was zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso No deposition of this zzso was detected in the zzso of patients with zzso complex deposit forms of zzso 

zzso zzso cell envelope zzso is a new candidate for the induction of zzso zzso
