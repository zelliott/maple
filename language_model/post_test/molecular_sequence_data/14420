The global emergence of zzso tuberculosis has highlighted the need for the development of rapid tests to identify resistance to zzso zzso zzso Resistance to zzso and zzso develops through zzso single zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso genes and the zzso zzso zzso Using DNA sequencing as the gold standard for the detection of zzso zzso resistance, in conjunction with zzso we demonstrated zzso in zzso and zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso resistant to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of follow-up zzso from the same patients showed that the population structure of clones may change during treatment, suggesting different zzso in the emergence of zzso The presence of underlying zzso clones was identified in zzso which failed to show a correlation between zzso resistance and zzso in the zzso or zzso zzso These clones zzso previously described zzso in either the zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that rare zzso zzso resistance to zzso or zzso may not be as important as was previously zzso We concluded that the absence of a correlation between zzso and zzso resistance implies an early phase in the emergence of resistance within the zzso Thus, the diagnostic utility of zzso drug zzso tests will depend on the proportion of patients whose zzso are in the process of acquiring resistance in the study zzso These data have implications for the interpretation of molecular and zzso diagnostic tests for patients with zzso and drug-resistant tuberculosis who fail to respond to treatment and for those with zzso zzso
