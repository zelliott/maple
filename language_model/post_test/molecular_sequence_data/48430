The act gene of zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso zzso an intermediate during zzso zzso zzso In a previous study, zzso of zzso was observed in a zzso zzso defective in growth on zzso In contrast to the wild type and all other obtained zzso this zzso showed no growth when zzso was applied as the sole source of carbon and zzso The zzso zzso was inserted in a gene showing high zzso to class III zzso In the present study, analyses of the translation product clearly allocated zzso to this protein zzso The predicted secondary structure indicates the lack of a zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso and was then zzso by zzso acid zzso affinity zzso zzso size exclusion zzso revealed a zzso structure with a molecular mass of 96 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso identified zzso zzso and zzso as potential zzso donors and unequivocally verified the conversion of zzso to zzso zzso studies revealed an apparent zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso which zzso to a turnover number of zzso zzso per zzso of zzso For zzso the apparent zzso was determined as zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso to a turnover number of zzso zzso per zzso of zzso The apparent zzso values were zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso Nonetheless, the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not reproduce the zzso of the zzso zzso This defined deletion zzso was able to zzso zzso or zzso as the sole carbon source, like the wild zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso partially restored growth on zzso which indicated a polar effect of the zzso zzso on zzso located downstream of zzso
