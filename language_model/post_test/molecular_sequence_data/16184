Six zzso zzso zzso genes have been isolated and zzso They contained zzso of different sequences and two size zzso 20 or 21 base pairs zzso (five zzso and 113 zzso (one zzso However, the sequences coding for the mature zzso were identical in all six zzso The zzso zzso gene was a zzso zzso zzso its primary transcript could be traced by zzso zzso The gene was turned on during zzso and continually expressed to various degrees during the following zzso zzso Thus, zzso mapping is a feasible method to follow the zzso activity of individual genes with identical mature products, provided that their primary transcripts are zzso The six genes were organized in two clusters of three and two zzso respectively (each containing a zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that four of the six zzso genes characterized were localized in putative zzso control regions of zzso controlled genes transcribed by zzso zzso
