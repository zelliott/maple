In an attempt to identify zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso and central nervous tissue of zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso by lentil zzso affinity zzso and gel zzso to yield small abundant zzso zzso with zzso similarities to zzso was found and shown to consist of two zzso that were ultimately zzso using zzso zzso affinity zzso Both zzso were zzso to yield sequences of 84 zzso for zzso and 92 zzso for zzso The sequences were analyzed for similarities to zzso and other zzso zzso and zzso showed some similarities that were greater than 3 standard zzso units away from mean random scores when tested with the zzso zzso However, the sequence patterns were not typical of zzso zzso and the relationship of zzso to the zzso zzso remains zzso zzso showed no relationship to the zzso zzso but similarities to zzso zzso sequences were noted that are in zzso with an evolutionary zzso The similarities included ten zzso zzso in each sequence of which eight were matched in the best alignment given by the zzso zzso Chemical evidence was obtained for zzso tails at the zzso of zzso and zzso as is the case for zzso and zzso zzso
