We have determined the zzso sequence for the DNA zzso the zzso zzso and downstream internal transcribed zzso zzso regions for zzso zzso and the zzso related species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of all known zzso zzso zzso sequences revealed a close relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso within the zzso zzso This group can itself be delineated from predominantly zzso zzso The more zzso relationships between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso support previous findings based on small zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis, suggesting a greater degree of evolutionary divergence of these species from the zzso zzso zzso Among strains of zzso zzso we observed conservation of the zzso region at the zzso zzso Conservation was also observed for a more limited number of zzso zzso zzso Although the 3' region of the ITS zzso was species specific, sequence zzso was observed in the zzso end within the zzso zzso Our findings suggest a rapid approach to species identification through the use of zzso regions flanked by highly zzso functional zzso
