We zzso three peptides zzso from the small zzso of mice, established their primary zzso acid sequences and examined their zzso zzso Their primary sequences revealed approximately 50% identity to a group of zzso zzso that we had previously isolated from the zzso of rat zzso In addition to their ability to kill zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacteria zzso coli and zzso zzso in zzso the peptides were much more active against an zzso zzso zzso zzso strain than against its zzso zzso zzso Overall, these data suggest that zzso zzso peptides produced by zzso cells may protect small zzso zzso which are critical sites of zzso cell renewal, from invasion by zzso zzso or by zzso acquired potential zzso such as zzso and zzso
