Using zzso zzso mice lacking zzso D1 were generated by replacing most of the first zzso of the zzso gene with sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were viable and fertile but consistently smaller than their zzso or zzso zzso The zzso animals also showed two distinctive zzso a severe zzso caused by impaired development of all layers of the zzso and, in the zzso zzso during pregnancy, a marked reduction in zzso development accompanied by a failure to zzso zzso 50% of animals also had a zzso of the jaw that zzso itself as a zzso of the zzso zzso Mouse zzso zzso isolated from 14 day zzso zzso or zzso zzso and grown under standard conditions showed similar zzso and growth zzso Thus although zzso D1 zzso activity may facilitate zzso zzso it is not essential for the development of most zzso and zzso and only a few specialized cell lineages are demonstrably sensitive to its zzso
