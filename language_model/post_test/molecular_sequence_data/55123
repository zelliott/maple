Under dark zzso the zzso green algae zzso zzso may produce hydrogen by means of its zzso zzso in particular zzso using zzso derived from the degradation of zzso carbon zzso Other zzso belonging to the zzso pathways compete for the same zzso A complete understanding of the mechanisms determining the zzso of one zzso rather than another will help us engineer zzso for zzso zzso production, including zzso We examined the expression pattern of the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso cycles, continuous light, continuous darkness, and low or high oxygen zzso which are all conditions that vary on a regular basis in zzso natural zzso We found that all genes except zzso show daily fluctuations in zzso and that zzso differentiated itself from the others in that it is clearly responsive to low zzso where as zzso zzso and zzso are primarily under zzso zzso Our results provide evidence that there exist at least three different regulatory mechanisms within the zzso pathways and suggest that the zzso pathways are not redundant but rather that availability of a variety of pathways allows for a differential zzso response to different environmental zzso
