zzso zzso zzso does not only recognize zzso II zzso zzso but has also the capacity to label a zzso zzso II binding site, selectively associated with zzso and activated zzso We have searched for the structural requirements of the novel zzso binding site, and compared these with the requirements for binding to the zzso II zzso zzso We designed a series of zzso zzso and evaluated the new compounds by using binding zzso on rat zzso zzso zzso and rat fetal zzso II zzso zzso zzso The zzso analog zzso (N alpha zzso the side chain of zzso zzso on the zzso group, was selective in recognizing the zzso site, and did not zzso binding from the zzso II zzso zzso This is a potential lead compound for development of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso analog lacking the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were selective for the zzso II zzso site, and recognized the zzso site zzso Our results demonstrate that the structural requirements for the zzso II zzso and the zzso II zzso binding sites are zzso We propose that the zzso group and the free zzso terminal group, together with their spatial orientation, are key components of the zzso for the interaction in the zzso zzso binding zzso
