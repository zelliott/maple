zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alias the crab-eating monkeys or zzso zzso live across a vast range of zzso zzso These zzso primates have emerged as important animal models in infectious and chronic diseases and transplantation studies, zzso a more extensive characterization of their major zzso complex zzso zzso The current information on the zzso variation or diversity of the zzso locus is largely limited in comparison with the more commonly studied zzso zzso zzso zzso In this article, to better zzso the degree and types of zzso and genetic differences of zzso locus among three zzso Asian populations and to investigate how the zzso differences between zzso and humans might affect their respective immune responses, we identified 40 zzso within zzso 2 of the zzso locus by DNA sequencing using 217 zzso We also performed evolutionary and population analyses using these sequences to reveal some zzso zzso and zzso zzso conservation between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Of the 40 new zzso eight belong to a newly identified lineage group not previously found in the zzso zzso zzso This zzso information will be useful for medical researchers using the zzso zzso in disease and zzso zzso
