Evolution often results in zzso similar solutions in different organisms, a phenomenon known as zzso However, there is little knowledge of the processes that lead to convergence at the genetic zzso The genes of the zzso cluster control zzso in zzso They may also be central to the convergence of zzso traits, but whether zzso similarities also require similar changes in zzso gene function is zzso In zzso body subdivision into a region with zzso zzso zzso and a region with reduced zzso zzso has evolved zzso in several groups, zzso zzso and zzso In insects, legs develop in the expression domain of the zzso gene zzso zzso whereas the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso mediate leg repression in the zzso Here, we show that, unlike zzso in insects, the zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso legs in the first segment of the abdomen zzso and that zzso and zzso are redundant in the following zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso zzso leads to a striking zzso zzso We present evidence from zzso expression of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso and zzso tissue that this unique function of zzso is not due to changes in the zzso zzso but likely due to divergent evolution of zzso zzso collaborators or target genes in zzso and zzso Our results illustrate an interesting example of zzso evolution of abdominal leg repression in zzso by altering the role of distinct zzso genes at different levels of their zzso
