Human zzso zzso is a common zzso zzso inflammatory disease and has been studied extensively using a zzso model of experimental zzso zzso zzso It is possibly zzso by zzso immune zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso zzso a protein with zzso functions that contributes to the development of zzso zzso zzso Accompanying zzso zzso zzso was elevated in zzso zzso mice that had been zzso with human zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice showed milder zzso progression in clinical and zzso scores compared with those of zzso zzso The T cells from zzso zzso mice exhibited reduced zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso and zzso production compared with those of zzso T zzso When zzso zzso mice were administered zzso zzso reacting to zzso zzso a cryptic binding site to zzso within zzso zzso development was significantly zzso T cells from zzso zzso mice showed significantly reduced zzso responses and zzso zzso production upon stimulation with zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso Our present results demonstrate that zzso may represent a novel therapeutic target to control zzso
