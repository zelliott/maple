Members of the zzso zzso are among the most abundant microbes in coastal marine waters, but it is unclear to which extent the diversity within this zzso is covered by currently available zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso thus, obtained a comprehensive collection of sequence types affiliated with zzso in coastal North Sea surface waters and we compared this local diversity with the available sequences of marine zzso and other aquatic zzso zzso zzso of zzso 600 clones from two libraries zzso 2000, June 2001) were related to zzso specifically to the zzso Local diversity appeared to be almost zzso zzso However, the diversity of the two libraries virtually did not zzso indicating a pronounced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The majority of sequence types represented novel zzso zzso adding zzso to the currently known zzso and species of zzso in marine zzso Different diversity zzso suggested that so far only approximately half of the global diversity of zzso marine zzso has been zzso The data set zzso indicated that zzso techniques and isolation approaches have recovered almost equally sized and virtually zzso zzso of the currently known diversity within this zzso Interestingly, only zzso of zzso of zzso from various aquatic environments appear to occur in more than one habitat zzso
