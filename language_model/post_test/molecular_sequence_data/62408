zzso tags enable the facile zzso of proteins by immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso Both the type and position of zzso tags can affect significantly properties of a protein such as its expression level, behavior in solution, and its ability to form suitable samples zzso suitable zzso for X-ray zzso We investigated systematically the effects of zzso tag length and position on many properties related to expression and zzso of zzso integral membrane zzso Specifically, modified zzso coli zzso expression zzso were built that placed 6- or zzso tags at the zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso coli water channel zzso was zzso into this suite of zzso and its zzso zzso solution properties, and yield were zzso These studies show that: zzso all zzso yield similar expression levels, zzso tag length has a greater effect than tag position upon yield, zzso neither tag length nor position affects significantly zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the length of the tag affects the zzso state of the zzso zzso and zzso the tag length and position change zzso behavior of the zzso zzso In addition, substitution of the zzso zzso AAA at the second position, previously shown to have some effect upon soluble protein expression levels, did not have a large effect on zzso zzso We are currently producing approximately 12 zzso of zzso zzso per liter of zzso culture, and preliminary zzso that zzso to approximately zzso resolution have been zzso
