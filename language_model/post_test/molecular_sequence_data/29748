Human aurora A is a zzso zzso that controls various zzso zzso The zzso of aurora A zzso varies throughout the cell cycle and zzso during zzso To clarify the zzso zzso we first cloned the zzso zzso region of aurora A including the first zzso zzso expression of aurora A zzso zzso containing a series of zzso sequences or zzso zzso identified a zzso sequence zzso from zzso to zzso as a positive regulatory zzso zzso shift zzso identified the binding of positive regulatory proteins to the zzso zzso zzso zzso generated a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso markedly increased aurora A promoter zzso zzso cells zzso with the aurora A zzso zzso revealed that the promoter activity of aurora A increased in the S phase and peaked at zzso In addition, we identified a tandem zzso element, zzso just downstream of the zzso element, and zzso within this element led to a loss of cell cycle zzso We conclude that the zzso of aurora A is positively regulated by zzso a zzso expressed zzso family zzso and that the zzso element was essential for the zzso zzso of aurora zzso
