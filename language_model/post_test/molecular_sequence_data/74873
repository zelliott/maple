The size and shape of the plant leaf is an important zzso zzso To understand the molecular mechanism governing plant leaf shape, we characterized a classic rice zzso zzso dwarf zzso named narrow zzso zzso which exhibits a characteristic zzso of narrow zzso In accordance with reduced leaf blade zzso leaves of zzso contain a decreased number of zzso zzso zzso investigations revealed that the zzso of zzso also show a defective vascular system, in which the number and distribution pattern of vascular zzso are zzso zzso cloning and genetic zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso encodes a zzso protein with unknown zzso zzso We provide evidence showing that zzso is richly expressed in vascular zzso and that zzso of this gene leads to significantly reduced polar zzso transport zzso These results indicate that zzso affects polar zzso transport as well as the vascular patterns of rice plants and plays an important role in the control of lateral leaf zzso
