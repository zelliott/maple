The zzso zzso zzso zzso channels displaying four zzso zzso and two pore regions share structural zzso with their animal counterparts of the zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso channels (six zzso zzso pore zzso the functional properties and the biological role of plant zzso channels have not been zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso to the plasma membrane and is predominantly expressed in zzso zzso zzso resembles the electrical properties of a zzso zzso channel after expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso membrane zzso zzso instantaneous zzso zzso which were blocked by zzso calcium and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso and pharmacological properties of the zzso zzso The features of zzso point toward a role in zzso zzso and membrane zzso control of the growing zzso zzso Thus, zzso represents a member of plant zzso channels, resembling the characteristics of its animal counterparts as well as zzso features with respect to zzso of channel activity by zzso and zzso
