zzso light chain zzso contains a regulatory segment consisting of an zzso region and a zzso sequence that folds back on its zzso core to inhibit zzso zzso It has been proposed that zzso formation may be involved in displacement of the regulatory segment and zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso were introduced at putative zzso zzso in the regulatory segment to disrupt zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso immediately zzso of the zzso in the zzso sequence had most significant effects on zzso binding and zzso zzso of an zzso in this region upon zzso binding may be necessary for displacement of the regulatory segment allowing zzso of zzso regulatory light zzso
