We present the cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso of the zzso zzso sugar zzso zzso transport system from zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso to an open reading frame of zzso zzso which translates into a putative zzso acid zzso protein with a zzso of zzso and a zzso of zzso The zzso was produced in zzso coli under the control of its own promoter located immediately upstream of zzso a situation never previously reported for any other gene coding for an zzso The deduced zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso shows a high degree of similarity with the zzso coli zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso transfer protein from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso also shares a highly zzso zzso cluster with a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso The zzso cluster is located in a domain which is hypothesized to be the zzso zzso
