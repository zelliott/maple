zzso protein zzso zzso zzso play an important role in zzso stress responses in zzso zzso However, little is known about the role of zzso in modulating the interaction of defense pathways activated by zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we have isolated and functionally characterized a zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso is a zzso gene but can generate at least two zzso spliced zzso The zzso zzso its zzso and zzso activity were zzso by zzso acid as well as various zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso drought, salt, and zzso zzso To determine its biological function, we generated and analyzed transgenic rice plants with zzso zzso the zzso promoter of zzso mosaic zzso or suppression zzso zzso zzso interference zzso of zzso Interestingly, suppression of zzso expression and its zzso activity resulted in the zzso expression of zzso zzso genes such as zzso and zzso in the zzso transgenic plants and significantly enhanced resistance to zzso zzso zzso and bacterial zzso zzso zzso However, these same zzso lines had significant reductions in drought, salt, and cold zzso By contrast, zzso lines exhibited increased zzso zzso activity and increased tolerance to drought, salt, and cold zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso can positively regulate drought, salt, and cold tolerance and zzso zzso zzso gene expression and zzso disease zzso
