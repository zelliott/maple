Five zzso beta zzso have been isolated to date, and a comparative analysis of zzso acid identity has suggested that the zzso beta C, beta D and beta E zzso represent a distinct zzso Based on zzso cloning studies, we now report that the mouse zzso beta C and beta E genetic zzso are closely zzso the coding sequences are separated by zzso These genes also show similarities in structural organization as well as a unique zzso pattern of expression in adult zzso Our results suggest that tandem zzso of an ancestral gene generated the mouse zzso beta C and beta E genetic zzso and they provide further evidence for the zzso that the beta zzso E zzso form a distinct subset of related zzso To our knowledge, this report is the first to demonstrate close zzso linkage between members of the zzso zzso as well as a zzso expression pattern for a zzso zzso
