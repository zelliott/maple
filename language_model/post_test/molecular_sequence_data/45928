The design of zzso and zzso zzso for studying large zzso is complicated by the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso are particularly difficult to study due to abundant zzso The speed of most existing primer evaluation programs is not sufficient for large-scale zzso 

In order to improve the efficiency and success rate of automatic zzso design, we created a novel method which allows rapid masking of repeats in large sequence files, for example in zzso zzso It also allows the detection of all alternative binding sites of zzso zzso and the prediction of zzso zzso The new method was implemented in a collection of efficient programs, the zzso zzso The performance of the programs was compared to other similar zzso We also modified the zzso program, to be able to design zzso from zzso zzso 

The zzso package is able to mask the entire human zzso for zzso zzso within 6 hours and find locations of all binding sites for 10,000 designed primer pairs within 10 zzso Additionally, it predicts all alternative zzso products from large zzso for given primer zzso
