zzso direct zzso recruitment into sites of tissue inflammation and may facilitate recruitment of zzso into zzso following zzso Although the expression of zzso during rejection of zzso zzso has been zzso zzso expression in zzso minor zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso The zzso zzso expression of several zzso and zzso zzso was tested during rejection of full thickness skin zzso from zzso zzso donors on control zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In all recipients, two patterns of zzso zzso expression were observed during rejection of these zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso were expressed at equivalent levels in zzso and zzso for 2-4 days zzso and then returned to low or zzso zzso and 2) zzso and zzso induced by zzso zzso were expressed in the zzso 3 days before rejection was completed, suggesting a possible role in recruiting primed T cells into the zzso Three days before completion of zzso zzso zzso protein was restricted to the zzso whereas zzso was located in the lower zzso and associated with the intense zzso of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso recipients with rabbit zzso to zzso but not to zzso delayed rejection of the zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso mediates optimal recruitment of T cells into zzso minor zzso zzso zzso during zzso
