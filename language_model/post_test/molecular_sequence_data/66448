zzso zzso analyses have recently shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is unlikely to be a zzso or an zzso as previously zzso but is more closely related to zzso zzso and zzso However, the specific zzso relationship of zzso to other zzso zzso lineages was poorly zzso To test these earlier results we have expanded both the zzso sampling and the number of genes from zzso zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso genes zzso factor zzso zzso and heat shock protein 70 zzso from zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Our maximum likelihood zzso and zzso analyses of a zzso alignment of zzso zzso and zzso protein sequences with a better sampling of zzso zzso lineages indicate that zzso zzso is not clearly allied with any of the zzso zzso but represents an independent zzso lineage closely related to animals and zzso Moreover, we have found that the zzso zzso zzso possesses an zzso zzso gene copy instead of the zzso zzso the first so far described in an zzso A maximum likelihood zzso analysis shows that the zzso gene of zzso zzso strongly groups with the zzso genes from zzso Finally, to begin characterizing the zzso zzso we have performed zzso gel zzso zzso zzso which indicate that its zzso has at least 12 zzso with a total zzso size in the range of 22-25 zzso
