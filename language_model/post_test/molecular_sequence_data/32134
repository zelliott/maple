In the attempt to explore complex bacterial communities of environmental samples, zzso zzso to zzso highly zzso regions of zzso zzso genes are widely used, but differential amplification is a recognized zzso The biases associated with preferential amplification of zzso zzso were investigated using zzso zzso zzso focusing on the effect of primer zzso zzso temperature and zzso cycle zzso The distortion of the zzso ratio was measured using zzso template zzso and environmental samples by terminal restriction zzso length zzso zzso When a 1 : 1 zzso DNA template mixture of two strains was used, primer zzso inherent in the zzso primer presented a serious bias, showing preferential amplification of the template containing the perfectly matching zzso The extent of the preferential amplification showed an almost exponential relation with increasing zzso temperature from 47 to 61 degrees zzso No negative effect of the various zzso temperatures was observed with the zzso zzso with no zzso with the target zzso The number of zzso cycles had little influence on the zzso zzso As a result of additional tests on environmental samples, the use of a low zzso temperature is recommended in order to significantly reduce preferential amplification while maintaining the specificity of zzso
