A zzso clone for a zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso which is most strongly expressed in the various sink zzso of mature tobacco zzso roots, flowers, and young zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso codes for a protein with 523 zzso acids and a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso The protein is zzso to a group of other plant zzso transport proteins from zzso zzso and Chlorella zzso to human zzso zzso and to zzso zzso and several bacterial sugar transport zzso As with these other zzso the zzso protein is extremely zzso and has zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso clone in zzso zzso allowed its characterization as a putative zzso zzso catalyzing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso and the energy dependent and zzso sensitive zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were raised against a fusion protein of zzso and the last 27 zzso acids of the zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso extracts of transformed zzso cells these zzso recognize a zzso with an apparent molecular weight of 42 zzso which is absent in extracts from zzso control zzso
