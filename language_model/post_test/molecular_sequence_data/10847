The zzso factor zzso and its regulation by zzso and related pocket proteins are central to cell cycle control in higher zzso Much of our knowledge of this regulation has come from studies using zzso proteins of DNA tumor zzso Previously, we reported that the zzso zzso region 1 gene product of the human zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoter through the zzso site and that it physically interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wade, zzso zzso zzso zzso Nelson, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we further characterized the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso reactions using zzso zzso expressed proteins revealed that zzso is a zzso that zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso (but not zzso or zzso and the zzso pocket proteins zzso and zzso (but not zzso The region of zzso spanning zzso acids 173 to 197 shows a high level of zzso to the zzso binding sites in over 500 zzso The zzso protein zzso from which this region has been deleted, cannot activate zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso is also required for its ability to reduce the association of zzso with zzso and zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the zzso activity of zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso and that this is likely to result from zzso of specific members of the zzso and pocket protein families by zzso
