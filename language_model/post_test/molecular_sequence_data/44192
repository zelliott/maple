zzso anemia zzso is a genetically zzso disease involving at least five genes on the basis of zzso analysis zzso to zzso The zzso gene has been recently isolated by two independent approaches, zzso and functional zzso In the present study we describe the zzso structure of the zzso zzso The gene contains 43 zzso spanning approximately 80 zzso as determined by the alignment of four zzso and the fine zzso of the first and the last zzso in restriction fragments of these zzso zzso range from 34 to 188 zzso All but three of the zzso sites were consistent with the zzso zzso We also describe three alternative zzso events in zzso clones that result in the loss of zzso 37, a zzso deletion at the zzso end of zzso 41, and a zzso zzso at the 3' portion also in zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region upstream of the putative zzso start site showed no obvious zzso and zzso boxes, but did show a zzso region, typical of zzso zzso zzso of the structure of the zzso gene will provide an invaluable resource for the discovery of zzso in the gene that accounts for about zzso of zzso zzso
