A family of proteins containing a zzso and zzso domain zzso has been identified zzso Here, we report the identification of a novel member of the zzso protein family from zzso This protein is designated zzso zzso The complementary DNA sequence of zzso 31 predicts a zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 31 was most abundant in zzso but was also detected in many other zzso More significantly, the zzso raised against zzso 31 reveal that the protein has a unique and restricted expression zzso zzso 31 is expressed in zzso cells of the zzso but unlike many other zzso it is not found on developing zzso Furthermore, zzso 31 is highly expressed on four types of specialized zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the convoluted zzso of the zzso and the zzso cells of the zzso
