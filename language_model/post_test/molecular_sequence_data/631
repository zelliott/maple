The zzso zzso within the family zzso comprises three closely related zzso namely goat zzso sheep pox and zzso skin disease zzso This nomenclature is based on the animal species from which the virus was first isolated, respectively, zzso sheep and zzso Since zzso are zzso zzso their specific identification relies exclusively on the use of molecular zzso We describe here the suitability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene for use in zzso grouping of zzso The analysis of 58 zzso showed three tight genetic clusters consisting of goat zzso sheep pox and zzso skin disease zzso However, a few discrepancies exist with the classical zzso origin zzso a virus isolated from sheep is grouped in the goat zzso zzso and vice zzso zzso diversity was further observed for the goat pox and zzso skin disease virus zzso Despite the presence of nine vaccine zzso no genetic zzso of zzso were identified on the zzso zzso For sheep zzso the addition or deletion of 21 zzso acids (7 zzso was consistently observed in the zzso terminal part of the zzso zzso signatures for each cluster were also zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and its comparison with other known zzso zzso and viral zzso revealed not only a classical zzso profile in the last three-quarters of the protein but also unique features such as a longer zzso end with a zzso zzso zzso and a shorter zzso zzso
