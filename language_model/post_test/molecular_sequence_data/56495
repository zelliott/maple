A zzso is a DNA sequence of 180 base pairs that encodes a zzso domain known as a zzso The zzso chain reaction zzso has been used to prepare zzso of zzso zzso We cloned and zzso the amplified products of zzso that was performed with human zzso DNA and two zzso that zzso to zzso regions in zzso Fifteen kinds of zzso gene were identified and 13 of them were assigned to zzso genes that have already been zzso Two others represented novel zzso genes and one of them, zzso was mapped to zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso Northern zzso of zzso for various kinds of zzso cell showed that the newly identified zzso gene is expressed in zzso cells and zzso zzso
