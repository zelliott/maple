We have constructed a zzso to assess the ability of zzso signal sequences to function in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso reporter contains the zzso gene from zzso coli from which the promoter and signal sequences have been zzso Signal sequences of zzso origin were cloned into the zzso and the level of zzso alkaline zzso determined zzso and by Western zzso We show that a number of the signal sequences of zzso origin function well in zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso corn plants with zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso fusion, we demonstrated alkaline zzso activity in zzso Our data show that zzso can be used to detect zzso bacteria in some locations in zzso and is therefore useful in the study of zzso zzso Furthermore, our data illustrate how zzso zzso can be useful as a reporter for protein zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso
