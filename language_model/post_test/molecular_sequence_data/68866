zzso in the zzso gene are associated with defects in protein zzso into the zzso zzso zzso as well as in nuclear protein zzso in zzso zzso To identify proteins that might interact and/or function with zzso we cloned a high copy zzso zzso of the zzso lethal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that encodes an integral zzso membrane zzso of 206 zzso acids with the zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso region in the zzso zzso strains disrupted for zzso are zzso for growth and accumulate precursor forms of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso lethal in combination with zzso affecting zzso zzso We propose that zzso is important for zzso zzso and interacts with previously identified components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is identical to zzso which encodes a zzso zzso with zzso and zzso
