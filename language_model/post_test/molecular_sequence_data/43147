An atomic model of the zzso zzso zzso fiber was zzso by combining the molecular coordinates of the fiber zzso from electron zzso with atomic coordinates of the zzso zzso double strand zzso from X-ray zzso The model is zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso zzso are located at fiber contact sites and the majority of the zzso that do not affect zzso are not located at contact zzso The zzso at zzso contacts in the fiber model are zzso We have searched the coordinate space in the vicinity of the zzso reconstructions to find models with alternative sets of coordinates that satisfy the zzso data, contain zzso contacts between double zzso and are zzso zzso This involved a systematic examination over 297 different zzso The alternative fiber models were generated with a range of fiber pitch, zzso positions, and zzso zzso Models which had unacceptably close contacts between zzso failed to satisfy the zzso data, or did not have zzso contacts between double strands were considered zzso None of the acceptable alternative fiber models improved the agreement between the zzso behavior of zzso zzso and their contact site zzso However, several models could account for the zzso data equally zzso zzso locations for zzso zzso zzso that could discriminate between alternative fiber models are zzso The twist of zzso fibers varies in an apparent random manner with an average rotation of zzso zzso zzso degrees per zzso and a maximum rotation of 16 degrees per zzso The number of zzso contacts as a function of fiber twist shows a broad maximum around 9 degrees and may account for the observed range of fiber zzso This study shows that the upper limit on the fiber twist could result from a loss of zzso contacts and repulsive van der zzso interactions between zzso involved in zzso zzso The loss of zzso contacts limits the zzso growth of the zzso In the appendix we analyze the methodology used by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to build a model of the zzso Our examination reveals shortcomings in the methodology of zzso and zzso One result of these shortcomings is that the model zzso by zzso and zzso is not zzso acceptable because it gives rise to a large number of excessively close (less than zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso of the molecular zzso
