zzso at the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso can fully restore viability and partially restore fertility in hybrid flies from crosses between zzso zzso and any of its three most closely related zzso Although more than one gene is expected to be involved in these barriers to zzso a single zzso protein was recently identified as zzso The zzso gene was shown to evolve unusually fast, a feature that supports its role in causing genetic zzso in a hybrid zzso The current treatment of hybrid zzso focuses not only on zzso but also on the zzso zzso which lies only zzso from zzso zzso is proposed also to influence hybrid zzso This gene has remained tightly linked to zzso for about 10 million years, but it has zzso even more than zzso with regard to zzso zzso and its most closely related zzso Furthermore, the zzso acid zzso protein contains four zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is shown to have evolved under very strong positive selection and to be the most recent member of a cluster of six zzso that zzso small zzso zzso Four of the six zzso are unique to zzso zzso in which they have zzso zzso their zzso proteins sharing less than 50% zzso acid identities with proteins from their zzso in the closest zzso Only two zzso zzso are present in these sibling species and none is present in the zzso of more zzso related zzso zzso zzso evolving zzso zzso near the zzso locus probably developed functional specialization of redundant proteins involved in trafficking zzso between zzso and zzso Positive selection acting on zzso of these zzso genes appears to participate in zzso zzso
