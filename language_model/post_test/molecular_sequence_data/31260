zzso clones for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells were isolated and zzso The fact that the cloned zzso fragments zzso a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso consisting of an zzso zzso signal zzso of 20 zzso zzso a large zzso zzso zzso zzso and a small zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that the two zzso are zzso as a precursor zzso The zzso acid sequence of mature zzso deduced from the zzso sequence showed zzso zzso with human CA zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and those forming a zzso network to zzso zzso molecules were highly zzso in the plant and animal zzso Three possible zzso zzso sites were found in the large zzso Northern zzso analysis was carried out using the zzso zzso as a zzso The level of zzso CA zzso increased within 1 zzso when CO2 concentration of the bubbling gas was changed from zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso On the other hand, CA zzso did not accumulate when CO2 concentration was lowered in the zzso zzso using zzso showed that photosynthesis is absolutely required for the zzso of CA zzso These results indicate that CA zzso is regulated by changes in environmental CO2 concentration as well as light at the level of zzso zzso
