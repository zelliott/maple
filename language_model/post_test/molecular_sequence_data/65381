zzso of zzso beta peptides zzso followed by their deposition in the brain as zzso zzso contributes to the hallmark pathology of zzso zzso The zzso responsible for production of zzso zzso and zzso are therapeutic targets for treatment of zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso and zzso comprise the zzso core of zzso In comparing zzso selectivity of several classes of zzso zzso we observed that zzso in general tend to be more selective for zzso of zzso zzso as exemplified by zzso and zzso We employed a combination of zzso zzso and point zzso to identify structural zzso for zzso zzso by zzso Our studies identified zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso as necessary for zzso zzso by zzso These zzso also contributed in part to the zzso zzso by zzso zzso scanning zzso of areas zzso zzso zzso and zzso identified additional zzso acids that affect inhibitor potency of not only these zzso but also zzso zzso without affecting zzso production and zzso zzso Interestingly, many of these same zzso have been identified previously to be important for zzso zzso These findings zzso zzso and a second region near the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso the activity of zzso zzso Our observations demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso are zzso and such zzso may allow differential zzso of zzso zzso production and zzso zzso
