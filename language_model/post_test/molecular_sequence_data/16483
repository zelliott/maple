The gene zzso which encodes a novel zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was cloned using zzso in conjunction with the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso The open reading frame consisted of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso including a zzso signal zzso The protein showed zzso sequence similarity to the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso but no significant similarity to zzso zzso or zzso from other zzso On 40 h incubation with a solo carbon source, northern analysis revealed that the gene was induced by zzso zzso from zzso zzso but was not by the same concentration of zzso The zzso zzso was functionally expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso with as high activity against zzso as native zzso Based on these data, the probable existence of zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso in some zzso zzso is zzso
