Using pooled zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso motif characteristic for known zzso a zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso product was zzso The zzso product was used to screen a zzso zzso zzso library, and a complete zzso zzso sequence from zzso was zzso Four clones with the identical sequence were zzso supporting the idea of a single zzso gene in zzso The sequence contains a zzso zzso untranslated region and a zzso 3' untranslated region with two zzso zzso The coding region spans 219 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows 21 zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso studies were performed with 50 zzso zzso for up to 16 zzso The exposed zzso show a zzso higher zzso zzso level compared with zzso control zzso
