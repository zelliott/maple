A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been associated with childhood absence zzso We evaluated the possibility that this zzso which is located adjacent to the most zzso of three zzso zzso zzso sites, might reduce zzso zzso by increasing zzso of zzso zzso The zzso had three major effects on zzso zzso First, zzso of zzso zzso with zzso or zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells reduced surface expression of zzso zzso and increased surface expression of zzso zzso suggesting a partial shift from zzso zzso receptors to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Second, zzso zzso were more likely than zzso zzso to be zzso at zzso but increases in zzso were not responsible for changes in zzso surface zzso Rather, both phenomena could be attributed to the presence of a basic zzso at position zzso Finally, zzso receptors had significantly reduced zzso current zzso This reduction could not be explained fully by changes in zzso expression levels (because zzso levels decreased only zzso or zzso (because reduction persisted in the absence of zzso at zzso Single channel recording revealed that zzso receptors had impaired gating with shorter mean open zzso zzso modeling indicated that the zzso altered salt bridges at zzso zzso including regions important for zzso zzso Our results suggest both a mechanism for zzso zzso and a novel role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso assembly and zzso
