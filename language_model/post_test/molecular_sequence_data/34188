zzso virus zzso is an zzso closely related to zzso virus, the zzso agent of zzso Human zzso infection results in a disease that is similar to zzso and can also be zzso Two zzso of zzso have been identified, with viruses of the central African zzso displaying more zzso properties than those within the west African zzso The zzso inhibitor of complement zzso zzso which is not expressed by viruses of the west African zzso has been hypothesized to be a main zzso factor responsible for increased zzso properties of central African strains of zzso To gain a better understanding of the role of zzso during zzso disease, we compared the host zzso immune response and disease severity following zzso infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) lacking expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Data presented here demonstrate that infection of zzso with zzso leads to significant viral replication in the peripheral blood and lungs and results in the induction of a robust and sustained zzso immune response against the zzso More importantly, we show that the loss of zzso expression results in enhanced viral replication in zzso as well as a dampened zzso immune response against zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso zzso the zzso immune response and that this protein is not the sole zzso factor of the central African zzso of zzso
