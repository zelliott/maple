zzso fetal kidney zzso was analyzed by zzso to identify protein zzso This screening demonstrated expression of a protein zzso consistent with zzso a group II zzso center zzso and zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso activity were increased in rat fetal kidney zzso zzso days zzso compared with adult zzso In adult zzso subjected to zzso of the zzso artery, followed by zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso activity were increased compared with zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso expression was evident mainly in the zzso of zzso zzso cells in fetal and adult zzso There was also some expression in developing and mature zzso but zzso of the zzso was zzso In cultured zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso activity was increased after incubation with serum, or after exposure to chemical zzso plus zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced cell proliferation and increased zzso and exacerbated zzso and necrosis after chemical zzso plus zzso to zzso Thus zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso whose expression and activity are increased during development and recovery from acute zzso failure, where zzso zzso zzso may zzso zzso zzso The actions of zzso appear to be zzso and may facilitate cell zzso
