zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene are found in a number of spontaneous canine zzso and may contribute to increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using reverse zzso and DNA amplification, we isolated zzso zzso from normal and zzso tissue of ten canine zzso cancer zzso DNA sequencing identified zzso zzso in three of the ten zzso These included zzso zzso gene zzso within zzso 2 and 5 and a germ line deletion of zzso 3 to zzso These results support a role for zzso zzso in canine zzso zzso formation and breed predisposition to zzso Such information could prove invaluable in the successful zzso of inherited predisposition to cancer in the zzso A putative zzso was also identified at zzso 69 in zzso 4 and we discuss the possibility that similar zzso may be associated with human breast zzso
