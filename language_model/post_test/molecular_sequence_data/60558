The gene zzso encodes one of four type zzso protein zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is not zzso however, zzso cells grow slowly in defined minimal medium and undergo premature growth arrest in response to nitrogen zzso Interestingly, zzso cells are unable to fuse zzso in response to zzso stress or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to induce zzso zzso These findings reveal a zzso zzso function of type zzso protein zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso which suggests that zzso regulates zzso fusion by zzso of one or more proteins in the zzso zzso zzso function is required for the process of zzso that is induced by zzso zzso thus, the zzso zzso of zzso cells might explain why these cells undergo premature growth arrest in response to nitrogen zzso
