We have studied the zzso of protein synthesis zzso factor zzso the effects of zzso on its activity and the zzso of zzso zzso by protein zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso generated from zzso zzso in zzso by subsequent zzso with zzso and zzso indicated that zzso and zzso are the only zzso significantly zzso consistent with our earlier zzso They are also the only two zzso to be significantly zzso in zzso zzso in this system zzso zzso corresponded only to zzso of zzso no factor zzso at only zzso being zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was found to be an ordered process, modification of zzso zzso and apparently being required for, zzso of zzso This presumably explains why the only species of zzso zzso detected are zzso at zzso The zzso zzso could zzso a synthetic zzso based on zzso zzso of zzso zzso albeit only at a very low rate, and with a very high zzso compared to zzso zzso The zzso zzso the zzso corresponding to zzso and zzso apparently in a random manner, but not zzso In the light of the existence of two zzso sites in zzso the relationship between zzso and activity was zzso zzso was measured in the zzso synthesis of zzso where both the zzso and zzso zzso at zzso forms of the factor were found to be completely zzso Indeed, the zzso species appeared to be able to impair the activity of zzso zzso in this zzso zzso using zzso zzso also indicated that both zzso forms of zzso were inactive in the translation of zzso templates, but no evidence for dominant zzso by these species was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso can each efficiently zzso zzso zzso While zzso zzso was a better zzso for zzso than zzso factor zzso at zzso the converse was true for zzso This seemed to be due, at least in part, to the zzso of zzso of zzso by zzso by the presence of zzso on zzso Nevertheless, zzso exhibited a preference for zzso of zzso in zzso zzso while zzso showed no such zzso These findings are discussed in terms of current knowledge of the specificity of these two protein zzso
