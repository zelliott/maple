zzso zzso and sequencing zzso that zzso a single pair of zzso zzso were used to characterize a zzso DNA zzso internal zzso to the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso in 40 zzso zzso zzso type zzso The zzso of the zzso tree obtained was in general agreement with that which was zzso from an analysis of their zzso zzso or zzso gene zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso genes exhibit a higher divergence than does the corresponding zzso zzso zzso These results confirm that the zzso gene constitutes a highly zzso target sequence for zzso closely related bacterial zzso Clinical zzso that could not be identified at the species level by zzso tests were identified by use of this zzso These results demonstrate the usefulness of this method for rapid and accurate species identification of zzso zzso although it does not allow discrimination of zzso The zzso sequence zzso observed with zzso species offer good opportunities for the development of zzso based on DNA chip zzso
