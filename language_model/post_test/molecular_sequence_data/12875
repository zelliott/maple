The zzso protein zzso of zzso virus zzso is localized predominantly in the zzso of infected zzso To define the nuclear zzso signals within zzso we prepared truncated zzso of zzso and analyzed their zzso in the zzso cells by indirect zzso Analysis of zzso truncated from the zzso end of the zzso acid zzso showed that two regions including a short sequence of basic zzso acid zzso were associated with the nuclear zzso of zzso To assess whether these regions substantially function as signals for nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso we then constructed two deletion zzso lacking each zzso A zzso lacking zzso acids zzso to zzso was detected in the zzso of the zzso cells, whereas the other zzso lacking zzso acids 900 to 950 was detected mainly in the zzso These results suggest that the region of zzso acids 900 to 950 is responsible for nuclear zzso of zzso
