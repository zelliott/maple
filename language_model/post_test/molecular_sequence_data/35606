zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso is a lethal disease, and molecular markers that differentiate zzso from aggressive zzso are zzso We zzso the zzso of five zzso tumors and healthy kidney tissue from an index case with zzso to identify zzso associated with disease progression and zzso An zzso Jewish zzso zzso founder zzso zzso in zzso was observed and zzso ancestry was zzso zzso zzso zzso altered proteins in tumors, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The majority zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were present in all zzso and only a subset zzso zzso 31) was observed in the primary zzso zzso tumor next-generation sequencing and DNA copy number showed zzso loss of zzso and zzso We zzso 19 genes with deleterious zzso in the index case in additional zzso samples and detected a zzso two zzso zzso zzso tumor loss of zzso and combinations of zzso zzso zzso in zzso In zzso genetic analysis of zzso from an index case permitted us to zzso a zzso for the zzso spread of disease based on sequential zzso of zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso deserves additional analysis and may define a subset of zzso zzso
