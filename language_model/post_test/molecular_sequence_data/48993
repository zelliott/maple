Mice with a zzso zzso zzso in zzso protein zero zzso develop zzso clinical paralysis associated with inflammatory pathology in the peripheral zzso Although the development of this illness is known to require T cells and zzso little is understood regarding the zzso zzso in the zzso Here we report that young zzso mice, free from clinical manifestations, have a zzso in central tolerance to zzso and are more prone to induction of experimental zzso zzso zzso by zzso against zzso zzso zzso we found that the zzso gene is transcribed in the zzso of zzso and the zzso mice in an amount zzso to the gene zzso We then replaced the zzso of zzso mice with that of the zzso mice and vice zzso zzso of these mice with zzso zzso that a lower zzso zzso transcript would be associated with the higher recall T cell response to zzso thus accounting for the higher zzso of the zzso mice to zzso zzso These results imply that a zzso zzso in an zzso could cause defective central tolerance to the zzso As such, zzso T cells may play some role in zzso diseases caused by a zzso gene zzso
