In this study we have used a reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso to demonstrate that adult primary human zzso and zzso a human zzso cell line with zzso properties, express cellular zzso protein I zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso protein II zzso zzso and very low levels of zzso zzso We also show that zzso II is expressed in the adult liver, which does not express zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso II is the important zzso in the adult bone as well as in the adult zzso Since the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso alpha previously has been shown to be expressed predominantly in the liver, zzso II might be involved in the transport of zzso zzso acid to its nuclear zzso
