Earlier we have shown that an zzso mixture of zzso zzso A and C (19 zzso acids each) strongly activates zzso in zzso In the present work we developed a zzso zzso system, by zzso an zzso tail to both zzso We tested zzso zzso as well as synaptic zzso on rat brain slices ex zzso In zzso slices both basic zzso and long-term synaptic efficacy were significantly increased upon treatment with the zzso We propose that the zzso zzso zzso can be used with any zzso cell, to specifically challenge the zzso system apparently without raising zzso zzso Such an zzso may be a useful tool in zzso zzso mechanisms involving the zzso zzso
