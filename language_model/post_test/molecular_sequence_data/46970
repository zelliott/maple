Seven overlapping peptides derived from the bovine zzso zzso of collagen III support zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso site has been assigned within this zzso to zzso zzso of the collagen zzso zzso zzso In this study we found that two of the zzso zzso and zzso were able to support zzso zzso under flow conditions, whereas the other peptides showed either very little zzso and zzso or no zzso zzso at all zzso zzso and zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso known to prevent both zzso zzso and von zzso factor zzso to zzso we observed almost complete zzso of zzso zzso to peptides zzso and zzso In zzso binding zzso zzso bound to zzso and zzso and to zzso containing the zzso zzso overlap zzso and not to any other zzso Our results suggest that the overlap sequence zzso zzso zzso acid code, zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of the zzso collagen chain, contains a binding site for zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso by about zzso showing that the zzso site in this locality in zzso detected under zzso conditions is of sufficient affinity to withstand zzso zzso zzso binding studies indicated that zzso binds to zzso and to a lesser extent to zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso in binding to zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso of the zzso may contain one of the critical zzso sites involved in the initial phase of zzso zzso to collagen zzso zzso against zzso zzso and A3 zzso and zzso zzso confirmed that zzso is involved in zzso to zzso and showed that zzso is also involved in zzso to zzso despite the absence of direct binding of zzso to the zzso The existence of zzso zzso and zzso sites all in close proximity in zzso zzso to the importance of this locus in collagen III for its zzso zzso
