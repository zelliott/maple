The isolation and zzso by DNA sequencing of a low molecular weight zzso zzso gene from wheat is zzso The deduced protein contains a signal zzso a central repetitive region rich in zzso and zzso and N and C terminal zzso zzso similar to other zzso A detailed comparison of the C terminal domain of 20 zzso genes enabled us to divide them into 4 zzso The zzso zzso family is distinct from the zzso zzso and zzso families of wheat and is closest to the B zzso genes of zzso This and other comparisons were also used to assess the pattern of genetic variation among zzso sequences and to provide a molecular basis for the interpretation of zzso size zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the isolated gene was previously shown to direct zzso expression of a reporter gene in transgenic zzso Evidence is provided that the isolated gene is also active in wheat and its zzso initiation site was zzso Features of the gene which may be relevant to its activity are zzso
