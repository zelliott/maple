zzso zzso zzso has traditionally been thought to involve the release of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso from the zzso cell zzso onto the target cell zzso zzso Recently, a zzso zzso mechanism involving the interaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso has been zzso We have generated zzso zzso zzso and zzso B zzso zzso of the human zzso cell line zzso These zzso have greatly reduced zzso ability when compared to the zzso control cell line zzso In this study, however, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso retain the ability to lyse zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso and is inhibited by a zzso zzso blocking zzso zzso By zzso we detect message for zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso By flow zzso we show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso express surface zzso These data indicate that in a human zzso cell line, similar to the zzso system, the zzso and zzso pathways of zzso function independently of one zzso At least with the zzso tested, our data also indicate that the zzso and zzso pathways together account for nearly zzso of the zzso ability of zzso
