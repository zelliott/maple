The zzso scorpion toxins specific for zzso channels were found to interact with zzso channels on the zzso region, while zzso zzso binds to the pore region of the Shaker zzso channel, and zzso zzso binds to the intermediate region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to explore the critical zzso for zzso zzso we determined the zzso structure of native zzso zzso a 42 zzso acid zzso scorpion toxin isolated from the zzso of the Mexican scorpion zzso zzso Hoffmann, and we used zzso evolutionary trace zzso analysis to predict possible structural and functional features of interacting zzso The zzso three-dimensional solution structure of native zzso zzso was solved using a total of zzso distance constraints, 13 zzso and 10 hydrogen zzso The structure is characterized by 2 segments of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso stabilized by 4 zzso zzso The zzso and structural analysis provided indication of the presence of two important zzso acid zzso zzso one zzso and the other zzso that should be involved in the surface contact between the toxin and the zzso Some features of the proposed interacting surface are zzso
