A zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso of Tatar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a medicinal plant containing zzso and other zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso with zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a trace amount of zzso zzso from zzso supporting the zzso identification as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso were observed in minor amounts in the reaction with zzso and as major products with zzso zzso As well, such zzso and not aromatic zzso were identified as the only products in zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso from zzso was identified as a new product of a zzso zzso Using Northern zzso analysis, zzso transcript was found to be highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso with low transcript levels also present in young zzso This expression pattern correlated with the occurrence of zzso which was detected in higher amounts in zzso zzso zzso compared with leaves and zzso using zzso Few zzso zzso have been found in plants, and the identification of zzso provides additional sequence and zzso information with which to study the evolution of plant zzso zzso
