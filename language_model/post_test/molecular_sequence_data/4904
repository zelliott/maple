Recently we generated zzso 10 knockout mice which provided a valuable model for the zzso inherited skin disorder zzso zzso Here we investigated the molecular basis for their zzso zzso and zzso expressed a truncated zzso 10 zzso which has been identified directly by zzso zzso mapping of zzso zzso to zzso zzso enabled us to study its distribution relative to zzso 6, which is highly expressed in zzso 10 knockout mice, by zzso electron zzso This revealed that zzso zzso was restricted to complexes with zzso 1 but did not mix with zzso zzso The latter did not form extended filaments with zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso were unable to compensate for the lack of normal zzso zzso zzso Remarkably zzso 6 zzso strictly zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were located in the cell periphery and at zzso which maintained a normal zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso tailored to sustain mechanical stress, was completely lost in paw sole zzso of zzso zzso 10 knockout mice, pointing to zzso 10 as its zzso The selective pairing of zzso zzso and the loss of zzso zzso indicate that in zzso zzso are less zzso than in zzso zzso fragility in zzso 10 knockout mice and in zzso zzso is probably the consequence of two zzso mechanisms namely a decrease of normal zzso zzso filaments and an increase in zzso zzso with a poor zzso zzso
