zzso is a highly zzso zzso involved in controlling cell polarity and polarizing the zzso zzso The zzso gene was first identified by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We have determined the DNA and predicted zzso sequence of the zzso zzso and identified multiple zzso in the coding region and zzso promoter region, thereby limiting its usefulness in genetic zzso zzso we generated additional zzso zzso in highly zzso zzso zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso displayed the same zzso arrest zzso zzso round zzso zzso as the zzso zzso However, it exhibited a zzso selection zzso and abnormal bud zzso at the zzso temperature of 23 degrees zzso These zzso suggest that zzso functions in zzso selection early in the zzso process and also in polarizing growth patterns leading to proper bud zzso later in the zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso displayed a zzso zzso zzso when expressed from the zzso zzso promoter under zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso when expressed in zzso zzso these zzso did not display a conditional zzso when expressed in zzso zzso These new zzso zzso zzso will be important zzso for the further dissection of the cell polarity zzso in both zzso
