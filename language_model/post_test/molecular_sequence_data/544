zzso and DNA sequencing approaches were applied to assess the single zzso zzso zzso and analyze the genetic zzso at partial zzso 2 and zzso 2 of zzso fatty zzso zzso and five sheep populations that comprised of zzso Han sheep zzso zzso zzso Tan sheep zzso zzso Tan zzso zzso F1 zzso Poll Dorset zzso and Suffolk zzso sheep were screened in this zzso The result zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ) and nine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CD and zzso were detected using primer 2, the AA was the zzso zzso A zzso analysis suggested that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were in zzso equilibrium except the Tan and Suffolk zzso zzso analysis revealed a low zzso information content zzso in the Suffolk and Tan zzso zzso F1 populations zzso zzso zzso but an intermediate zzso in the remaining three populations zzso zzso zzso zzso It meant that the zzso of zzso had zzso which could be used as a candidate gene associated gene with zzso traits like intramuscular fat content in different sheep zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso determined by a zzso at zzso were detected using primer zzso The zzso zzso were in the order of zzso A zzso analysis suggested that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were in zzso equilibrium in the Tan and Poll Dorset zzso and the zzso values were low zzso zzso zzso However, there was no zzso in zzso Tan zzso zzso F1 and Suffolk zzso
