Strategies employed for the production of genetically modified zzso crops are premised on zzso the avoidance of gene transfer in the field; zzso the use of genes derived from edible organisms such as plants; zzso preventing the appearance of zzso zzso and zzso maintaining zzso without zzso plant cell zzso To this end, we developed a novel zzso system for zzso transformation with zzso zzso zzso ALS zzso the first step in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso activity is inhibited by certain classes of zzso We generated a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso ALS zzso genes and introduced zzso with zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso into the tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso by particle zzso zzso plants were selected using their resistance to zzso The effects of zzso on zzso zzso activity were examined by a zzso zzso using the leaves of zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso plants were specifically tolerant to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso plants possessing zzso were able to grow in the presence of various zzso thus affirming the relationship between zzso and the associated resistance to zzso Our results show that zzso genes integrated into the zzso zzso are useful sustainable markers that function to exclude plants other than those that are zzso while maintaining zzso zzso This investigation suggests that the resistance management of weeds in the field amid growing zzso crops is possible using zzso a series of zzso that zzso specific resistance to zzso and zzso a strategy that employs zzso zzso
