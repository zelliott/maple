Although protein zzso zzso alpha (an zzso factor of zzso protein zzso has been established as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso involved in the zzso regulation, zzso and zzso studies on tissue and zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso alpha is in fact a zzso zzso and most abundantly exists in brain particulate membrane zzso depending on the tissue homogenization zzso For instance, when brain was zzso in zzso without zzso M zzso approximately zzso of the total zzso alpha was found in the zzso However, when brain was zzso in buffer containing zzso M zzso and in a glass zzso with Teflon zzso more than zzso of the total zzso alpha was found associated with the particulate membrane zzso By manipulating these findings, we have developed a simplified procedure for zzso of homogeneous zzso zzso alpha in high recovery and in a substantial amount from brain zzso The data explain why zzso zzso alpha cannot be isolated in a reasonable amount from most zzso zzso for the past zzso The specific pure zzso that can specifically recognize zzso zzso alpha from crude tissue extracts together with the high quantity zzso of the zzso as presented in this report provides an initial key step for studies on the role of zzso zzso alpha in the regulation of brain functions especially in the brain particulate membrane zzso
