We isolated zzso for zzso zzso from a human zzso zzso library in zzso zzso The zzso revealed that the human zzso zzso lacked a sequence motif of an zzso and/or E1 binding zzso This suggests that the human zzso zzso possesses a unique structure consisting of two zzso in contrast with the zzso zzso of other zzso acid zzso zzso In addition, we found that the human zzso zzso gene is located on zzso 14 at zzso and that a sequence related to the zzso zzso gene is located on zzso 1 at zzso Interestingly, the gene for the zzso zzso of the zzso chain zzso acid zzso complex is also located on zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso 10, zzso
