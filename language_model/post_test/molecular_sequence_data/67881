The zzso zzso zzso zzso at position zzso Because there is no zzso zzso structure available, we have mapped the zzso binding site of zzso by systematically mutating zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and studying the zzso zzso activity and binding of the corresponding zzso After mutating 20 zzso and zzso zzso we identified eight of them that caused large zzso decreases in zzso zzso These zzso cluster within and next to a surface zzso in the zzso which is large enough to accommodate the zzso zzso loop and zzso This zzso is located next to the binding pocket for the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso are positioned at its walls or zzso Many of the zzso with strongly reduced zzso activity showed only a weak loss of zzso binding or even bound better to zzso than zzso zzso which suggests that the zzso zzso some zzso changes in the zzso in the transition state of the zzso group transfer zzso Manual placement of zzso into the structure suggests that zzso mainly interacts with the zzso stem and zzso
