To evaluate the function of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso we constructed a series of zzso zzso in which some of zzso were replaced to zzso With these zzso we studied the effect of zzso agents, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on their zzso zzso Of 10 zzso zzso scattered over zzso either a single zzso at zzso or multiple zzso at the four clustered zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso yielded clear resistance to the treatment with 10 zzso zzso or 1 zzso zzso In contrast, other zzso including those in the zzso domain and those in the zzso zzso of the zzso domain were zzso for the zzso by zzso and zzso Similarly, deletion of zzso and zzso did not zzso the resistance to zzso suggesting the zzso by the zzso agents is zzso Although zzso zzso was resistant to 1 zzso zzso it was zzso by 5 zzso zzso However, combined zzso including all of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso yielded clear resistance to 5 zzso zzso Among these zzso those with double zzso in the four clustered zzso yielded a temperature sensitive zzso in the zzso cells, whereas zzso did not, suggesting that zzso has, at least in part, a discrete zzso In contrast to zzso zzso which lacks zzso at position zzso was resistant to 1 zzso zzso but sensitive to 5 zzso zzso While replacement of zzso of zzso to zzso made it sensitive to 1 zzso zzso double zzso in clustered zzso again yielded resistance to 5 zzso zzso Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the multiple zzso zzso clustered at the end of the zzso lobe are critical for the zzso by the zzso agents and, zzso have an zzso zzso effect on the zzso activity of zzso in a zzso independent zzso
