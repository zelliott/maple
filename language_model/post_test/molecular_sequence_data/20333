Evidence is presented for six zzso zzso zzso including four zzso genes on zzso 6 and zzso and zzso genes on zzso zzso zzso structures for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso boundaries for zzso zzso genes showed a high degree of similarity with other zzso zzso zzso analyses supported the proposed designation of these zzso class 1 zzso as zzso zzso and zzso and are therefore likely to play important roles in retinal and zzso zzso zzso zzso of predicted zzso zzso zzso acid sequences with sheep zzso and rat zzso sequences demonstrated conservation of key zzso previously shown to participate in zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid substitution rates observed for family zzso zzso during zzso evolution indicated that zzso genes are evolving slower than zzso and zzso zzso It is proposed that the common zzso for zzso genes predates the appearance of birds during zzso zzso
