zzso analysis of over zzso aligned zzso sequences from two nuclear zzso growth hormone zzso and zzso provided zzso zzso depicting relationships among the major lineages of zzso Separate and combined analyses resulted in five major zzso zzso strong support for a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso + zzso with zzso zzso being more closely related to zzso than is zzso zzso a zzso relationship between the family zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso a near zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso position of a zzso group containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + two members of the zzso zzso + zzso zzso dates among zzso and primates were also estimated using the combined zzso zzso a global molecular clock and a zzso zzso point, divergence dates among zzso exceeded zzso dates but were generally compatible with other zzso dates estimated under similar zzso However, when a relaxed molecular clock was applied, estimated divergence dates were highly compatible with the fossil zzso
