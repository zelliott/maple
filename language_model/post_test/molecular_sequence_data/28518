Three genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso using zzso zzso zzso of zzso could be detected during zzso growth under both zzso and zzso conditions, whereas neither zzso nor zzso zzso was zzso indicating that zzso is the major transcribed zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was regulated by carbon zzso The zzso promoter was successfully used for zzso expression of genes of both zzso zzso zzso a regulator of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth of a zzso zzso strain resulted in the zzso of zzso active zzso The potential advantages of using a zzso fungus for zzso protein production are zzso
