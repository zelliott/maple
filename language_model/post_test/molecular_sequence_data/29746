The zzso coli zzso zzso exists as a linear DNA zzso with zzso closed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only protein required to convert circular DNA zzso to the linear form with hairpin zzso Within the center of the zzso occupancy site zzso the target for zzso is the zzso zzso consisting of the central zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso I zzso of zzso complexes shows a segment of approximately 50 zzso protected by zzso Surface zzso resonance studies demonstrate that this extended footprint is caused by two zzso molecules bound to zzso zzso zzso DNA complexes are achieved with zzso however, the additional sequences of zzso stabilize the zzso zzso zzso alone is not sufficient for specific stable complex zzso However, processing can occur, zzso generation of the linear zzso closed zzso Within the context of zzso sequences of zzso are involved in specific zzso complex formation, in processing itself, and/or in recognition of the processing zzso The sequence of the central zzso within zzso that is part of a zzso stretch proposed to have zzso zzso is essential for processing but not for formation of specific zzso zzso The concerted action of both zzso molecules at the target site is the basis for zzso zzso zzso of reaction zzso demonstrates that zzso binds zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso
