Using a newly constructed zzso with a zzso reporter gene in a zzso zzso zzso zzso we have identified an zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso which is a component of a novel zzso zzso system required for zzso This gene is located on a 4 zzso zzso zzso segment, which constitutes a new zzso zzso This zzso encodes an outer membrane zzso zzso and contains the zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso as predicted by their characteristic signature zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulted in a zzso that is zzso and zzso protective immunity in zzso zzso The zzso zzso could be restored by in zzso zzso with the zzso zzso This novel zzso might be involved in iron zzso in zzso
