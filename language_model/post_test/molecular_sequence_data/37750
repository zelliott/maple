A variety of studies suggest that zzso losses at zzso zzso are associated with aggressive behavior of various forms of human zzso Using a probe to detect zzso deletions on zzso zzso in kidney and zzso cancer cell lines, we identified a new candidate tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumors zzso The predicted zzso product of zzso zzso acids has extensive zzso to a gigantic zzso zzso which mediates zzso of multiple proteins from the cell zzso zzso deletions in zzso were detected in zzso (4 of zzso of zzso cell lung cancer zzso cell zzso The expression of only abnormal transcripts missing portions of the zzso sequence was demonstrated in an additional zzso (11 of zzso of zzso zzso Finally, a zzso zzso at zzso zzso was detected in one of four zzso lines tested for the large open reading zzso In contrast, no zzso zzso were identified in a major fraction of zzso cell lines, indicating that this gene is zzso zzso in one zzso type of lung zzso Our data suggest that zzso of zzso occurs in at least zzso of zzso lines and thus may play an important role in zzso of zzso
