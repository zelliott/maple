We have used direct zzso selection to isolate expressed sequences from a set of four overlapping zzso spanning approximately 470 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso unique zzso fragments were identified in this zzso Twenty-two of the selected zzso showed complete identity with known genes and expressed sequence zzso Two of these zzso shared sequence zzso with genes known to zzso potential DNA binding motifs and hence could function in zzso zzso The remaining 16 unique zzso fragments showed no significant similarity to sequences in the databases and could potentially zzso novel zzso Northern analysis of the novel zzso showed differential expression in various zzso supporting the transcribed nature of these zzso Our results place the gene for a zzso coupled zzso zzso previously mapped to zzso within a 400 zzso region on zzso
