zzso zzso zzso genes were first identified in zzso as negative regulators of zzso gene zzso It has been confirmed that zzso is a zzso family of proteins present in various animals and zzso In this paper, the zzso of the zzso zzso named zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso zzso carp zzso and zzso color zzso carp zzso zzso The full-length zzso is zzso zzso in length with an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso that encodes zzso zzso zzso while the full-length zzso is zzso zzso in length and also has an zzso of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of both zzso zzso contain seven zzso zzso and show high identity with other zzso family zzso zzso analyses revealed strong expression of zzso in the zzso whereas no expression was detected in the zzso of either of the zzso zzso zzso was not detected in the liver of zzso but a high level of zzso zzso was observed in zzso The zzso expression pattern showed that the zzso zzso is consistently expressed during all embryonic development stages in zzso However, the abundance of zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso shortly after zzso and then increased again and remained stable from zzso till zzso The varying zzso expression patterns of zzso genes in zzso and zzso may be associated with the differing zzso modes used by these two closely related zzso Our results suggest that zzso may play a role not only in the zzso of zzso nucleus and the formation of zzso during zzso but also in zzso and the subsequent development of zzso
