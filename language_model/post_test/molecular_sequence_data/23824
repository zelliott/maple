zzso infection has been rare in zzso In 2000, an explosive epidemic among injecting drug users was detected in the Eastern border region, resulting in zzso newly reported cases by the end of zzso The molecular epidemiology of the outbreak was studied to establish whether the zzso epidemic is linked to the zzso in Eastern zzso Over 200 newly infected individuals were zzso sampled from June 2000 to March 2002 in a geographically representative way, with known dates of diagnosis and information of probable route of zzso zzso regions coding for two viral gene regions were directly zzso from plasma viral zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a larger region coding for the entire zzso gene was zzso from one sample and studied for indications of possible zzso zzso The zzso zzso outbreak was found to be caused by simultaneous introduction of two zzso a minor zzso A strain very similar to the Eastern European zzso A strain zzso zzso of zzso and a second major strain zzso found to be most closely related to the zzso strain, previously described only from African zzso The zzso in the two clusters was very low, suggesting point source zzso Ten percent of cases seemed to be newly generated zzso of the A and zzso zzso Analysis of viral diversification over time revealed a rate of change within the zzso region of zzso for the zzso strain, consistent with findings from other zzso Due to the relatively frequently found novel zzso forms, the zzso zzso epidemic may allow studies of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
