zzso is the main constituent of zzso bodies in familial and sporadic cases of Parkinson's disease zzso zzso dominant point zzso gene zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso gene cause zzso forms of zzso One of the zzso point zzso zzso is associated with increased zzso toxicity leading to familial zzso zzso in zzso The zzso acid in position 53 in zzso is an zzso in humans, great apes and Old World zzso However, this zzso acid is a zzso in the zzso of all other examined species, including New World zzso Here, we present DNA sequence analysis of zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso cloned from various different species, ranging from fish to zzso which are known for their zzso zzso In all these investigated species the zzso is zzso We conclude that zzso is not a molecular adaptation for zzso animals to minimize the risk of developing zzso
