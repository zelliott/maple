We have identified a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso locus of zzso zzso zzso possessing this locus are known to produce zzso outer core structures that mimic host zzso and have been implicated in triggering the onset of zzso zzso The zzso which was cloned and expressed as a fusion construct in zzso coli, is soluble and zzso with members of the zzso family of zzso This zzso zzso the transfer of zzso groups onto zzso zzso acid, with a high specificity for terminal zzso zzso The modification is directed to zzso and not zzso as is believed to occur more commonly in other zzso Despite their wide prevalence and importance in both zzso and zzso this is the first report to describe the characterization of a zzso zzso zzso
