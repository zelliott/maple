The E6 protein of cervical zzso human zzso zzso is known to suppress zzso differentiation through unidentified zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso differentiation and functions as a tumor zzso in zzso zzso Here, we report that the zzso gene is a novel target of zzso and can be zzso by E6 through zzso degradation in normal human zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso by E6 or zzso zzso zzso resulted in reduced zzso expression at the zzso level, and a zzso element could be identified in the zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso suppressed both spontaneous zzso differentiation in culture and its induction upon DNA zzso Furthermore, the induction of zzso and differentiation makers as well as zzso of the zzso layer upon zzso zzso was observed in zzso but not in zzso mouse zzso Together, our findings not only demonstrate a novel link between zzso and zzso in zzso differentiation upon zzso stress but also suggest a novel tumor zzso mechanism of zzso in the development of zzso cell zzso including zzso zzso
