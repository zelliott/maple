zzso zzso unlike the zzso of zzso and zzso are characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which is caused by the enhanced zzso rate of zzso To find out whether local zzso sequences around existing zzso zzso zzso have common patterns, we analyzed a large population of zzso regions in human DNA, which are typically zzso We detected a novel periodic variation in the numbers of zzso bases around zzso in the zzso parts of these zzso This zzso of eight zzso gradually diminished over 64 zzso on each side of the central zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the zzso and 3' nearest neighbors of zzso in zzso regions were biased towards zzso and zzso zzso Such biased sequence contexts may have helped to stabilize zzso against depletion during zzso zzso
