zzso receptors are expressed in specific brain zzso We now describe zzso zzso variations of the human zzso zzso zzso occurring at zzso zzso zzso zzso near the end of the first predicted zzso zzso zzso is formed by the zzso of an additional 16 zzso zzso zzso is formed by deleting a cassette of 130 zzso zzso including six of the 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso formed functional channels in zzso zzso and human zzso zzso After zzso of zzso small, inconsistent zzso responses were detected only in the human cells, but when zzso zzso may alter the function of zzso in zzso The distribution of zzso zzso zzso within human brain suggests zzso zzso These data indicate that the functions of the human zzso zzso may be altered by alternative zzso
