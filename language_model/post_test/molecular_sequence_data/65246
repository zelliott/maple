As a central component of innate zzso complement zzso is a critical mechanism of zzso and clearance of microbial pathogens in advance of the development of acquired zzso Several pathogens restrict complement zzso through the acquisition of host proteins that regulate complement zzso or through the production of their own complement regulatory molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Leung, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Atkinson, zzso zzso zzso 2006; zzso zzso zzso Wang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Friedman, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The infectious stage of the zzso zzso zzso zzso produces a zzso complement regulatory protein zzso that functions to inhibit alternative and classical zzso complement zzso zzso zzso Norris, zzso zzso zzso zzso Cooper, and zzso So, zzso zzso zzso zzso This study addresses the zzso complexity of the zzso zzso zzso and its relationship to the zzso zzso zzso family zzso active zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of several functionally distinct zzso that share a characteristic zzso domain at their zzso zzso These zzso families include active zzso zzso zzso and proteins of unknown functions zzso zzso Cross and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A sequence comparison search of zzso using zzso revealed several full-length zzso of zzso These proteins share significant zzso at their zzso zzso and a strong spatial conservation of zzso zzso Alternative zzso complement regulation was confirmed for zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso identity to zzso zzso are functionally similar to the microbial and zzso proteins that regulate complement zzso zzso alignment of zzso complement control proteins to zzso showed that these sequences are zzso supporting a zzso evolutionary zzso Finally, we show that a zzso line of zzso zzso expresses multiple unique copies of zzso that are zzso recognized by patient zzso
