A zzso zzso zzso procedure for zzso synthetic peptides has been developed based on the specific incorporation of zzso zzso derivatives onto the terminal zzso acid of zzso The acid stable zzso derivatives were zzso with a variety of chemical groups thus altering the zzso properties of the zzso peptides and permitting their convenient zzso either by zzso zzso or zzso exchange zzso The assembly of the peptides involved a capping step to prevent the formation of deletion zzso The zzso derivatives were incorporated either as zzso zzso acid zzso or as activated zzso zzso After zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso were zzso removed with organic zzso The efficiency of the technique was demonstrated by the zzso of small to large sized zzso including a zzso zzso
