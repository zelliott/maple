In zzso zzso the genes required for zzso of zzso hosts are under the control of DNA regulatory sequences called nod zzso In this paper, we have characterized three zzso zzso zzso which form a zzso zzso zzso of the nod box zzso The first gene of this zzso is identical to the zzso gene identified by zzso and zzso (1992) in zzso zzso strain zzso The product of the second zzso zzso presents some zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors lacking the zzso zzso In contrast, in strains carrying a zzso in either zzso or zzso no modification in zzso structure or production could be zzso On particular zzso such as zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso showed a very weak zzso ability, associated with a drastic decrease in the number of infection zzso while zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso was not zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso By using a zzso approach, we showed that the presence of zzso and hence of zzso zzso factors, is a major prerequisite for zzso the ability to zzso alfalfa upon the zzso zzso zzso zzso
