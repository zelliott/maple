An unusually slow association process which accounts for the bulk of its zzso changes at zzso zzso is observed for zzso when it zzso with zzso D zzso This is in contrast to an order of magnitude faster association rates exhibited by zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso binding sequence zzso zzso or zzso The number of drug molecules bound and the melting temperature increase upon zzso binding are significantly higher for zzso than for other zzso zzso zzso spectral zzso of this zzso in the presence of zzso suggest additional drug binding prior to zzso This particular zzso sequence may be unique, as other zzso containing central zzso sequence and even those differing only by the terminal bases such as zzso and zzso are only zzso binding and do not exhibit such zzso slow zzso association zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso CD evidence indicates that, in contrast to the other zzso containing zzso both zzso and its parent zzso exhibit zzso B zzso The observed slow association zzso and its interesting zzso dependence are rationalized in terms of a model in which the zzso molecules initially zzso and distort the zzso duplex to a favorable zzso zzso so that zzso at the central zzso sequence can occur via DNA zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
