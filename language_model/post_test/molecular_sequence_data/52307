We have examined the zzso of zzso zzso introduced at seven novel sites on human zzso D to determine whether the location of an zzso on a zzso zzso affects its ability to serve as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso that zzso the initial step in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso sites were introduced into the zzso D zzso by zzso zzso and were selected to be widely distributed over the surface of the zzso When the zzso were expressed in zzso zzso the zzso at each zzso site were zzso at levels considerably above background zzso zzso versus zzso zzso for the zzso protein zzso However, zzso located closer to the essential components of the zzso recognition domain zzso zzso and zzso acids zzso were zzso better than zzso located further zzso Similar results were obtained for zzso at zzso sites on a zzso D zzso containing only zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso D, although the absolute levels of zzso were zzso These results demonstrate that there is considerable flexibility in the placement of zzso sites on zzso D in terms of the ability of the zzso to serve as zzso for zzso although zzso located closer to the zzso recognition zzso are zzso zzso
