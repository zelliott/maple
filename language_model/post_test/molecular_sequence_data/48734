zzso fishes, or zzso comprise nearly one-third of all living zzso Despite their dominant role in aquatic zzso the evolutionary history and tempo of zzso diversification is poorly zzso We investigate the pattern of lineage diversification in zzso by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso from a nuclear gene zzso that includes 520 zzso species and 37 fossil age zzso This zzso provides resolution for what has been classically referred to as the zzso at the zzso of the zzso tree, and indicates zzso originated in the Early zzso zzso evidence suggests zzso exhibit a pulse of zzso diversification following the end zzso mass zzso however, the role of this event on the zzso of living zzso diversity remains zzso zzso diversification rates through time exhibit no shifts associated with the end zzso mass zzso but there is a global decrease in lineage diversification rates 50 Ma that occurs during a period when zzso disparity among fossil zzso increases zzso Analysis of zzso shifts in diversification rates reveal that the zzso of living zzso is highlighted by several rapidly radiating lineages including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These lineages with high diversification rates are not associated with a single habitat type, such as coral zzso indicating there is no single explanation for the success of zzso as exceptional bouts of diversification have occurred across a wide array of marine and freshwater zzso
