zzso diversity of zzso A viruses zzso and zzso 68, 69, and 71 was studied by comparing zzso and derived zzso acid sequences from the zzso untranslated region zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso region, and zzso The data were obtained by sequencing zzso zzso According to the molecular analysis of the coding region, zzso belong to three different genetic zzso zzso 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 form a coherent genetic group designated cluster zzso No other zzso apart from zzso 71, are found in this zzso zzso is the only member of the zzso found in the same genetic group with zzso B zzso the major group of zzso and zzso 69 zzso zzso zzso C includes zzso 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 24 which are genetically close relatives of zzso zzso 68 is related to zzso 70 zzso zzso zzso different from those in the coding region are found in the zzso while the grouping in the zzso is similar to that found in the zzso zzso zzso of these findings with evolution, zzso and zzso is zzso
