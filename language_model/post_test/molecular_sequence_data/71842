zzso defects in the zzso zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso protein zzso lead to the lethal zzso disorder zzso zzso zzso for which no efficient treatment has been established so zzso Three other zzso ABC zzso currently are zzso zzso protein zzso 70 zzso zzso membrane protein zzso and zzso related zzso By using transient and stable zzso of human zzso zzso zzso and its closest relative zzso we could restore the impaired zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of very long chain fatty acids could also be prevented by zzso of zzso in immortalized zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the functional replacement of zzso by zzso was not due to stabilization of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we were able to restore the zzso zzso zzso in the liver of zzso mice by stimulation of zzso and zzso gene expression through a dietary treatment with the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that a correction of the zzso zzso in zzso could be possible by drug-induced zzso or zzso expression of zzso
