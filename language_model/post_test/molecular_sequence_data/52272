The zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso coli is the recognition component of the zzso zzso and of the active transport system for zzso It interacts with the zzso zzso signal zzso and the integral zzso components (the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso transport zzso zzso binds in a zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso which are connected by a zzso zzso The two zzso undergo a large motion relative to one another as the protein moves from the open, zzso state to the closed, zzso zzso We generated, by zzso zzso zzso acid zzso that specifically disrupt the zzso function of zzso These zzso cluster in two zzso regions that are nearly zzso on the surface of zzso in its closed zzso One region is in the zzso domain and one is in the zzso zzso The distance between the two regions is expected to change substantially as the protein goes from the open to the closed zzso These results support a model in which zzso binding brings two recognition sites on zzso into the proper spatial relationship to interact with complementary sites on zzso zzso in zzso that appear to cause defects in interaction with zzso and zzso are distributed differently from zzso that primarily affect zzso zzso We conclude that the regions of zzso that contact zzso and those that contact zzso and zzso are adjacent on the face of the protein opposite the hinge connecting the two zzso and that those regions are zzso although perhaps not entirely, zzso
