zzso zzso zzso expression by breast tumors is an important predictor of zzso survival in breast cancer patients and, more importantly, is a strong predictor of response to zzso zzso zzso forms of the zzso may play an important role in the loss of hormone responsiveness and the progression to hormone zzso We have examined a panel of human breast tumor cell lines, both zzso and zzso and have identified an zzso zzso zzso containing a deletion of zzso 5 in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso This zzso 5 deletion zzso has been previously reported to be zzso in zzso zzso breast zzso Using zzso protection analysis, we have found that the zzso zzso transcript in the zzso cells is the zzso 5 deletion zzso while the principal transcript in zzso cells is the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso transcript is translated into a truncated zzso protein of approximately zzso 42,000 when expressed in zzso and, more important, in breast tumor zzso This is the first demonstration of an zzso 5 deletion zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis has shown that this zzso zzso possesses zzso zzso regulatory activity with respect to an zzso reporter gene construct in a zzso expression zzso The presence of this zzso zzso in breast tumor cell lines, as well as breast tumor zzso and zzso zzso suggests that it is a naturally occurring zzso that may arise by alternative zzso and whose zzso may be involved in the progression of breast tumors to a zzso zzso
