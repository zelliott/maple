An unexplained increase in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in pneumonia cases has been reported in recent zzso The present study investigated the genetic and biological specifications of new zzso of zzso zzso mini virus zzso detected in zzso zzso samples from children zzso for severe pneumonia with zzso A pathogen discovery protocol was applied in zzso zzso zzso samples and led to the identification of three new zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso into zzso and human embryonic kidney zzso cells and viral replication was assessed by quantitative real-time zzso and full-length zzso zzso zzso cells were further infected with released zzso zzso and the zzso immune response was measured by multiplex zzso zzso analyses of the three zzso zzso revealed a classic zzso zzso but a weak identity zzso with known zzso We demonstrated the in zzso replication of zzso in zzso zzso cells and the effective release of infectious viral zzso We also showed a selective production of inflammatory zzso in response to zzso zzso This study reports the description of zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso of children zzso with zzso suggesting a potential role of the virus in the zzso of zzso
