Analysis of zzso zzso of DNA derived from zzso zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso zzso strain zzso extending in the zzso direction of the recently described zzso zzso revealed 13 open reading frames zzso which showed great similarities to genes of members of the type II zzso zzso systems of zzso zzso We named the zzso zzso to zzso for zzso type II zzso zzso In addition, an zzso zzso element was found to separate the zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso experiments with a specific zzso probe and various categories of enteric zzso coli zzso revealed that the zzso gene cluster occurred in all 30 zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso tested and is distributed sporadically among other zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso genes were rarely detected in zzso isolated from bovine feces zzso Moreover, it was found not to occur in zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso The results obtained with the zzso probe were confirmed by a zzso approach to specifically detect an internal zzso of the zzso zzso
