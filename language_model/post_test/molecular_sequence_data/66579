Over the course of infection, human zzso virus type 1 zzso continuously adapts to evade the evolving host zzso zzso zzso Changes in the envelope variable loop zzso particularly the extent of zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso To document modifications that potentially influence zzso zzso we compared envelope variable zzso 1 and 2 zzso from multiple sequences isolated at the primary phase of infection to those isolated around 2 to 3 years into the chronic phase of infection in nine women with zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences isolated during chronic infection had significantly longer zzso zzso with a significantly higher number of potential zzso zzso sites, than the sequences isolated early in zzso To assess the effects of these zzso changes on zzso zzso and zzso we created zzso envelope zzso which incorporated a zzso zzso sequences into a common zzso A envelope backbone and then used them to generate zzso zzso Compared to the parent virus, the introduction of a zzso zzso zzso envelope variable zzso rendered the zzso envelope more sensitive to that zzso plasma samples but only to plasma samples collected zzso months after the sequences were zzso zzso was not detected with the same plasma when the zzso zzso sequences were replaced with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that changes in zzso contribute to zzso zzso zzso viruses with zzso segments from different times in infection, however, showed no significant difference in zzso sensitivity to zzso pooled zzso suggesting that viruses with zzso zzso from early in infection were not inherently more zzso zzso zzso viruses bearing zzso envelopes with zzso zzso sequences showed a trend in infecting cells with low zzso zzso more zzso while engineered viruses with zzso sequences isolated during chronic infection were moderately better at infecting cells with low zzso zzso These studies suggest that changes within the zzso envelope zzso over the course of an infection influence sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso and may also impact host zzso zzso
