zzso a zzso zzso abundantly expressed in human and mouse zzso is presumed to play an important role in the process of zzso and zzso In this study, we cloned an zzso zzso from rats, and analyzed its expression and tissue zzso The isolated zzso consisted of zzso zzso with a single open reading frame zzso zzso zzso acids and an expected molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of rat zzso had zzso and zzso identity with its zzso and human counterparts, respectively, and appeared to be a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso region at the zzso By quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction analysis, rat zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso as in human and zzso However, its zzso distribution was predominantly in the zzso zzso at steps 12 to 19, and not in the primary zzso and round zzso This different distribution profile suggests that zzso plays a role in zzso zzso events during zzso and zzso
