In zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso is responsible for the zzso of storage zzso This zzso also occurs in other zzso where it has a variety of additional zzso zzso The central zzso steps of zzso zzso are performed by zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso In order to investigate the function and regulation of zzso in plants it is first necessary to identify and characterize genes zzso the relevant zzso in a single model zzso Recently we and others have reported on the cloning and characterization of genes zzso four zzso and a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Here we identify a gene zzso an zzso zzso zzso that is induced zzso during zzso The pattern of zzso expression closely reflects changes in the activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similar patterns of expression have previously been reported for zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that genes zzso the three main proteins responsible for zzso are zzso expressed during zzso zzso and may share a common mechanism of zzso
