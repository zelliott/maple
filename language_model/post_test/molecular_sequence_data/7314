We zzso the region of the bovine zzso type 1 zzso zzso corresponding to map units zzso zzso zzso representing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus which zzso the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso and components of the viral zzso and the zzso zzso To discriminate between two potential zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso end of the zzso was mapped by zzso zzso protection zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of the three zzso proteins with analogous zzso from several other zzso revealed significant levels of zzso We also compared the expression zzso of the large zzso zzso versus the small zzso zzso zzso zzso during the course of in zzso zzso infection by Western zzso using specifically developed and zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso protein was zzso earlier than its zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso protein accumulated to a higher level than the zzso protein even though the zzso transcript was in greater abundance than the zzso zzso This is discussed with regard to the zzso efficiency of their zzso
