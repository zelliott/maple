zzso zzso viruses zzso have previously been described in zzso zzso from zzso da zzso zzso Like other known zzso viruses of zzso zzso these viruses have never been adapted to cell cultures and remain zzso at the molecular zzso In this study, we made attempts to adapt the virus to cell cultures that resulted instead in the isolation of a previously zzso zzso closely related to zzso The zzso was subsequently detected by zzso chain reaction zzso in the blood of infected zzso using zzso for a zzso portion of the zzso major zzso protein zzso zzso microscopic study of the new zzso disclosed, among other features, the presence of zzso viruses that may be related to an zzso zzso zzso zzso Attempts to detect by zzso a portion of the DNA zzso gene of the zzso in infected zzso blood were zzso The recovered sequence had zzso zzso zzso with a previously detected sequence from a snake zzso virus from Florida, which is zzso different from the studied zzso These results further support the hypothesis that zzso viruses are related to one another and may represent a new group of zzso large zzso
