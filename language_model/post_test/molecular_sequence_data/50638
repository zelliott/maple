zzso A viruses bearing zzso zzso zzso are restricted in replication in the respiratory tract of animals and humans and are therefore zzso zzso sequences were determined for the zzso segment coding for the zzso basic protein 2 zzso from a panel of 12 influenza zzso zzso zzso zzso previously characterized to have a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Each of the viruses with a zzso zzso in the zzso gene had a single zzso acid change located at position 65, 100, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso The sites of the single zzso were scattered throughout the length of the protein and occurred in regions that are highly zzso among the influenza A virus zzso predicted zzso acid zzso Interestingly, the substitution of zzso acid for zzso at position 556 was found to lie within a region that has zzso with zzso motifs of human and zzso zzso Taken together, the findings of zzso sites in the zzso zzso gene and the three reported zzso acid changes at positions zzso zzso and 512 for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, indicate that the zzso gene can sustain a viable zzso zzso at different zzso This information will allow us to construct cloned zzso copies of the zzso zzso gene zzso at specific zzso Different zzso of two or more zzso zzso may be incorporated into the zzso zzso gene zzso We have a zzso zzso virus that should permit rescue of in zzso transcripts of the zzso gene into infectious zzso The rescue of these zzso zzso zzso segments into an infectious influenza A virus may lead to the development of live attenuated zzso virus vaccines that are zzso zzso genetically stable, and zzso in zzso
