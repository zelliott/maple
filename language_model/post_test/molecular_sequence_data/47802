The major zzso of zzso degradation in zzso occurs through zzso zzso and subsequent zzso to 3' zzso zzso of the transcript zzso To identify proteins that control the activity of the zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso we isolated a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso of zzso partially suppressed the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso protein was required for the zzso of both normal zzso and zzso transcripts that are zzso by the zzso surveillance zzso The zzso protein contains a zzso zzso which is found in a class of zzso zzso analyses indicated that the region of zzso containing the zzso motif is necessary and sufficient for zzso function in zzso zzso The zzso also zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and is required for the production of zzso active zzso zzso These results suggest that direct or indirect interaction of zzso with zzso is required for the production of active zzso zzso perhaps in a process requiring the zzso of a zzso zzso
