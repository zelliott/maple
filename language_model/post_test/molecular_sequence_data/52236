An zzso zzso which possesses the property of inducing both zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso has been isolated from zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso exchange zzso This zzso single chain zzso with an zzso of zzso and zzso point of zzso is stored exclusively in the large zzso zzso of zzso Based on the partial zzso zzso acid sequence of 63 zzso DNA zzso have been zzso for screening a zzso zzso library constructed from zzso zzso The zzso coding for this protein reveals the presence of a zzso signal zzso preceding the zzso open reading zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates the presence of a single zzso zzso The primary structure derived from the corresponding zzso sequence reveals an internal zzso consisting of two consensus zzso zzso and zzso The formation of 5 zzso bonds between 10 zzso divides the zzso into three zzso zzso each containing the zzso repeating zzso One of the novel features of this protein is that it shares 37% identity with a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein isolated from fetal bovine skin zzso zzso Choi, zzso and Rosenberg, zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The two proteins exhibit a similar pattern of zzso zzso each domain containing a zzso consensus sequence zzso zzso The overall structure of both proteins seems to be highly zzso with the exception of an zzso zzso region present only in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The functional properties of the two proteins are similar in that the zzso zzso protein zzso horse zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein is an effective zzso promoter for zzso zzso On the basis of these unique properties, the newly characterized zzso has been termed zzso zzso zzso factor zzso
