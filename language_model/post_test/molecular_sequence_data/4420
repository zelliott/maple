A protein that zzso to a zzso zzso zzso was induced in zzso roots following the invasion of second-stage juveniles zzso of the cereal zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso designated zzso was acid zzso and its molecular mass was about 45 zzso on a sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced in both compatible and incompatible interactions between the zzso and the plant, and also in roots by exposure to zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso However, zzso was not induced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid, or zzso zzso activity, which is involved in zzso zzso was higher in zzso and zzso roots than in their zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity in roots abolished zzso induction in the zzso zzso zzso acid sequences similar to that of zzso were found in zzso of zzso tree and zzso even though zzso showed no zzso zzso Although the biological role of zzso in infected roots is not clear, zzso is suggested to be involved in signal zzso after pathogen invasion of the zzso
