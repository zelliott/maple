The pharmacological characterization of the zzso receptors involved in spinal and zzso cardiovascular regulation is reviewed in this zzso In conscious rats, substance P zzso zzso A zzso zzso B zzso zzso K zzso and zzso gamma zzso zzso were injected either zzso zzso or zzso zzso and their effects were assessed on mean zzso blood pressure zzso and heart rate zzso Moreover, selective zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors were tested against the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso SP zzso zzso zzso zzso The cardiovascular response to zzso SP, zzso and zzso gamma was significantly attenuated by the prior zzso administration of zzso and zzso but not by zzso and zzso By the zzso route, zzso also zzso zzso and zzso responses dose zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso SP zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso were slightly more potent than zzso on both zzso Whereas the cardiovascular response to zzso was largely blocked by zzso and zzso that to SP was reduced by zzso This treatment had no effect on the cardiovascular response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduced by zzso the zzso cardiovascular changes without affecting the central zzso effects of zzso SP, and zzso However, when zzso zzso and zzso abolished the effects to SP and zzso while leaving untouched those induced by zzso Finally, the central effects zzso by zzso zzso and zzso were blocked by zzso These findings suggest that the zzso action of zzso on the rat cardiovascular system is zzso by a zzso zzso in the spinal cord, while zzso zzso and zzso receptors are likely involved in the zzso zzso effects of these zzso It is also concluded that zzso is a pure and powerful zzso zzso in contrast to SP and zzso which are not selective for zzso and zzso zzso zzso
