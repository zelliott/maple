To penetrate susceptible cells, zzso zzso interacts with two highly zzso cellular zzso zzso and a zzso zzso like zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against such receptors are currently under clinical investigation as potential preventive or therapeutic zzso We zzso zzso mice with molecular complexes of the native, zzso zzso envelope zzso bound to a soluble form of the human zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice were found to contain zzso zzso zzso and showed zzso zzso zzso A proportion of zzso derived from these mice zzso recognized zzso zzso In particular, a zzso zzso designated zzso zzso was found to zzso bind to a zzso zzso on the zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso also recognized zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso which exhibit sequence divergence in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed broad zzso activity, but it did not exert zzso effects on zzso zzso in zzso The variable regions of the heavy and light chains of zzso zzso were zzso Due to its zzso zzso activity and lack of zzso effects, a humanized zzso of zzso zzso could provide a useful complement to current preventive or therapeutic strategies against zzso
