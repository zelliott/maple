Acute zzso failure is an abrupt decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acute zzso zzso We aimed to determine whether zzso affects zzso zzso zzso cells and is associated with acute zzso zzso We analyzed the expression of zzso and its zzso zzso in the zzso of rats with zzso acute zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso and its receptors and zzso zzso showed strongly expressed zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso We analyzed human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, which expressed both zzso and its zzso zzso specifically induced zzso zzso by zzso zzso 9 in zzso zzso zzso also activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2, the downstream signals implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the transcripts of transforming growth factor zzso a critical zzso of zzso zzso In hypoxic zzso cells, zzso and zzso transcripts increased, and zzso zzso zzso beta zzso In zzso study further demonstrated that zzso zzso reduced the expression of zzso and zzso beta and the number of damaged zzso cells in the zzso of rats with acute zzso zzso We concluded that zzso may be involved in the injury of zzso zzso cells in acute zzso zzso
