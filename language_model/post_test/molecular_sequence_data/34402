zzso elements zzso are the most diverse and widespread zzso zzso with members of the zzso zzso found in zzso plants, zzso and zzso In a previous study, we characterized 82 zzso zzso gene fragments zzso length zzso in 44 bamboo species, indicating that zzso are zzso abundant and diverse in the zzso zzso In this study, we isolated 79 full-length zzso zzso genes from 63 bamboo species representing 38 zzso in six zzso mainly found in zzso The zzso were highly zzso mostly uniform in length and contained intact zzso motifs and zzso zzso zzso with few notable zzso zzso and nonsense zzso This suggested the zzso are probably still mobile, not yet affected by vertical zzso A zzso tree of the zzso zzso established using zzso DNA internal transcribed zzso sequences was zzso with a second tree based on the zzso zzso zzso This evidence, together with the presence of zzso zzso in zzso related species and diverse zzso in closely related species, indicates that zzso have evolved in a distinct manner, probably independently of zzso events in the zzso The evolution and diversity of zzso zzso genes in the zzso zzso is zzso
