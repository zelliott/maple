Two zzso bacteria, strains zzso and zzso were isolated from sewage flowing into zzso River near the zzso industrial complex in zzso zzso of the strains were zzso and zzso displayed a zzso life cycle and formed creamy white colonies on zzso zzso or zzso zzso The strains had zzso markers that were consistent with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso as the major zzso zzso and zzso components as the zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso content of zzso zzso zzso analysis, based on zzso zzso gene sequencing, showed that the strains were most similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (with zzso zzso and zzso % zzso zzso and formed a separate lineage with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Combined zzso data and zzso zzso data supported the conclusion that strains zzso and zzso represent a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
