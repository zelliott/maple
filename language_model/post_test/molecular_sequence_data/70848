zzso of the zzso cell in flowering plants zzso the male zzso zzso which eventually culminates in the process of double zzso Little is known about the molecular mechanisms operative in the zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation and characterization of zzso clones zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso analysis revealed that both genes are activated after formation of the zzso cell and zzso of transcripts increases progressively during zzso cell zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso are products of zzso zzso of the zzso cell nucleus and thus provide the first evidence for male germ line zzso gene expression in flowering zzso
