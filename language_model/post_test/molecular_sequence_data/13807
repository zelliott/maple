zzso is a human cell line derived from a small cell lung zzso zzso which expresses the zzso zzso zzso We took it as a model in which to study the mechanism of zzso gene expression in these zzso precursor processing is altered and gene expression is essentially unresponsive to zzso zzso gene structure appeared normal by Southern zzso analysis, indicating that gene zzso was not responsible for its expression in zzso Indeed, using transient expression of human zzso fusion genes in zzso we showed that zzso the normal human zzso promoter was functional in zzso and zzso the same zzso promoter region zzso + zzso produced the full zzso activity in zzso and in the mouse zzso cell line zzso Progressive zzso deletion analysis revealed differences between zzso and zzso region zzso zzso was active in zzso and not in zzso whereas region zzso zzso was active in both cell lines and zzso zzso was only active in zzso The latter partially zzso a motif zzso to the zzso rat element which zzso the zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso however, this motif had no effect in zzso These data suggest that zzso gene zzso is achieved through a different set of zzso factors in zzso and zzso Altogether, our results provide evidence that zzso is a valid model of tumors responsible for the zzso zzso syndrome and that the mechanism of zzso gene expression in these zzso cells is different from that in zzso zzso
