To investigate zzso which is linked to zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso using molecular zzso 

A zzso chain reaction method was used to detect zzso from clinical zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso strain diversity was examined by DNA restriction zzso length zzso zzso patterns with zzso as a zzso 

The detection rate of the zzso products was significantly higher in strains from gastric zzso patients than in those of chronic zzso patients zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso and zzso patterns were different between gastric zzso and gastric cancer zzso 

A zzso chain reaction method established for the detection of zzso proved to be rapid and zzso Analysis of zzso may therefore be a useful genetic technique for the study of strain zzso
