The zzso sequence of rat zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso was obtained by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso terminal zzso Complete zzso was zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso obtained from rat kidney and zzso Two different transcripts (short and zzso stemming from the zzso of an internal region of 189 bases pair, corresponding to zzso 4 were zzso This alternative zzso seems to be specific of the zzso The long zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The short zzso encodes a protein of 497 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso Both of these zzso sequences contain the zzso and zzso sites and a zzso zzso zzso These sequences are 80 and zzso identical to the sequences of human and rabbit zzso By Northern zzso and/or zzso the zzso zzso zzso was detected in the rat zzso zzso and liver and the short form particularly in the zzso For the first time, the expression of zzso protein was zzso By Western zzso using the two different forms of zzso zzso a long zzso protein was detected in the rat zzso whereas in the rat brain, only the short form of zzso was zzso
