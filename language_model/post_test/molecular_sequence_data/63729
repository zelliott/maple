Human zzso zzso zzso is a critical target in cancer zzso Previous studies showed that an zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso region functions as a zzso zzso response zzso In this study, we further investigated the key elements contained within this sequence that are required for the zzso zzso protein zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments, we isolated a zzso sequence zzso corresponding to zzso zzso which bound with high affinity and specificity to human zzso to form a zzso zzso In zzso transient zzso experiments using a zzso reporter system revealed that zzso zzso could repress the zzso expression in a zzso manner when placed upstream of zzso zzso This work provides new insights into the essential molecular elements that mediate zzso zzso
