zzso relationships among temperate species of bamboo are difficult to resolve, zzso to both the challenge of detecting sufficiently variable markers and their zzso zzso Here, we use restriction zzso DNA sequencing to identify candidate zzso with fixed zzso differences segregating between and within two temperate species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 27 million zzso sequencing reads were generated across four zzso From pooled data, we assembled zzso and zzso de zzso zzso from partial overlap among zzso reads, with an average length of 240 and zzso for the two species, respectively, which were used to investigate functional zzso of zzso tags in a zzso zzso zzso separately by population, we recovered zzso zzso zzso zzso tags shared across the four sampled zzso containing zzso sequence zzso of which zzso zzso are segregating between species, and zzso zzso segregating between populations within each zzso zzso based on these zzso tags yielded robust zzso zzso even with data set constructed from surprisingly few zzso This study illustrates the potential for zzso zzso data to resolve difficult zzso relationships in temperate zzso
