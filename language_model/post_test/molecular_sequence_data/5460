We have cloned and zzso the red zzso zzso zzso of goat zzso zzso When zzso is expressed in cultured cells and zzso with zzso zzso the resulting visual zzso has a wavelength of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso This result and the deduced zzso sequence of the goat red zzso suggest that the zzso max values of the red zzso of goat and human are based mainly on zzso and zzso The slightly lower zzso max value of the red zzso in goat than in human zzso zzso zzso can be explained by a single zzso difference between the goat zzso and human zzso red zzso
