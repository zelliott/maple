Changes in near zzso circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso placed pairs of zzso zzso have been used to probe the roles of the zzso hairpin and the zzso hybrid in controlling intrinsic termination of zzso zzso zzso complexes were assembled directly by mixing zzso zzso acid scaffolds of defined sequence with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso immediately upstream of a zzso hybrid formed complexes of reduced stability, whereas the same zzso adjacent to a hybrid of zzso base pairs triggered complex zzso and transcript zzso zzso zzso at the upstream ends of the hairpin stems show that the zzso open on zzso binding and that stem zzso begins after one or two zzso bases on the downstream side of the stem have emerged from the zzso exit zzso zzso directly adjacent to the zzso hybrid weaken zzso zzso decrease zzso efficiency, and disrupt the upstream end of the hybrid as well as interfere with the movement of the template base at the zzso active zzso zzso the edges of the DNA zzso bubble demonstrates that termination zzso prevent zzso of the zzso suggesting that they zzso zzso the zzso to the zzso acid scaffold and, thus, hold the zzso hybrid zzso zzso At intrinsic zzso the weak zzso hybrid and the adjacent termination hairpin combine to destabilize the zzso complex sufficiently to permit significant transcript release, whereas zzso pausing provides time for the process to go to zzso
