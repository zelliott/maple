Advanced zzso end products zzso the final products of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are found in the plasma and accumulate in the zzso during aging and at an accelerated rate in zzso A novel integral membrane zzso termed zzso for zzso zzso forms a central part of the cell surface binding site for zzso Using zzso zzso zzso raised to human zzso and bovine zzso zzso of bovine zzso showed zzso in the zzso zzso and smooth muscle cells and in zzso cells in the zzso zzso with these data, zzso zzso and zzso were identified in cultured bovine zzso vascular smooth muscle, and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso in bovine cardiac zzso as well as in cultures of zzso rat cardiac zzso and in neural tissue where motor zzso peripheral nerves, and a population of cortical zzso were zzso In zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso and studies with rat zzso zzso indicated that they provide a zzso cell culture model for examining zzso zzso zzso studies of human zzso plaques showed zzso of zzso cells in the expanded zzso These results indicate that zzso is present in multiple zzso and suggest the potential relevance of zzso interactions for modulating properties of the zzso as well as neural and cardiac function, prominent areas of involvement in diabetes and in the normal aging zzso
