An important factor that defines the toxicity of elements such as zzso zzso and zzso with biological zzso is metal zzso exchange zzso zzso little is known about the fundamental rates and mechanisms of metal zzso exchange into zzso especially zzso zzso zzso we investigate the exchange zzso of zzso using de zzso designed zzso zzso peptides that contain metal zzso zzso zzso as a model for the incorporation of this zzso into zzso parallel coiled zzso zzso were designed containing both a single zzso binding site, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso with two zzso binding zzso The binding of zzso to any of these sites is of high affinity zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to these designed peptides was zzso While the zzso binding is in extreme slow exchange regime without showing any chemical shift changes, incremental line broadening for the bound zzso signal is observed when excess zzso is zzso into the zzso Most dramatically, for one site, zzso all zzso zzso signals disappear once a zzso ratio of zzso is zzso The observed processes are not compatible with a simple zzso zzso exchange zzso at any time zzso The experimental results can, however, be simulated in detail with a zzso binding model, which features additional zzso binding zzso which, once occupied, zzso the primary binding zzso This model is expanded into differential equations for zzso zzso chemical zzso The zzso integration of these equations exhibits progressive loss of the primary site zzso signal without a chemical shift change and with limited line zzso in good agreement with the observed experimental zzso The mathematical model is interpreted in molecular terms as representing binding of excess zzso to surface zzso zzso located at the zzso zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso zzso stabilize the zzso structure though salt bridge interactions with surface zzso zzso We zzso that zzso interferes with these surface zzso pairs, zzso the zzso structure, and zzso the primary zzso binding zzso This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the zzso line broadening is attenuated in zzso where a surface zzso close to the metal binding site, was changed to zzso The external binding site may function as an entry zzso for zzso to find its internal binding site following a molecular zzso which may serve as a basis for our understanding of metal zzso zzso and exchange in complex native systems containing zzso zzso
