Investigation of the potential association of single zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso with zzso to zzso associated cervical cancer in Indian zzso 

The study included 165 zzso confirmed cases with 45 zzso and 120 cancer patients and an equal number zzso of healthy controls with normal cervical zzso zzso was employed to analyze zzso promoter zzso which were confirmed by direct zzso Both patients and controls were screened for Human zzso zzso zzso 

The frequency of zzso A zzso in zzso was significantly higher in cases compared with control subjects zzso in cases zzso zzso in zzso zzso with an odds ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, women carrying A zzso for this locus presented 3 times increased zzso to zzso 16 infection as evident from carrier zzso distribution between zzso positive cases and control subjects zzso in zzso positive cases zzso zzso in zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No such association was found for zzso zzso zzso with the risk of development of cervical zzso 

It suggests that zzso at zzso zzso of zzso promoter may represent an increased risk for zzso infection and development of cervical cancer in Indian zzso
