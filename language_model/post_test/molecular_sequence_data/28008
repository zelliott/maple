zzso G is a zzso zzso zzso that is found in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso G gene is expressed at high levels in zzso zzso cells, but is zzso with zzso zzso To characterize the zzso sequences responsible for the regulated expression of this zzso we screened a human zzso zzso library using zzso G zzso and obtained two zzso clones that contained the zzso G zzso The zzso G gene spans zzso zzso pairs of zzso DNA and consists of 5 zzso and 4 zzso The zzso organization of zzso G is similar to that of human zzso zzso rat mast cell zzso II, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso located near the borders of zzso 2, 3, and zzso Using in zzso zzso techniques, we localized zzso G to zzso zzso a site that is near the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso G zzso is abolished in zzso zzso with 2 zzso zzso indicating that this gene is probably transcribed by zzso zzso zzso The zzso end of the zzso G gene was defined by primer extension and zzso zzso protection zzso A zzso box is found at position zzso and a zzso box is found at zzso with respect to the zzso initiation zzso Having defined the zzso structure and zzso location of zzso G, we are now attempting to identify the DNA elements in or near this gene that mediate its tissue and zzso pattern of zzso
