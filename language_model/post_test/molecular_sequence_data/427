zzso 1 zzso zzso gene plays a key role in determining coat color in several species, including the zzso However, up to now there is no report regarding the zzso gene and the potential association of its zzso with coat colors in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we zzso the zzso region of the zzso gene in three zzso breeds with completely white zzso zzso or black coat color zzso and zzso zzso The predicted coding region of the zzso zzso gene resulted of zzso zzso the same to that of the zzso cattle zzso with zzso zzso None of the zzso events reported in cattle was zzso Comparing the zzso obtained zzso five zzso zzso were zzso which defined three zzso zzso zzso and zzso Of the five zzso two, characterizing the zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso causing zzso acid changes located in the first zzso loop zzso and in the seventh zzso region zzso In zzso prediction might indicate a functional effect of the latter zzso However, all three zzso were present in the three zzso breeds with relatively consistent frequency distribution, despite of their distinguished coat colors, which suggested that there was no zzso association between zzso or zzso and zzso zzso at least in the investigated zzso Other genes may be involved in affecting coat color in the analyzed zzso
