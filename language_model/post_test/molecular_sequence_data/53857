The complete zzso sequence of putative zzso gene zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso strain zzso is zzso The coding region of the zzso zzso zzso which is preceded by zzso promoter elements zzso and zzso spans zzso zzso The zzso gene sequence codes for a putative zzso of zzso zzso acids and is interrupted by seven zzso The open reading frame sequence of the zzso gene shows strong zzso with those of other zzso zzso genes and encodes a protein with an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso The similarity between the zzso protein and other zzso zzso is from 45 to zzso with the region of highest conservation found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We compared the zzso of zzso activity and levels of gene expression in zzso zzso strain zzso grown on different carbon sources zzso zzso zzso and potato zzso and in various zzso stages zzso growth, zzso appearance, and zzso body zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso utilizing pairs of zzso specific for zzso gene expression shows that expression of zzso was induced by starch and increased during the process of zzso body formation, which indicates that zzso may play an important role in the zzso of the zzso zzso
