zzso of the zzso zzso which are essential constituents of the zzso plaques in Alzheimer's disease, involves the sequential zzso of the zzso precursor protein zzso by zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso which is liberated from zzso by zzso was used as a potential native zzso of the zzso With the addition of an zzso Met and a zzso sequence at the zzso zzso it was expressed in zzso coli under the control of the zzso zzso The preferred zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by potential zzso were rapidly identified using zzso zzso zzso mass zzso in addition to zzso mapping followed by protein sequence zzso Since zzso seem to be active at zzso zzso three zzso zzso E and zzso were selected for zzso Studies using different zzso indicated that the zzso preference of zzso D for the zzso is highly dependent on the zzso used to zzso this zzso All three zzso were found to be capable of zzso both zzso peptides and the zzso As zzso D was found to cleave the zzso in the vicinity of the zzso of the zzso peptides and zzso B has a high zzso activity at low zzso the possibility cannot be excluded that zzso D and B are involved in the zzso processing of zzso
