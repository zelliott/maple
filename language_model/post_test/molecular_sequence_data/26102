The major zzso components of the hair zzso are the hair zzso and zzso The hair zzso cells zzso and protect the zzso and undergo a different zzso program to that of the zzso We report the molecular characterization of a set of zzso zzso hair genes which are transcribed in the hair zzso late in zzso zzso Two genes were isolated and zzso one expressed in the human zzso and one in the sheep zzso Each gene encodes a small protein of 16 zzso containing greater than 50 zzso zzso ranging from 31 to 36 zzso zzso Their high zzso content and in zzso expression data identify them as zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted proteins are composed almost entirely of zzso and zzso zzso zzso blots reveal that the zzso zzso proteins are zzso by related zzso families in both the human and sheep zzso zzso in zzso zzso demonstrates that the expression of both genes is localized to the hair fiber zzso and occurs at a late stage in fiber zzso
