zzso is an zzso small zzso that is induced under zzso zzso stress in zzso zzso It forms a specific zzso zzso protein complex with zzso and zzso E resulting in zzso repression and rapid degradation of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Here, we report zzso zzso of zzso zzso in a defined in zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso and zzso are the minimum components for zzso zzso to faithfully reproduce the reaction in zzso We show that zzso base pairing is sufficient to cause zzso repression when the zzso zzso is forced to base pair with zzso without the help of zzso The extent of zzso repression zzso with the extent of duplex zzso We conclude that base pairing itself but not zzso is directly responsible for zzso zzso and the major role of zzso in gene zzso is to stimulate the base pairing between zzso and zzso zzso This simple mechanism is in striking contrast to zzso action in zzso in which the zzso is believed to act only as a guide of protein zzso
