zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso complex with at least two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This complex zzso the zzso zzso of complement zzso by binding to zzso structures present on bacteria, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are composed of modular structural motifs similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Another protein of 19 zzso with the same zzso sequence as the zzso zzso protein is consistently detected as part of the zzso zzso In this study, we present the primary structure of this novel zzso plasma protein of 19 zzso zzso and demonstrate that zzso and zzso are zzso by two different zzso species generated by alternative zzso from one structural zzso
