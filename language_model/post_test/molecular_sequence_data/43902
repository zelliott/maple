zzso an zzso protein containing one zzso and three zzso zzso is a common target for zzso by a variety of cell surface zzso The absence of a recognizable zzso domain of zzso suggests that zzso serves as a zzso zzso to couple cell surface receptors to downstream zzso molecules that regulate cellular responses induced by zzso zzso In this study, we isolated zzso zzso from mouse zzso by screening a phase expression library using zzso zzso zzso zzso which recognizes the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso from an extract of the zzso cell that had been infected with zzso zzso containing mouse zzso zzso The zzso protein exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 47 zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated in rabbits using zzso protein as an zzso The distribution of zzso protein in rat zzso examined by zzso showed that zzso is expressed widely, and that brain, zzso and tests contain more zzso than other zzso zzso
