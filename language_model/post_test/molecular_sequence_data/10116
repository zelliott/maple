Natural zzso ends are stabilized by proteins that bind duplex zzso DNA zzso In human cells, the zzso Repeat Factor 1 zzso was identified by two independent studies, one screening for factors that bind duplex zzso DNA and the other screening for proteins containing a particular zzso motif called the zzso which is required for zzso repeat recognition zzso zzso zzso zzso A second human open reading frame, zzso contains a zzso sequence and encodes a zzso that specifically recognizes zzso zzso repeat DNA in zzso We show that two proteins of 65 and 69 zzso expressed in zzso cells, contain the zzso zzso zzso These proteins are collectively termed zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso label the zzso of intact human zzso strengthening the correlation between occurrence of zzso and zzso recognition in zzso
