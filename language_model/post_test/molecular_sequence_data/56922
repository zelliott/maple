The complete zzso acid sequence of a 14 zzso structural protein zzso isolated from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso degradation of the intact protein and zzso derived zzso Plasma zzso and zzso mass zzso was used as an integrated part of the structure zzso zzso zzso has characteristics similar to proteins previously isolated from the zzso zzso The zzso acid composition shows a high content of zzso zzso and absence of the zzso acids zzso zzso Met, zzso and zzso The sequence has a central zzso region surrounded by two zzso regions with 7 repeats of a zzso zzso The conservation around the zzso zzso within this sequence motif is demonstrated for the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins from zzso zzso The zzso region of protein zzso is enriched in the zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso located in the zzso sequence zzso
