zzso is an zzso drug, which is a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is related to the stabilization of zzso complexes between zzso I and zzso The zzso and DNA sequence zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA breaks produced by zzso were determined in the zzso zzso DNA zzso was predominantly zzso and localized in selective regions of the zzso A major zzso site was found at zzso zzso on the coding strand in the early zzso zzso The DNA sequence was determined at prominent zzso sites zzso zzso and 199 in the two 72 zzso repeats and zzso zzso A DNA consensus sequence zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso occurred between the T and the G and zzso I was linked to the zzso zzso at the T zzso The sequence zzso is more frequent in the non transcribed strand of the early and late zzso of zzso than in the transcribed zzso This finding is consistent with the role of zzso I in zzso
