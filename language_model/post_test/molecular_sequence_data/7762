The zzso gene cluster on zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso are required for the metabolism of a number of foreign compounds, including the drugs zzso and zzso and are also thought to be involved in the metabolism of zzso steroid zzso Several different zzso zzso clones have been zzso however, the exact number of genes and the zzso arrangement of the zzso cluster have remained zzso Using a combination of zzso and restriction mapping to characterize zzso zzso we have constructed a zzso physical map that incorporates the zzso gene zzso The cluster spans approximately 500 zzso on zzso zzso and comprises four genes arranged in the order zzso The map also includes an adjacent zzso the serum zzso binding protein gene zzso The incorporation of zzso CA repeat genetic markers suggests the orientation of the zzso to be zzso zzso
