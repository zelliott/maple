The zzso zzso is most similar in primary sequence to the zzso zzso zzso and Ral zzso which regulate cell growth and differentiation in many cell zzso A likely zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which we designated zzso was identified by zzso zzso Our investigation of zzso showed that zzso cells arrested cell growth and division with a terminal zzso similar to that of zzso zzso In particular, cells depleted of zzso arrested as small, round cells with zzso DNA content, arrested more quickly in zzso zzso and induced expression of zzso and zzso zzso two zzso that were normally induced by nitrogen zzso Since zzso zzso binds and may regulate zzso a Ras zzso we tested for functional overlap between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso This analysis showed that zzso zzso did not suppress zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not suppress zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso double zzso had zzso equal to the sum of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso there is no evidence for overlapping functions between zzso and zzso On the basis of this study, we zzso that zzso zzso regulates entry into stationary phase when zzso nitrogen levels are adequate for zzso If this hypothesis is correct, then zzso and zzso regulate alternative responses to limiting zzso
