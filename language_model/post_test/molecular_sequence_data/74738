A bacterial strain, designated zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities, was isolated from zzso at a cattle farm near zzso Republic of zzso The strain comprised zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of an analysis of zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso position of zzso T was within the zzso zzso and the strain exhibited relatively high sequence similarities with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso OT zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso distance from other zzso species with zzso published names was greater than 3 % zzso less than zzso % sequence zzso zzso data also supported the zzso of strain zzso T within the zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso were the major fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were present in the polar zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that the values for zzso zzso between strain zzso T and the zzso closest zzso were below 23 zzso On the basis of its zzso properties and zzso zzso strain zzso T represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso
