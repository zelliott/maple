zzso are major zzso in colored grape zzso zzso zzso and most of them are zzso or zzso We report here the functional characterization of an zzso zzso zzso from zzso The expression pattern in two zzso with different zzso zzso profiles zzso and zzso showed a peak at start zzso zzso when the zzso of all zzso zzso begin to zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein was active on both zzso and zzso in zzso with zzso in the zzso range, and was dependent on zzso zzso for zzso zzso showed a preference for zzso zzso when a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso In order to assess its in zzso activity, we performed transient expression of zzso in tobacco zzso zzso leaves expressing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso factor from zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in leaves induced the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in an zzso of zzso zzso We also showed that zzso localized exclusively in the zzso of tobacco leaf zzso These results demonstrate the ability of this zzso to zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso indicating that zzso plays a major role in zzso zzso in grape zzso
