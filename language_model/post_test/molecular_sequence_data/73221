We determined the activity, content and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and copper zzso concentration in a Japanese pedigree of familial zzso lateral sclerosis zzso having two zzso deletion in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The activity and concentration of the zzso were low in red blood cells from the patients and the unaffected subjects with the zzso zzso The zzso activity stain and Western zzso analysis of the brain from one of the patients showed low zzso activity and the absence of the zzso zzso The zzso due to the zzso zzso gene was, however, zzso zzso of the copper zzso for zzso zzso DNA damage in the brain from the patient was zzso higher than those in the zzso We propose that the decrease of zzso activity and increased copper zzso play a role in the zzso death in this zzso
