Most small zzso in the factor VIII zzso gene that cause zzso A zzso are single zzso zzso resulting in zzso acid replacing zzso zzso and leading to various zzso ranging from mild to zzso We took a combined approach of zzso zzso and quantitative evaluation of evolutionary significance of zzso acid replacing zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso to assess their structural effects and significance of pathological zzso Comparative zzso models of all zzso acid zzso summarized in the zzso zzso database plus these identified and reported lately by us or by our collaborators were zzso zzso 640 zzso acid replacing zzso were scored for potential distant or local zzso changes, influence on the molecular stability and predicted contact zzso using available zzso domain zzso The average propensity to substitute zzso acid zzso by zzso was found comparable to the overall probability of de zzso zzso zzso changes reported with various zzso zzso were all confirmed significant using zzso The fraction of these, zzso zzso apparently involved in zzso zzso exceeds the average proportion of such zzso for zzso zzso contact zzso changed through zzso were zzso on the surface of zzso zzso and their possible functional implications were verified from the literature and are discussed considering available structural zzso Our zzso zzso adds on the current view of domain interface molecular zzso This structural insight could aid in part to the design of engineered zzso zzso for therapy, to possibly enhance their stability and prolong circulating zzso
