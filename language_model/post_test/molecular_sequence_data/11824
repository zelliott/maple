zzso of the zzso generating zzso zzso of zzso involves the assembly of a zzso complex and is dependent on the participation of the small molecular weight zzso protein zzso (1 or zzso This model system was used for mapping functional zzso in the primary sequence of zzso based on assessing the zzso effect of 90 individual overlapping zzso spanning the entire length of zzso on zzso zzso zzso in two types of zzso zzso Five functional zzso were identified, each consisting of a cluster of zzso zzso shared by members of five groups of overlapping zzso zzso Four of the five zzso are exposed on the molecular surface of zzso and were not identified previously by zzso zzso the fifth zzso to a zzso motif near the zzso zzso confirming earlier zzso zzso the entire linear sequence of a protein with a battery of overlapping peptides for interference with its ability to interact with upstream or downstream molecules should be of wide zzso as a reliable, fast, and economical method for mapping of functionally relevant zzso
