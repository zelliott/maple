zzso constitute a family of 3- to zzso zzso peptides that are stored in the zzso zzso of zzso some zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have assessed zzso gene expression during zzso differentiation by first characterizing zzso for each of the four known rat zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences revealed that the peptides are zzso as zzso zzso acid zzso each containing zzso zzso and mature zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not those for zzso and zzso or other zzso zzso contained unique zzso tracts located close to the termination zzso in the 3' untranslated zzso By using zzso zzso and/or zzso we evaluated zzso transcript levels in a variety of zzso and in the full spectrum of zzso zzso By in zzso zzso zzso zzso were localized to zzso precursors in the bone zzso with the highest zzso levels occurring in zzso and somewhat lower signals occurring in zzso and zzso zzso zzso were not zzso in bands or mature zzso nor at significant levels in zzso other than bone zzso The zzso of zzso protein in bone zzso cells was assessed by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein levels were then correlated for each stage of zzso differentiation to reveal the zzso profile of zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso
