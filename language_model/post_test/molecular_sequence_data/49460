The complete sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been determined and compared with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The sequence similarity clearly indicates zzso of the entire zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is very zzso most of the zzso regions are short zzso three are longer than 63 zzso and comprise only zzso of the zzso The zzso gene is zzso duplicated in zzso Long terminal zzso repeats and the zzso genes are undergoing concerted zzso There are 55 putative zzso three zzso zzso zzso eight transfer zzso zzso 22 proteins with zzso assigned functions and 22 additional open reading frames of unknown zzso In order to extend indications of zzso beyond zzso acid sequence similarity we have examined a number of zzso properties of the zzso zzso including theoretical zzso molecular weight and particularly the predicted zzso spanning zzso This approach has allowed us to identify zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
