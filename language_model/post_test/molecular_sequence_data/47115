We have developed a competitive zzso to measure the zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso are used, with zzso zzso as a detection zzso The zzso has a detection limit of 16 zzso and is precise zzso and day-to-day zzso zzso We used this zzso to determine steroid hormone activity of six steroids in cell culture, both in terms of time course and dose zzso zzso zzso in the tissue culture zzso of the zzso breast zzso cell line were significantly higher when zzso was the stimulating zzso There was a significant time course and dose response observed for zzso but not for the other zzso The availability of a sensitive, reliable, and convenient method for zzso zzso will allow for many research applications including the screening of natural and synthetic compounds for putative zzso zzso
