Gene transfer from the zzso to the nucleus, a process of outstanding importance to the evolution of the zzso cell, is an zzso phenomenon in higher zzso After transfer, the zzso gene has to be adapted to the nuclear context by acquiring a new promoter and targeting information to direct the protein back to the zzso To better understand the strategies developed by higher plants to transfer zzso genes during evolution, we investigated the fate of the zzso zzso locus in zzso While zzso zzso zzso does not contain zzso and zzso zzso wheat zzso DNA contains an intact zzso gene and a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and their transcripts are zzso In zzso the functional zzso gene is located in the nucleus, within the zzso of the respiratory complex II zzso zzso gene zzso Its organization and expression mechanisms are similar to those previously described in zzso and rice, allowing us to conclude that zzso transfer and nuclear zzso occurred before divergence of these zzso zzso we found evidence for a more recent zzso transfer to the nucleus in zzso This nuclear wheat zzso acquired its targeting information by zzso of an existing targeting zzso for another zzso zzso zzso protein zzso Thus, zzso and nuclear functional zzso genes appear to be maintained in zzso supporting the hypothesis that in an intermediate stage of the transfer process, both nuclear and zzso functional genes zzso Finally, we show that zzso has been independently transferred to the nucleus in the zzso lineage and has acquired regulatory elements for its expression and a zzso targeting zzso from an unknown zzso
