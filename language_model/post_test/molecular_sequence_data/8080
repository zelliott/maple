zzso of the zzso gene of zzso zzso is controlled at the level of transcript zzso In the zzso state, zzso possesses an zzso zzso II complex, zzso engaged, but paused early in the zzso zzso In this study, we have used a powerful new zzso technique to analyze the zzso transcripts associated with such zzso zzso under zzso shock and heat zzso zzso They reveal a region of pausing on the zzso gene in zzso spanning from zzso to zzso This region is interrupted by an area of low zzso density, centered at about zzso Upon zzso an zzso of short zzso similar in size to those associated with the paused complex, was zzso Models for zzso pausing and release are discussed in light of these zzso The increased sensitivity of our new technique also allowed us to investigate zzso complexes associated with genes with much lower levels of engaged zzso zzso These included two of the small heat shock genes zzso and zzso and two zzso genes zzso and zzso where paused zzso were thought to be present, plus two other genes zzso and zzso where zzso pausing has not been detected in the zzso In both of the small heat shock zzso we found evidence of previously unknown sites of zzso zzso residing immediately upstream of the regions of zzso zzso
