We present the sequence of 176 zzso of the zzso coli K-12 zzso from zzso at zzso to an open reading frame zzso of unknown function at zzso minutes on the genetic zzso This brings the total of zzso sequence from the zzso coli zzso project to 500 zzso zzso to zzso zzso This segment contains zzso putative coding genes zzso of which 66 genes were previously zzso Eight new zzso zzso and zzso identified as well as the previously mapped zzso and zzso zzso Still, 58 zzso remain unidentified despite literature and similarity zzso The arrangement of proposed genes relative to possible promoters and zzso suggests 55 potential zzso zzso Other features include 13 zzso zzso one zzso zzso zzso 59 zzso zzso 42 Chi sites and one new zzso zzso Sixteen signal peptides were found, including those of zzso zzso and zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located in this segment, so we have now zzso four of the seven zzso coli zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso reveals some differences in the zzso structural zzso which are generally compatible with the proposed secondary zzso
