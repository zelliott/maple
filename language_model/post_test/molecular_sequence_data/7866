The cellular zzso of experimental zzso zzso a model for multiple zzso has been zzso for the most part, using T cells directed to dominant zzso of the zzso zzso basic protein zzso To characterize T cells zzso to cryptic zzso of zzso we zzso Lewis rats with each of 17 overlapping peptides of the zzso zzso of rat zzso We found that, in addition to the known zzso zzso six other peptides induced active zzso in the majority the injected zzso T cell lines raised to six different zzso zzso were zzso upon adoptive transfer to zzso zzso In contrast to the T cells specific for the dominant zzso zzso the T cell lines zzso to cryptic zzso were not restricted in their zzso genes to V beta zzso and some of the lines caused prolonged zzso Thus, T cells of different zzso and zzso usage can be zzso
