A hybrid zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was produced by the construction of the expression zzso zzso This zzso contained the zzso gene as a selection marker, the zzso zzso promoter and zzso and the hybrid zzso heavy chain gene zzso with mouse zzso zzso gene zzso into its zzso zzso The expression zzso was zzso to the heavy chain loss zzso zzso cell zzso The hybrid protein zzso was zzso from zzso zzso using a zzso G zzso We showed that the hybrid protein retained the binding zzso for the zzso zzso as the original zzso zzso and the zzso capacity of the native zzso zzso zzso the zzso hybrid protein zzso may be very useful in cancer imaging when zzso with zzso such as zzso
