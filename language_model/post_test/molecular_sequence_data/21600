In the dairy cattle industry, zzso and Jersey are the breeds most commonly used for zzso They differ in performance by various traits, such as body size, milk production, and milk zzso With increased concerns about the impact of agriculture on climate change, potential differences in other traits, such as methane zzso also need to be characterized zzso Since methane is produced in the rumen by zzso zzso we investigated whether the population structure of zzso communities would differ between zzso and zzso zzso rumen zzso zzso zzso gene clone libraries were constructed from pooled zzso products obtained from zzso zzso and Jersey cows, generating 180 and 185 zzso zzso The combined 365 sequences were assigned to 55 zzso operational zzso units zzso Twenty zzso representing zzso of the combined library zzso were common to both breeds, while 23 zzso zzso zzso were found only in the zzso library and 12 zzso (18 zzso were found only in the Jersey library, highlighting increased diversity in the zzso zzso Other differences included the observation that sequences with zzso sequence identity to zzso zzso were represented more highly in the Jersey zzso while zzso sequences and novel zzso zzso clones were more frequent in the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso sequences with zzso sequence identity to zzso zzso were represented similarly in both zzso Since the sampled animals were from a single zzso consisting of two breeds which were fed the same diet and maintained under the same environmental conditions, the differences we observed may be due to differences in host breed zzso
