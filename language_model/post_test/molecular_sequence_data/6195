We constructed a zzso for the in zzso synthesis of a competitor zzso for use as an internal zzso control during reverse zzso zzso detection of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso The competitor zzso harbors a zzso deletion compared with zzso zzso zzso and generates a zzso product that is easily distinguished from the zzso zzso product by zzso gel zzso We encountered the problem of zzso formation during later stages of zzso which could be solved by decreasing the zzso cycle zzso This was accompanied by a significant loss of zzso zzso could be restored by using a novel and extremely sensitive DNA stain zzso Green I) instead of zzso zzso
