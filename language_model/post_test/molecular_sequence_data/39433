zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in plant cell metabolism by delivering reducing zzso to various essential zzso zzso zzso levels decrease under adverse environmental conditions in many zzso including zzso which share a common zzso with zzso zzso stress situations induce the synthesis of zzso zzso an electron carrier zzso not found in plants, which can efficiently replace zzso in most electron transfer zzso We report here that zzso zzso also declined in plants exposed to zzso or stress zzso A zzso zzso zzso was able to mediate plant zzso reactions in zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants expressing zzso in zzso displayed increased tolerance to multiple sources of stress, including zzso zzso extreme temperatures, high zzso water deficit, and zzso zzso zzso buildup and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were decreased in stressed plants expressing zzso zzso suggesting that development of the tolerant zzso relied on productive interaction of this zzso with zzso zzso pathways of the host, most zzso zzso zzso The use of zzso provides new tools to investigate the requirements of photosynthesis in zzso and to increase plant stress tolerance based on the introduction of a zzso product that is free from zzso regulation in higher zzso
