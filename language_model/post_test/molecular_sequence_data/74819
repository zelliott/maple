zzso is a ubiquitous and zzso zzso protein zzso that zzso more than 300 protein zzso at sites specified by an zzso consensus sequence in which positions zzso + 3 and zzso + 1 are particularly zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is known to rely on basic zzso located in the zzso site of the alpha zzso which make zzso contacts with the negative charges in the zzso consensus zzso thereby assuring optimal zzso the regulatory beta zzso is believed to play a protective and stabilizing zzso We describe a zzso and structural analysis of zzso zzso of a zzso synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso tail of the zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso demonstrate that this zzso still displays zzso features similar to full-length zzso and the zzso beta zzso also contributes to recognition of the protein zzso by establishing both polar and zzso interactions with specificity zzso located downstream from the zzso zzso In particular, the zzso domain of the beta zzso appears to be of crucial importance for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This domain includes an zzso cluster whose zzso contacts with basic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while strengthening zzso zzso
