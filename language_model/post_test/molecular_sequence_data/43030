Female sex determination in the germ line of zzso zzso is regulated by genes functioning in the zzso as well as genes that function within the germ zzso Genes known or suspected to be involved in zzso sex determination in zzso zzso have been examined to determine if they are required upstream or downstream of zzso a known zzso sex determination zzso Seven genes required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso are zzso These results together with information about the zzso in which these genes function and whether they control sex determination and viability or just sex determination in the germ line have been used to deduce the genetic hierarchy regulating female zzso sex zzso This hierarchy includes the zzso sex determination genes zzso zzso and zzso (and by zzso zzso which control a zzso signal required for female zzso sex determination, and the zzso zzso tumor genes zzso zzso zzso zzso sans zzso and zzso which are involved in either the reception or interpretation of this zzso sex determination zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and sans zzso genes function upstream of zzso in the germ zzso
