The zzso type zzso pump of zzso zzso has a zzso zzso zzso center that is peripheral to the zzso zzso present in this domain include the well characterized zzso A, B, C, D, zzso and zzso zzso a zzso composed of 50- and zzso zzso and zzso termed G and zzso Of these, zzso A, B, C, and E have been shown to be necessary but not sufficient for significant zzso zzso in addition, either zzso G or H is also required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso G and H were zzso and directly zzso zzso molecular analysis has revealed that these proteins are zzso which we designate zzso and zzso The zzso zzso the rat and bovine brain and chicken zzso forms of zzso have been zzso The open reading frames of the rat and bovine clones zzso zzso proteins of 118 zzso acids that differ at only five zzso bovine zzso has zzso identity with zzso a component of the zzso channel of zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso pair transcript zzso zzso in bovine brain, zzso heart, and zzso The zzso zzso bovine zzso H was cloned and zzso revealing this protein to be zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso In Northern zzso analysis, a single zzso zzso pair transcript zzso with a probe to zzso in brain, but not in heart, zzso or zzso An zzso against a bovine zzso domain zzso with V pump from bovine brain, zzso and zzso zzso whereas an zzso zzso zzso only with zzso pump from zzso The bovine forms of zzso and zzso were subsequently expressed in zzso coli and zzso cells, respectively, and zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso was achieved by combination of zzso zzso A, B, C, and E with either zzso zzso or zzso demonstrating the role of these zzso in pump zzso
