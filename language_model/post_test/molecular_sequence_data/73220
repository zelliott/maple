The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is involved in zzso and DNA zzso break zzso Recently, mouse and human zzso of the zzso zzso gene have been zzso Here we present the zzso organization of the mouse zzso zzso It consists of 12 zzso ranging in size from 67 to 374 zzso spread over a region of approximately 18 zzso The first zzso is located in zzso zzso Analysis of the promoter region revealed no classical promoter elements such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso mapping analysis revealed one major zzso start zzso zzso to the situation in zzso zzso of the zzso gene in human skin zzso and mouse zzso cells was not induced by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, no specific zzso in human zzso expression levels throughout the cell cycle was zzso
