zzso zzso found in all zzso zzso associate with zzso DNA between adjacent zzso presumably to keep the zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The identification of multiple zzso zzso zzso in zzso suggests these proteins have specialized roles in zzso organization and thus influence the regulation of gene expression in the zzso zzso The mechanism by which the association of zzso with zzso DNA is regulated is not completely zzso but affinity for different DNA sequences may play a zzso Here we report that a specific zzso zzso in the zzso namely zzso selectively binds to a regulatory element within the zzso sequence of a zzso mouse zzso zzso We have previously shown that this coding region element, zzso is the target of very specific interactions in zzso with another nuclear factor called the zzso zzso This element is required for normal gene expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso The mouse zzso protein interacts poorly zzso lower zzso with the comparable zzso sequence of a zzso mouse zzso zzso This zzso sequence differs at only 4 out of 22 zzso positions from the zzso zzso Our findings raise the possibility that this zzso protein plays a specific role in regulation of expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso
