Based on zzso zzso zzso and zzso characters, two major groups of zzso zzso can be zzso zzso and zzso Through the sequencing of zzso zzso we show here that, interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have a different stop zzso zzso In fact, the stop zzso usage of the former species resembles that of zzso This unexpected result is used to discuss the origin and acquisition of genetic code zzso in zzso
