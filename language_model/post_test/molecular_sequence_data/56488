Although zzso cells are a major target of zzso zzso action, the activity of the various protein zzso C zzso zzso have not been studied in detail in human zzso zzso of the zzso human zzso cell line by zzso zzso is accompanied by a twofold increase in zzso zzso Since zzso is a zzso family, we investigated which zzso were expressed in control and differentiated cells, and which of these zzso is involved in zzso zzso We found that: zzso zzso activity is higher in differentiated than in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed the expression of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the absence of zzso for beta in zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso evaluation with zzso zzso zzso showed the same pattern of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was significantly enhanced by zzso zzso while the other zzso were not zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso or zzso acid induced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso while zzso of cell proliferation by fetal calf serum zzso was without zzso These findings suggest that expression of zzso zzso zzso is tightly coupled with zzso differentiation and may play a role in the maintenance of the differentiated zzso
