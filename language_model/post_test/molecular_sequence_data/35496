The zzso functions of zzso remain enigmatic, but the central domain, zzso highly zzso regions of the protein may play an important zzso Indeed, a large number of studies indicate that synthetic peptides containing zzso zzso zzso located in the central domain zzso zzso of zzso are zzso The central domain comprises two chemically distinct zzso the charge cluster zzso zzso and a zzso region zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to establish the individual zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Our results show that only the CD zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Atomic Force zzso experiments demonstrated that the CD zzso is able to activate zzso and disrupt the cell zzso leading to cell zzso
