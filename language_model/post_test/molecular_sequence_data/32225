The zzso escape of zzso from established zzso responses is becoming zzso However, it is not yet clear whether zzso variations of zzso may have an additional effect on the differential zzso effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso we characterized zzso zzso responses toward zzso zzso and zzso optimal zzso presented by zzso during a chronic phase of zzso zzso We found zzso escape zzso within Pol and zzso zzso that affected recognition by zzso although there was no zzso within the zzso zzso An analysis of zzso zzso complexes revealed that zzso T cells exclusively specific for the zzso zzso were generated following domination by the zzso zzso The zzso cells were capable of killing target cells and producing zzso zzso but showed impaired zzso proliferation ex zzso whereas zzso specific cells had potent zzso Moreover, zzso zzso T cells specific for the Pol zzso showed diminished zzso whereas zzso ones had no functional zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso variations that abolished zzso recognition not only resulted in escape from established zzso responses but also eventually generated another subset of zzso zzso having decreased zzso activity, causing an additional negative effect on zzso immune responses during a chronic zzso zzso
