zzso zzso activities have been reported for small and large molecular complexes of heat shock protein 27 zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and chemical zzso we show here that Chinese zzso zzso is expressed in cells as zzso zzso ranging from zzso up to zzso zzso zzso with zzso which zzso zzso on zzso and zzso provoked a major change in the size distribution of the complexes that shifted from zzso to zzso zzso zzso was sufficient and necessary for causing this change in zzso zzso formation was severely inhibited by replacing zzso with zzso but not by replacing zzso with zzso Using the zzso zzso system, two zzso were identified that were responsible for zzso zzso zzso One domain was insensitive to zzso and corresponded to the zzso zzso zzso The other domain was sensitive to zzso 90 zzso and was located in the zzso region of the zzso Fusion of this zzso domain to zzso zzso zzso zzso with the capacity to form zzso that zzso into zzso upon zzso A deletion within this domain of zzso zzso which contains a zzso motif found in most proteins of the small heat shock protein family, yielded a protein that forms only zzso zzso We propose that zzso forms stable zzso through the zzso zzso These zzso further zzso through zzso interactions zzso by the zzso zzso zzso
