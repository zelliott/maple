zzso (or zzso activates the receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso to induce zzso in zzso but only zzso mediates zzso and zzso zzso This may be due to the rapid zzso of zzso To investigate the roles of the zzso zzso in zzso regulation, zzso zzso zzso and zzso tail zzso deletion zzso of both receptors were expressed in zzso cells and studied for cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso All but one zzso zzso bound zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso and zzso Upon zzso zzso the zzso receptors underwent zzso zzso and zzso One was resistant to zzso yet it zzso normal levels of zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso The lack of zzso by this zzso may be due to its reduced association with beta zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso receptors were resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso They also zzso greater zzso zzso and zzso and sustained zzso zzso but diminished zzso These data indicate that zzso of the zzso of zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso and zzso but are not sufficient to explain the rapid zzso of zzso relative to zzso The data also show that zzso zzso is not required for zzso The lack of zzso zzso was correlated with greater signal zzso but diminished zzso indicating that second zzso production, not zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso
