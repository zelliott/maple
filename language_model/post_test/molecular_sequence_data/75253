zzso clones zzso the entire coding region for human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been isolated from a human liver zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the largest clone consisted of zzso base pairs and contained a zzso open reading frame that encodes a precursor zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso The first zzso acid zzso of the open reading frame probably zzso to a typical zzso import leader zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the mature zzso starting at the zzso number 36 of the open reading frame, is almost identical zzso than zzso zzso with the known partial zzso acid sequence of the pig heart zzso zzso The zzso clone also contains a 3' untranslated region of zzso bases with an unusual zzso signal zzso and a short zzso zzso By zzso analysis with the zzso as probe, two zzso zzso and zzso zzso in size, have been detected in human zzso and zzso whereas only one zzso zzso zzso was detected in rat zzso
