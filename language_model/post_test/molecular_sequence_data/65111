zzso proteins zzso are zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso which convey zzso to their zzso zzso We compared the binding properties of a zzso rat zzso zzso using a set of six zzso of various chemical zzso We examined the binding properties by both fluorescent probe competition and zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity constants, in the zzso range, varied by more than one order of magnitude and were roughly correlated to the zzso zzso The observed binding zzso was found to be around one zzso per zzso Using zzso differential zzso the binding of zzso was shown to induce local zzso zzso A three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso using the known structure of zzso as template, allowed us to suggest the location of the observed structural changes outside of the binding zzso These results are consistent with one binding site located in one of the two zzso of the zzso zzso and a subtle zzso change correlated with binding of an zzso zzso which zzso zzso of a second zzso by the other zzso zzso
