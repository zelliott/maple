zzso processing plays a critical role in the replication of zzso regulated in part through the action of host zzso zzso To explore the impact of modulating zzso protein activity on virus zzso the effect of increasing or zzso the activity of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso protein zzso on zzso expression and zzso processing was zzso 

Despite their high zzso increasing individual zzso expression had distinct effects on zzso zzso enhancing zzso production while zzso inhibited the zzso Parallel studies on the zzso activity of zzso zzso revealed a similar zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso 2 and 4, had no effect on viral zzso synthesis while zzso a zzso 3 and 4 zzso blocked virus zzso zzso treatment altered viral zzso processing, decreasing levels of zzso and single spliced viral zzso and reduced Rev zzso zzso experiments in the context of zzso replication in zzso confirmed the capacity of zzso to suppress virus zzso 

Together, these findings establish that zzso zzso processing can be targeted to suppress virus replication as demonstrated by manipulating individual zzso function and identified zzso as a lead compound in the development of novel zzso zzso
