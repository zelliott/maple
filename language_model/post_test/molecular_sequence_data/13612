zzso genes zzso the 190 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso II zzso and the closely related zzso zzso zzso have been zzso in a zzso zzso Initially, a partial gene zzso zzso acids zzso was constructed in fusion with the zzso half of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The remaining zzso gene sequence was replaced during the assembly of the coding sequence for zzso acids zzso zzso of the synthetic genes in zzso coli yielded zzso zzso with specific activity generally identical with the natural zzso However, the zzso zzso showed zzso and temperature optimum lower than those of the natural zzso thus indicating that the zzso modifications of the latter in its zzso host are essential to its greater zzso A zzso zzso further decreased the zzso of the zzso zzso
