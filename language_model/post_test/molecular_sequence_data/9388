zzso zzso maturation proteins zzso bind zzso destined for zzso across the bacterial zzso membrane via the zzso zzso system and enable the zzso incorporation of complex zzso Most zzso recognize one specific zzso The recognition site usually resides in the zzso signal zzso zzso binding protects signal peptides against degradation by zzso zzso are also believed to prevent binding of immature zzso to the zzso The main aim of this work was to better understand the interaction between zzso and zzso signal zzso Two zzso were zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso Green fluorescent protein zzso was genetically fused behind the signal sequences of zzso and zzso This ensures native behavior of the respective signal sequence and excludes any effects zzso by the mature domain of the zzso Surface zzso resonance analysis revealed that these zzso zzso specifically bind to the zzso zzso Furthermore, the region of the signal sequence that is responsible for specific binding to the corresponding zzso was identified by creating zzso zzso signal zzso containing parts of both the zzso and zzso signal zzso Surprisingly, specificity is not zzso in the highly variable positively charged zzso region of the signal zzso but in the more similar zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, binding of zzso to its model zzso reduced membrane binding of the zzso This property could link zzso zzso binding to its reported zzso zzso
