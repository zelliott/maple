zzso and zzso constitute two respective zzso in the family zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso birds, and zzso and have a zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso fish and have a zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso Despite these differences, recent structural and zzso sequence evidence indicate that the proteins of zzso and zzso share many zzso The focus of this review is on the structure and function of the zzso core proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso for which X-ray crystal structures have been recently zzso The zzso core proteins in zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso By mapping the locations of zzso zzso onto the zzso crystal structures, we have found that zzso surfaces involved in zzso synthesis are well zzso between these two groups of zzso whereas several surfaces involved in zzso interactions are not well zzso Other evidence indicates that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins are zzso suggesting that zzso is a core protein as zzso is known to zzso These findings provide further evidence that zzso and zzso have zzso from a common zzso and contribute to a growing understanding of the functions of the core proteins in viral zzso zzso
