The effects of the zzso hormone zzso zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso which is a member of the zzso zzso zzso Defining differences between the binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso at the molecular level, is of fundamental importance to understanding zzso zzso and to rational drug zzso Previous reports have indicated that the zzso of the zzso is required for OT zzso The aim of this study was to identify which individual zzso within the zzso domain of the human zzso provided these OT binding zzso A series of truncated zzso and zzso zzso zzso with systematic zzso substitution were characterized with respect to their pharmacological profile and zzso signaling zzso Although a number of zzso within the zzso will be required for optimal zzso interaction, our data establish that zzso within the zzso domain contributes to zzso OT zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or substitution resulted in a zzso decrease in OT zzso In addition, we show that the zzso at this locus is required for zzso binding of zzso in zzso However, the importance of zzso is restricted to zzso interaction with the zzso as it was not required for binding zzso zzso or zzso zzso It is noteworthy that the corresponding zzso in the related rat zzso zzso zzso is also required for zzso zzso zzso This study zzso at the molecular level, the role of the zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso binding and identifies a key zzso for this zzso
