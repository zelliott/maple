The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso of the zzso coli zzso protein was localized upstream of the gene cluster that encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso that are supposed to be the zzso of the zzso zzso cluster in zzso zzso another zzso zzso regulator in zzso zzso does zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso single and double zzso revealed that the two regulators each exert exclusive control on the expression of a discrete set of target zzso In zzso zzso the expression of zzso c zzso was zzso that of zzso nitrate zzso and the zzso zzso was significantly reduced, whilst the activity of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso The amounts of the zzso and zzso oxide zzso in these zzso zzso were the same as in the wild zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, were disturbed exclusively in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso An zzso double zzso combined the zzso of the single zzso zzso In all three zzso the zzso and/or activities of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nitrous oxide zzso zzso those in the wild zzso As the zzso boxes in front of the zzso and zzso genes are highly similar to or even identical to each other, the absence of zzso between the regulation by zzso and zzso implies that as yet unidentified factors are important in the zzso It is proposed that the zzso state of an zzso zzso couple other than the zzso couple is one of the factors that zzso the activity of zzso
