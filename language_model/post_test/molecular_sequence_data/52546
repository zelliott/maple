The unfolding and zzso zzso of potato zzso inhibitor zzso were investigated using the technique of zzso zzso In the presence of zzso and zzso zzso the native zzso zzso by zzso its native zzso bonds and converts to form a mixture of scrambled zzso that consists of 9 out of a possible 14 zzso The zzso curve is determined by the fraction of native zzso converted to scrambled zzso under increasing zzso of zzso The concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso required to zzso 50% of the native zzso was found to be zzso zzso and 8 zzso zzso The zzso unfolding curve was constructed through the analysis of structures of scrambled zzso that were zzso under increasing zzso of zzso These results reveal the existence of structurally defined unfolding zzso and a progressive expansion of the zzso zzso The yield of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as a fraction of total zzso zzso was shown to be directly zzso to the strength of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso sequence was unable to fold zzso into a single native zzso Under zzso conditions, the scrambled zzso of zzso that constitute about zzso of the protein were in equilibrium with native zzso
