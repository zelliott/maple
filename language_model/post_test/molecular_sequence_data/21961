zzso zzso initiate zzso by binding to the zzso zzso zzso the specialized zzso zzso of their zzso zzso zzso occupying two highly zzso zzso zzso sites zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso designated zzso were previously implicated in this zzso However, recent zzso analyses confirm that neither site is occupied, zzso that an alternate zzso domain may be operational in native zzso Since human zzso zzso can substitute for zzso in rescue mice to mediate zzso zzso the site specificity of zzso in both native zzso and zzso was analyzed using zzso mass zzso zzso Two zzso sites in native zzso one at zzso and the other within the zzso at positions zzso zzso are zzso in zzso derived from transgenic zzso Thus, there is a specific zzso domain within native zzso expressing two closely spaced zzso that is very well zzso in an zzso related zzso In native zzso core 2 zzso predominate at both zzso However, in zzso derived from rescue mice, the zzso associated with zzso zzso to zzso in zzso are exclusively core 1 and related zzso zzso whereas core 2 zzso predominate at the other zzso zzso This unique restriction of zzso expression suggests that sequence differences in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso affect the ability of core 2 zzso to extend the core 1 zzso However, this difference in zzso at zzso does not affect the fertility or the zzso binding zzso of eggs derived from female zzso rescue zzso
