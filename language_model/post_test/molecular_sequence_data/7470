We have previously demonstrated that at birth most productive zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice zzso a zzso acid zzso and that a significant fraction of the expected repertoire is zzso We have now examined the adult zzso zzso repertoire involving all four zzso gene segments in both zzso and zzso Of the 74 P zzso zzso from these zzso 67 zzso a zzso of ten zzso acids and include a zzso in the fourth position zzso zzso Most of these zzso appear to derive from zzso zzso B cells, which also have a zzso zzso since few zzso P zzso were present in zzso cells depleted of zzso B zzso Thus, the zzso B cell repertoire in adult mice is largely restricted to the use of a single zzso motif and to a single zzso zzso This bias results from two selection events: zzso selective exclusion of most zzso B cells from the peripheral repertoire, and zzso zzso expansion in the periphery of zzso B cells that have a zzso zzso and bind zzso Analysis of zzso zzso in viable zzso zzso mice, which have an abnormal B cell repertoire due to a defective zzso zzso and have barely zzso numbers of zzso B cells, indicates that selective exclusion of zzso B cells from the peripheral repertoire occurs zzso but that zzso expansion of zzso zzso B cells is zzso This is evidence that the selective exclusion of zzso B cells from the peripheral repertoire and the zzso expansion of zzso B cells with a zzso zzso are due to independent signaling zzso
