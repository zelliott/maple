Six strains isolated from fermented food were identified as zzso species by zzso zzso sequencing, zzso with the species pair zzso zzso zzso The strains were zzso for growth on zzso zzso and zzso zzso All strains were zzso positive using the zzso zzso 50 zzso Growth on zzso was observed for strains 85, 92, 145 and zzso zzso by optical density zzso in zzso plates and zzso in batch cultures also confirming zzso decrease in zzso Analysis of zzso before and after growth established consumption in the zzso range in the four zzso zzso zzso were consumed simultaneously with zzso while zzso was consumed after zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was detected in the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso data suggests this activity to be linked with genes zzso zzso zzso from family 3, 8 or zzso No zzso activity was zzso Major end products were zzso and zzso A higher ratio of zzso acid to zzso acid was obtained during growth on zzso compared with growth on zzso This is the first report on zzso of zzso in zzso indicating an increased zzso potential for zzso strains from the species pair zzso zzso zzso but also showing that zzso zzso is strain dependent for these zzso
