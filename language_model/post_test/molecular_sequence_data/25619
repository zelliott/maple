We have developed a zzso chain reaction zzso procedure to facilitate the selection of zzso zzso The insert to be cloned is zzso to an zzso resistance zzso The zzso product is amplified by zzso followed by standard cloning procedure into a bacterial zzso The selection for the zzso resistance coded by the zzso product ensures zzso zzso frequency, eliminating the screening of the zzso
