The aim of this study was the isolation and characterization of the zzso bacteria inhabiting the leaves of transgenic white zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso engineered with the zzso gene for the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso are available in small amounts from natural sources or by expensive chemical synthesis zzso An alternative approach for the large-scale production of these relevant pharmaceuticals is the use of transgenic plants as zzso although the occurrence of novel molecules in plants growing under field conditions might zzso to some extent, with the associated microbial zzso Both zzso and zzso were isolated from the leaves of 2 zzso transgenic lines producing zzso zzso and from an zzso plant line grown in a zzso Eleven zzso were recovered and classified as members of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In addition, 2 zzso were classified as members of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to hydrogen zzso zzso and zzso was zzso as were the swimming and swarming zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso recovered from transgenic zzso showed the ability to withstand zzso stress compared with zzso recovered from the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso inhibited both the swarming and swimming zzso in all the tested zzso The effects of zzso on zzso production, required for zzso were also investigated by zzso zzso
