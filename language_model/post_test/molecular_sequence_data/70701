We recently isolated a novel zzso filament zzso zzso zzso that has two zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso expressed and specifically localized at zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and at zzso zzso junction zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso is abundantly expressed in neural zzso zzso has one zzso domain, three zzso regions, and one zzso domain, whereas zzso lacks the third zzso region and the zzso zzso To understand the molecular mechanism of the specific zzso of zzso at zzso in zzso cells and at zzso zzso in zzso cells, we attempted here to identify an zzso zzso and isolated a zzso named zzso zzso had many zzso zzso and the primary structures of two of them were zzso Both the two zzso had three zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso and turned out to be zzso zzso of zzso The third zzso region of zzso bound to the region of zzso containing the second and third zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed and localized at zzso in zzso cells, at zzso zzso in zzso cells, and at zzso zzso in both types of zzso zzso zzso directly bound zzso an zzso protein localized at zzso in zzso cells, at zzso zzso in zzso cells, and at zzso zzso in both types of zzso zzso has one zzso region where two zzso sequences are zzso The zzso region bound to the region of zzso containing the first and second zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound to zzso in a competitive manner and these three proteins hardly formed a zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is an zzso and zzso protein localized at zzso in zzso cells, at zzso zzso in zzso cells, and at zzso zzso in both types of zzso
