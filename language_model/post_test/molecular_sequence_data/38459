The utility of sequence zzso in the dense zzso zzso zzso gene as typing markers for zzso zzso was zzso The coding region of zzso was zzso zzso and compared for 30 zzso strains from eight different zzso zzso zzso alignment identified zzso zzso at 24 positions out of zzso zzso which correlated with zzso zzso I, II, and III could be distinguished from each other on the basis of three, 10, and six variable positions, zzso Two deletions of 15 zzso and 3 zzso existed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso With one exception, all zzso positions resulted in zzso acid zzso and the two gaps of 15 zzso and 3 zzso caused the deletion of six zzso acids in type II zzso zzso zzso were also found in the virulent zzso A high degree of sequence zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso strains points to the zzso gene being a good marker for strain zzso and typing of the zzso of this zzso The large variety of zzso acid changes supports the view that the zzso protein plays an important role in the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The existence of zzso restriction sites for zzso zzso was used to develop a zzso method which could simply differentiate the three different groups zzso I, II, zzso of zzso zzso
