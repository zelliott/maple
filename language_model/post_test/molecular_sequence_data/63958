The zzso zzso domain of the membrane copper zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli as an zzso soluble protein with no significant secondary zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso bound four zzso zzso structurally identified as a zzso cluster by zzso zzso zzso This was the only zzso form detected by zzso zzso mass zzso An average zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for binding of zzso to zzso was estimated via competition with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments for the zzso zzso zzso and an zzso domain of the zzso zzso pump zzso which both bind a single zzso zzso provided similar zzso zzso The estimates of zzso were supported by independent estimates of the equilibrium zzso zzso for exchange of zzso between pairs of these three zzso It is apparent that, in zzso the three proteins buffer zzso zzso zzso in a narrow range around zzso zzso The results provide quantitative support for the proposals that, in zzso zzso zzso copper zzso are very low in the zzso and zzso the zzso trafficking zzso is shallow along the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, both zzso and its zzso zzso factor zzso contain similar clusters which may be important in signaling copper status in zzso
