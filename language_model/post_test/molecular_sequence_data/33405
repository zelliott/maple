zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly infectious for humans via zzso route and zzso infections with the highly virulent zzso zzso can be zzso Our knowledge regarding key zzso zzso has increased recently but is still somewhat zzso Surface proteins are potential zzso factors and therapeutic targets, and in this study, we decided to target three genes zzso putative membrane zzso in zzso zzso zzso One of the genes zzso a protein with high zzso to the protein family of zzso zzso zzso The two other genes zzso proteins with zzso to the zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso was verified to be required for survival and replication in zzso and zzso also for in zzso zzso in the mouse infection model for zzso Using a combination of classical and shotgun zzso zzso we were able to identify several proteins that accumulated in zzso enriched for zzso proteins in the zzso zzso These proteins are zzso candidates for the zzso zzso zzso as well as being responsible for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
