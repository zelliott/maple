zzso family proteins are known as synaptic zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the complete zzso sequence and organization of the rat zzso The rat zzso cluster encodes 15 variable and 3 constant zzso The zzso organizations of the zzso zzso and human zzso are zzso The percentage identity of the coding regions between the rat and the mouse is zzso on average at the zzso acid level, and between rat and human it is zzso The rat zzso zzso also contain an zzso motif in the zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso repeats that are characteristic of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The number of variable zzso in the rat zzso cluster is identical to that of the zzso The rat zzso cluster has one more variable zzso than is found in laboratory mouse zzso because in the mouse a variable zzso located between zzso and zzso is divided by the zzso of a zzso This zzso is not disrupted in the zzso in which it is zzso By in zzso analysis, zzso was also mapped to rat zzso 18, but the orientation was opposite for the mouse zzso gene zzso The relative expression profiles of the rat zzso zzso show that all the zzso are zzso but there are variations in the expression ratios among the zzso
