Our objective was to investigate the presence of a B and T cell immune response directed against the zzso cell wall protein zzso in patients with different zzso disorders and with food zzso zzso is an ubiquitous food protein that has high zzso with zzso and other self proteins zzso virus nuclear zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso which are common targets in zzso zzso A zzso zzso derived from zzso was used to screen human zzso in direct and competitive zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed for their ability to zzso with zzso The zzso zzso profiles of the zzso T cell clones obtained from representative patients have been zzso zzso mice were zzso with the zzso coupled to the carrier protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso were detected in several zzso disorders and in food allergic patients, and were able to zzso with zzso including zzso collagen and zzso Twenty-five T cell clones showed a specific zzso response to the zzso zzso and were of the zzso zzso Eight of the 10 zzso mice zzso with the zzso coupled to zzso developed an zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso highly zzso zzso in plants, viruses and humans may be responsible for an zzso response in susceptible zzso They also indicate that the zzso spreading of a particular sequence among apparently divergent proteins may participate to initiate or amplify an immune zzso
