We have identified a zzso gene that has substantial sequence zzso to a distinct class of zzso that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso It has predicted zzso or zzso zzso exchange factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso immediately downstream of the zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso thus zzso the target zzso zzso et zzso zzso Trends zzso zzso 20, zzso Members of the zzso zzso regulate organization of the zzso zzso which controls the zzso zzso and zzso of cells zzso et zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso 225 zzso Ridley and Hall (1992) Cell 70, zzso Ridley et zzso (1992) Cell 70, zzso zzso from this gene is found throughout zzso and zzso Of particular interest, message is most abundant in zzso and folds of the zzso where cell shapes are changing and the zzso is likely to be undergoing zzso
