zzso global influenza migration and persistence is crucial for vaccine strain zzso Using 240 new human influenza A virus whole zzso collected in Vietnam during zzso we looked for persistence patterns and migratory connections between Vietnam and other zzso We found that viruses in Vietnam migrate to and from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, zzso Japan, South Korea, and the United zzso We attempted to reduce geographic bias by generating zzso zzso at the year and country zzso However, migration events in these zzso were still driven by the presence or absence of sequence data, indicating that an zzso study design that controls for prevalence is required for robust migration zzso With zzso data, most migration events are not zzso from the zzso of the zzso segment alone, although general migratory relationships between Vietnam and other countries are visible in the zzso zzso It is possible that virus lineages in Vietnam persisted for zzso zzso
