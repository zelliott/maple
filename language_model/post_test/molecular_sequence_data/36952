We studied the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso targeted to the primer binding site (PBS) of zzso zzso inhibited viral zzso The zzso only occurred when the cells had been zzso in the presence of the zzso The PBS sequence is involved in reverse zzso and in zzso The data suggest that the zzso could zzso reverse zzso zzso Thus, either the zzso induced a decrease in initiation or it inhibited the extension of the minus or plus strands DNA during reverse zzso These results show that reverse zzso may be an interesting target for zzso zzso
