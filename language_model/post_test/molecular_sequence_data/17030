It is generally assumed that there are only two ways to maintain the ends of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Without zzso and zzso cells enter zzso a state of permanent growth zzso We found that the decisive role in preventing zzso budding zzso cells from dividing is played by the zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso can resume cell cycle zzso despite degradation of zzso regions from many zzso As degradation zzso toward internal zzso regions, a progressive decrease in viability would be expected, caused by loss of essential zzso However, this was not the zzso We demonstrate that extensive degradation and loss of essential genes can be efficiently prevented through a zzso mechanism of DNA zzso repair, in which short DNA zzso induce formation of large DNA zzso For the first time, we show that large zzso form as a natural consequence of zzso growth and that they become essential for zzso in the absence of zzso zzso
