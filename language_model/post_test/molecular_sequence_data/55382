High zzso concentration contained in wastewater zzso the activity of zzso in biological wastewater treatment systems such as activated sludge and methane zzso To reduce the zzso effects, zzso capable of efficiently degrading edible oils were screened from various environmental zzso From Japanese soil, we isolated 2 bacteria strains with high degradation abilities at an alkaline pH without consumption of biological oxygen demand zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, of 3,000 zzso of mixed oil consisting of salad zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and pH zzso in 24 zzso zzso degradation by the two strains occurred at pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso lipids even at pH zzso The degradation rate of 3,000 zzso of salad oil, zzso and beef zzso by strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, during a zzso zzso The degradation rate of 3,000 zzso of salad oil, zzso and beef zzso by strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, during a zzso zzso After mixed oil degradation by both zzso the zzso value of the cell culture increased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso The fact that neither strain zzso zzso ingredients will be beneficial to zzso of methane zzso systems such as zzso zzso sludge blanket zzso In addition, the growth of usual zzso zzso utilizing soluble zzso can be suppressed under alkaline zzso
