zzso zzso sequence zzso elements behave like zzso in terms of their ability to invade and zzso in microbial gene pools and like zzso when they zzso with their bacterial zzso Here we investigated the evolutionary history of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso a genetically diverse gastric zzso These elements contain unrelated zzso genes zzso and also a zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso A total of zzso East Asian, Indian, zzso and Spanish zzso were screened, and 18 and zzso of them zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis zzso zzso zzso revealed geographic subdivisions similar to those of zzso zzso the geographic subdivision was zzso however, due in part to zzso zzso as indicated by split decomposition and zzso tests zzso ratio, zzso In contrast, the zzso populations zzso zzso zzso showed strong geographic subdivisions with less zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso selection zzso of zzso change to synonymous change, zzso was evident in approximately zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analyzed but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso selection was also evident in approximately zzso of the zzso zzso and approximately zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the evolution of these elements reflects selection for optimal zzso activity in the case of zzso zzso and for interactions between the zzso proteins and other cellular constituents that potentially contribute to bacterial zzso Taken together, similarities in IS elements and zzso zzso population genetic structures and evidence of zzso evolution in IS elements suggest that there is zzso between these elements and their bacterial zzso
