The zzso zzso system of DNA zzso is widely used to manipulate segments of the zzso of mice and other zzso for the purpose of studying the regulation and functions of their zzso Since this zzso system could have similar applications in analyzing the zzso of zzso we assessed the action of zzso zzso on its zzso DNA recognition sites in zzso zzso after inserting zzso zzso and two zzso zzso sites into the zzso zzso zzso We found that when zzso sites flank in a direct orientation the zzso termination sequence zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this termination zzso permitting zzso and subsequent expression of a downstream reporter gene for the green fluorescent protein zzso Thus, the zzso system is highly efficient in zzso zzso but the experimental results also indicate that a better way than the existing zzso system is required to completely silence expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso when it is not needed before the full range of zzso applications currently used in mice can be exploited in African zzso
