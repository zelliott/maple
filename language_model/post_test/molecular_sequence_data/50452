A method for the successful extraction of zzso cellular DNA from zzso fossil bones was developed and applied to zzso specimens of the extinct zzso cat, zzso zzso Two distinct gene zzso the zzso gene for zzso zzso and nuclear zzso (the zzso class I major zzso complex zzso from three different individual fossil specimens were cloned and zzso after zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA sequences to zzso regions in 15 living carnivorous species, including 9 species of zzso and 6 zzso affirmed the zzso placement of zzso within the modern radiation of zzso distinct from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results raise the prospect of obtaining genetically zzso DNA from preserved bones of extinct fossil species, particularly among the 2 million specimens excavated from the zzso sediments at Rancho La zzso in metropolitan Los zzso
