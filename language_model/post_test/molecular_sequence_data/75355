Human light chain genes are used in a zzso before zzso zzso Accompanying this hierarchy is the zzso of a zzso element zzso which eliminates the zzso locus before zzso gene zzso In approximately zzso of zzso the zzso zzso at a zzso zzso within the J zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso possessing apparent zzso zzso existed zzso to the J zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso may selectively eliminate zzso zzso zzso A zzso cell that displayed the unusual finding of zzso gene zzso demonstrated a rearranged zzso This zzso was a V zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso the V zzso is the target site of the zzso zzso of the zzso The mouse possesses a counterpart to the zzso zzso sequence zzso and the highly zzso regions surround the zzso zzso No complete protein product was predicted from the zzso zzso near its zzso and no consistent fusion product was predicted from either the zzso or zzso zzso A zzso portion of the zzso is duplicated and is present at zzso as well as zzso The evolutionary conservation of the zzso event, the zzso and maintenance of the zzso indicates that it has a zzso A portion of the zzso may still prove to zzso a zzso factor that directly affects zzso zzso A certain role for the zzso is its zzso zzso which destroys ineffective zzso genes and sets the stage for zzso gene zzso
