Fluorescence zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso of maximum zzso and the quantum yield of their intrinsic zzso zzso zzso were zzso To verify the factors which affected their zzso zzso the dynamics of zzso zzso in those zzso proteins were studied by zzso with zzso zzso and zzso The degrees of exposure of zzso groups in zzso and zzso zzso assessed by zzso zzso were found to be the major factor that determined their zzso zzso However, the positively charged groups surrounding zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso might affect the quantum yield of their zzso zzso zzso of zzso were in an environment with less zzso which did not allow free diffusion of zzso zzso This might render its zzso zzso to zzso at a shorter zzso These results suggested that the structural zzso affecting the intrinsic zzso zzso of zzso proteins can be easily assessed by zzso zzso
