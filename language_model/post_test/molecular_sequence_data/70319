A living entity can be described as a complex zzso system which differs from any, however complex, chemical structure by its capability of functional zzso based on the processing of zzso If one asks, where does this information come from and what is its primary zzso the answer is: information generates itself in feedback zzso via replication and selection, the objective being zzso be or not to zzso This paper describes the theoretical framework of zzso systems and provides experimental clues for some basic forms of genetic organization, such as molecular zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results are primarily obtained with zzso viruses and zzso zzso The experiments are carried out with the help of zzso computer-controlled zzso called zzso zzso that may form the basis of a new zzso zzso
