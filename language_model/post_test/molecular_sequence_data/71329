We have designed zzso based on a zzso group I zzso that can zzso zzso sequences into a chosen zzso target to create a functional zzso zzso and provide a highly specific trigger for gene zzso We have targeted zzso against the coat protein zzso of a widespread plant zzso cucumber mosaic zzso The zzso were designed to zzso the coding sequence of the diphtheria toxin A chain in frame with the viral initiation zzso of the target zzso zzso toxin A chain zzso the zzso zzso of zzso factor 2 and can cause the zzso of protein zzso In a zzso zzso model system, zzso expression was shown to specifically inhibit the growth of cells expressing the virus zzso A point zzso at the target zzso site alleviated this zzso zzso zzso the extent of base pairing between the zzso and target dramatically increased specific expression of the zzso and reduced illegitimate toxicity in zzso zzso zzso may provide a new class of agents for engineering virus resistance and therapeutic zzso
