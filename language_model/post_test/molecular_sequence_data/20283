We investigated zzso resistance mechanisms in zzso zzso strains from zzso Combined zzso zzso and synergistic data indicated that although zzso zzso activities were associated with the zzso target site zzso was the major resistance zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso sodium channel gene encompassing segment 4 of domain II to segment 6 of domain IV was obtained by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence showed highest identity zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and was zzso classified within the divergent group of zzso zzso of resistant and susceptible strains identified the point zzso zzso in segment 6 of domain III, which is known to zzso strong resistance to zzso along with a second zzso zzso in the zzso zzso connecting zzso II and III with an unknown zzso Three transcripts were identified corresponding to the k and zzso alternative zzso The mode of inheritance of resistance was confirmed as incompletely zzso which is consistent with a target site mechanism for zzso
