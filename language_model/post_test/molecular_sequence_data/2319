zzso of the zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso virus zzso is specifically zzso by a zzso zzso zzso factor zzso or zzso that is introduced as a component of infecting zzso In both the zzso and zzso zzso this zzso requires an upstream zzso target response element that contains a single zzso consensus zzso Furthermore, many zzso zzso zzso elements overlap with zzso zzso motifs that are similar to the zzso sites found in both zzso and zzso zzso genes and to the nuclear factor III zzso site within the zzso type 2 origin of DNA zzso zzso zzso cell zzso protein proved to form specific zzso complexes with several upstream regions from both the zzso and zzso zzso and this interaction was subject to efficient competition with an zzso type 2 DNA zzso containing an intact zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso protein bound to synthetic zzso containing only the zzso consensus elements as well as to those containing the zzso zzso zzso although the former exhibited lower affinity and gave complexes with slightly different zzso zzso The zzso zzso also zzso more efficiently than the zzso sequence itself for binding to a zzso probe, indicating that the same protein species binds to both zzso The zzso also formed novel zzso complexes with zzso zzso zzso but only in the presence of a crude nuclear extract and not with zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the cellular zzso protein can recognize both the zzso and zzso elements independently but that only the interaction with zzso represents an intermediate step in the zzso stimulation of zzso genes by the zzso zzso zzso
