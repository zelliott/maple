Two DNA sequences were cloned from the zzso of cultivated rice zzso zzso zzso by zzso with the human zzso sequence zzso The rice sequences consisted of tandem direct repeats, which showed significant similarity to the zzso consensus zzso zzso capable of distinguishing different rice zzso were detected by zzso with a DNA probe amplified by the zzso chain reaction from one of the rice zzso zzso
