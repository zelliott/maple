The DNA sequence of an open reading frame zzso corresponding to the canine zzso type 1 zzso zzso gene was zzso A total of zzso base pairs were zzso from the downstream end of the zzso zzso zzso fragment, including adjacent regions corresponding to the zzso portions of the zzso and the zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso consists of 206 zzso zzso zzso of which zzso are identical and zzso are similar to the sequence of the human zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso identified a number of zzso zzso that could form part of the zzso zzso of the zzso
