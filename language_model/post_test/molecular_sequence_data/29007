Little is known of the degree that zzso sequence and the local environment zzso the structures of zzso zzso Toward this understanding, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been determined for 29 of the 31 zzso zzso zzso in the tandem repeat zzso of blood group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso patterns obtained from three individual animals are in agreement with earlier incomplete zzso on a pooled zzso zzso zzso zzso Owens, zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Owens, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirming that the addition of the zzso zzso and its substitution by zzso are sensitive to local zzso sequence in a highly zzso manner in zzso The present data further support earlier suggestions of an inverse correlation of the density of zzso acid zzso (and by zzso the density of zzso zzso with the extent of substitution of the zzso zzso by zzso This effect is highly correlated for zzso zzso but not for zzso zzso A similar correlation is observed with respect to the in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the addition of zzso to zzso shows no apparent correlation with zzso acid density, although a marked zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso is zzso The above effects may represent both zzso and zzso factors acting to alter the relative accessibility and activity of the zzso toward zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso core 1 beta zzso and zzso exhibit unique zzso sensitivities that may provide mechanisms for the zzso of zzso side chain zzso
