zzso a molecular zzso was generally thought to be a unique zzso form in zzso playing important roles in multiple cellular stress zzso Now, two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from an zzso - crab zzso zzso Main features, sequence identities and zzso analysis with other species were zzso zzso profiles in zzso and under stressful conditions were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso expressed with higher transcript levels in zzso and muscle, zzso A cold treatment rapidly activated both zzso zzso in zzso and zzso but caused the zzso zzso decrease in muscle and zzso Under heat treatment zzso zzso was accumulated in zzso and muscle (but zzso in zzso while zzso zzso tendency in each tissue was the same as that in cold zzso Moreover, the zzso levels of both zzso genes under zzso stress were zzso This crab exposed to the low and high zzso exhibited either lower expression levels of both zzso or no changes in four zzso except the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso These results suggested there were at least two zzso in zzso zzso which played differing roles in zzso and stressful zzso
