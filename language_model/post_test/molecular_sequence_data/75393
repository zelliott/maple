The production of the second zzso molecules zzso and zzso zzso is zzso by activated zzso zzso C zzso zzso Here we report the cloning of a bovine brain complementary DNA zzso an zzso zzso that is characterized by zzso and zzso zzso C activity when expressed in zzso zzso zzso brain zzso zzso contains a zzso transcript corresponding to the isolated zzso a related transcript of the same size is present in zzso from some but not all human cell lines zzso Southern zzso analysis of the bovine zzso indicated that one or possibly two genes zzso to the cloned zzso zzso There is a striking sequence similarity between specific regions of zzso and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso The newly characterized zzso transforming gene of the avian zzso virus zzso also contains extensive sequence similarities with zzso
