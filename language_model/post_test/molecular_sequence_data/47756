Cellular zzso binding proteins are thought to play important roles in the zzso a zzso active zzso of vitamin A that has profound effects on cell growth, + differentiation and zzso zzso of zzso to type II human cellular zzso binding proteins zzso has been investigated by zzso zzso The sequential resonance assignments of zzso in the presence of zzso were established by zzso three-dimensional zzso at pH zzso The resonance assignments of the bound zzso were achieved by zzso zzso The secondary structures of zzso determined by zzso were zzso as revealed by the crystal structure of zzso Most of the nuclear zzso effects zzso between zzso and the bound zzso were consistent with those predicted crystal structure of zzso The results suggested that the zzso in solution and in the zzso state are highly zzso Compared to the zzso binding pocket, especially the zzso entrance, was stabilize zzso one of the structure elements that constitute the zzso binding pocket, became more mobile upon binding of zzso zzso zzso between zzso of the zzso the zzso end of the bound zzso is well fixed but the zzso
