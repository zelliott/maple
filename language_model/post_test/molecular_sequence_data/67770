Biological rhythms are driven by zzso zzso which are ultimately controlled by the zzso expression of clock zzso zzso zzso blue light zzso belong to the negative elements of the zzso feedback loop into the molecular zzso This paper describes the cloning and characterization of two zzso zzso and 2) in European zzso which is considered an interesting zzso model due to its dual zzso zzso The cloned zzso fragments zzso for two proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso which included the zzso and the zzso zzso Moreover, both proteins had a high zzso with zzso proteins zzso of other zzso zzso These zzso and 2 genes were expressed in several zzso of zzso zzso liver, heart, zzso muscle, zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the daily expression of zzso was rhythmic in brain, heart and liver with the zzso around zzso zzso h (after the onset of zzso Similarly, the zzso daily expression was rhythmic in liver, zzso at zzso zzso zzso whereas in brain the zzso was at zzso zzso h zzso prior to the offset of zzso These findings provide new elements to help understanding the functioning of the molecular clock of zzso
