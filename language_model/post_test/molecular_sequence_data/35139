zzso zzso is frequently zzso in liver and zzso zzso We and others have previously described the role of zzso zzso in cell proliferation in zzso but we have yet to identify the relevant zzso direct zzso In this study, we further demonstrated that zzso zzso promotes cell proliferation using both in zzso zzso and in zzso tumor growth zzso We systematically screened for high confidence zzso targets by overlapping in zzso predicted targets from multiple zzso and significantly zzso genes in zzso cells from whole zzso expression zzso A total of 72 high confidence zzso targets were identified and found to be enriched in various zzso zzso zzso family member 4 zzso is zzso validated as the direct cellular target through which zzso promotes cell zzso The clinical relevance of our experimental observations was supported by a statistically significant inverse correlation between zzso and zzso transcript expression in tumor versus paired adjacent zzso zzso from zzso patients zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso zzso is significantly associated with poorer patient survival zzso In zzso zzso zzso is a clinically relevant zzso to provide new insights in understanding zzso zzso zzso
