Several zzso zzso zzso within the coding block of the zzso zzso zzso gene on zzso zzso have been identified in the human zzso In studies utilizing zzso zzso and zzso zzso three zzso at zzso acid positions 16, 27, and zzso have been found to significantly alter zzso zzso The zzso form displays altered zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso displays enhanced zzso zzso and the zzso form is resistant to zzso The zzso of these various forms of the zzso are not different in zzso than in normal zzso However, given the importance of zzso in modulating lung function, studies have been carried out to determine if zzso forms may play roles in promoting zzso zzso establishing zzso zzso or influencing the response to acute or chronic zzso zzso The results of zzso and family studies to date support these zzso Thus zzso zzso act as disease zzso in asthma and represent one of probably many genetic variables involved in the zzso of zzso
