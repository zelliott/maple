Shortly after zzso zzso the rat zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which zzso to zzso and zzso zzso forms zzso and zzso after which an equilibrium of both forms is zzso zzso zzso a type I membrane zzso contains four zzso zzso in the zzso domain which are capable of forming zzso zzso The zzso half of the zzso domain consists of four predicted zzso zzso one heavily charged and three zzso in nature, all candidates for zzso or zzso zzso Using zzso zzso the zzso were individually changed to zzso and the contribution of each of the zzso zzso was zzso by internal zzso The zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the double zzso zzso zzso like the zzso zzso The two zzso zzso were found to be necessary for the zzso of zzso zzso lacking one of the membrane zzso zzso either zzso or zzso were unable to form zzso while zzso were formed zzso The zzso double zzso formed only zzso zzso of any of the individual zzso zzso had no effect on zzso The zzso and zzso forms bound equally well to zzso The zzso and zzso zzso displayed a cellular distribution similar to the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso status played a minimal role in maintaining the zzso distribution of zzso
