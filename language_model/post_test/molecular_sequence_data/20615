As a consequence of selective pressure exerted by the immune response during zzso C virus zzso infection, a high rate of zzso zzso in the viral zzso is observed which leads to the emergence of viral escape zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the evolution of the zzso acid zzso sequence of the zzso zzso protein 3 zzso in viral zzso after liver zzso Six patients with zzso liver disease undergoing liver transplantation zzso were followed up for sequence zzso zzso C recurrence was observed in all patients after zzso The rate of synonymous zzso zzso zzso was much higher than that of zzso zzso ones in the zzso zzso zzso The high values of the zzso ratios suggest no sustained zzso evolution selection pressure and, therefore, absence of specific zzso viral zzso Clinical zzso assignments were supported by zzso zzso zzso samples from each patient showed lower mean zzso genetic distance when compared with samples of the same zzso zzso and zzso The zzso samples studied had an zzso zzso sequence with several differences as compared with reference ones, mainly in zzso zzso zzso After zzso as compared with the sequences before, a few reverted zzso zzso and several established zzso zzso were observed at the zzso of zzso Sites described to be involved in important functions of zzso notably those of the zzso zzso and zinc zzso remained zzso in terms of zzso zzso zzso or frequent zzso zzso occurred zzso in different zzso Several zzso T zzso zzso described for zzso were present in our zzso zzso Nevertheless, the deduced secondary structure of the zzso zzso showed a few zzso in samples from zzso zzso patients, but none were seen in zzso zzso Our data, obtained from patients under important selective pressure during zzso show that the zzso zzso remains well zzso mainly in zzso zzso zzso It reinforces its potential use as an zzso candidate for further studies aiming at the development of a protective immune zzso
