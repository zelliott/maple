zzso of the zzso coli zzso gene is controlled by an zzso promoter zzso and is poorly transcribed by the zzso form of zzso zzso in the absence of additional zzso In this report, we investigate the interaction between zzso and either the zzso or the zzso forms of zzso zzso in zzso We show that although zzso can bind the zzso promoter, its interaction with the promoter results in the formation of an open complex inefficient in zzso initiation and sensitive to zzso zzso zzso of the C zzso at position zzso of zzso zzso slightly impaired zzso initiation by zzso consistent with the role of zzso as a specific feature of zzso zzso However, zzso could still bind and initiate zzso from the zzso zzso zzso promoter more efficiently than zzso suggesting that sequence elements other than the zzso play an important role in specific promoter recognition by zzso
