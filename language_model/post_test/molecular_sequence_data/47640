We have isolated a zzso clone that zzso to the zzso locus of zzso which controls the zzso of zzso to zzso and of zzso to zzso by the action of zzso zzso zzso The zzso encodes a 512 zzso acid zzso with regions of similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso zzso and are key zzso in the zzso zzso leading to the production of the zzso zzso The F3 zzso transcript is most abundant in petals from flowers at an early stage of development and levels decline as the flower zzso zzso are also detected in the zzso zzso zzso stems and zzso of the zzso zzso No or very reduced levels of transcripts are detected in zzso zzso This is the first report of isolation of a F3 zzso zzso clone from any zzso
