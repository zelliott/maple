Classical zzso zzso has achieved great success in development of many industrial zzso zzso but has the serious disadvantage of zzso of zzso secondary zzso that are zzso to their zzso In the zzso era, a novel methodology which avoids this drawback presents zzso This zzso strain zzso involves identifying zzso by comparative zzso analysis, defining zzso beneficial for production, and assembling them in a single zzso zzso Described zzso is an initial challenge involving reconstruction of classically derived zzso zzso zzso Comparative zzso analysis for the relevant terminal zzso the zzso step, and the zzso reactions between the zzso and production strains identified a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso and a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso Introduction of the zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso strain by zzso replacement resulted in zzso of 8 g and 55 g of zzso respectively, indicating that both these specific zzso are relevant to zzso The two zzso were then zzso in the zzso zzso which led to a synergistic effect on production (75 zzso Further introduction of the zzso zzso resulted in an additional contribution and zzso of 80 zzso after only 27 zzso This high-speed zzso achieved the highest productivity zzso g zzso zzso so far reported for microbes producing zzso in zzso zzso
