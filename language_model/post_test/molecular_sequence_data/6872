The integration host factor zzso of zzso coli is a small, zzso zzso zzso The specific and zzso binding zzso of zzso were estimated by zzso zzso The equilibrium association constant of zzso for the zzso site in zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso binding constant is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso giving a selectivity of approximately zzso for a specific site over random zzso To study the molecular zzso specifying zzso zzso we used a series of 41 zzso containing zzso zzso that modified the surfaces of the major and minor grooves of the zzso Many of the analogue zzso within the previously defined consensus region caused decreased zzso Replacement with various zzso outside the consensus domain had little zzso zzso the binding zzso for those sites with reduced affinities indicated an interaction with the minor groove within the consensus zzso The binding zzso of sites with zzso and an zzso substitution within the same region suggest that zzso may also interact with the major zzso Thus, the specific interaction of zzso with its zzso site likely involves interactions with both the minor and major grooves of the zzso
