zzso plants in the tropical zzso are a rich source of zzso zzso and this work illustrates isolation of a zzso zzso inhibitor from the seeds of zzso zzso zzso inhabiting Great zzso Island, zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by zzso and ammonium zzso zzso and zzso exchange, size exclusion and reverse phase zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed that it is constituted by two zzso chains zzso zzso 15,000 and zzso zzso zzso the molecular weight being approximately 20 zzso zzso sequence showed high zzso with other zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso Both zzso as well as zzso zzso showed four zzso zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity of zzso remained unchanged over a wide range of temperatures zzso degrees zzso and pH zzso The protein inhibited zzso in the zzso ratio of zzso but lacked similar zzso against zzso Also, zzso complex was stable to zzso unlike the zzso unstable zzso zzso zzso which possessed zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso against zzso and zzso activity, respectively, retained over zzso of zzso activity after being stored at zzso degrees C for more than a zzso zzso studies on the zzso properties of zzso indicate it to be a very potent insect zzso
