zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso system zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso yielding primarily R zzso The presumed site of zzso zzso is a zzso iron zzso similar to that in the soluble methane zzso of zzso bacteria, to which zzso exhibits a significant degree of zzso acid sequence zzso The zzso complex was not expressed in zzso coli, at least partly because that host did not produce all of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was achieved in zzso zzso by cloning the zzso genes into the zzso expression zzso zzso No background of zzso activity was detected in zzso zzso cells without zzso and expression of zzso activity, at a level comparable to that from zzso zzso zzso zzso coincided with appearance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso extracts of zzso zzso was zzso by the addition of zzso and produced zzso with comparable zzso excess to zzso zzso from the original zzso Although the whole zzso complex could not be expressed in zzso coli, the functional zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso were expressed individually in zzso coli as zzso with zzso zzso The expression systems described here now allow zzso studies on zzso to be carried out by zzso zzso
