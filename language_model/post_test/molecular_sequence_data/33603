Despite advances in expression technologies, the efficient production of zzso zzso proteins in zzso coli remains a zzso One frequent limitation relies on their inability to be exported to the zzso coli zzso However, recent studies have suggested that zzso zzso and signal sequences act in concert to zzso the export zzso 

In order to produce zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in the bacterial zzso we compared expression of the natural and zzso gene zzso and evaluated export efficiency of zzso fused to different signal zzso The best combination of these factors acting on translation and export was obtained when the signal sequence of zzso was fused to an zzso coli zzso mature zzso zzso When tested in high cell density cultures, the protein was primarily found in the growth zzso Under these conditions, the engineered expression system yields over 470 zzso of zzso active zzso 

These results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso proteins require proper zzso between translation and zzso for optimal high-level production in zzso zzso
