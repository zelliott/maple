In order to address the molecular signature of human zzso we investigated the zzso of zzso of the zzso of zzso an zzso zzso which plays a role in the invasive behavior of these zzso zzso zzso is identified by zzso and a strategy based on rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso reveals different zzso resulting from both an alternative use of two types of leader zzso and a zzso mechanism within the zzso The spliced zzso is an zzso element specific to the zzso zzso thus indicating a recent evolution of regulatory processes specific to the zzso line that occurs on this zzso Each zzso exhibits different zzso efficiencies and contains features that allow translation to occur independently of the classic zzso zzso These data illustrate the complex regulation of zzso expression in human brain tumors occurring at both zzso and translation zzso The different zzso are zzso expressed in diverse types of human zzso Thus, the zzso occurring within the zzso part of the zzso zzso reveals new opportunities to explore deregulation that occurs during the zzso zzso
