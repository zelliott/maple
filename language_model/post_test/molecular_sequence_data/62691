zzso zzso are major contributors to the zzso properties of zzso zzso Currently, four zzso zzso genes have been zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso All these genes have five major zzso zzso (four von zzso factor zzso C or D zzso and one zzso zzso zzso as their distinctive features, in contrast to other zzso type of zzso The CT domain is believed to be involved in the initial zzso zzso formation and have very zzso relationship between different zzso zzso across different zzso Because of gene zzso and zzso zzso it is very likely that other zzso zzso genes zzso To search for new zzso zzso candidate zzso a zzso zzso zzso was built from the common features of the CT zzso of those zzso zzso By using this model to screen all protein databases as well as the zzso translated expression sequence tag and translated human zzso databases, we identified a locus located at the zzso region of human zzso 12 and the corresponding zzso region of mouse zzso zzso We cloned the 3' end of this gene and its mouse zzso We found one zzso C domain, one CT domain, and various zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated the close relationship between this gene and the zzso zzso from zzso and zzso A zzso signal was observed on the Northern zzso which indicates very large zzso zzso Further analysis of the upstream zzso sequences generated from human and mouse zzso projects revealed three additional zzso D zzso and many zzso zzso zzso The expression of this gene is restricted to the zzso cells of various zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso Based on the zzso convention, we have given the name zzso to the human zzso and zzso to the zzso
