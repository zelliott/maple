Advances in molecular biology have produced great results concerning with the knowledge about zzso mechanisms and gene zzso In the last zzso years the development of discoveries have exceeded the information of clinical zzso and the technology of genetic engineering, evolved from the properties of the DNA zzso give us powerful diagnostic tools much more specific than those of classical zzso limited to gross disorders of zzso Cellular cultures, zzso and zzso have been very useful to develop molecular zzso Using zzso a gene can be located into one zzso After zzso the restriction map may be represented and employed as routine diagnostic zzso Final objective is the genetic map with the complete sequence of normal and abnormal zzso To do so, more sophisticated methods are coming that still belong to the field of zzso
