The genetic structure of natural populations of zzso barley yellow dwarf virus zzso zzso and cereal yellow dwarf virus zzso from barley zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in Alaska were analyzed between 2002 and zzso zzso products spanning the viral coat protein gene of zzso zzso were cloned and zzso The majority zzso were similar to zzso zzso were similar to zzso and only about zzso resembled zzso The zzso zzso clustered in three groups: 44, 17, and zzso resembled zzso zzso from Mexico, resembled zzso zzso from New York, or formed a unique zzso that was zzso zzso zzso zzso The patterns of genetic variation of zzso and zzso varied little over time or with respect to host zzso The difference in spatial and zzso population genetic structures of the zzso and zzso zzso suggests that these two viruses are influenced by different zzso zzso zzso of zzso products spanning the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso region, and most of the coat protein gene of zzso revealed two probable ancestral zzso events for some zzso
