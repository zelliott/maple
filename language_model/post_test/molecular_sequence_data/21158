zzso are a class of zzso elements that represent a major fraction of the repetitive DNA of most zzso Their abundance stems from their expansive replication zzso We screened and isolated sequence fragments of long terminal repeat zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso and zzso envelope zzso zzso and two partial sequences of zzso zzso long zzso element zzso in the zzso zzso zzso sweet potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso these elements were found to be present in the zzso zzso zzso sweet potato zzso with copy numbers ranging from zzso to zzso as observed in the partial zzso zzso and LINE zzso zzso zzso The continuous zzso propagation of sweet potato may have contributed to such a multitude of copies of some of these zzso zzso Interestingly, the isolated zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequence fragments, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, were found to be zzso to the zzso zzso sequences of barley zzso zzso zzso Although the isolated partial sequences were found to be zzso to other zzso active zzso future studies are required to determine whether they represent elements that are zzso active under normal and zzso stressful zzso
