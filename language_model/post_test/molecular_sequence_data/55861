zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso has been observed during zzso cell zzso To understand this zzso we analyzed the zzso gene of a zzso deficient patient, in whose zzso the zzso was persistently zzso A point zzso zzso zzso was identified in the zzso zzso and it caused a single zzso acid substitution from zzso The zzso is very close to the zzso zzso the putative binding site of the zzso zzso zzso The impaired zzso binding would cause the decreased affinity for zzso consequently the zzso zzso may be extremely zzso Although the zzso other zzso zzso did not have any structural change, the zzso zzso level in zzso was zzso These findings suggested that both the structural zzso near the active site and the decreased zzso level of the zzso were responsible for the zzso
