zzso to zzso the most common human arthritis, is known to be influenced by genetic zzso Through a zzso association study using approximately 100,000 zzso we have identified a previously unknown gene on zzso zzso zzso which is associated with zzso to knee zzso zzso specifically in cartilage, zzso encodes a zzso protein with two regions corresponding to the von zzso factor type A domain zzso zzso Several zzso zzso are significantly associated with knee zzso in two independent Japanese zzso zzso This association was zzso in a Japanese population cohort and a Han Chinese zzso cohort zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein binds to zzso and the binding is influenced by two highly associated zzso zzso zzso and zzso located in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso which is overrepresented in knee zzso showed weaker zzso Our findings reveal a new paradigm for study of zzso zzso and zzso
