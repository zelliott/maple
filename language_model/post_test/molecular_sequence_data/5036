Human zzso contain a complex of proteins similar to the zzso protein 2/3 zzso complex of zzso We have obtained zzso sequence information for each member of the putative zzso complex previously described for zzso and human zzso From the zzso sequences we have identified zzso species zzso three novel proteins in this zzso We find that in addition to zzso and zzso this complex contains a relative of the human zzso of zzso zzso protein and four previously unknown zzso These proteins zzso in the zzso of zzso that lack zzso but are enriched in zzso on stimulation with serum or zzso growth zzso We propose a zzso and dynamic role for this complex in the organization of the zzso zzso
