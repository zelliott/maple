zzso zzso is a widespread environmental zzso that must be activated by cellular metabolism to a zzso zzso form zzso before it zzso with zzso It has recently been shown that zzso zzso zzso the zzso in zzso zzso sequences in the human zzso zzso providing one explanation for why these sites are zzso hot zzso Using zzso duplex zzso containing identical zzso and zzso zzso zzso we show here that zzso zzso modified the zzso in zzso or fully zzso zzso zzso producing between 3- and zzso more modification at this zzso Analysis of this reaction using shorter duplex zzso indicated that it was the level of the zzso zzso that was specifically zzso To determine if there were zzso differences between the zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequences that may be responsible for this enhanced zzso a native zzso gel zzso analysis was carried out using DNA containing zzso pure zzso zzso These experiments showed that each zzso resulted in an altered gel mobility in duplex DNA but that only the presence of a zzso zzso and a zzso C zzso to the zzso resulted in a significant gel mobility shift compared with the zzso zzso
