The human zzso and zzso genes have similar zzso promoter zzso A first analysis of the factor requirements for the zzso of a human zzso gene by zzso zzso II in zzso has been zzso and these requirements compared with those of human zzso gene zzso by zzso zzso III in the same zzso zzso containing zzso protein zzso are shown to be essential for zzso of both zzso and further evidence that zzso itself is required for zzso as well as zzso zzso is zzso On the other hand, the two genes have distinct requirements for zzso protein zzso On the basis of zzso and functional properties, the zzso or zzso complex, required for zzso zzso appears to differ from previously described complexes required for zzso zzso I, II or III zzso The different zzso requirements of the zzso and zzso promoters are reflected by specific association with either zzso or zzso respectively, thus providing a basis for differential zzso zzso zzso
