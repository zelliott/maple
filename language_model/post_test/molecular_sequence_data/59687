zzso zzso a symbiotic zzso zzso has a complex respiratory zzso chain, capable of functioning throughout a wide range of oxygen zzso It does so by zzso a number of terminal zzso each appropriate for different environmental zzso We have previously described the cloning of the large zzso zzso zzso from one of the terminal zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Murphy, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence for a fourth terminal zzso from zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso In this work, we describe the remaining zzso of this terminal zzso complex, which is zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso by zzso does not contain any zzso acid zzso that are known to bind the zzso atom of zzso c terminal zzso but contains zzso thought to be involved in zzso zzso Terminal zzso cyanide zzso zzso pattern comparisons of the wild type with a zzso zzso zzso indicated the new zzso is expressed zzso However analysis of zzso extracted from zzso incubated cells revealed the absence of zzso O in this strain (from both the wild type and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso most likely encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso
