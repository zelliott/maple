This study examined relationships between zzso induced zzso currents and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso along the northeast Pacific zzso zzso A robust diagnostic model of zzso circulation in this region predicted strong zzso currents following contours of the Blanco zzso zzso a zzso lateral offset that separates the zzso and Juan de zzso zzso zzso Such currents should facilitate the southward zzso of zzso zzso zzso Immigration rates for populations north and south of the Blanco zzso zzso were estimated from molecular population genetic zzso zzso DNA evidence revealed population subdivision across the Blanco zzso zzso and a strong directional bias in gene flow that was consistent with predictions of the circulation zzso The distribution of zzso diversity between the northern and southern populations of zzso zzso suggests that the zzso Ridge zzso have maintained larger effective population sizes than the northern zzso a pattern that also exists in zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that the northern zzso fields may experience a higher frequency of habitat turnover and consequently more rapid losses of genetic zzso
