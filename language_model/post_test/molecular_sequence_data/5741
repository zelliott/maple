zzso zzso play a key role in the normal function of the airway zzso We examined the expression of zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso 6, 7, and 8 in human fetal zzso to establish the zzso and age of onset of expression of each zzso gene during human zzso We detected expression of zzso zzso zzso and 7 in the zzso airway zzso but did not detect expression of zzso 6, or zzso zzso was expressed in the trachea and large airways in the majority of cells in the airway zzso zzso of zzso was only seen in individual zzso cells in the zzso while zzso was expressed in the surface zzso of the trachea at 13 zzso but was largely restricted to zzso zzso by 23 zzso of zzso
