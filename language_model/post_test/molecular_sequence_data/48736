Many important protein interactions related to cell signaling networks and zzso modification events are zzso by the binding of a zzso domain in one protein to a short zzso stretch in zzso In the current study, we describe a zzso protocol to realize the quantitative prediction of weak affinity in such zzso This method uses the crystal structure of zzso zzso domain zzso with a zzso zzso mimic zzso as the template to construct other zzso zzso complex structure zzso zzso independent zzso interactions between the domain and zzso in constructed complexes are zzso and correlated with zzso measured affinity of 80 zzso zzso zzso by using partial least squares zzso and random forest zzso We demonstrate that zzso the zzso zzso is time-consuming but performs much well as compared to linear zzso in modeling and predicting the binding affinity of zzso zzso zzso the proposed zzso strategy is more effective and accurate than those of traditional zzso methods in capturing the binding behavior and interaction information of domain with zzso and zzso only very few zzso at complex interface contribute significantly to zzso zzso
