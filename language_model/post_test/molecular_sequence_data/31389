The smooth muscle cells of chicken gizzard harbor the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso which were used as a model to study the association of a membrane protein with zzso We demonstrated that the binding process between zzso and zzso has the qualities of a zzso interaction, zzso is zzso and zzso In contrast to the association of zzso with zzso the interaction with zzso does not require zzso metal zzso zzso peptides containing the zzso or a zzso zzso interfering with binding of other receptors to the zzso domain of zzso did not abolish the interaction with zzso This indicates that the zzso does not represent the major contact site for the zzso and that the zzso belongs to a separate class of zzso receptors with distinct properties as compared to the zzso
