The gene responsible for zzso syndrome has been assigned to zzso by a combination of comparative mapping and linkage zzso A previous report has mapped the zzso zzso associated with the disease in a female patient to an zzso zzso by zzso and a group of six more zzso zzso zzso including zzso We have characterized a number of zzso or zzso zzso from which we have generated six new zzso One of them identifies a small overlap region between a zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso A zzso region covered by a zzso zzso has been zzso and zzso disclosing a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso A probe mapping zzso to the zzso in the same zzso reveals altered zzso fragments in a hybrid constructed from the zzso patient's zzso We describe the development of a zzso zzso extending 150 zzso from a nearby zzso island across the zzso This zzso includes four adjacent clones displaying zzso zzso
