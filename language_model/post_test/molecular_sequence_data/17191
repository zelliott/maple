zzso zzso invasion of human zzso depends on recognition of specific zzso surface receptors by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso invasion is totally dependent on the recognition of the zzso blood group zzso by the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso recognition by zzso zzso relies on a zzso domain, the zzso domain or region II, at the N zzso of the zzso portion of zzso The minimal region of the zzso implicated for zzso recognition lies between zzso 4 and 8 of the zzso domain, which is a region that also has the highest rate of zzso zzso among zzso zzso We previously found that zzso zzso in this region altered the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso character, which contrasts with changes in zzso specificity attributed to zzso in some zzso zzso of zzso zzso To further investigate the relative importance of zzso and zzso zzso within this zzso central region, we identified zzso critical for zzso recognition by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain were zzso with zzso and zzso for zzso binding activity by expression of the zzso proteins on the surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso The functional effect of zzso substitution varied from zzso to complete loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso that caused loss of zzso function mostly occurred in zzso clusters of zzso zzso whereas nearly all zzso in zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso These data delineate zzso domain zzso essential for zzso zzso
