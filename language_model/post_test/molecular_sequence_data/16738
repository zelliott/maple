The zzso minor zzso proteins enter the nucleus twice during viral zzso in the initial phase after zzso zzso and in the productive phase when, together with the zzso major zzso zzso they assemble the zzso viral DNA into zzso In this study we investigated the interactions between the zzso protein of high-risk human zzso type 16 zzso and nuclear import zzso We discovered that zzso zzso interacts directly with both zzso and zzso Moreover, binding of zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso its interaction with zzso suggesting that the zzso complex is import zzso In addition, we found that zzso forms a complex with the zzso zzso via interaction with the zzso zzso In agreement with the binding data, nuclear import of zzso in zzso cells could be zzso by either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso contains two nuclear zzso signals zzso in the N zzso zzso and C zzso zzso that could mediate its nuclear zzso Together the data suggest that zzso zzso interacts via its zzso with a network of zzso and can enter the nucleus via several import pathways zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso
