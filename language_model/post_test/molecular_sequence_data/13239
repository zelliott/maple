zzso difference analysis was used to identify zzso differences in the zzso region zzso of mouse X and Y zzso One second generation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso male carrying the zzso zzso zzso was used for tester zzso DNA from five zzso males from the same generation that were zzso zzso for the zzso was pooled for the zzso A cloned probe designated zzso was recovered that is zzso in Southern zzso Analysis of zzso DNA from several zzso strains of laboratory mice and diverse zzso species and subspecies identified a characteristic zzso I pattern of zzso sizes that is present only in the zzso family of zzso zzso was observed with sequences in zzso and to a limited extent with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso No zzso was observed in DNA of different zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso was conducted using zzso zzso males that carry zzso zzso zzso for zzso X zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso females with zzso zzso These analyses demonstrated that the zzso sequences were inherited with both the X and Y zzso zzso sequences were genetically mapped as a locus within the zzso using two zzso zzso The locus defined by zzso is designated zzso zzso analyses of zzso between the zzso X zzso gene zzso zzso and the zzso zzso for either zzso or sex zzso association zzso suggest that the locus zzso maps to the zzso portion of the zzso
