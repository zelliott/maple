The zzso zzso zzso mediates recognition of foreign zzso physically associated with major zzso complex zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso zzso is thought to resemble that of zzso zzso fragments and to possess corresponding zzso regions zzso that contact zzso To test such a model for the zzso zzso we have generated zzso zzso that express a zzso or zzso form of the zzso zzso present on the zzso zzso clone zzso zzso of 2 zzso acids zzso to zzso zzso to zzso in the predicted zzso of the zzso zzso zzso alpha chain caused a markedly diminished response to zzso without affecting the response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results constitute the first test of the prediction that zzso in the zzso zzso alpha chain is important for zzso recognition, thus providing strong evidence for the structural model of the zzso zzso zzso based upon zzso
