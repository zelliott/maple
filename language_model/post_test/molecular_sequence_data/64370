A gene for a putative zzso zzso zzso which is zzso to zzso from zzso zzso was cloned and zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso The predicted protein possessed the zzso zzso zzso domain, the response regulator domain, and six tandem repeats of zzso at the zzso end that are found in zzso zzso from other zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso gene product is a zzso zzso zzso zzso are resistant to zzso and zzso zzso and they are sensitive to zzso zzso We previously classified zzso zzso into three types, based on their zzso To explain the zzso differences among the zzso zzso zzso we cloned and zzso the zzso zzso genes and compared their sequences with that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso with a deletion or point zzso in the zzso repeat region, were highly sensitive to zzso stress and highly resistant to both zzso A single zzso acid change within the zzso domain or the regulator domain altered the sensitivity to zzso stress and zzso moderate resistance to the zzso These results suggest that this predicted zzso especially its repeat region, has an important function in zzso adaptation and zzso zzso
