zzso replicate through a zzso mechanism in which the infecting circular zzso and its complementary zzso strand are zzso The precise site at which zzso starts was investigated for the zzso zzso zzso zzso the type species of the family of zzso with zzso zzso Linear zzso zzso and zzso zzso begin with a zzso sequence that maps to similar zzso terminal zzso in their predicted zzso secondary zzso The sequences around the initiation sites of zzso which replicates and accumulates in the zzso are similar to the promoters of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso supporting the involvement of an zzso activity in zzso zzso Since zzso folding appears to be zzso determined, the specific location of both zzso initiation sites provides a zzso insight into how the nascent zzso strands may fold in zzso The approach used here, in zzso capping and zzso protection zzso may be useful for investigating the initiation sites of other small circular zzso zzso
