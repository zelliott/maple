zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso low plasma levels of zzso and LDL zzso zzso for zzso almost always have plasma LDL cholesterol levels zzso 70 zzso and are zzso Because the low cholesterol levels may protect zzso zzso from coronary heart disease, the mechanisms for zzso are of considerable zzso 

The plasma zzso of 29 subjects with LDL cholesterol levels zzso 70 zzso were examined by zzso One subject who had virtually zzso levels of LDL cholesterol had a truncated zzso zzso in his zzso a second subject with an LDL cholesterol level of 44 zzso had zzso in his zzso The zzso zzso zzso acids in zzso resulted from a zzso caused by an zzso zzso in zzso 26 of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was caused by a nonsense zzso in zzso 26 of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso occurred at a zzso zzso pair, a zzso hot spot, and was identical to a zzso described previously in a subject with zzso Our subject with zzso however, had a different zzso than the subject described zzso suggesting that the two zzso zzso may have arisen zzso Of note, the zzso zzso father, who had very low cholesterol levels and who probably carried the zzso zzso had significant coronary and zzso zzso at zzso 

In a study of adults with low LDL cholesterol levels, we discovered two subjects with truncated zzso proteins and identified the responsible zzso zzso gene zzso causing truncated zzso are not particularly rare in subjects with low cholesterol zzso The role of these zzso in preventing zzso deserves further zzso
