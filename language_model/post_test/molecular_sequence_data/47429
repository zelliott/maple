By zzso the activity of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso complexes, zzso prevents the premature initiation of S phase in the zzso zzso zzso By testing a series of zzso zzso zzso we have mapped the minimal domain necessary for zzso zzso in zzso to the zzso 70 zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso was used to show that a sequence that matches the zzso motif found in zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso This motif is not found in the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which appears to be a structural and functional zzso of zzso Based on the zzso data and sequence zzso we argue that zzso and zzso are structurally distinct from the known zzso zzso zzso but may bind zzso complexes in a manner more closely resembling zzso zzso like the zzso and zzso zzso
