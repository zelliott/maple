This study discusses the zzso of soluble zzso zzso obtained from the zzso liver of zzso zzso The first zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso presented a molecular weight of zzso with an zzso point of zzso The highest specific zzso activity was achieved using human blood type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated a higher zzso specificity for zzso For zzso the molecular weight obtained was zzso with an zzso point of zzso The highest zzso specificity was observed for zzso These zzso zzso zzso are similar to the zzso zzso zzso previously zzso However, it is different from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso analyses of zzso resulted in zzso identity with the zzso acute regulatory protein zzso while zzso was similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso We suggest that these liver zzso are related to the inherent functions of liver previously zzso
