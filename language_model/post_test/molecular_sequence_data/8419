zzso of a zzso of nuclear proteins zzso was observed in human zzso T cell line following treatment with an zzso to zzso zzso a cell surface zzso involved in zzso cell zzso The zzso activity, corresponding to a zzso of proteins observed at approximately 42, 45, and 50 zzso in size, was zzso zzso and detected by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso containing zzso acids zzso zzso The zzso activity requires the presence of zzso and is insensitive to zzso by heating at 80 degrees C for 5 zzso zzso effectively inhibited the zzso activity of zzso on zzso and also protected zzso cells from the zzso zzso in cell zzso The zzso zzso however, was not a unique zzso for the zzso cell zzso The zzso induced by zzso zzso a zzso agent, also activated the zzso zzso activity in zzso cells, suggesting that a similar cascade of subsequent events in zzso may occur in most instances although many different signals can initiate zzso cell death in various cell zzso The zzso identified by this study appears to be distinguishable from zzso I or zzso II by its molecular characteristics and its zzso zzso The zzso with respect to the zzso activity closely associated with zzso cell death, may serve as a candidate for the zzso involved in the zzso of DNA into fragments during zzso
