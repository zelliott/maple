Despite the recent discovery of novel zzso from zzso samples, their genetic evolution and diversity are poorly zzso This study reports the identification and complete zzso characterization of two novel zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso 4 zzso from various zzso zzso displaying marked zzso and zzso genetic diversity, with zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso among zzso zzso of zzso samples zzso zzso serum, zzso and zzso zzso from healthy, sick or deceased pigs from farms and a zzso in Hong zzso As marked zzso zzso were observed in the partial zzso zzso complete zzso genes from one zzso and three zzso specimens were cloned and zzso which suggested the presence of two different zzso and demonstrated significant zzso and zzso genetic zzso Complete zzso sequences revealed the presence of two zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with two zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso Their zzso zzso three zzso characteristic of zzso zzso analysis showed that they were zzso related to other zzso forming a distinct cluster within the zzso zzso analysis showed possible zzso events among zzso sequences of zzso strains from a zzso zzso with two zzso identified (with a 68 and 71 zzso zzso suggesting that different zzso within the same host could have arisen from zzso This is the first report describing marked sequence diversity and the zzso of two viruses of the family zzso within the same host, which may have originated from and, in turn, facilitated zzso
