zzso (Human zzso interacting zzso was identified in a zzso two hybrid screen for proteins that interact with zzso zzso zzso encodes a 43 zzso protein predicted to contain an extended zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso raised against zzso protein revealed strong zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso This signal zzso at the zzso with zzso at a position slightly outside of the central part of the zzso as revealed by zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso has been confirmed by following zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso with a zzso zzso a zzso fusion zzso In cycling zzso cells, zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso cells prior to zzso zzso and remains at the zzso until late in zzso This zzso pattern, combined with the zzso results, suggests that zzso may play a role in targeting zzso to the zzso at zzso zzso was also found to zzso to zzso and to the active zzso of zzso zzso zzso thus appears to associate with all active zzso zzso that it plays an important role in correct zzso zzso
