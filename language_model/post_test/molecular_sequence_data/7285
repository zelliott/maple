We report the isolation and characterization of zzso cell clones obtained after two successive persistent zzso zzso zzso Once zzso some of the cell clones displayed selective zzso toward the zzso zzso strain and partial resistance to particular zzso of this strain, including the zzso 1 zzso Two cell zzso zzso 4 and zzso 10, were studied in greater zzso The zzso effects of zzso infection were comparable in the cell clones and in zzso zzso The zzso effects of infection by zzso 1 or zzso zzso were greatly delayed in zzso 4 and zzso zzso In the zzso region zzso the zzso zzso zzso involved in the resistance of the cell clones to the zzso zzso were localized in the zzso part of zzso zzso acids 22 and zzso the zzso loop of zzso zzso acids zzso and the loop of zzso connecting its zzso to beta strand B zzso acid zzso These zzso regions are thought to be involved in the early steps of viral zzso zzso zzso was slower and less efficient on zzso 10 cells than on parental zzso zzso zzso zzso was faster on zzso 4 than on zzso cells, and at least as efficient, but there was less zzso structural modification of the zzso a step that is required for zzso Furthermore, infection of zzso 4 by a zzso zzso in which the zzso loop of zzso has been deleted was affected in the later steps of zzso These results indicate that, in cells cured of persistent zzso infection, zzso zzso was restricted at several stages and particularly at two steps of virus zzso zzso and/or the zzso transitions following zzso onto the zzso
