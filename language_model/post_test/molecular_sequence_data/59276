We have cloned and determined the complete structure of the zzso gene zzso the zzso form of zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso acid synthetic zzso Its coding region comprises 18 zzso spanning 42 zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 together with 64 zzso of zzso 2 defines the zzso untranslated region of zzso zzso zzso 18 specifies the zzso zzso terminal and the entire 3' untranslated zzso zzso zzso and zzso are solely contained in the coding regions of two alternatively spliced zzso embryonic zzso which code for the truncated embryonic zzso zzso The promoter region zzso corresponding to the main group of zzso initiation sites is devoid of zzso and zzso boxes but has putative binding sites for the zzso factor zzso and is embedded in a large G + zzso domain of a zzso island, features shared by the promoters of zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso extension data suggests the existence of additional zzso start sites at 130 zzso and 295 zzso upstream from the major initiation site that are zzso less frequently in adult zzso The tentative zzso promoters zzso and zzso that zzso to the minor start sites resemble zzso promoters with zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso region, we identified several putative zzso factor binding sites such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and putative zzso regulatory zzso including the zzso zzso element, which may have functional significance in the zzso and zzso expression of the zzso zzso
