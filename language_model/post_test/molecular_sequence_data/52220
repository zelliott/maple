To zzso the role of the zzso region of zzso III, we studied the effects of synthetic peptides corresponding to its sequence on the zzso and zzso activities of zzso and Factor zzso in the presence or absence of the zzso zzso zzso The peptides zzso and zzso corresponding to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso respectively, blocked the zzso by zzso zzso The effect of zzso was reduced in the presence of zzso Both peptides at a concentration of 1 zzso blocked complex formation between zzso III and zzso or Factor zzso The two zzso particularly zzso directly enhanced the zzso activity of zzso and Factor zzso on the synthetic zzso zzso (where zzso is zzso and zzso is zzso which zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso site of zzso III, and also on other zzso due to increased zzso zzso also shortened the zzso zzso zzso time, whereas zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of protein C both in the presence and absence of zzso The direct effect of zzso and zzso on zzso was confirmed by enhancement of the incorporation of zzso into zzso These findings suggest that the zzso region of zzso III interacts with zzso and Factor zzso to increase the zzso of the zzso which may enhance zzso formation between the inhibitor and the zzso
