The zzso zzso zzso gene is highly expressed in cultured rat zzso cells, but extinguished in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene expression in hybrids is a zzso process that involves several zzso zzso only one of which zzso zzso zzso has been characterized to zzso To identify sequence elements of the zzso gene that are involved both in zzso extinction and in zzso zzso we zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso hybrid zzso We report that zzso responsiveness mapped to the zzso zzso zzso response zzso as shown previously for the zzso zzso zzso This was expected from the recent identification of the zzso gene product as a regulatory zzso of protein zzso zzso However, none of the zzso we zzso were responsive to zzso extinction mechanisms, suggesting that these controls require DNA sequences and/or zzso structures that were not present in the zzso zzso The implications of these findings are zzso
