zzso zzso zzso one of the primary zzso generated in vascular zzso is known to cause zzso in vascular smooth muscle zzso To clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso the involvement of zzso oxygen species was examined in a rat vascular smooth muscle cell line, zzso zzso and zzso a selective zzso of the zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso increase was suppressed by zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso that has been reported to be the major source of zzso in vascular zzso The zzso synthesis of the protein induced by zzso or zzso was suppressed in the presence of zzso In zzso or zzso cells, a zzso increase in the expression of zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by Northern zzso zzso Finally, depletion of zzso zzso in the cells zzso with zzso targeted for three independent zzso sites on the zzso sequence significantly reduced the zzso increase in protein zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso of vascular smooth muscle cells caused by zzso is zzso by zzso induction and the zzso overproduction of zzso by zzso zzso
