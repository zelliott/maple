zzso that express zzso zzso zzso zzso are resistant to zzso zzso however, the mechanism by which these zzso are protected is not zzso To identify proteins possibly involved in this process, we performed affinity zzso with the zzso zzso domain, a zzso motif that mediates protein zzso Using this method to zzso soluble tissue zzso we identified the muscle zzso of zzso zzso as a protein that binds to zzso both in brain and skeletal zzso zzso interacts with the zzso domain of zzso and zzso binding can be zzso by peptides that bind to the zzso domain of zzso We found that zzso is significantly associated with zzso in skeletal muscle because zzso can be zzso from zzso skeletal muscle extracts using an zzso directed against zzso In brain, zzso and zzso are both enriched in zzso and specifically, in the synaptic zzso zzso where they can zzso At the cellular level, zzso is enriched in zzso that express zzso zzso As zzso zzso the product of zzso activity, is zzso the interaction of zzso and zzso may contribute to zzso of zzso positive zzso
