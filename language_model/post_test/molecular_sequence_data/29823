The expression and activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined during the development of cortical zzso zzso zzso content and zzso zzso both increased during the first 7 days, later stabilized and decreased from zzso zzso transport and zzso concentration were relatively constant from zzso to zzso The kinetic parameters of zzso transport were at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The shift in zzso towards higher values suggest a more important participation of zzso after zzso At zzso and 14, zzso transport was poorly sensitive to zzso zzso suggesting a weak participation of zzso in zzso zzso Western zzso experiments and zzso showed that zzso was expressed by zzso whatever the stage of the zzso zzso was found in zzso as soon as zzso and labeling increased during the development of the zzso There was little zzso zzso zzso at zzso only detected by zzso From zzso to 18, an increasing zzso expression of zzso was observed, also detected by Western zzso These results show that: zzso zzso zzso remains stable all along the development of the cultures although the pattern of expression of the different zzso is changing, suggesting that zzso transport is highly zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a critical role during the early stages of the culture when it is expressed alone; and zzso the zzso expression pattern of zzso zzso in cortical zzso cultures is quite similar to that observed in zzso during early zzso zzso
