The zzso zzso is the shortest zzso zzso to date and consists of 297 zzso with two putative zzso sites at the zzso N zzso In zzso studies have demonstrated zzso of the zzso zzso by its own zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso lead to the familial zzso zzso zzso syndrome, a rare zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso are not present in all patients with zzso and also not in the closely related zzso zzso syndrome indicating that other mechanisms of zzso resistance are still to be zzso Despite an extensive search, no zzso zzso zzso zzso have been found in adrenal tumors, excluding the zzso zzso as a relevant zzso for adrenal zzso However, the zzso zzso may play a role as a differentiation factor, as loss of zzso for the zzso zzso in adrenal tumors seems to be associated with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in benign adrenal tumors is strongly related to the expression of zzso side chain zzso zzso zzso indicating a close zzso zzso However, this correlation is disrupted in adrenal zzso an observation which may help in the difficult differential diagnosis between benign and zzso zzso Surprisingly, the highest zzso zzso zzso expression was found in zzso while it is low in zzso zzso and zzso No correlation between zzso zzso zzso expression and circulating zzso levels has been found in patients with adrenal disorders casting doubts on the zzso significance of zzso zzso zzso by its own zzso in zzso
