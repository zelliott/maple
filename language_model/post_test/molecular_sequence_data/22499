In order to meet zzso challenges in the gastrointestinal zzso enteric bacteria rapidly accumulate zzso of zzso and other weak organic zzso The ensuing zzso zzso is zzso by unknown elements at zzso zzso zzso Here we identify DNA elements needed for high levels of zzso in the presence of salt and zzso and show that they are associated with the zzso regions of target zzso zzso zzso region sequences are shown to specify zzso zzso zzso at the zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso in zzso are isolated that contribute to bypassing the salt response and most of these cluster in a small segment corresponding to the zzso zzso DNA recognition zzso of the zzso Overall, the data suggest that an ensemble of zzso region elements exists at zzso promoters and these can help mediate responsiveness to zzso challenges through interactions involving region 4 of the zzso zzso
