We report here on the isolation and repertoire characterization of a zzso zzso T cell population which, unlike most zzso zzso T cell zzso reported before, was rich in zzso T cells zzso all zzso gamma zzso and zzso T cells zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso gamma zzso zzso Only zzso of the isolated T cells were zzso By contrast, zzso zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells from the same patient were gamma zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso analysis of 18 zzso delta zzso prepared from these cells indicated the presence of at least 17 different gamma zzso T cell zzso with zzso zzso zzso site zzso As opposed to most peripheral blood gamma zzso T cells zzso V delta 2 zzso 13 of the 17 different zzso delta zzso used a V delta 1 zzso although zzso amplification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with V zzso and V zzso zzso zzso confirmed usage of all 4 V gamma and all 6 V delta zzso zzso analysis of 21 zzso alpha zzso from a zzso zzso zzso library indicated the presence of at least 12 different zzso using 8 different V alpha gene families and zzso zzso site zzso These results are in contrast with the selective V alpha gene usage reported for other zzso T cell zzso in zzso zzso zzso
