The zzso remnant zzso zzso of zzso zzso produces zzso that is active against closely related zzso zzso had not been characterized previously in other zzso zzso Here, we show zzso production in six different strains of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was found to possess a highly zzso remnant zzso cluster zzso zzso of the zzso sheath gene resulted in loss of zzso activity, indicating that the zzso locus was required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso contain a zzso zzso a zzso gene involved in stabilization of zzso complexes and are zzso with zzso C, suggesting that both zzso are regulated by zzso of the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso lack typical zzso zzso genes but contain a predicted zzso gene zzso that may be involved in cell zzso The main tail fibers of zzso and zzso are mosaic structures with divergent zzso regions suggesting they differ in host zzso Several genes zzso zzso tail fiber fragments are present in the same position in zzso and zzso zzso between the main fiber genes and the zzso fragments could potentially expand the host range specificity of zzso in the respective zzso
