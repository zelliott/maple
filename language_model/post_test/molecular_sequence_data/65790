zzso necrosis zzso zzso production is regulated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso increasing zzso zzso zzso also activates the zzso protein zzso zzso resulting in stabilization and enhanced translation of the zzso zzso In addition, nuclear export of the zzso zzso is a zzso regulated process involving the zzso zzso and requiring the presence of the zzso zzso element zzso We demonstrate that nuclear export of the zzso message requires not only the zzso ARE but also the interaction of the proteins TAP and zzso both of which are involved in zzso transport of zzso Through the use of dominant negative zzso and zzso we establish that control of zzso zzso nuclear export operates specifically through zzso Finally, we examined the role of two established zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that shuttle between the nucleus and zzso These data demonstrate that neither zzso nor zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso It is unclear at this time if zzso zzso directly interact with the zzso complex, if each complex is independently targeted by zzso or if only one complex is zzso
