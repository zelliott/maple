zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso including the variable zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined for representative species from the 4 zzso species zzso On an alignment of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (with zzso zzso chosen as an zzso both maximum likelihood and maximum zzso analyses provide a robust molecular zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso both domain D1 and domain zzso yielded similarly zzso data whereas D3 failed to resolve the zzso These results confirm a zzso previously suggested by zzso zzso gene zzso corroborating the status of zzso zzso as a sister zzso to zzso zzso and demonstrate the utility of zzso zzso gene sequence data for resolving zzso within the zzso
