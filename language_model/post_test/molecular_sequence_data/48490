zzso zzso 9 zzso is a component of the innate immune system, which recognizes the DNA of both pathogens and zzso Thus, it can drive zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed inside the zzso block zzso protein functions by zzso the zzso of the protein from the zzso to its zzso zzso Here, we describe the construction and characterization of an zzso zzso zzso zzso The respective zzso zzso comprises the variable zzso of the heavy and light chain of a zzso zzso zzso zzso towards human and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and mouse zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso of both molecules with the zzso marker zzso zzso of mouse zzso with zzso indicated that zzso interacts with its zzso zzso The expression of zzso inhibited zzso reporter gene zzso upon zzso DNA challenge but not the zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso production was inhibited in zzso zzso upon zzso with the zzso expression zzso The zzso open reading frame was integrated into an zzso zzso zzso to produce the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso specifically inhibited zzso cellular zzso zzso These data strongly indicate that zzso is a very promising experimental tool to block zzso zzso
