The ubiquitous human zzso factor zzso has been shown to interact with zzso zzso zzso and to stimulate in zzso the reactions zzso by this zzso We have previously used a zzso model to study the effect of zzso IN expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nguyen, zzso zzso zzso Dupont, zzso zzso zzso zzso of functional zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso leads to the emergence of a lethal zzso potential use for inhibitor zzso zzso zzso 29, zzso Here, we describe the effect of the zzso of the gene zzso for zzso a zzso zzso factor zzso to zzso on the zzso induced by the expression of zzso IN in zzso We observed that the zzso IN was unable to perform its lethal activity in cells where the zzso gene has been zzso suggesting that zzso may play a role in the lethal effect induced by IN in zzso zzso zzso affects neither zzso viability nor expression of zzso zzso Given the zzso between zzso and its human counterpart zzso our results suggest that this factor may be important for IN activity in infected zzso Moreover, given the important role proposed for this zzso factor in the integration step and the fact that it is zzso for cell zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso IN should become a potential target in the search for new zzso zzso
