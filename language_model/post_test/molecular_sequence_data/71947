The persistently infected carrier zzso is the critical natural zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso as zzso infection of zzso frequently occurs after breeding to such zzso Two zzso zzso that were infected during the 1984 outbreak of zzso viral zzso in central Kentucky subsequently became long-term zzso zzso zzso zzso amplified from the zzso of these two zzso were compared by sequence analysis of the six 3' open reading frames zzso 2 through zzso which zzso the four known structural proteins and two zzso zzso The major zzso of the zzso population that zzso arose within the zzso tract of each carrier zzso varied by approximately zzso per year, and the zzso of the viral zzso increased during the course of long-term persistent zzso The various zzso of the dominant zzso zzso evolved zzso and there was apparently strong selective pressure on the zzso zzso protein during persistent zzso zzso acid changes also occurred in the zzso variable region of the zzso zzso This region has been previously identified as a crucial zzso domain, and selective pressures exerted on the zzso region during persistent zzso infection led to the emergence of virus zzso with distinct zzso zzso Thus, evolution of the zzso zzso that occurs during persistent infection of the zzso clearly can influence viral zzso properties such as zzso and perhaps zzso
