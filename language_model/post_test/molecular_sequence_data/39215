zzso zzso such as the zzso liver and zzso emerge at precise locations along the primitive gut zzso Although several zzso pathways have been implicated in liver formation, so far no single gene has been identified that exclusively regulates liver zzso In zzso the onset of liver zzso is marked by the localized zzso expression of zzso and zzso at 22 hours post zzso Here we used a screen for zzso affecting zzso organ zzso to identify a unique zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit profound, though zzso defects in liver zzso zzso cloning reveals that zzso encodes a previously unidentified zzso zzso zzso is expressed in restricted bilateral zzso in the lateral plate zzso directly adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso analyses show the requirement for zzso in the lateral plate zzso in agreement with the zzso properties of zzso zzso Taken together, these data reveal an unexpected positive role for zzso zzso in liver zzso and indicate a possible common theme for the localized formation of zzso zzso along the gut zzso
