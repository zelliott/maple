We cloned a zzso zzso an zzso Ran binding zzso zzso and generated transgenic zzso expressing the zzso strand of the zzso gene to understand the in zzso functions of the zzso signal zzso The transgenic plants showed enhanced primary root growth but suppressed growth of lateral zzso zzso significantly increased lateral root initiation and inhibited primary root growth in the zzso at 10 zzso several orders of magnitude lower than required to induce these responses in zzso zzso This induction was followed by a zzso of zzso in both newly emerged lateral roots and in the primary zzso ultimately resulting in the selective death of cells in the tips of both lateral and primary zzso Given the established role of Ran binding proteins in the transport of proteins into the nucleus, these findings are consistent with a model in which zzso plays a key role in the nuclear delivery of proteins that suppress zzso action and that regulate zzso progress in root zzso
