The gene zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso contains 26 zzso zzso We identified two zzso zzso clones zzso the zzso untranslated region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 1 has 69 zzso flanked by perfect zzso zzso and donor sites, with a zzso motif 25 zzso zzso zzso 0 lacks zzso or zzso motifs and is embedded in a G + zzso zzso zzso zzso The major products identified by zzso protection initiated in zzso zzso only a minority of zzso initiated in zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso identified the same major zzso start sites in zzso 0 in the atrium and zzso zzso The zzso zzso upstream of zzso 0 and the zzso zzso upstream of zzso 1 were placed upstream of a zzso reporter gene in both sense and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was observed in neuroendocrine and zzso cells with both sense zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso 0 zzso promoter containing multiple zzso box elements supported expression of zzso activity in all cell zzso zzso of reporter genes in cells that do not normally express zzso suggests a need for more upstream or zzso information, a role for zzso or a need for zzso scaffolding for zzso expression of the zzso zzso
