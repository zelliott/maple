The five human zzso zzso are suggested to play an important role in the maintenance of zzso stability through their function in DNA zzso break zzso These proteins have been found to form two distinct complexes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the recent zzso zzso zzso structure, we have used zzso modeling to design deletion zzso of the zzso zzso The models of the human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins reveal distinct zzso and zzso zzso connected by a zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso techniques, we have demonstrated that a zzso of zzso containing zzso acid zzso zzso interacts with the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and this region of zzso also interacts with zzso and zzso We have also determined that the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso while the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso binds zzso By this, we have identified the binding zzso of the zzso and zzso complexes to further characterize the interaction of these proteins and propose a scheme for the three-dimensional architecture of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso
