zzso diversity of the human gastric pathogen zzso zzso in an individual host has been zzso whether this diversity represents diversification of a founding strain or a mixed infection with distinct strain populations is not zzso To examine this issue, we analyzed multiple zzso zzso from two to four separate stomach zzso of eight adult and four pediatric patients from a zzso Mexican zzso Eleven of the 12 patients contained zzso with identical random amplified zzso DNA, amplified zzso length zzso and zzso zzso molecular zzso whereas a single adult patient had two distinct zzso Comparative zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed variation in 24 to 67 genes in zzso from patients with similar molecular zzso The one patient with distinct profiles contained two strain populations differing at 113 gene zzso including the zzso zzso island zzso zzso The two strain populations in this single host had different spatial zzso in the stomach and exhibited very limited genetic zzso The total genetic divergence and zzso genetic divergence between zzso from adults and zzso from children were not statistically zzso We also analyzed zzso obtained 15 and 90 days after experimental infection of humans and found no evidence of genetic zzso indicating that transmission to a new host does not induce rapid genetic changes in the bacterial population in the human zzso Our data suggest that humans are infected with a population of closely related strains that vary at a small number of gene zzso that this population of strains may already be present when an infection is acquired, and that even during zzso genetic exchange among distinct strains is zzso
