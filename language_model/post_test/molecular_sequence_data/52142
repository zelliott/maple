zzso coli zzso is regulated by a zzso zzso The zzso operator is 242 zzso downstream from the zzso start site and zzso zzso 62 to 67 in the zzso sequence zzso He, zzso zzso Smith, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanism by which the zzso interaction functions to repress zzso was investigated by a combination of promoter replacement experiments and zzso zzso By using a zzso promoter replacement that deleted zzso zzso DNA to position zzso zzso expression was increased zzso yet normal two- to zzso regulation was zzso This indicates that zzso control is independent of the zzso promoter and other zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation was likewise independent of coupled zzso An approximately zzso truncated in zzso zzso zzso was identified which was dependent upon zzso zzso Thus, binding of zzso zzso to the zzso operator zzso zzso zzso by a roadblock zzso The roadblock was not influenced by a zzso increase in promoter strength or by an operator zzso resulting in a zzso increase in zzso zzso
