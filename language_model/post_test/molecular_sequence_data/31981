To sequence and analyze the complete zzso DNA of Chinese zzso 

The circular 17 zzso zzso sequence of zzso DNA zzso of Chinese zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This zzso contained 37 coding genes (including 22 zzso 2 zzso and 13 zzso zzso and two control regions zzso and zzso The gene content and arrangement of Chinese zzso zzso was similar to those of other zzso reported so zzso 

The characteristics of the replication origin and the zzso arrangement of snake zzso zzso can be used for identification of medicinal zzso
