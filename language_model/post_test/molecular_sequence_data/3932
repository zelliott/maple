The expression of zzso zzso a known zzso was suppressed in a transplanted rat zzso because of promoter zzso and was induced by heavy metals only after zzso by zzso zzso Treatment of the zzso rats with zzso resulted in significant zzso of the zzso When the zzso tumor was allowed to grow in a new host, zzso promoter was zzso which suggested de zzso zzso The activities of both de zzso zzso and maintenance DNA zzso zzso zzso were higher in the zzso than in the host zzso The zzso levels of the de zzso zzso zzso and zzso were 3- and zzso higher, respectively, in the tumor implicating zzso zzso of these two genes in this zzso zzso analysis showed exclusive zzso of zzso in the zzso of both the liver and zzso whereas zzso was detected in the zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso showed that the levels of zzso zzso and zzso proteins in the zzso were zzso zzso and zzso higher, respectively, than in the zzso The zzso level of the major zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso higher in the tumor compared with the zzso zzso studies showed that zzso is localized exclusively in the zzso of both zzso A zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was associated with the zzso promoter in the zzso implicating its involvement in zzso the zzso zzso Analysis of the DNA isolated from the liver and zzso by zzso zzso landmark zzso scanning with zzso zzso zzso showed that many genes in addition to zzso were zzso in the zzso These data demonstrate suppression of the zzso gene and probably other genes in a solid tumor by promoter zzso and have provided potential molecular mechanisms for the altered zzso profile of the genes in this zzso
