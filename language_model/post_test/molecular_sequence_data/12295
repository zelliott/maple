When the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was exposed to 1 zzso zzso it zzso approximately fourfold increased levels of three zzso copper response zzso zzso zzso The members of the zzso protein trio had apparent molecular masses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and were zzso together from the culture zzso and separated from each other by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of the three proteins were essentially zzso and zzso raised against one of the trio reacted with all three proteins and with three other zzso proteins with slightly higher molecular zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of one of these larger proteins was different from that of the zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso which encodes the zzso zzso was cloned and zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The zzso sequence predicts that the zzso zzso is zzso as a precursor with an zzso leader zzso containing 28 zzso acid zzso that is removed during the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was initiated zzso zzso upstream from the zzso zzso producing an approximately zzso zzso transcript that was present in zzso zzso zzso cells under all growth conditions but that increased approximately fourfold in zzso in response to zzso zzso The zzso proteins appear to be zzso since they react with zzso A and zzso and to be the products of one gene that have different levels of zzso zzso This is supported by very similar zzso and zzso properties, identical zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and the detection of only one zzso sequence by Southern zzso Western blots zzso showed no evidence for zzso proteins in cell zzso of several other zzso zzso
