zzso inversion of the G segment in zzso zzso DNA is promoted by two zzso the DNA zzso zzso and the host factor zzso zzso occurs if the zzso sites zzso are arranged as zzso repeats and a zzso zzso sequence is present in zzso zzso reactions as well as deletions between direct repeats of the zzso rarely zzso Making use of a zzso zzso of zzso coli we have devised a scheme to isolate gin zzso that have a zzso independent zzso This zzso zzso is caused by single zzso acid changes at five different positions of zzso The zzso proteins display a whole set of new properties in zzso they promote zzso deletions and zzso zzso in an zzso and zzso zzso The zzso differ in zzso zzso The most active zzso protein was zzso in zzso The loss of site orientation specificity was accompanied with the ability to recombine even linear zzso We discuss these results in connection with the role of the zzso and zzso protein in the zzso zzso
