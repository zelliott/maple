zzso diabetes zzso zzso is a clinically and genetically zzso zzso zzso diabetes of the young zzso an zzso dominant form of zzso has been used as a model for genetic studies of zzso We recently reported linkage between markers on zzso zzso and diabetes in zzso of our French zzso zzso To evaluate if this gene is also implicated in zzso zzso we performed linkage studies between two markers of the zzso region and diabetes in zzso families with zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso methods were used in a total of 600 affected zzso zzso was rejected in this population by all methods, zzso that the zzso gene on zzso zzso is not a major gene for zzso zzso in this zzso However, we cannot exclude a zzso role in a zzso disorder or an important role in some zzso
