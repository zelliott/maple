Human zzso zzso zzso are composed of one of the four small Y zzso and at least two zzso zzso and zzso association of additional proteins including the zzso protein and zzso has been suggested, but clear-cut evidence is still zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso extracts allowed characterization of several zzso of zzso zzso with estimated molecular masses of between 150 and 550 zzso The majority of these complexes contained zzso and zzso whereas only a small proportion of zzso appeared to be associated with zzso zzso To identify novel Y zzso proteins in zzso binding of zzso proteins to zzso Y zzso was zzso In these zzso experiments, several proteins with estimated molecular masses of 80, 68, 65, 62, 60 and 53 zzso the latter two being zzso distinct from zzso and zzso respectively, appeared to bind specifically to Y zzso Furthermore, zzso to these proteins were found in zzso from patients with systemic lupus zzso The proteins bound zzso to zzso and zzso zzso but, with the exception of the zzso zzso only zzso to zzso zzso and not at all to zzso zzso zzso of the 80, 68, 65, and zzso proteins by zzso to zzso and La was observed, suggesting that at least a proportion of the novel proteins may reside on the same particles as La and/or zzso Finally, the binding sites for these proteins on zzso zzso were clearly distinct from the zzso site involving a portion of the large central loop 2, which was found to be indispensable for binding of the 80, 68, 65 and zzso zzso as well as the stem zzso 3 and stem zzso 1 zzso Interestingly, zzso of the zzso site resulted in decreased binding of the novel proteins (but not of zzso indicating La to be required for efficient zzso Taken together, these results suggest the existence of further zzso of zzso zzso or Y zzso consistent with the zzso characteristics observed for these particles in the zzso zzso zzso
