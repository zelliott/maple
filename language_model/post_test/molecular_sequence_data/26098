zzso of the two zzso of cardiac zzso heavy chain zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso in zzso is regulated zzso by a variety of zzso including serum hormone zzso Less is known about the factors that regulate zzso gene expression in rapidly growing cardiac muscle in zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the two zzso genes and the two zzso zzso light chain zzso genes expressed in cardiac muscle, we have investigated the zzso and spatial pattern of expression of these different genes in the developing mouse heart by in zzso zzso Between zzso and 8 d post zzso zzso the newly formed cardiac tube begins to express zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene transcripts at high levels throughout the zzso As a distinct zzso chamber forms between 8 and 9 d zzso zzso beta zzso begin to be restricted to zzso zzso This process is complete by zzso d zzso During this time, zzso alpha zzso levels decrease in zzso muscle cells but continue to be expressed at high levels in zzso muscle zzso zzso alpha transcripts continue to decrease in zzso zzso until 16 d zzso when they are zzso at low levels, but then increase, and finally replace zzso beta zzso in zzso muscle by 7 d after zzso Like zzso zzso zzso transcripts become restricted to zzso zzso but at a slower zzso zzso zzso continue to be detected at low levels in zzso cells until zzso d zzso zzso zzso levels gradually decrease but are still zzso in zzso cells until a few days after zzso This dynamic pattern of changes in the zzso zzso in the prenatal mouse heart suggests that there are different regulatory mechanisms for zzso expression of zzso zzso during cardiac zzso
