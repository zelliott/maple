zzso B virus is zzso in zzso Our aim was to zzso characterize zzso B virus from Sudanese individuals, with and without liver disease, because zzso play an important role in clinical manifestation and treatment zzso 

Ninety-nine patients - 30 zzso 42 zzso 15 with zzso zzso 7 with acute zzso and 5 with chronic zzso were zzso zzso of surface and basic core zzso regions and complete zzso were zzso 

The mean zzso standard zzso age was zzso years and the male to female ratio zzso The median zzso zzso of zzso B virus DNA and zzso zzso levels were zzso zzso log zzso and 30 zzso zzso zzso Using three zzso methods, zzso zzso could be zzso Forty eight percent of the 99 patients were infected with zzso D and zzso with zzso zzso zzso with putative zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso Patients infected with zzso E had higher frequency of zzso B e zzso and higher viral loads compared to patients infected with zzso zzso Basic core zzso region zzso including the zzso in 37% of zzso individuals, could account for zzso B e zzso zzso deletion zzso were found in zzso D and zzso Three zzso had the vaccine escape zzso zzso 

Sudanese zzso B virus carriers were mainly infected with zzso D or zzso with patients infected with zzso E having higher zzso and higher viral zzso This is the first study to zzso characterize zzso B virus from liver disease patients in zzso
