The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso E1 component from the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso complex zzso has been determined at a resolution of zzso zzso The zzso coli zzso E1 component zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso with an intact zzso in an zzso zzso Each zzso zzso consists of three zzso zzso middle, and zzso with all having zzso zzso The functional zzso contains two zzso centers located at the interface between zzso The zzso zzso are bound in the zzso zzso in zzso between the two zzso zzso involves the zzso and middle zzso and there is a common zzso binding zzso The zzso are completely zzso as only the C2 atoms are accessible from solution through the active site zzso zzso structural differences are observed between individual zzso of zzso relative to zzso zzso complex E1 components operating on zzso chain zzso These differences may be responsible for reported alternative zzso binding modes to zzso components within the respective zzso This paper represents the first structural example of a functional zzso zzso zzso component from any zzso It also provides the first representative example for the entire family of zzso zzso E1 zzso complex zzso and should serve as a model for this class of zzso
