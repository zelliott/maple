Analysis of zzso in two zzso zzso twins offers novel information on the zzso of expressed sequences zzso to the zzso factor VIII zzso These patients show an inversion that, in contrast to the common zzso responsible for zzso of all zzso A, affects the first rather than zzso 22 of the zzso This zzso the most zzso of the factor VIII zzso zzso 1) by approximately 100 zzso towards the zzso and close to the region of the zzso zzso This novel inversion creates two hybrid zzso zzso one formed by the promoter and first zzso of the factor VIII gene followed by a widely expressed zzso the other by the promoter and coding region of the zzso gene plus most of the factor VIII gene zzso of zzso 1 and zzso zzso Investigation of this zzso unit reveals that the zzso gene has an zzso zzso in the region coding for the previously described zzso tail of the zzso Furthermore, zzso located beyond the known zzso sequence and present in normal transcripts zzso zzso zzso of the factor VIII gene in the hybrid zzso of the zzso zzso The factor VIII sequences in this hybrid zzso are not expected to be expressed because they lack the first zzso zzso the zzso and follow a translation stop in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region suggest that this region may be somewhat zzso
