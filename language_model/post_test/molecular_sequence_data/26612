The potentially important role of northern zzso during zzso zzso is challenging the view of southern Europe as a refuge and source area of European zzso In zzso large geographic ranges of presumably good zzso are increasingly suspected to consist of zzso of cryptic species with narrow zzso Moreover, a large species range, even when confirmed by molecular evidence, tells us little about the zzso dynamics of zzso Here, we used zzso zzso species zzso methods and zzso zzso diffusion models to test for the likelihood of zzso colonization from distant zzso among five zzso of zzso zzso zzso All zzso except one were zzso but they comprised a total of 15-17 cryptic zzso Three cryptic species retained ranges that spanned a distance zzso similar to that of the nominal zzso zzso diffusion models based on zzso markers revealed considerable zzso zzso in zzso rates, suggesting that zzso zzso windows were instrumental in shaping species zzso Only one species was found to experience a recent, presumably zzso range zzso The Jura and Alpine zzso probably played a major role in maintaining diversity within zzso in northern regions by acting both as diversification hotspots and zzso zzso zzso insight into the zzso zzso of zzso rates revealed contrasting colonization dynamics among species that were not consistent with a global zzso colonization of Europe from distant zzso
