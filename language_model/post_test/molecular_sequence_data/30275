The crystal structure of zzso has been determined as part of a project to study the mechanism of the zzso transition in zzso The zzso unit contains two zzso and the equivalent of zzso water zzso partially zzso over 12 zzso zzso The two zzso zzso form a duplex with zzso zzso and a right-handed zzso zzso zzso with previously determined structures of the B and A zzso showed that this duplex is closer to B than to A but significantly different from zzso It zzso to a stretched out zzso with a 4 A rise per base pair and a zzso twist of 32 zzso This structure may serve as a model for the zzso of DNA in certain zzso The zzso at the zzso zzso is zzso and a zzso based on this assignment, is presented for the zzso transition in zzso
