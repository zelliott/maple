Several zzso with the zzso zzso zzso sequence have been identified in the zzso of a variety of zzso The present study was conducted to isolate novel zzso peptides from the zebra zzso zzso zzso were isolated by zzso zzso using an zzso that zzso avian zzso zzso The isolated zzso consisted of 25 zzso acids with zzso at its zzso The sequence was zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso has revealed that the identified zzso is the zebra zzso zzso We also cloned the precursor zzso zzso this zzso zzso analysis of the gene showed a high conservation of this gene among zzso In addition, we cloned the zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso G zzso zzso 103 zzso in the zebra zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a 432 zzso acid protein that has seven zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis in the brain showed that the expression of zzso zzso is confined to the zzso zzso area, zzso nucleus of the zzso and the lateral zzso area, the brain regions that are involved in the regulation of feeding zzso whereas zzso zzso is distributed throughout the brain in addition to the zzso zzso When administered centrally in zzso male zebra zzso zzso increased food intake 24 h after injection without body mass zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso by zzso for 10 zzso Our data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso system plays an important role in the central control of food intake and energy zzso in the zebra zzso
