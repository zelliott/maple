zzso of the rat gene designated zzso is rapidly and markedly induced by zzso zzso in the zzso We have used nuclear zzso zzso and zzso studies to explore the basis of this zzso These studies indicate that zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso is due primarily, if not exclusively, to changes in the rate of gene zzso Both alpha and beta forms of the zzso hormone zzso zzso can activate zzso promoter activity in a zzso zzso This zzso occurs in a zzso manner and requires the expression of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso in either zzso cells or primary rat zzso zzso of sequences essential for control of zzso promoter activity indicates that multiple zzso hormone response elements zzso are zzso These zzso have been localized in the far upstream zzso region of the zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso from the zzso zzso initiation zzso zzso studies with in zzso translated zzso indicate that each of the zzso zzso contains a specific binding site for the zzso The location of the zzso zzso far upstream from the promoter site may zzso the presence of multiple zzso for hormonal zzso
