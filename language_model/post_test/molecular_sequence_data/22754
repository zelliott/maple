Human zzso zzso zzso zzso is a component of a zzso complex consisting of at least nine zzso zzso and three auxiliary zzso In zzso cells, zzso is present as a free protein as well as a component of the zzso Via an alignment of zzso from different zzso the genes zzso full-length human zzso zzso and an zzso zzso acid deletion zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The two zzso products were expressed as a soluble protein in zzso zzso The level of production of zzso in zzso coli and its specific activity were higher than those for zzso By Western zzso analysis, using an zzso against the zzso zzso the two forms of zzso were detected in three human cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso as confirmed by zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso contained three start zzso Through zzso of the three zzso the two human zzso zzso were found to be produced in different zzso indicating that they resulted from two different translation initiation zzso Here we show evidence that two forms of human zzso zzso were produced from two zzso zzso by a single zzso
