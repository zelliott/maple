The crystal structure at zzso A resolution of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso in complex with its zzso acid zzso zzso has been zzso In the crystal zzso unit there are two zzso each zzso containing zzso zzso acid zzso Each zzso of the zzso consists of three zzso zzso an zzso zzso domain containing a zzso zzso zzso and the three motifs common to all class II zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso domain which is common to most class zzso zzso and is probably involved in recognizing the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso a zzso zzso domain inserted into the zzso domain, between motifs II and zzso The position of the zzso domain above the zzso site suggests that it could clamp onto the zzso stem of the zzso during zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are intimately involved in forming the binding site for the zzso a zzso of which is found in the active site of each zzso The structure of zzso in complex with zzso zzso produced zzso in the zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso This structure shows that the zzso zzso interacts directly with the zzso of the zzso on the opposite side to the usual zzso motif 2 zzso zzso thus zzso for the zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso and plays a crucial zzso role in the mechanism of zzso zzso
