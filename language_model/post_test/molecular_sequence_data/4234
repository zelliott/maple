In normal mice, major zzso complex zzso proteins are bound to many different zzso derived from the proteins of their zzso In the zzso the diversity of this collection of zzso + zzso zzso allows zzso bearing many different T cell receptors zzso to mature by low zzso reactions between the zzso + zzso zzso and the zzso zzso To investigate this problem, the selection of T cells specific for a well-studied combination of zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso c zzso zzso was zzso Mice were created that expressed zzso bound to a single zzso either a zzso of zzso in which a critical zzso contact zzso zzso was changed to A, or a zzso of a mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso caused the zzso deletion of some T cells specific for the zzso + zzso zzso zzso it also positively selected many T cells that could react with this zzso Some of the zzso on the selected T cells were related to those on cells from normal mice and some were zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso on the other hand, did not select any T cells which could react with zzso + zzso These results demonstrate that although positive selection is a partially zzso event, the sequence of the zzso involved in positive selection controls the selected zzso
