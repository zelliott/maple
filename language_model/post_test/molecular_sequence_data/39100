A zzso zzso which blocks zzso zzso release from isolated zzso zzso was used to isolate a novel zzso zzso zzso from a human zzso zzso cell zzso expression zzso A corresponding zzso transcript of zzso zzso zzso was present in all human cell lines and zzso zzso but cardiac and skeletal muscle had an additional transcript of zzso zzso The identification in zzso of zzso expressed sequence tags from many zzso and organisms suggests that the gene is zzso expressed in higher zzso The gene was mapped to human zzso zzso The zzso predicts a 100 zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso with two putative zzso zzso multiple consensus zzso sites, a zzso tract of 12 repeats and regions of imperfect zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso translation of the full-length zzso produced proteins of zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to protein bands detected by Western zzso of many cell zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells with the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso led to an zzso decline in zzso within 5 days of zzso zzso with markedly decreased zzso zzso zzso by zzso decreased DNA synthesis and growth arrest, indicating that the protein has an important function in zzso zzso growth and zzso
