A zzso structure of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been generated using the crystal structure of the zzso from zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso structure identified a potential zzso site zzso four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from each zzso at the zzso interface of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso throughout zzso zzso zzso zzso is only present in the zzso zzso Four zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso have been made zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso expressed and zzso From an analysis of their kinetic properties, zzso activities and zzso zzso it is concluded that this site has an important influence on the zzso of the zzso The findings support the view that the arrangement and interaction of the zzso charged zzso acids are as important as the total net charge in determining the adaptation of proteins to high salt zzso
