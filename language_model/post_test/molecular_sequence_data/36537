We have used an extract of basement zzso which can be zzso into a biologically active gel zzso composed predominantly of collagen IV, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in order to study the mechanisms involved in tumor cell zzso When layered onto a porous filter in a zzso chamber, the gel forms a barrier to the passage of normal zzso zzso cells are able to cross this layer when the zzso medium of zzso zzso cells is used as a zzso to stimulate cell zzso A variety of human tumor cells have thus been studied in this system and we find a high correlation between their zzso in zzso and their zzso behavior as exhibited in zzso We have used this in zzso invasion zzso to test for factors which might inhibit tumor cell zzso zzso IV is produced by zzso cells and is thought to be required for zzso Indeed, zzso of this zzso have demonstrated reduced tumor cell zzso One site of five zzso zzso on the B1 chain, which has been shown to promote cell zzso migration and binding to zzso zzso was found to inhibit the invasion of tumor zzso In addition, factors which elevated zzso levels were also able to suppress the zzso of tumor zzso These data suggest that the zzso system described zzso can be successfully zzso to study the invasive activity of tumor cells and those factors that may inhibit the spread of zzso zzso
