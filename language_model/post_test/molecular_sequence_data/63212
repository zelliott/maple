A novel member of the zzso gene family, designated zzso was isolated from a cadmium zzso zzso zzso zzso library by differential zzso zzso proteins specifically bind to zzso which are found in the promoters of many genes involved in defense and response to environmental zzso zzso contains a zzso open reading frame zzso a putative protein of 324 zzso zzso zzso searches showed that zzso resembles similar zzso zzso proteins from rice, parsley and zzso especially zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the expression of zzso was strongly induced by various environmental zzso including an excess of zzso drought, cold and the signal zzso salicylic acid zzso The expression of zzso in response to zzso drought and cold suggested a possible role of zzso in zzso stress zzso However, zzso tests indicated that the expression of zzso in zzso decreases tolerance to zzso during zzso root zzso This was consistent with zzso treatment of tobacco zzso and together these results indicate a negative zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso Furthermore, two zzso responsive factor zzso family zzso zzso and zzso were zzso induced in zzso transgenic zzso In contrast, a zzso family zzso zzso showed no change, suggesting that zzso might regulate the plant zzso stress response by interacting with an zzso zzso factor rather than by regulating function genes zzso
