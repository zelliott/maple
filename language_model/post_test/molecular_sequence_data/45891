To study the zzso of human zzso zzso gene in children and investigate the relationship between the zzso and zzso 

The zzso was carried out to determine the DNA quantity of clinical isolate and then the zzso zzso and zzso were performed to test the zzso of zzso zzso The typical zzso from different diseases were selected to clone and zzso then the results were zzso 

The zzso acid zzso is frequent among the sequence of zzso those zzso focus on the two ends of zzso but most of them are sense zzso The important functional groups of zzso are highly zzso The zzso acid zzso of some zzso resulted in the change of secondary structure, but the zzso tree analysis did not show any clear association between the zzso and the distribution of clinical zzso The comparison of zzso sequences from AIDS patients with the sequences from children in our study showed that both sequences have their own specific high zzso zzso 

There is zzso among the zzso gene of clinical zzso from zzso There observed no clear relationship was between the zzso and the distribution of clinical zzso
