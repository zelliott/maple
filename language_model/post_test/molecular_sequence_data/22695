The use of zzso zzso as the 21st zzso acid in the genetic code has been described in all three major zzso of zzso However, within zzso zzso are only known in animals and zzso In this study, we characterized zzso and zzso zzso systems in zzso zzso zzso We found that among these organisms, zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso did zzso However, zzso had no zzso of known zzso By searching zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso which are zzso structures involved in zzso zzso we identified four unique zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso were incorrectly zzso in zzso were zzso in other zzso and had no zzso zzso in other zzso We provide evidence that two zzso zzso elements supported zzso zzso into zzso and zzso zzso when they were expressed in zzso cells, demonstrating that the zzso zzso elements are functional and indicating conservation of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso on zzso suggests possible strategies for zzso drug zzso
