zzso sexual development and zzso function depend on precise zzso and quantitative expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene expression is achieved by zzso factors acting at highly zzso and closely spaced zzso in the zzso 200 base pairs of the zzso We now demonstrate that zzso promoter activity is further regulated by the orphan nuclear zzso chicken zzso upstream zzso factors zzso and zzso These data establish that zzso are expressed in primary zzso zzso and two zzso cell zzso zzso bind to two promoter regions in the zzso gene which overlap but are distinct from two previously defined zzso for another orphan nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso stimulate zzso gene promoter activity in the absence of zzso but blunt zzso stimulation of gene expression in a reporter construct containing both zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso containing zzso or zzso in the zzso revealed a complex pattern of zzso and zzso by zzso on this promoter, suggesting multiple mechanisms by which this factor zzso zzso gene zzso To our knowledge, these data are the first to demonstrate zzso expression and function in zzso zzso
