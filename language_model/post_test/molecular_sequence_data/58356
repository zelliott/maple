We report the use of zzso zzso in conjunction with in zzso zzso to determine the physical proximity of a pair of engineered zzso in the pore region of the zzso zzso channel zzso We show that the newly introduced zzso zzso located near the outer end of the narrow zzso pathway, renders the zzso channel sensitive to zzso by zzso but only if the native zzso at position zzso in zzso remains in zzso Conservative zzso in zzso for zzso zzso abolish zzso sensitivity in the zzso zzso zzso Comparative zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrates the presence of zzso zzso for zzso but not for zzso zzso At the single-channel level, the probability of opening of zzso channels, unlike zzso is reduced in the presence of zzso however, zzso of zzso does not alter unit zzso These findings imply that zzso zzso located near the outer end of the narrow zzso pathway, zzso in zzso bridge formation, zzso the channel in a zzso state from which it cannot undergo zzso transitions required for zzso
