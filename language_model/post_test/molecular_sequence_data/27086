Plants protect themselves from excess absorbed light energy through zzso zzso which is measured as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The major component of zzso zzso is induced by high zzso zzso in excess light and depends on the zzso cycle, in which zzso and zzso are zzso to form zzso To investigate the zzso dependence of zzso we identified zzso of zzso zzso as a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which lacks zzso zzso zzso plants have a partially restored zzso but lack zzso and have low levels of zzso zzso and zzso However, they accumulate more zzso and zzso than the wild zzso zzso contains a point zzso in the lycopene zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso analysis, zzso appears to be the major lycopene zzso and is not involved in zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein levels are reduced by 50% in zzso zzso relative to the wild type, whereas other zzso proteins are present at zzso zzso Analysis of zzso radical zzso formation and leaf zzso changes strongly suggest that the higher amount of zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso a direct role in zzso as well as a mechanism that is zzso sensitive to zzso structural zzso
