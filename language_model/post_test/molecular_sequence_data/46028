zzso zzso is a key regulator in the regulation of a number of processes including zzso duplication, maintenance of zzso integrity, and zzso zzso While the mechanisms underlying zzso function are largely zzso zzso loss results in severe zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso a zzso zzso nuclear export sequence in its zzso zzso to enable its shuttling between the zzso and zzso In search of zzso trafficking targets, we zzso zzso zzso protein complexes from zzso cell zzso zzso with zzso proposed role in zzso zzso we isolated zzso protein zzso zzso a known zzso for the zzso zzso zzso interaction of zzso with zzso zzso the zzso of zzso with maturing nuclear zzso zzso zzso as well as newly exported and assembled zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso shuttling or loss of zzso blocked the nuclear export of zzso and zzso zzso resulting in cell cycle arrest and demonstrating that zzso and its nuclear export provide a unique and necessary zzso activity to zzso
