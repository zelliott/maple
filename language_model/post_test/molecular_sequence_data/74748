A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from zzso samples from the zzso zzso zzso was able to grow at zzso degrees C, with optimum growth occurring at zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso had zzso as the major respiratory zzso and contained zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso cellular fatty zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was zzso zzso A zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso formed a coherent cluster within the zzso zzso The highest level of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity zzso zzso exhibited by strain zzso was obtained with respect to the type strain of zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso properties and zzso zzso data, strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
