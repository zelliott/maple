zzso acid zzso zzso is an important zzso that zzso the movement of replication and zzso complexes through DNA by creating negative zzso ahead of the zzso Its presence in zzso zzso is now established and considered a good drug target since it is absent in the human zzso The sequence of zzso zzso zzso A zzso was analyzed for its zzso zzso acid zzso folding as well as target accessibility for zzso The four zzso zzso sites identified at zzso zzso 1907, and zzso zzso positions of the zzso A zzso were also accessible to zzso by zzso H zzso Site zzso was zzso accessible followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were produced against all these sites and tested for their in zzso transcript zzso zzso where zzso showed the maximum zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso was chemically zzso albeit with modifications so as to make it resistant against zzso zzso The modified zzso retained its zzso potential and was able to inhibit the zzso zzso zzso growth up to zzso and zzso at 20 and 30 zzso zzso zzso respectively, as compared to the zzso zzso However, up to zzso and zzso zzso growth zzso was observed at the same zzso zzso of 20 and 30 zzso when compared with control zzso zzso This zzso as well as other targets identified here can be investigated further to develop the effective zzso agents against zzso
