zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have recently been zzso zzso have been designed coding for highly zzso zzso acid regions that are shared between sequences of zzso One of the zzso zzso referred to as 51 C, shows zzso identity to a previously reported sequence zzso present in the zzso We report here the identification of zzso for a new zzso protein showing zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and therefore referred to as zzso zzso differs at both zzso and zzso ends with the sequence of zzso The translated sequence of zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 142 zzso Particularly high levels of zzso were found in human heart, skeletal muscle and zzso as shown by Northern zzso zzso zzso was also expressed in dog zzso cells in primary culture where the expression was enhanced in zzso and zzso zzso
