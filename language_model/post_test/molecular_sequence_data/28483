The zzso of zzso zzso has been questioned, based on its zzso and genetic resemblance to zzso zzso This zzso problem has practical implications regarding correct diagnosis of zzso zzso which has proved to be highly zzso to stocks of wild Norwegian Atlantic zzso The host specificity and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso tested on salmon and zzso Both zzso species were able to zzso live and reproduce on both fish zzso zzso zzso was highly zzso for the experimental stock of zzso while zzso mounted an effective response against this zzso Both fish species responded to an infection with zzso zzso The results did not support the hypothesis of zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of both species was zzso Variation in sequence was lower than expected for different zzso Variation in the sequences of zzso repeated elements was found and may prove useful in distinguishing zzso zzso and zzso zzso
