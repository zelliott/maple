zzso is a key zzso protein in higher zzso cells and is involved directly in zzso zzso Using an zzso raised against zzso zzso the zzso protein was detected in zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as in the amplified zzso of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso The deduced protein sequence reveals similar zzso in zzso and in zzso but they have undergone separate zzso In particular, each of the four zzso zzso has evolved zzso zzso domain is twice as zzso zzso as the zzso domain zzso These data shed some light on the possible roles of each zzso The expression of zzso has been followed throughout zzso and zzso The appearance of zzso during early development precedes the zzso of zzso and the synthesis of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso with zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso synthesis is activated during zzso and zzso peptides zzso to zzso appear and zzso The results suggest that zzso plays a role not only in zzso assembly but also in zzso
