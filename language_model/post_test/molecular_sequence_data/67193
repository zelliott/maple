In order to determine gene zzso of human zzso zzso zzso and establish a panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso donors as well as an zzso zzso donor registry, a total of 1000 Chinese donors of Han nationality zzso from north China and 500 from south zzso were typed for zzso through zzso using a zzso zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso The zzso and zzso zzso donors were detected at low zzso The zzso mismatch probabilities potentially leading to zzso in random zzso zzso vary with a region from zzso to 37% depending on the distribution patterns of common and less common zzso in each zzso This study provides a useful zzso zzso donor registry in China and could improve zzso zzso detection and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
