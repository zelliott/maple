In order to test a hypothesis that the expression of zzso gene promotes zzso by zzso the function of zzso gene product, time course of the expression of zzso was investigated using the zzso rat zzso which were undergoing zzso zzso zzso suppressed the expression of zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Such decrease was detected even in the presence of zzso suggesting that the suppression is due to the zzso zzso effect of zzso Since the expression of zzso as measured by a specific zzso probe, was not detected at a quantifiable level, the decrease was apparently attributed to that in zzso Our present observations propose a new role of the zzso gene product, in which the zzso gene product may be necessary for survival of immature zzso rather than for their zzso
