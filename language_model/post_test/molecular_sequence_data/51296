zzso human zzso and zzso from a patient with zzso were grown in the presence or absence of 100 zzso zzso for 7 zzso zzso zzso were isolated and zzso by high performance liquid zzso zzso and zzso zzso Man alpha zzso beta zzso and Man alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso (where Man is zzso and zzso is zzso comprised greater than zzso of the total zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, Man alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso was the major zzso zzso present after 7 days of zzso zzso No zzso zzso were detected in control zzso in the absence of zzso but, in its presence, zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso Man alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso and Man alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso were the major components zzso Surprisingly, Man alpha zzso beta zzso was only observed in zzso control cells during the recovery period after removal of zzso These studies suggest the presence of a second zzso zzso activity which is unaffected in genetic zzso but is inhibited by zzso This zzso would cleave the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso to form Man alpha zzso beta zzso To confirm this hypothesis, zzso from zzso and control zzso that bound to zzso A zzso and were zzso with zzso M zzso zzso were incubated at pH zzso with Man alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso As anticipated, Man alpha zzso beta zzso was the sole product using zzso from zzso zzso while the major product from control zzso was Man alpha zzso beta zzso This confirmed the presence of a zzso zzso activity unaffected by the zzso The differing zzso zzso of the zzso and the major zzso zzso indicate that the zzso plays an important role in the generation of the zzso accumulated in zzso zzso
