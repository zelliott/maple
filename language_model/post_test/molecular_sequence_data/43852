The zzso zzso involved in the zzso of zzso IV by zzso zzso alpha was studied using a zzso zzso IV zzso in which zzso zzso zzso was replaced with zzso because the zzso of zzso IV occurring at multiple sites made it difficult to study zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso from the zzso digest of zzso IV zzso zzso by zzso zzso alpha suggested that the zzso of zzso IV by zzso zzso only occurred at zzso The zzso zzso zzso IV in which zzso or zzso was replaced with zzso zzso showed little activity in the presence and absence of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in which zzso was replaced with zzso charged zzso acid showed almost 25 times as high activity as the zzso zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso and no more zzso was observed in its zzso In contrast, the zzso in which zzso was replaced with zzso acid showed little zzso zzso Thus, it may be concluded that the zzso of zzso in zzso IV by zzso zzso is necessary for the subsequent zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
