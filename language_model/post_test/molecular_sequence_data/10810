A zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso gene has been identified that encodes a zzso to the zzso zzso zzso proteins that are capable of enhancing the infection of other zzso zzso genes have been identified and zzso for three species of zzso but have not been found in any other nuclear zzso virus to zzso The zzso zzso gene is located between zzso and zzso zzso on the viral zzso Northern and primer extension analyses of viral zzso indicate that the zzso gene transcripts are expressed at late times zzso from a consensus zzso late zzso The zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso acid identity to the zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All four proteins contain a zzso zzso domain characteristic of zzso A zzso virus zzso was constructed in which the zzso zzso gene was zzso by zzso zzso in order to ascertain the effect of the zzso protein on viral zzso The zzso results indicate that disruption of the zzso gene in the zzso results in a reduction in viral zzso
