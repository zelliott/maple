zzso disease virus zzso is the type member of the zzso a family of viruses that induce often fatal neurological diseases in horses, sheep and other animals, and have been proposed to have roles in certain psychiatric diseases of zzso The zzso zzso zzso is an extensively zzso protein that zzso with an apparent molecular mass of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso G is zzso zzso by the cellular zzso zzso zzso into two zzso a 41 zzso zzso terminal protein zzso and a 43 zzso zzso terminal protein zzso 

Class III viral fusion proteins zzso zzso by members of the zzso zzso and zzso have an internal fusion domain comprised of beta zzso other beta sheet zzso an extended alpha zzso domain, a membrane zzso stem domain and a zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso analyses suggest that the zzso motifs that characterize class III zzso are located zzso in zzso zzso zzso models were established for zzso G based on the zzso structure of a zzso class III zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that G zzso by members of the zzso are class III zzso zzso
