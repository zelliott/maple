zzso are zzso molecules involved in several processes outside and within the zzso As zzso molecules in the zzso they zzso the establishment of zzso zzso zzso but they also act as host detection cues for root zzso zzso As zzso they are involved in the regulation of plant architecture, zzso zzso secondary growth and zzso development, and novel roles are emerging zzso In the present study, the possible involvement of zzso in plant zzso responses was zzso For this purpose, the zzso of the zzso tomato zzso zzso against the zzso zzso pathogens zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso was more susceptible to both zzso pointing to a new role for zzso in plant zzso A reduction in the content of the zzso hormones zzso acid, salicylic acid and zzso acid was detected by zzso liquid zzso coupled to tandem mass zzso in the zzso zzso suggesting that hormone zzso is altered in the zzso Moreover, the expression level of the zzso gene zzso involved in the resistance of tomato to zzso zzso was lower than in the corresponding zzso We propose here that zzso play a role in the regulation of plant zzso through their interaction with other zzso hormones, especially with the zzso acid zzso zzso
