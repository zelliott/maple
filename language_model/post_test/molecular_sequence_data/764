In plants, zzso is a central mechanism of cell zzso We still know surprisingly little about some aspects of this process, starting with zzso zzso formation, which may take place at the zzso network even without coat assistance, facilitated by the local regulation of membrane zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso recruiting zzso to the zzso network, is a candidate zzso formation zzso However, in plant cells, there are obviously additional zzso source compartments for zzso zzso The zzso zzso regulatory module is central for the initiation of zzso active zzso in plant cell zzso zzso cortical zzso Most plant cells exhibit several distinct plasma membrane zzso established and maintained by zzso membrane zzso We propose the concept of a zzso zzso uniting the activated cortical domain and the connected zzso zzso as a dynamic zzso zzso We have recently described the zzso zzso complex in plant zzso As a result of the zzso of its putative zzso zzso this complex may belong to core regulators of recycling domain organization, including the generation of multiple recycling zzso within a single zzso The conventional textbook concept that the plant zzso zzso is largely zzso is zzso
