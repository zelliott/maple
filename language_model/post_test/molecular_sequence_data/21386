Using a combination of advanced zzso synthesis techniques and single zzso zzso the zzso of individual contributions of zzso modifications to the overall folding and stabilization of human zzso zzso is zzso An unexpected zzso effect of two zzso on the native zzso folding was zzso Furthermore, the presence of zzso alone does not facilitate the folding of zzso but a stabilization of the biologically functional zzso shape in conjunction with the principal stabilizing component zzso exceeds the contribution of zzso zzso This constitutes an unprecedented cooperative effect of two zzso modifications in the context of a naturally occurring zzso which may be of general importance for zzso structure and help understanding several recently described zzso pathways for zzso zzso
