Human zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso responsible for the zzso of terminal zzso zzso from zzso and is the defective zzso causing zzso disease zzso zzso An zzso elevated level of plasma zzso A activity zzso zzso times the normal zzso was detected in two unrelated normal males and the elevated activities were inherited as zzso traits in their zzso zzso of the zzso A coding region, zzso boundaries and zzso region from the zzso identified a single zzso a zzso transition 30 zzso upstream from the initiation of translation zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso occurred in a putative zzso zzso zzso consensus binding site that was recently shown to inhibit protein binding to the zzso region of the zzso providing a possible explanation for its high zzso To further characterize the zzso the zzso and protein expressed by this zzso zzso were zzso zzso plasma and zzso zzso A activity from individuals with the zzso zzso had normal physical and kinetic zzso In zzso translation of zzso from the cloned normal and high plasma activity zzso resulted in similar levels of zzso A zzso indicating that this zzso did not enhance zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso A gene enhances transcription, presumably by interfering with the binding of zzso zzso factors which normally decrease zzso A expression in various zzso zzso studies of the frequency of the zzso zzso in 395 unrelated normal males of mixed ancestry revealed two additional unrelated individuals who had high plasma zzso activity and the zzso confirming the effect of this zzso on zzso expression and suggesting that about zzso of normal individuals have high plasma zzso A activity due to this zzso zzso
