zzso of double strand breaks zzso is coupled to zzso and zzso zzso in zzso We show that also in a higher zzso induction of zzso is directly correlated with a strong enhancement of zzso zzso We zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso carrying a synthetic zzso zzso coding for a highly sequence specific zzso together with zzso zzso carrying an zzso adjacent to their zzso zzso We measured efficiencies of zzso zzso using a well established transient zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities were strongly increased when a zzso carrying the zzso gene in sense but not in zzso orientation with respect to the promoter was included in the zzso The in zzso induced zzso were detected in the zzso zzso by Southern zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso is functional in plant zzso At high ratios of zzso zzso to zzso the majority of the zzso in the zzso zzso are zzso indicating that the induction of the zzso is the rate limiting step in the described zzso zzso These results imply that in zzso induction of transient breaks at specific sites in the plant zzso could allow foreign DNA to be targeted to these sites via zzso zzso
