In zzso failing human hearts and in rat hearts after prolonged in zzso zzso treatment, several proteins involved in the zzso signal zzso are altered on the zzso zzso or zzso level, zzso zzso zzso or proteins of zzso zzso In many zzso zzso zzso regulation occurs through the zzso response element binding protein zzso and related zzso factors binding as zzso to zzso response elements zzso in the promoter regions of regulated zzso 

To investigate a possible role of zzso in the human heart, nuclear protein of zzso failing and zzso human hearts was used to test for zzso specific binding properties in gel mobility shift zzso zzso specific binding was found in competition studies, and zzso and its zzso form were zzso identified in zzso zzso The alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be expressed on the zzso level by the reverse zzso chain zzso 

We conclude that in the failing and zzso human heart, zzso is expressed on the protein and zzso levels and that zzso is zzso and able to bind to zzso indicating a functional role of zzso in the human zzso
