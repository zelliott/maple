By using complete sequence data of zzso zzso three zzso models zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso acid zzso during evolution were applied in maximum likelihood analyses of zzso zzso proteins to estimate a zzso tree depicting human, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso with chicken, frog, and carp as zzso A zzso zzso was confirmed with a more than zzso confidence level by any of the three models, but the branching order among human, zzso and the zzso zzso remained zzso It turned out that the zzso model is by far the most appropriate model among the alternatives in zzso the zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is consistent with a previous analysis of a more limited data zzso It was shown that the substitution rate of zzso zzso proteins has increased in the order of fishes, zzso birds, and zzso and that the rate in zzso is at least six times, probably an order of zzso higher than that in zzso The higher evolutionary rate in birds and zzso than in zzso and zzso was attributed to relaxation of selective constraints operating on proteins in zzso zzso and to high zzso rate of bird and zzso zzso zzso
