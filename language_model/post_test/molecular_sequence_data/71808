zzso of zzso zzso requires the function of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recent studies have suggested that zzso and zzso zzso interact extensively with each other, as well as with the zzso by zzso base zzso The overall structure and many of the sequences are very similar to the highly zzso analogous regions of zzso and U2 zzso We have identified the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the plant zzso zzso These zzso are significantly zzso from human, showing overall identities of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso However, there is almost complete conservation of the sequences and structures that are implicated in zzso The sequence of plant zzso zzso shows complete conservation of the zzso that base pair to the zzso zzso site sequences of zzso zzso in zzso The immediately adjacent zzso zzso which is found in human zzso and all zzso zzso is also zzso High conservation is also observed in the sequences of zzso and zzso that are believed to base pair with each zzso The zzso zzso zzso structure immediately adjacent to the zzso interaction region differs from the human sequence in 9 out of 21 zzso Most of these differences are in base pairing regions with zzso changes occurring across the zzso To show that this zzso was functional, it was transplanted into a human zzso zzso zzso expression zzso This zzso zzso was inactive in zzso but could be rescued by zzso of a zzso zzso expression construct containing zzso zzso that restored base pairing to the zzso zzso zzso These data show that base pairing of zzso zzso to zzso zzso has a required role in zzso and that the plant zzso zzso zzso is the functional analog of the human zzso
