zzso zzso labeling of proteins with zzso zzso acids enables the study of zzso changes in specified zzso of complex zzso zzso For example, zzso zzso and zzso acid, both of which are activated by an engineered zzso zzso zzso zzso are excluded from proteins made in zzso cells but incorporated readily into proteins made in cells that carry zzso To expand the set of tools available for zzso zzso zzso we sought a zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso was chosen as the target zzso acid because its zzso side chain can be selectively and efficiently zzso to zzso zzso zzso and affinity zzso Directed evolution, using zzso zzso and zzso zzso yielded a zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of incorporating zzso at zzso levels into proteins made in a zzso strain of zzso coli cultured in zzso zzso zzso made in zzso coli strains expressing zzso were labeled with zzso in zzso media as shown by zzso zzso after zzso to zzso The combined use of zzso and zzso enabled zzso zzso labeling of marker proteins derived from two bacterial strains zzso in media supplemented with Met, zzso and zzso Treatment of the mixed marker proteins by sequential zzso and zzso zzso allowed straightforward identification of the cellular origin of each zzso
