Previous studies from this laboratory have provided evidence that the zzso of the zzso heavy chain constant region gene zzso gamma zzso in the zzso myeloma cell line zzso occurred via unequal sister zzso zzso We now report the determination of the DNA sequences of the zzso regions in which this exchange has zzso The two donor sequences have long regions of virtual zzso Furthermore, both zzso contain stretches of zzso and zzso zzso the latter has the potential to form zzso zzso of the actual zzso via zzso Southern zzso analysis suggests a novel mechanism for the zzso and strongly implicates the simple sequence in the zzso
