The zzso protein of influenza A virus forms a zzso channel that is required for viral zzso It is the target of the zzso drugs, zzso and zzso zzso drug resistant zzso however, has greatly compromised the effectiveness of these zzso Here, we report the solution zzso structure of the highly zzso drug resistant zzso zzso The structure reveals subtle structural differences from zzso that maybe linked to drug zzso The zzso zzso significantly decreases zzso packing between the zzso ends of the zzso zzso which explains the zzso more dynamic zzso zzso The weakened channel assembly can resist drug binding either by zzso the zzso pocket at zzso in the case of the zzso zzso model, or by reducing zzso contacts with zzso in the zzso in the case of the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso structure shows a substantially increased channel opening at the zzso end, which may explain the faster zzso zzso observed for this zzso Furthermore, due to the high quality zzso data recorded for the zzso zzso we were able to determine the structured region connecting the channel domain to the zzso zzso zzso that was not determined in the zzso zzso The new structural data show that the zzso zzso are packed much more closely to the channel domain and provide new insights into the zzso transfer zzso
