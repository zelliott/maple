zzso is a zzso plant protein that occurs in several zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose B chains are believed to either have zzso and zzso or lack zzso and zzso the ability to bind zzso The zzso signal sequence and toxin B chain zzso region were excised from a zzso zzso zzso zzso Wood, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tentatively identified as zzso which was predicted to lack zzso activity, and fused zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso from zzso cloned into the zzso zzso zzso were expressed after zzso into zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso using a qualitative zzso zzso to be devoid of zzso zzso zzso activity could not be restored to this zzso zzso by replacing the 2 gamma zzso with the corresponding zzso 2 gamma zzso from zzso B chain, but it was restored by replacement with the active zzso 2 gamma zzso from a different zzso zzso zzso The putative zzso pocket of the zzso zzso 2 gamma zzso contained a His zzso at the position occupied by a zzso with an aromatic side chain zzso or zzso in functional 2 gamma zzso zzso converting this His to either zzso or zzso restored zzso activity to the zzso zzso emphasizing the contribution of an aromatic side chain in a functional 2 gamma zzso zzso site for members of this zzso zzso
