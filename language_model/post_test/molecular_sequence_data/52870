Plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been considered to constitute a family of functionally and structurally zzso intrinsic membrane zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Kim, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso from zzso all characterized plant zzso share greater than zzso sequence identity and catalyze zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the molecular and zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso active in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The differences between zzso and zzso provide the first indication that plant zzso from the same zzso fall into two distinct zzso zzso analyses of these and other zzso sequences extend this principle by showing that zzso rather than being an zzso of zzso is but one representative of a novel category of zzso zzso zzso zzso that coexist with zzso zzso I) zzso not only in plants, but also in zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso
