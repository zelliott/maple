Biological formation of methane is the terminal process of biomass degradation in aquatic zzso where zzso zzso zzso iron and zzso have been depleted as electron zzso The zzso leading from dead biomass to methane through the metabolism of zzso bacteria and zzso is well understood for easily zzso zzso such as zzso proteins and zzso However, little is known about the organic compounds that lead to methane in old zzso sediments where easily zzso zzso are no longer zzso One class of naturally formed zzso compounds in such sediments is the saturated zzso zzso zzso are usually considered to be zzso in the absence of zzso nitrate or zzso and the analysis of zzso patterns is often used for zzso characterization of zzso However, zzso might be consumed in zzso sediments below the zone of zzso reduction, but the underlying process has not been zzso Here we used enrichment cultures to show that the biological conversion of zzso zzso to the simplest zzso zzso is possible under strictly zzso zzso
