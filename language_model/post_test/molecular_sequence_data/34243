zzso zzso zzso zzso has been studied in detail in the fungus zzso zzso The genes and zzso for this zzso zzso are known until the last zzso step, the zzso of the zzso group of its zzso zzso On the basis of sequence zzso to zzso zzso zzso which mediates the formation of zzso acid from the corresponding zzso zzso we cloned the zzso gene of zzso zzso and investigated the activity of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso performed with zzso expressed protein showed the formation of zzso and other zzso acids from the corresponding zzso To confirm this function in zzso we generated an zzso coli strain producing zzso which was converted into zzso upon expression of zzso Moreover, the zzso function was substantiated by its targeted disruption in a zzso zzso zzso strain, which resulted in the loss of zzso and the zzso of zzso its zzso zzso and minor amounts of other zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso zzso suggest that the reactions leading to zzso in zzso and zzso are different in their zzso In contrast to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso content is enhanced by light, but to a lesser extent than other zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso levels were higher in zzso zzso supporting a functional role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso With the genetic and zzso characterization of zzso the whole zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been zzso
