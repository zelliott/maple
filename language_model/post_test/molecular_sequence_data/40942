Five zzso bacterial strains were enriched and isolated from soil samples collected from different agricultural sites in Cairo, zzso zzso was used as a sole source of carbon zzso to zzso zzso zzso which were designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso They were identified, based on their zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which showed the highest degrading activity, were selected for further identification by partial sequence analysis of their zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene of zzso shared zzso similarity with that of zzso zzso while zzso scored zzso similarity with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso almost completely disappeared within zzso of incubation in zzso liquid zzso zzso analysis confirmed the degradation of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso which formed as a result of zzso zzso A zzso gene zzso was amplified from the zzso zzso by using specifically designed zzso zzso The sequence analysis showed a significant similarity to a known zzso gene in different zzso zzso We report here the isolation of a new zzso bacteria from zzso in Egypt that may be very well adapted to the zzso and environmental conditions of the zzso We also report the partial cloning of a new zzso zzso Due to their high zzso activity, the bacteria isolated from this work merit further study as potential biological agents for the zzso of soil, water, or crops contaminated with the zzso zzso
