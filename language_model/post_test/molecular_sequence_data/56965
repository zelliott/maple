To assess the feasibility of detecting zzso zzso in zzso donor zzso by a specific, direct zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso donor zzso was tested for the presence of zzso zzso by a specific zzso directly applied to zzso without prior DNA zzso 

zzso care fertility center in a teaching hospital and zzso laboratory for molecular zzso 

zzso zzso from 30 donors was zzso These zzso samples had previously given negative results in cell culture for zzso zzso Two different zzso of each zzso zzso with an zzso of 2 years, were zzso zzso 

zzso 

The presence of zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso 

In 3 of 30 donors zzso zzso was detected in both zzso whereas in 2 additional donors only one of the two samples tested zzso Additional samples from 2 positive donors, together with samples from 3 negative donors, were studied more zzso to test the zzso and reliability of zzso zzso All zzso of the donors, previously positive for zzso zzso by zzso indeed appeared to be positive, whereas the samples of the negative donors remained zzso 

The direct zzso is a reliable, sensitive, and valuable method for detection of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso of contamination of donor zzso with zzso zzso in the donor population in this study stresses the need for rigorous screening of donor zzso before artificial zzso preferably using a sensitive method such as the zzso
