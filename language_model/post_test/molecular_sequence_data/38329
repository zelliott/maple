The replication of zzso a zzso zzso virus, requires translation of the infecting zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso synthesis of a zzso zzso zzso sequences involved in the latter process are poorly zzso Since many sequences involved in zzso replication form zzso structures, we searched the zzso other than the untranslated regions, for predicted local secondary structural elements and identified a zzso zzso zzso in the region zzso the zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested the structure was well zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the structure without affecting the zzso product, destroyed zzso viability and suggested that the structure was required in the positive sense for zzso Recovery of zzso viruses suggested that integrity of the structure was critical for function, and analysis of replication demonstrated that zzso zzso did not zzso negative zzso Our conclusion, that this zzso secondary structure constitutes a novel zzso zzso replication element zzso is supported by the demonstration that zzso zzso bearing lethal zzso in the native structure can be restored to replication competence by the addition of a second copy of the zzso zzso sequence at another location within the zzso This zzso zzso functionally resembles an element identified in zzso type 14 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1998) and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso but differs in zzso structure, and zzso The functional role and evolutionary significance of zzso in the replication of zzso zzso viruses is zzso
