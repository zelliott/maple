Fusion regulatory protein zzso regulates zzso cell fusion and fusion of zzso Eleven of zzso zzso zzso acids of zzso were the same as the zzso acid sequence of zzso heavy zzso zzso molecules were detected in Con A- or zzso zzso while zzso was rare on resting zzso These properties of zzso are similar to those of zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso resulted in cell fusion, and other zzso directed against zzso induced formation of zzso giant cells of zzso cells, a zzso cell line zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso cells expressing human zzso zzso or zzso When zzso disease virus zzso zzso cells expressing human zzso were incubated with zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso giant cells were zzso thus, zzso molecules expressed in zzso cells are functional for fusion regulatory zzso
