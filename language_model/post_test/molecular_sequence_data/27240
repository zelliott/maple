zzso bacteria of the zzso zzso are widespread among zzso and cause a variety of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and host zzso In this study, we used three sets of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in conjunction with the zzso chain reaction zzso cloning and sequencing to study the infection of fruit flies zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso The flies were collected at several localities in Brazil and at zzso zzso All of the fruit flies studied were infected with zzso zzso A, in agreement with the high prevalence of this group in South zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene was the most sensitive gene for studying the relationships among zzso zzso The zzso sequences detected in these fruit flies were similar to those such as zzso reported for other fruit zzso These results show that the infection of zzso fruit flies by zzso is much more widespread than previously zzso
