Heavy metal contamination of zzso is of widespread occurrence as a result of human, agricultural and industrial zzso Among heavy metals, lead is a potential zzso that readily accumulates in zzso and zzso Although lead is not an essential element for plants, it gets easily absorbed and accumulated in zzso zzso which exhibits a significant level of tolerance to zzso The response of a metal tolerant plant to heavy metal stress involves a number of zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the overall molecular response of a zzso plant to lead exposure, suppression zzso zzso zzso was used to construct a zzso library enriched in lead induced zzso transcripts from zzso zzso zzso the library by reverse Northern analysis revealed that between 20 and zzso of clones selected from the library were zzso regulated in lead treated zzso After differential zzso we isolated several zzso expressed zzso zzso including a type 2 zzso zzso gene which is involved in zzso and zzso and shown to be zzso regulated in lead treated zzso The data from the reverse Northern analysis was further confirmed with conventional Northern analysis of a select group of genes including zzso zzso zzso zzso water zzso and other zzso zzso zzso which are zzso rapidly in response to lead zzso The zzso levels of zzso increased substantially after lead treatment indicating a potential role for it under lead stress in zzso The present results show that zzso can serve as an effective tool for zzso genes induced in response to lead heavy metal tolerance in zzso A better understanding of lead induced gene expression in zzso should help select candidates associated with zzso of heavy metal zzso The possible link between this result and the zzso response of plants is zzso
