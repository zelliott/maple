zzso dramatically change their dynamics and organization at the entry into zzso Although this change is zzso by zzso proteins zzso how zzso themselves are regulated is not well zzso Here we used an integrated zzso approach to establish the framework and biological significance of zzso regulation critical for the zzso zzso zzso we applied quantitative zzso to determine global cell cycle changes in the profiles of zzso in human and zzso zzso This uncovered a wide range of cell cycle regulations of zzso previously zzso zzso systematic studies of human zzso highlighted an overlooked aspect of zzso most zzso zzso suppress their affinity to zzso or reduce their protein levels in zzso in combination with nuclear zzso zzso in-depth analysis of a novel zzso zzso zzso revealed that the suppression of the zzso affinity of this zzso zzso in combination with nuclear zzso is essential for zzso organization in zzso and zzso of zzso is needed for zzso attachment in zzso Thus, this first comprehensive analysis of zzso regulation for the zzso transition advances our understanding of zzso biology and reveals the prevalence and importance of zzso zzso zzso
