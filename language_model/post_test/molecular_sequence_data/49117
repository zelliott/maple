We have isolated three zzso zzso zzso specifically impaired in zzso oxide zzso zzso The zzso arose from insertions of an zzso element into zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, the zzso zzso zzso the response regulator zzso and the sensor zzso Although zzso is not the sole zzso reducing zzso in zzso zzso growth analysis showed that it is the main respiratory zzso zzso Use of a zzso zzso fusion confirmed that the zzso zzso mediates zzso induction of the zzso zzso
