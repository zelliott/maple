The structures of the zzso attached to zzso from Chinese oak zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso a storage protein present in fifth zzso zzso contained zzso zzso of zzso that was composed of zzso zzso per mole zzso Four zzso of zzso in zzso zzso strongly suggest that the protein contains two zzso zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso profiles confirmed that zzso contained mainly zzso zzso as well as truncated zzso structures with or without zzso Interestingly, the most abundant zzso was zzso zzso which was characterized by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 600 zzso zzso zzso This zzso structure is not normally present in zzso zzso zzso however, it has been identified in avian zzso The zzso structure was present only in zzso whereas other zzso proteins contained only zzso and truncated zzso The zzso was also detected in the zzso of another zzso zzso zzso suggesting a specific function for the zzso zzso There were no processed zzso zzso such as zzso Furthermore, zzso was not released from zzso by zzso F under zzso conditions, suggesting that the zzso linkage to zzso is protected by the zzso zzso may play a role in the folding of zzso or in the assembly of zzso
