The full-length promoter zzso of the carrot zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso fused to the zzso reporter gene was zzso transformed to carrot zzso by zzso and the promoter activity induced by zzso zzso light of various zzso was zzso The action spectrum constructed from the zzso zzso showed a single peak at around 280 zzso suggesting that the zzso of the zzso promoter is zzso as one of the zzso light zzso The same zzso system was applied to variously truncated zzso promoters and to zzso promoter fusion with various parts zzso of the zzso zzso The region from zzso to zzso zzso to the zzso start zzso fused to the zzso core zzso promoter showed a 280 zzso zzso However, zzso promoters truncated above zzso and zzso although they contain the region between zzso and zzso did not show such a typical zzso response, zzso they responded to 260 zzso light as much as to 280 zzso zzso The promoter truncated to below zzso also responded to 260 zzso light as much as to 280 zzso zzso Therefore we assumed that the zzso promoter is composed of three functionally different zzso the upstream above zzso zzso the region from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and the zzso below zzso zzso and C zzso The overall zzso response of the zzso full-length promoter is explained as the result of interaction of these three zzso
