Two rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recycling factor zzso and zzso had been identified and characterized in this zzso The gene zzso is located on zzso 4 while zzso on zzso zzso No other zzso is found in rice zzso zzso Both genes are unique in rice zzso and zzso zzso The zzso character of their zzso protein products suggests that the proteins are transferred to zzso and zzso respectively and carry out their zzso The sequence conservation and the zzso expression profile of the two genes strongly imply their indispensable role in plant zzso In addition, these sequences share zzso zzso to some extent with other zzso and zzso zzso providing further evidence for the zzso theory, and zzso the potential value of zzso in molecular evolution zzso
