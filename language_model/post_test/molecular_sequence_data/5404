Human zzso 17 zzso is a zzso derived zzso that exhibits zzso zzso acid sequence identity to mouse zzso zzso and 57% identity to a viral protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso gene 13 zzso The zzso family of proteins binds to a unique mouse zzso zzso Using zzso acid zzso techniques, a zzso zzso a human zzso of the zzso zzso was isolated from a human T cell zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso is zzso identical to the zzso shares no zzso with previously identified zzso zzso families, and exhibits a broad tissue zzso The zzso gene was localized to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generated against the zzso were able to block the zzso production of zzso from human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso zzso binds to the zzso with low zzso
