We have developed a zzso chain reaction zzso for the clinical diagnosis of potentially zzso strains of zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso A zzso amplification product, overlapping a DNA portion zzso both fragments of the diphtheria zzso has been found in 28 among the 36 strains zzso In addition, effective toxin production, as evidenced by the ability of bacterial culture zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 2, was zzso In every case, the presence of an amplification product correlated with an zzso activity, thus confirming the zzso The zzso chain reaction zzso zzso described is very rapid (2 zzso compared with the zzso zzso test or the guinea pig zzso zzso It can provide a convenient and reliable method for laboratories involved in the identification of zzso zzso
