Here, we report isolation and zzso expression pattern of the zzso zzso C zzso zzso acid sequence analysis showed that the zzso zzso C protein shared approximately zzso identities with the zzso human, chicken, and carp zzso zzso in zzso zzso showed that the zzso C gene was expressed in zzso as its expression was zzso with the known zzso lineage markers zzso and zzso At 20 hours zzso zzso most of the zzso C positive cells were localized in the zzso and head zzso but not in the intermediate cell mass, supporting the notion that the primitive zzso originated from the zzso zzso 126 (1999) zzso At zzso the zzso C positive cells scattered within the head and zzso and began to appear in the zzso part of zzso zzso By 6 days zzso zzso the zzso C positive cells accumulated in the kidney where zzso had been indicated to take place after zzso zzso zzso 214 (1999) zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that the zzso C gene is specifically expressed in zzso zzso suggesting that it could serve as an excellent marker for genetic screening of both primitive and definitive zzso lineage development in zzso
