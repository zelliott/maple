The complete sequence of the bovine zzso gene zzso is described and compared with the mouse gene zzso Both genes contain seven zzso separated by six zzso and the zzso of zzso is closely associated with structural zzso of the zzso Individual zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso similar in zzso There are no zzso zzso or zzso boxes associated with the zzso initiation sites in the genes of either zzso However, a number of potential binding sites for zzso factors were identified in the zzso DNA, some of which may function in regulating expression of the gene in zzso zzso Conservation of a zzso region in the promoters of zzso and zzso may have some functional zzso Cloning and sequencing of zzso provides an additional zzso gene promoter that may be used for driving the expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and for determining the basis for zzso gene zzso In addition, the sequence of zzso may be used to map zzso zzso and identify quantitative trait zzso in commercial zzso
