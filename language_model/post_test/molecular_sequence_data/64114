The gray, zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most extensively used, zzso zzso resource for basic zzso and biomedical research zzso To enhance the research utility of this species, we are building a linkage map, using both anonymous markers and functional gene zzso that will enable the zzso of quantitative trait zzso zzso and provide comparative information regarding the evolution of zzso and other zzso zzso The current map is composed of 83 zzso distributed among eight zzso linkage groups and the X zzso The zzso linkage groups appear to zzso a very large portion of the zzso yet span a zzso distance of only zzso zzso making this the most compact linkage map known among zzso Most surprising, the male map is much larger than the female map zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a pattern contrary to that in zzso zzso and other zzso The finding of zzso reduction in female zzso in zzso zzso coupled with zzso data from two other, zzso related zzso species, suggests that reduced female zzso might be a widespread zzso zzso We discuss possible explanations for reduced female zzso in zzso as a consequence of the zzso characteristic of zzso paternal X zzso zzso
