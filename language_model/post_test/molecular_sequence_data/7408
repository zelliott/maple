The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Total zzso from zzso zzso cells was used as zzso Two overlapping zzso fragments zzso respectively, zzso 1 to 290 and zzso 191 to zzso of the zzso were zzso Taken together, the two fragments represented the whole coding zzso assuming a comparable length for the zzso from the zzso rat and human zzso zzso of the cloned zzso was assessed by expression zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso exhibited zzso specific binding for zzso and zzso zzso zzso The primary sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain showed high percentages of identity with the sequences from zzso human, and rat zzso A truncated form of the zzso zzso lacking zzso 75 to 124 in the zzso domain, was also cloned and zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was used as zzso zzso probe to map the zzso gene by radioactive in zzso zzso This gene was found zzso (as in zzso with the zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso gene on the zzso region of pig zzso zzso
