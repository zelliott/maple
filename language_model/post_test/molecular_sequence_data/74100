zzso can disrupt the zzso 43 zzso and zzso zzso zzso interaction, leading to zzso of gap junction zzso zzso Previously, the authors characterized the interaction of zzso from these proteins with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and found that binding of the zzso zzso domain to zzso disrupted the zzso zzso domain zzso Because zzso and zzso form zzso zzso and display similar mechanisms of pH regulation, the authors addressed whether zzso interacts with these zzso in a similar manner as zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance zzso data indicate that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso determined that zzso affected the last 28 zzso zzso and zzso shifted numerous zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso complex was unaffected by zzso and both zzso zzso simultaneously with zzso This result differs from when the same experiment was performed with zzso suggesting different mechanisms of regulation exist between zzso zzso even when involving the same molecular zzso
