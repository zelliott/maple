zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso polarity and is an zzso zzso in embryonic zzso Here, we describe properties of zzso that control the position and integrity of the zzso zzso junction and zzso organ, or zzso In contrast to normal zzso zzso junctions and zzso which span the depth of the zzso zzso junctions and zzso of zzso zzso initially accumulate at the top of the zzso and fail to maintain their integrity as they stretch to the retinal zzso We show that zzso controls zzso of the zzso junction through its zzso domain containing a putative binding site for a protein zzso zzso protein zzso Although loss of zzso or zzso of the zzso binding domain causes zzso of zzso zzso they do not result in a significant loss of zzso zzso zzso in zzso a human zzso of zzso are associated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso 12 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso behaves similarly to its zzso counterpart when zzso in the fly zzso Our studies may provide clues for mechanisms of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso
