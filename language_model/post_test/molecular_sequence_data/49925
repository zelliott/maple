The zzso of groups within zzso is examined with molecular sequence zzso zzso is a zzso zzso diverse group of zzso fishes, most of which are small, zzso and zzso Efforts to zzso relationships among the zzso groups have been hampered by the prevalence of reductive evolution among zzso zzso such reduction can make identification of zzso zzso characters particularly zzso zzso have been variously grouped into two to nine families, several with included zzso but most existing zzso are not zzso and few zzso hypotheses of relationships among zzso groups have been zzso In this study, representatives of eight of the nine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso selected to sample broadly from the range of zzso diversity, were zzso Complete sequence from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso was used in a zzso zzso analysis to zzso relationships among the zzso zzso A single most zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso indicating strong support for most zzso Major zzso conclusions include that zzso is part of zzso and zzso is zzso with respect to a zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Within this zzso zzso two zzso are zzso One includes zzso which is zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso and zzso The other contains zzso also zzso and including zzso zzso and zzso Previous zzso evidence for zzso groupings is zzso the zzso hypothesis indicates that the zzso reduction observed in many zzso species has been derived several times zzso
