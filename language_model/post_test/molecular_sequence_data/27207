zzso zzso T zzso is a zzso that zzso cardiac muscle contraction through its extensive and diverse interactions with neighboring thin filament zzso Its zzso half is the zzso that anchors the zzso complex to zzso Until now, studies aimed at investigating the role of the zzso tail region have not considered the effects of zzso To understand better the regulatory role of the zzso tail region of zzso zzso we investigated the functional effects of zzso deletion zzso acids zzso and zzso on zzso dependence of zzso zzso force production, zzso zzso rate, and thin filament sliding zzso zzso profiles were assessed in zzso zzso fiber preparations where the native zzso zzso was exchanged with zzso zzso engineered to contain modified zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso enhances zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso levels (the zzso range in cardiac zzso However, at zzso zzso levels, there is a reduction in zzso tension and zzso zzso On one hand, zzso of zzso zzso the zzso effect induced by zzso of the zzso tail, zzso zzso zzso responsiveness back to control zzso On the other hand, it zzso zzso tension development and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso zzso regulates tension cost (an index of zzso cycling zzso increased by zzso and decreased by intact zzso Like the zzso fiber data, sliding speed of thin filaments regulated by zzso is more sensitive to zzso compared with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso sliding speed and is associated with zzso zzso of thin filament sliding zzso
