In plants, the observed low frequency of gene targeting and zzso zzso contrasts markedly with the efficient zzso zzso of zzso Thus, zzso accessibility can have a major influence on the zzso frequency of zzso DNA in zzso An zzso zzso hypersensitive to a range of zzso treatments zzso X-rays, zzso zzso and zzso zzso is also defective in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a protein closely related to the structural maintenance of zzso zzso family involved in structural changes in zzso Although loss of zzso function is lethal in other zzso growth of the zzso zzso is normal in the absence of zzso zzso This suggests a surprisingly specialized function for this protein in plants, and provides the first in zzso evidence for the involvement of an zzso protein in zzso DNA zzso It is possible that zzso proteins in plants alleviate zzso zzso structure limiting zzso zzso in zzso zzso
