We studied sequence variation in the nuclear zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso in 111 individuals from 11 zzso of the sponge zzso zzso across the core species range in the western Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic zzso We report the first confirmed instance of zzso variation in zzso zzso zzso zzso and population genetic analyses were used to zzso the zzso evolutionary zzso The study revealed highly structured populations affected by restricted gene flow and zzso A zzso range expansion in the whole distribution area of the sponge was zzso zzso analyses indicate a recent origin of most sequence types that could be explained by a recent origin of the species or a by recent bottleneck event in the studied zzso A recent expansion of the distribution range to the zzso region from the Mediterranean Sea was also zzso suggesting that zzso zzso was recently introduced from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean via zzso zzso and that the pattern observed is not the result of a natural zzso relationship between these zzso
