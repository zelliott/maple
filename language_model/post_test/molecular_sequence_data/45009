zzso zzso mobility zzso zzso and zzso techniques have been combined with mass zzso zzso and investigated as a means of generating and separating zzso and protein zzso zzso When fragments are generated inside a drift tube and then dispersed by IMS prior to zzso analysis, it is possible to observe many features that are not apparent from zzso analysis zzso The approach is demonstrated by examining fragmentation patterns arising from zzso zzso zzso of insulin chain B and zzso The zzso IMS approach makes it possible to select individual components for zzso zzso and to disperse fragments based on differences in mobility prior to zzso zzso Such an approach makes it possible to observe many features not apparent by zzso analysis zzso
