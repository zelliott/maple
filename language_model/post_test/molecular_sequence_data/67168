The zzso effects of several Y zzso including pancreatic zzso zzso indicate the presence of zzso zzso and zzso receptors in mouse and human zzso colon zzso Here, we used preparations from human and from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso knockout zzso mice, alongside zzso zzso cells to define the relative functional contribution of the zzso zzso First, rat zzso zzso zzso responses were lost in zzso zzso zzso but zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso responses in human zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and attenuated zzso zzso responses in mouse and human zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso in zzso zzso zzso but were partial zzso compared with zzso at this zzso In zzso human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso displaced zzso binding with orders of affinity zzso at human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding through zzso receptors with significantly lower efficacy than zzso zzso marginally increased zzso but abolished further zzso zzso zzso to recycling zzso pathways in zzso zzso Taken together, these findings show that zzso receptors play a definitive role in attenuating zzso zzso transport and may be useful targets for novel zzso agents due to their limited peripheral zzso
