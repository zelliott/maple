The zzso zzso complex zzso is a major contributor to the zzso motive force across the membrane by zzso electron transfer to zzso zzso The crystal structures of wild type and zzso zzso complexes from the zzso purple zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilized with the zzso zzso zzso site inhibitor zzso alone or in combination with the zzso reduction zzso site inhibitor zzso were zzso The high quality electron density permitted assignments of a new zzso site to the zzso zzso zzso and a number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso differences between zzso and its zzso counterparts are mostly extra zzso and provide a basis for understanding the function of the predominantly longer sequences in the bacterial zzso zzso implications for the zzso complex are derived from analyses of 10 independent molecules in various crystal forms and from comparisons with zzso zzso
