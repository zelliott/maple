zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the degradation of zzso a zzso factor regulating the zzso expression of many zzso zzso Through comparative zzso zzso we found that zzso acid zzso zzso the pocket of zzso that interacts with zzso are highly zzso among zzso zzso and related proteins in all zzso and in certain zzso including flies and zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso appears to be widely preserved in zzso Similarly, zzso zzso corresponding to zzso and zzso in the intervening region of mouse zzso which are essential for the repression of zzso activity in cultured cells, are zzso among zzso zzso in zzso and zzso except zzso We found that fish have two types of zzso zzso and zzso To our surprise, zzso and zzso contain the zzso zzso corresponding to zzso and zzso zzso In our analysis of zzso zzso and zzso activities, both zzso and zzso were able to facilitate the degradation of zzso protein and repress zzso target gene zzso Individual zzso of either residual zzso zzso in zzso and zzso disrupted the ability of zzso to repress zzso indicating that the presence of either zzso or zzso is sufficient for fish zzso molecules to fully zzso These results provide an important insight into the means by which zzso zzso act as sensors of zzso and zzso
