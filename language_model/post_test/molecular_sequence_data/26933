Iron is essential to the zzso green zzso zzso but the molecular mechanism for response to iron zzso remains largely zzso In previous studies, we have identified zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as important regulation components of iron response in this zzso Here we present another iron regulated gene zzso which promoter was zzso by using a zzso zzso deletion and a scanning zzso zzso The results reveal that the zzso of zzso and zzso regions from zzso start site of zzso were sufficient and necessary for zzso zzso zzso Further deletion analysis indicates both zzso and zzso regions are essential for zzso zzso The scanning zzso analysis of these regions identifies two zzso zzso the zzso at zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso and zzso reveals a core sequence of zzso which had been found in our previously reported zzso gene zzso Moreover, we show that the promoter region of several zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also contains this core zzso suggesting that at least two classes zzso elements exist in zzso one in zzso and zzso and others the second in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
