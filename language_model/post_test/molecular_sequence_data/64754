In zzso zzso the development of a zzso active zzso from a zzso zzso zzso is accompanied by the elimination of numerous DNA zzso called internally eliminated sequences zzso many of which belong to dispersed repetitive sequence zzso To examine the relationship between the zzso and deletion events expected to occur during evolution of the repeats and the zzso elimination process, zzso were compared among different zzso zzso A 600 zzso DNA segment, the R zzso was discovered inside the R zzso one of the ten zzso zzso out of an estimated zzso total in the zzso zzso The R zzso was found in strains B3 and C2 but not in several other strains zzso indicating that the zzso was probably present in a zzso of strains B3 and zzso The R zzso was found to belong to a moderately large sequence family of about 200 members; however, zzso searches did not reveal meaningful similarities with other mobile zzso zzso comparisons revealed that a 300 zzso stretch, very closely related to the first half of the R zzso was present inside the previously described B zzso another of the ten zzso zzso This is the first example of shared sequences between two of the known zzso
