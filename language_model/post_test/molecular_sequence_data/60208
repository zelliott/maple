zzso small zzso tumor typically occurs in the abdomen of young men, but it can also develop at other zzso sites and in older people, presenting greater diagnostic zzso We report a case of this tumor arising from the zzso region in a 43-year-old zzso The tumor showed zzso zzso and zzso evidence of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the presence of an zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by the reverse zzso chain reaction using an zzso zzso 7 primer and zzso zzso 8 and zzso 9 zzso which revealed single zzso chain reaction products with a junction of zzso zzso 7 to zzso zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that zzso small zzso tumors of the zzso region share not only zzso but also molecular genetic features with those of the abdomen and that reverse zzso chain reaction analysis using zzso sections is useful for a conclusive zzso
