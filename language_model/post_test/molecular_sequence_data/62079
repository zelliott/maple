zzso bonds are zzso strongly among proteins of related structure and zzso Despite the explosive growth of protein sequence databases and the vast numbers of sequence search tools, no tool exists to draw relations between the zzso patterns of zzso zzso We present a comprehensive database of zzso bonding patterns and a search method to find proteins with similar zzso zzso The zzso database was constructed using zzso zzso extracted from zzso and was expanded significantly from zzso to zzso zzso zzso by an zzso method that combines zzso zzso with zzso multiple zzso To search the database, we define a zzso description, called the zzso signature, which encodes both zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso A web tool was developed that allows users to search for related zzso patterns and for zzso resulting from the removal of one or more zzso from the zzso We explore the possibility of using zzso pattern conservation to identify protein zzso that are zzso by zzso Examples include the zzso between a sea zzso zzso protein and a sea zzso zzso and the zzso between tick zzso zzso and bovine zzso zzso In both examples, there is a clear structural similarity and a functional zzso We used the database to find structural zzso for the zzso zzso zzso The identification of a von zzso Factor C zzso domain agrees with its functional role and explains zzso zzso We believe that the rapid increase in structure zzso arising from structural zzso efforts and advances in mass zzso techniques will greatly increase the number of zzso zzso This information will become a valuable resource for structural and functional zzso of zzso The availability of a zzso zzso pattern database will thus provide a powerful new addition to existing zzso discovery zzso
