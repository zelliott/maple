zzso sclerosis is an zzso dominant trait in which the zzso of cellular proliferation and differentiation results in the development of zzso zzso in many zzso The zzso gene is one of two genes determining zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in patients with zzso sclerosis and zzso loss of zzso at the zzso locus in the associated zzso indicate that zzso functions as a zzso zzso gene and that loss of function is critical to expression of the zzso sclerosis zzso The zzso product, zzso has a region of zzso with the zzso zzso protein zzso and stimulates the zzso activity of zzso and zzso in zzso Here we show that the region of zzso between zzso and human zzso and the zzso GAP zzso is more extensive than previously reported and spans approximately 160 zzso acid zzso zzso within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Single strand zzso zzso analysis of these zzso in 173 unrelated patients with zzso sclerosis and direct sequencing of zzso zzso together with study of additional family members enabled zzso of disease associated zzso in 14 zzso zzso zzso which occurred in zzso 36, 37 and 38 were identified in eight cases, four of whom shared the same zzso change zzso Each of the five different zzso zzso identified was shown to occur de zzso in at least one sporadic case of zzso zzso The high proportion of zzso zzso detected in the region of the zzso gene zzso the zzso domain supports its key role in the regulation of cellular zzso
