zzso a breast and zzso cancer zzso zzso has been implicated in gene zzso Previous studies demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso a zzso and zzso gene that plays an important role in cellular response to DNA zzso However, the zzso by which zzso regulates zzso remains zzso In this report, we have shown that zzso zzso of the zzso promoter is zzso through the zzso and zzso motifs located at the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso motifs abrogate induction of the zzso promoter by zzso Both zzso and zzso motifs are able to zzso zzso zzso in a zzso minimal zzso Physical associations of zzso protein with zzso factors zzso and zzso which directly bind to the zzso and zzso zzso are established by zzso pull-down and zzso zzso Such protein interactions are required for interaction of zzso with the zzso promoter because either zzso of zzso and zzso proteins or zzso in the zzso and zzso motifs disrupt zzso binding to the zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso can zzso its targeted genes through zzso interactions and provide a novel mechanism by which zzso zzso in zzso zzso
