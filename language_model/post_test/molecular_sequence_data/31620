DNA zzso breaks are highly zzso zzso zzso that routinely arise in zzso To protect the integrity of their genetic information, all organisms have evolved specialized zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso DNA repair in plant zzso and zzso by binding zzso DNA in a zzso zzso Although most of the results showing the involvement of the zzso proteins in DNA repair have been obtained in zzso zzso only the crystal structures of the potato zzso proteins zzso and zzso have been reported to zzso The present report of the crystal structures of the three zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso and zzso reveals that these structurally similar proteins assemble into zzso Furthermore, structural alignment with a potato zzso complex reveals that the zzso in these proteins are properly oriented to bind zzso DNA in a zzso zzso
