The zzso zzso factor zzso is essential for proper motor zzso development and development of zzso pancreatic zzso zzso is closely related to zzso and zzso and all three are expressed in the developing central nervous system and in the developing zzso zzso detection of protein expression is an important tool for description of the zzso differences in expression zzso When several gene family members like the zzso factors have overlapping or juxtaposed expression zzso there is an elevated risk of zzso zzso and it is therefore crucial to determine the zzso of zzso against such zzso In this study we have determined the zzso consensus sequences of four zzso zzso against zzso using zzso zzso and we refined the results by combined zzso recognition and blocking zzso We show that two of the zzso zzso zzso specifically recognize zzso and do not zzso to zzso and zzso The other two zzso zzso zzso are specific to zzso in mice but do not recognize zzso in chicken and zzso
