zzso of a protein zzso to T cells is believed to follow its zzso breakdown by the zzso cell, with the fragments zzso the trigger of immune zzso It should then be expected that zzso recognition of protein zzso in zzso will be independent of protein zzso Three zzso lines were made by passage in zzso with native zzso of T cells from two mouse strains zzso and zzso that had been primed with the same zzso These cell lines responded well to native zzso and very poorly to unfolded zzso zzso The response of the zzso lines to the zzso was major zzso complex zzso A line from zzso was selected for further zzso This line responded to the three zzso synthetic sites of zzso (representing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that were extended to a uniform size by a nonsense zzso zzso clones prepared from this line were specific to native zzso and did not respond to the unfolded zzso Furthermore, several of these clones showed specificity to a given zzso synthetic zzso The exquisite dependency of the recognition by the clones on the zzso of the protein zzso and their ability to recognize the zzso synthetic sites indicate that the native zzso protein was the trigger of zzso zzso zzso
