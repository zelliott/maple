The 106 zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso isolated in zzso Medical College Hospital were examined for their properties and zzso zzso The strains produced four types of zzso of which type II was the most common, produced by 84 zzso zzso was produced by 58 zzso zzso were produced by 45 zzso most of which zzso zzso were of type zzso Thirty-four strains zzso produced both zzso and toxic shock syndrome zzso All strains were susceptible to zzso and zzso although they were mostly resistant to many other zzso Using the zzso chain reaction zzso technique, the zzso gene was detected in 57 zzso of the 62 strains zzso In addition, one of the 42 zzso strains isolated had the zzso zzso These results indicate that detection of the zzso gene by the zzso technique is a rapid and accurate way to identify zzso zzso
