The zzso zzso and zzso proteins are characterized by the presence of a zzso zzso with a closely linked zzso zzso motif zzso We have suggested that the zzso motif could, via zzso of the zzso zzso recognize zzso DNA zzso Here we report an analysis of the DNA binding properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain in zzso DNA binding analysis performed using zzso DNA templates showed that the zzso domain, but not the zzso HD alone, binds to zzso The zzso domain recognizes a 9 zzso zzso sequence zzso as determined by selecting zzso binding sites from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso domain binds to DNA as a zzso Moreover, the analysis of the DNA binding activity of zzso derivatives indicated that a correct spatial relationship between the HD and the zzso is essential for DNA zzso Finally, we determined that the zzso zzso domain recognizes a distinct 9 zzso zzso sequence zzso A model of DNA binding by the zzso proteins is zzso
