Here, we report the successful design of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was designed by replacing zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed strong zzso activity against reference strains zzso zzso 1-2 zzso of zzso and zzso bacteria as well as against clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not cause zzso of human zzso even at 200 zzso These results indicate that zzso may be a good candidate for zzso drug development, especially as a topical agent against zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that the lack of zzso activity of zzso correlated with its weak ability to penetrate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which mimic zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso caused little or no dye leakage from zzso charged zzso zzso zzso zzso which mimic bacterial zzso but had a potent ability to cause zzso of the zzso membrane potential of intact zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso kills zzso by not the zzso mode but the formation of small channels that permit transit of zzso or zzso but not molecules as large as zzso
