The activity of acid zzso zzso in insect fat bodies is zzso by the steroid hormone zzso zzso in zzso However, in fat bodies kept in culture, a factor from the zzso is required to enhance the zzso zzso We identified the factor as a protein with a molecular mass of 19 zzso zzso from the zzso of a zzso zzso the rice zzso zzso zzso Western analysis of zzso proteins with zzso and zzso PAGE using zzso raised against zzso suggest that this protein exists as a zzso It is zzso by the hind zzso zzso fat body of the larvae and is released into the zzso The zzso effect of zzso on the zzso activity is zzso regulated and exhibits its zzso effect shortly before the onset of zzso We cloned the zzso zzso by zzso a hind zzso zzso fat body zzso expression zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence shows that zzso belongs to the family of zzso zzso zzso like zzso However, zzso zzso from zzso failed to show any mediation effect on zzso zzso activity, and zzso lacks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates the zzso zzso activity in intact fat body tissue and zzso even in the presence of zzso of zzso and translation, suggesting a zzso mode of zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
