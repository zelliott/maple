zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso is an zzso unfolded protein with a zzso zzso zzso domain, which mediates the zzso between several signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso is increased by stimulation with bacterial zzso We determined that zzso and zzso protein specifically bind to zzso and that the addition of the zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso production of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso binding site within the zzso domain of zzso was narrowed down to a zzso that binds to zzso in an extended zzso as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso After zzso zzso zzso moved from the plasma membrane to zzso zzso where it zzso with zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso responded to zzso with increased zzso production compared with the matched zzso zzso Similarly, small interfering zzso zzso of zzso also increased zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso signaling was enhanced by the zzso of zzso which had no effect on stimulation by zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso contributes to the negative regulation of the cellular response to zzso
