zzso zzso were obtained from zzso zzso with 2 vaccine strains of zzso virus zzso zzso zzso derived by serial plaque zzso directly from tissue zzso without an intervening step of isolation and amplification on cell cultures, were characterized as zzso and parental zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso and zzso X gene zzso Use of limiting zzso and recovery of virus zzso as individual plaques minimized the likelihood of in zzso zzso serving as a zzso source of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso X gene sequences were classified as zzso or deleted, using a battery of zzso chain reaction zzso zzso substantiate the observation that zzso vaccine strains can form genetic zzso in zzso after zzso induced zzso
