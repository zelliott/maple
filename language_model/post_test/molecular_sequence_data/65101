Family D DNA zzso zzso has recently been found in the zzso zzso of zzso Its genes are adjacent to several other genes related to DNA zzso repair and zzso in the zzso suggesting that this zzso may be the major DNA zzso in zzso We successfully zzso zzso and zzso the family D DNA zzso from zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso we identified zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso of a large zzso as the essential zzso responsible for zzso zzso We zzso the domain structure using proteins truncated at the zzso and zzso of both small and large zzso zzso and zzso and identified putative regions responsible for zzso interaction, zzso and regulation of the zzso zzso activity in zzso It was also found that the internal region of the putative zinc finger motif zzso cluster zzso at the zzso of zzso is involved in the zzso zzso zzso Using gel zzso analysis, we determined the molecular masses of the zzso zzso and the zzso putative zzso domain of the large zzso and proposed that zzso from zzso zzso probably forms a zzso structure in zzso Based on these results, a model regarding the zzso interaction and regulation of activity of zzso is zzso
