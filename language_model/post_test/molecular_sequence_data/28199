A highly repetitive DNA sequence from zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso It is a zzso arrayed sequence of 237 zzso and constitutes zzso of the fish zzso The copy number of the repeat is approximately 3 zzso zzso per zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of 7 cloned repeats revealed a high degree of conservation of the zzso zzso Within the zzso unit, a 9 zzso AT rich motif is regularly spaced approximately 30 zzso apart and may represent the zzso of the amplified zzso One cloned zzso zzso contained a 30 zzso deletion at a position flanked by a 7 zzso direct zzso The zzso sequence appears to have been amplified independently of the major 237 zzso tandem zzso A zzso repeat unit, defined by zzso zzso revealed by restriction zzso zzso is further imposed on the tandem zzso
