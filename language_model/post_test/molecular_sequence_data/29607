A distinct subset of sensory zzso are thought to directly sense changes in zzso energy through their zzso in the zzso Very little is known about the molecules that mediate zzso by these zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso a member of the zzso family of channels, is activated by noxious zzso Here we describe the cloning and characterization of zzso a distant relative of zzso zzso is specifically expressed in a subset of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso channel can be activated by cold temperatures and by a cooling agent, zzso Our identification of a zzso zzso channel in a distinct zzso of sensory zzso implicates an expanded role for this family of zzso channels in zzso sensory zzso
