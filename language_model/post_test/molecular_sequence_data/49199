We describe the first freshwater members of the class zzso that have been zzso Nine zzso zzso zzso strains were isolated from five freshwater zzso in Europe and zzso These zzso represent a broad spectrum of zzso ranging from deep zzso lakes to shallow zzso zzso Even when the isolated strains were grown in very rich media, the cell size was zzso zzso and was indistinguishable from the cell sizes of bacteria belonging to the smaller size classes of natural lake zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences of the isolated strains revealed that they are affiliated with the class zzso and the family zzso The previously described species with the highest levels of sequence similarity are zzso zzso and zzso zzso two zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequences of the nine zzso examined are more closely related to cloned sequences from zzso freshwater bacteria than to the sequences of any previously isolated zzso The nine zzso isolated form, together with several zzso bacteria, a diverse zzso cluster zzso zzso consisting exclusively of freshwater zzso zzso obtained from lakes that are ecologically different and geographically separated by great distances possess identical zzso zzso gene sequences but have clearly different zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that at least one of the zzso zzso is protected against zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso
