Relatively little is understood concerning the mechanisms by which zzso of zzso G proteins and zzso zzso interact to zzso specific zzso Through expression of normal, hybrid and deletion zzso receptors in zzso zzso we determined the G protein zzso characteristics of the functionally distinct zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and identified the critical zzso sequences responsible for G protein zzso zzso of a zzso toxin insensitive G protein pathway, leading to a rapid and transient release of zzso zzso characteristic of the zzso zzso could be specified by the transfer of as few as nine zzso acids from the zzso to the zzso zzso In a zzso manner, transfer of no more than 21 zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso was sufficient to specify zzso of a zzso toxin sensitive G protein coupled to a slow and zzso zzso release zzso typical of the zzso zzso zzso these critical zzso occur within the same region of the third zzso domain of functionally distinct zzso zzso
