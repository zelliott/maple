Miniature zzso zzso elements zzso are widespread in plants and zzso Although zzso zzso zzso has a large amount of and a variety of zzso zzso the zzso information of the zzso zzso is zzso 

We used zzso and zzso approaches to search for zzso in the zzso zzso We identified 17 zzso families with a total of zzso members, accounting for zzso of the zzso 7 of 17 zzso families are completely novel based on the zzso composition of target site zzso zzso and/or terminal zzso repeats zzso zzso zzso were widely and zzso distributed in the zzso One family named zzso might experience a recent burst zzso Network and diversity analyses for each family revealed different diversification patterns of the zzso zzso reflecting the signatures of zzso that zzso zzso Most zzso zzso zzso inserted into or near genes and zzso that encodes a zzso small zzso might silence its the closest genes in zzso zzso through a small zzso zzso 

zzso harbors 17 zzso zzso The zzso zzso preferred to reside in or near genes and one zzso might be involved in gene zzso Our results emphasize the exceptional role of zzso in zzso regulation of genes and have general implications to understand interaction between zzso and their host zzso
