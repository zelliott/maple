zzso is a zzso zzso containing two zzso molecules which has zzso activities against zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene cluster of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso has now been zzso Four zzso were identified and a putative zzso supposed to code for the zzso zzso zzso was designated as zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli using zzso expression zzso zzso The zzso protein expressed in a soluble zzso The zzso was zzso by zzso column using zzso buffer as zzso The molecular mass of the expressed protein correlated with the predicted mass zzso zzso deduced from the cloned gene sequence zzso The zzso zzso produced zzso from zzso and it was confirmed that the expressed protein was zzso zzso catalyzing zzso of zzso and zzso or zzso of zzso
