zzso is a common compound in pharmaceutical and commercial products and a popular additive to zzso The molecular targets of zzso remain poorly zzso In this study we show an effect of zzso on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso technique, zzso was found to zzso inhibit zzso receptors zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso by zzso was not dependent on the membrane potential and did not involve zzso zzso zzso channels, since zzso zzso remained unchanged by zzso injection of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso bathing solution containing zzso Furthermore, increasing zzso zzso did not reverse zzso zzso and the specific binding of zzso zzso was not attenuated by zzso Studies of zzso zzso receptors zzso expressed in neural cells demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the cell body and zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso receptors in a zzso zzso
