The zzso domain of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso and zzso zzso To zzso the functional importance of these motifs and of zzso zzso and zzso chemical modification and zzso zzso studies were zzso Chemical modification of zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso respectively, renders the zzso inactive in zzso zzso and overall zzso Data base searches and sequence comparison of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso shows a limited number of highly zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso Of these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are present within or near the zzso motif whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso are present in and around the zzso The functional role of these zzso zzso was further studied by zzso zzso In the zzso zzso none of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had zzso or overall activity, whereas they all exhibited normal zzso zzso A slight improvement in reverse zzso activity zzso residual zzso and complete restoration of forward zzso was observed with zzso zzso designed to probe the zzso requirements included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Of these, zzso exhibited normal zzso and zzso activity, zzso and zzso showed no zzso activity, and zzso had normal zzso activity but produced an effect on zzso activity zzso residual zzso The single zzso zzso which is part of the highly zzso zzso sequence of the zzso affected both zzso and zzso zzso This zzso analysis indicates that the zzso motif plays a role only in the zzso activity, whereas the zzso is involved in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso activity have also been distinguished from those involved in zzso zzso
