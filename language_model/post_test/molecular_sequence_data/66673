On the basis of zzso analysis, the zzso zzso zzso derived zzso with deletions of the gene zzso respectively the response regulators zzso zzso and zzso were classified into two zzso Group I bacteria carrying either zzso or zzso exhibited less zzso lower level of zzso zzso zzso synthesis and higher zzso than the parental zzso No apparent change of the group II, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was found to be diminished after introducing into a zzso expressing zzso Via zzso fusion analysis, zzso deletion was found to reduce zzso zzso A regulatory role of zzso for the expression of zzso was supported further by zzso showing a specific binding of zzso to the putative promoter of zzso The promoter activity measurement and zzso also revealed that zzso acted as an zzso and an zzso for the expression of zzso and zzso In addition, deletion of zzso suppressed slightly the promoter activity of the zzso and the expression of all three zzso transcripts zzso zzso and zzso were reduced in the zzso zzso These suggest that the three zzso response regulators interact to control, in zzso the bacterial zzso zzso
