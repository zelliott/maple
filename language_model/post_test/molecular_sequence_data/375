zzso T cells and zzso T cells perform zzso immune zzso In zzso species with a high percentage of very diverse zzso T cells, like zzso and zzso it is often assumed that zzso T cells are less diverse than zzso T zzso Based on the bovine zzso we have created a map of the bovine zzso locus and show that, in zzso in addition to the anticipated zzso zzso zzso there are also zzso zzso or zzso zzso Among the V genes in the zzso zzso there are several genes that lack a zzso and are functionally rearranged and transcribed and, in some cases, have an extended zzso The number of bovine V genes is a multiple of the number in mice and humans and may zzso T cell receptors that use a novel way of interacting with zzso
