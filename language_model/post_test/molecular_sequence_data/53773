zzso have a high affinity for the zzso interface and have been suggested to play a role in determining the zzso of membrane zzso We investigated this potential role zzso using zzso of the zzso zzso coat zzso whose zzso zzso are sensitive to small changes in zzso acid zzso zzso were constructed with varying numbers of zzso zzso the zzso region and zzso was assessed by an in zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso coli inner membrane zzso could take place under a variety of experimental conditions, with zzso or zzso zzso and zzso motive zzso or zzso zzso It was found that zzso can even occur in pure zzso zzso under which conditions the zzso must directly interact with the zzso However, under all these conditions zzso neither inhibited nor zzso zzso demonstrating that they do not affect zzso and suggesting that this may be universal for zzso in membrane zzso In contrast, we could demonstrate that zzso clearly prefer to stay on the zzso of the zzso in agreement with the zzso zzso A statistical analysis focusing on zzso localized zzso showed that in zzso membrane proteins zzso are indeed located on the inside, while zzso are zzso localized at the outer zzso Since our experimental results show that the latter is not due to a zzso role, we propose instead that zzso fulfill a functional role as zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of the zzso
