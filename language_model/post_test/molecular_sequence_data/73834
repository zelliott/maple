In the course of the zzso zzso zzso project, we succeeded in cloning all the genes zzso translation zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso With the exception of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso factors has not been previously zzso For zzso we found three genes whose zzso acid zzso sequences are quite zzso each other zzso but whose 3' untranslated regions zzso are completely zzso Southern zzso indicated that those three zzso genes are located at different zzso Northern analysis indicated that one of three zzso genes was zzso with zzso while the level of expression for another of three zzso genes was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence predicted from the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso clone covered almost all the coding sequence zzso of zzso except the first zzso which has zzso identity with that of zzso zzso We also identified two copies of zzso zzso zzso zzso Their zzso sequences deduced from zzso sequences are identical zzso but they have different 3' zzso The location of these two zzso genes in different zzso was proved by Southern zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso clone zzso only a third of the zzso from the zzso and its deduced zzso sequence has a zzso identity with those of other zzso and zzso
