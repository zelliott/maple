The zzso cone zzso zzso zzso is the deadliest snail on zzso In the absence of medical intervention, zzso of human stinging cases are zzso zzso its zzso is known to consist of a cocktail of small peptides targeting different zzso and zzso the bulk of its zzso constituents, their sites of zzso relative zzso and how they function collectively in zzso has remained zzso 

We have used zzso sequencing to systematically zzso the contents the zzso zzso zzso zzso dividing it into four segments in order to investigate each segment's zzso zzso Three different types of calcium channel (each targeted by zzso entirely distinct zzso zzso and at least two different zzso receptors appear to be targeted by the zzso Moreover, the most highly expressed zzso component is not zzso but causes sensory zzso and is expressed in a different segment of the zzso duct from zzso believed to cause sensory zzso We have also identified several new toxins of interest for pharmaceutical and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is believed to prey on fish hiding in reef zzso at zzso Our data suggest that zzso of prey is central to its zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression profiles also suggest a sophisticated layering of zzso patterns within the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso expressed in different zzso Thus, our zzso analysis provides a new zzso framework for understanding the molecular zzso strategy of this deadly zzso
