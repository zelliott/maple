There is increasing evidence that male or female zzso tract represent a distinct replication compartment for human zzso virus type 1 zzso and that such compartments may serve as a virus zzso zzso paired plasma and zzso samples from zzso females undergoing zzso were collected to examine the viral responses to zzso therapy and to assess the possible role of the zzso tract as a zzso for drug-resistant zzso zzso females had zzso viral zzso both in plasma and zzso fluid, whereas 14 females had zzso virus only in zzso Twelve paired samples were used to analyze zzso pol sequences for the presence of drug zzso zzso Nine of the twelve paired samples exhibited zzso drug resistance zzso zzso The other three females showed identical drug zzso zzso However, further examination of zzso and zzso showed numerous zzso zzso that corresponded to zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso were different between plasma and zzso zzso suggesting that evolution of zzso was independent in these two zzso
