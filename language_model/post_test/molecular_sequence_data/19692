zzso virus zzso encodes many zzso zzso including zzso of zzso and zzso of innate immune zzso zzso protein zzso is an zzso zzso that contributes to virus zzso and was reported to inhibit nuclear factor zzso zzso However, analysis of zzso zzso in cells infected with zzso viruses with or without the zzso gene showed no difference in zzso gene zzso Given that zzso promotes virus zzso other possible functions of zzso were investigated and this revealed that zzso is an inhibitor of zzso in cells zzso with the zzso gene and in the context of zzso zzso In support of this finding zzso expressed zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso proteins Bid, Bad and zzso as well as with Bad and zzso expressed by zzso In addition, the crystal structure of zzso was solved to zzso A resolution zzso zzso zzso although zzso shows no sequence similarity to cellular zzso its three-dimensional structure closely resembles zzso and other members of the zzso protein zzso The structure also reveals that zzso has a zzso open surface groove similar to the grooves of other zzso zzso zzso which bind the zzso motifs of zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso of zzso peptides into the zzso surface groove, together with analysis of their zzso properties, suggests a mechanism for the specificity of zzso zzso This study illustrates the importance of the evolutionary conservation of structure, rather than zzso in protein function and reveals a novel zzso protein from zzso
