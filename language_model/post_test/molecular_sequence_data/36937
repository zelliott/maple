zzso gamma zzso production has been attributed exclusively to activated T cells and zzso zzso We sought to determine whether human B cells express zzso We studied 28 B cell lines including zzso virus zzso normal zzso B cell lines (N zzso zzso zzso B cell lines derived from patients with zzso zzso with (N zzso 6) or without AIDS (N zzso zzso as well as seven zzso B cell zzso All cell lines were studied by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso We detected zzso expression of zzso in every B cell zzso The tumor promoters zzso and zzso appeared to enhance this zzso expression in nearly every B cell zzso The 517 zzso zzso spanning the entire protein coding region of the zzso zzso from three representative lines were zzso definitively establishing that B cell zzso is identical to zzso from activated T cells and is not altered by derivation of the B cell lines from AIDS patients or by zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the entire panel of zzso and zzso cell lines suggests that the zzso gene is broadly expressed by human B zzso Our data imply that human B cells can be activated to produce zzso further zzso B cells in the dynamics of zzso
