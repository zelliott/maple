A zzso zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso was isolated that required zzso zzso for zzso The zzso was found to reside within a zzso designated zzso zzso a protein of 216 zzso acids with a high level of similarity to bacterial zzso zzso The zzso zzso completely lost zzso zzso activity, which is easily zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso strain could no longer grow in minimal medium without zzso zzso the zzso gene product is essential for the de zzso synthesis of zzso via zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene is surrounded by genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as deduced from sequence zzso The genetic zzso in zzso zzso zzso is identical to that found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
