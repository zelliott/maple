The zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso cells was unaffected by the addition of zzso zzso zzso indicating the absence of any zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with the zzso promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to the rapid transient induction of zzso activity which attained a maximum value after about 13 h before slowly zzso Such induction was attenuated by zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed to zzso with two regions identified as being characteristic of zzso forms found in various species and predicted to amplify a zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso allowed an zzso 600 zzso zzso to be amplified from zzso preparations of rat brain but not from zzso cells unless they had been treated with zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso protein zzso C zzso and zzso but not those zzso to zzso zzso I or zzso exhibited a twofold higher zzso zzso They also expressed a zzso activity, with zzso zzso a zzso increase in total zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso identified an zzso 600 zzso product in zzso cells zzso to zzso zzso and zzso but not in those zzso zzso I or zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso caused a zzso albeit zzso increase in zzso activity, which reached a maximum some 1 h after zzso challenge, before returning to resting levels some 2 h zzso The residual zzso zzso zzso activity was dramatically reduced zzso zzso in the zzso zzso suggesting that the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was selectively reduced by zzso of this particular zzso zzso These data identify a novel point of zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso systems where the action of specific zzso zzso is shown to cause the induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that this protein zzso zzso process might involve regulation of zzso gene expression by the zzso zzso zzso
