A zzso non-obese diabetic zzso mouse strain that contains a segment of zzso 3 from the zzso mouse strain zzso was less susceptible to diabetes than zzso zzso A fully zzso zzso zzso also mapped to this segment, which encodes the zzso zzso zzso for zzso G zzso zzso gamma zzso The zzso zzso zzso which results in a deletion of the zzso tail, caused a 73 percent reduction in the turnover of cell surface zzso zzso The development of zzso strains and the characterization of zzso traits that are specific to the disease zzso demonstrate the feasibility of zzso the zzso of complex, zzso zzso
