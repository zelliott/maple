In pea leaves, the synthesis of zzso a primary step in folate zzso was only detected in zzso This reaction is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which represented zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso had a native zzso zzso of zzso zzso and was made up of identical zzso of 53 zzso The reaction zzso by the zzso zzso domain of the protein was zzso and behaved like a random zzso zzso The related zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence corresponded to a zzso of 515 zzso with a calculated zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence with the zzso sequence of the zzso protein indicated that the plant zzso is zzso with a putative zzso transit zzso of 28 zzso zzso The calculated zzso of the mature protein was zzso zzso Southern zzso experiments suggested that a zzso gene codes for the zzso This result, together with the facts that the protein is zzso with a zzso transit zzso and that the activity was only detected in zzso strongly supports the view that zzso is the major zzso site of zzso synthesis in higher plant zzso
