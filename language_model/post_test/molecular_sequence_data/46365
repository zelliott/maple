zzso zzso are aquatic zzso with the ability to survive extreme zzso or zzso at any life zzso To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms used by zzso during zzso we constructed a zzso library enriched for genes that are zzso in zzso zzso 24 h after onset of zzso zzso expressed sequence tags zzso were zzso and sequences grouped into categories according to their probable zzso Of 75 unique zzso approximately half zzso were similar to known genes from other zzso These included genes zzso an unusual group 3 late zzso abundant zzso and a number of other stress-related and DNA repair zzso Open reading frames from a further 39 novel zzso without counterparts in the database, were screened for the characteristics of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lack of stable secondary zzso Such proteins have been implicated in zzso tolerance and at least five were zzso The majority of the genes identified was confirmed by real-time quantitative zzso to be capable of zzso in response to zzso water zzso zzso further database and zzso analysis highlighted four zzso that are present in the zzso zzso zzso but which represent genes probably arising from zzso or bacteria by horizontal gene zzso zzso not only can zzso zzso accumulate foreign genes and render them zzso competent, but their expression pattern can be modified for participation in the zzso stress response, and is presumably zzso in this zzso
