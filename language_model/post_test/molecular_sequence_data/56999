We describe a new human satellite I DNA zzso zzso which is composed of 72 copies of zzso repeating units of 42 zzso zzso These repeating units are zzso organized into a higher order structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso of this DNA revealed base zzso deletions and zzso and an overall conservation of zzso among the zzso The sequence has a high AT content of zzso Under zzso in zzso zzso conditions, satellite I is found on the zzso regions of zzso 3 and 4 and on all the zzso zzso On the zzso zzso satellite I is further detected on the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso cell hybrids under high stringency indicates the presence of the zzso zzso predominantly on zzso zzso zzso 21 shows a 50- to zzso reduced amount of this zzso and the presence of other sequences closely related to zzso Investigation of a group of 11 human zzso zzso zzso revealed the retention of satellite I DNA around the zzso in all zzso These results extend our understanding of these zzso and of the general structural organization of the zzso regions of the zzso zzso
