zzso zzso plants with a zzso coding sequence under the control of a zzso promoter sometimes lose zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity and purple flower zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso In these plants, shorter zzso and zzso zzso zzso are found, and a 3' zzso zzso zzso from the zzso is more resistant to zzso The zzso of this zzso zzso are located in a region of zzso between the zzso 3' coding region and its 3' untranslated zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments remain in the white flower tissue of a zzso zzso zzso We present a model involving cycles of zzso pairing between complementary sequences followed by zzso zzso zzso to describe how zzso degradation is likely to be zzso
