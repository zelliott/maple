zzso molecules that can bind to the Rev protein of zzso have been isolated from random sequence zzso acid pools based on a minimal zzso element zzso found within the Rev zzso zzso zzso While the selected sequences are related to the zzso element, they also contain zzso that allow them to bind Rev up to zzso better in zzso A hypothesized zzso pairing at zzso is generally replaced by zzso the occasional selection of zzso suggests that zzso may be in a zzso zzso These data support the structural model for the zzso originally proposed by zzso et zzso zzso Additional interactions with the Rev protein are promoted by the sequence zzso zzso zzso found in one class of zzso zzso but absent from the zzso zzso Within each class of zzso different zzso and zzso zzso with one another to generate optimal zzso zzso The zzso of different zzso zzso suggest structural models for both the zzso zzso and the selected zzso zzso
