zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in the life cycle of the human zzso viruses zzso A better understanding of this zzso and its two zzso functions, the DNA zzso and the zzso zzso could lead to the development of new drugs that would specifically block zzso zzso The available zzso zzso zzso and zzso data on the reverse zzso of zzso zzso the possible structure of the DNA zzso zzso The purpose of this review is to correlate the data and to discuss, in light of that data, a model for the structure of the zzso zzso In this model, the zzso domain is approximately 50 to 60 A in diameter with a 20 A opening to accommodate the zzso acid zzso The most zzso zzso region of zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso is proposed to form the inner surface of the 20 A opening to which the zzso acid zzso is zzso
