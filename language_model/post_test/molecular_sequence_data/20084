Both the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were applied in a quantitative zzso relationship zzso zzso For seven zzso systems, zzso models were built that describe the retention times of a set of peptides using a large set of molecular zzso as potential predictor zzso The use of zzso models for zzso retention prediction of peptides may be valuable in zzso research to improve the number of correct zzso zzso Always, zzso of the samples was used to derive the zzso models zzso zzso whereas the remaining zzso of the peptides were treated as an independent external test zzso For four systems, the models obtained by zzso have better zzso abilities than the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso model performance was compared with those of other zzso zzso zzso For five out of seven systems it was observed that the zzso variable elimination by the partial least squares zzso approach zzso all other methods zzso For three systems zzso errors smaller than 30 s were zzso zzso zzso and a multiple linear zzso model based on three zzso led to the best zzso for the remaining two zzso
