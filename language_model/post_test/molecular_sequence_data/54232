An zzso zzso was isolated by mild acid degradation of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and studied by sugar and zzso analyses as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments in zzso and a zzso experiment in a zzso zzso mixture to reveal correlations for zzso zzso It was found that the zzso is built up of linear zzso repeating units containing an zzso of zzso acid with zzso and has the following zzso The zzso studied is structurally and zzso closely related to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
