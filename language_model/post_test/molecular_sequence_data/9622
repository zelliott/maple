The zzso virus zzso zzso Q promoter zzso is the only promoter used for the zzso of zzso virus nuclear zzso 1 zzso zzso in cells in the most restricted zzso I) zzso infection zzso However, zzso is inactive in type III zzso With the use of the zzso zzso system, a new cellular gene has been identified that encodes proteins which bind to sequence in zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the gene has significant zzso to the zzso regulatory factors zzso This new gene and products including two zzso zzso are designated zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso is predominantly in zzso zzso and peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso proteins were identified in primary zzso with specific zzso against zzso zzso zzso can bind to zzso response element zzso sequence and repress zzso zzso by both zzso and zzso Additionally, a functional viral zzso zzso zzso has been identified in zzso Finally, the expression of zzso is consistently high in type III zzso cells and almost zzso in type I zzso corresponding to the activity of zzso zzso in these zzso states and the ability of the zzso proteins to repress zzso zzso The identification of a functional viral zzso and association of zzso with type III zzso may be relevant to the mechanism of regulation of zzso
