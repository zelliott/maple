zzso zzso zzso zzso like other members of the zzso family, is expressed in skeletal zzso Its mechanism of action remains zzso zzso of zzso was analyzed in human bone zzso zzso cells zzso by zzso We identified two major transcripts corresponding to those of full-length zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso which lacks a putative zzso binding zzso To investigate the function of zzso in bone, zzso cultures were treated with zzso human zzso and analyzed for proliferation and zzso zzso zzso treatment increased both zzso incorporation and alkaline zzso (AP) zzso Considering the known functional zzso found between the zzso zzso and members of the zzso family, we next tested the effect of zzso on zzso zzso We found that zzso could reduce zzso induced zzso zzso Similarly, zzso inhibited zzso induction of zzso zzso To explore functional differences between the zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso into zzso Both zzso could strongly induce zzso zzso However, there were no effects of either zzso on zzso activity without an additional zzso stimulus such as zzso Taken together our results suggest a functional relationship between zzso and zzso To further define this relationship we analyzed the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso induced zzso of zzso Our data indicates that full-length zzso and its zzso zzso are zzso of proliferation and zzso zzso and may be novel regulators of zzso signaling in zzso zzso
