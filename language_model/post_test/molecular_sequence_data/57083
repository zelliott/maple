The structural gene for zzso coli zzso I (called zzso has been cloned by use of sequence data obtained from the zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped at zzso zzso pair of the zzso coli physical map zzso zzso of zzso coli genetic zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso gene was obtained and the deduced protein sequence showed that zzso I consists of 182 zzso acids and has a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso of the DNA and protein sequence data suggested that a leader sequence of 26 zzso acid zzso is zzso from the primary translation product, and this processing was confirmed by zzso sequencing of the primary translation product zzso in zzso These data predicted that zzso I zzso believed to be a zzso zzso is exported to the cell zzso a prediction supported by release of the zzso from cells upon zzso zzso The zzso protein sequence does not exhibit any significant overall sequence similarity with other known zzso although the sequence does contain two small sequence elements found in several other zzso One of these elements is a sequence similar to the zzso zzso active sites found in zzso zzso and four other zzso A zzso zzso within this zzso element was shown to be zzso labeled with zzso zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso The second sequence element is a zzso sequence found close to the zzso zzso that is also found in the zzso zzso of the four known active zzso zzso The zzso role of zzso I is zzso A strain carrying a zzso zzso of the zzso gene was constructed and found to have no growth zzso Moreover, a strain carrying a zzso that gave massive overproduction of zzso zzso zzso higher than that of the wild zzso also grew zzso In addition a strain containing double zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso (the structural gene for zzso coli zzso zzso also failed to display any growth zzso Analysis of the fatty acid compositions of zzso zzso A, and zzso of the above strains showed no significant changes from a wild type zzso
