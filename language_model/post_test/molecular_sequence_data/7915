The crystal structure of the large zzso of the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso determined at zzso resolution, demonstrates a compact zzso zzso The zzso domain is identical in fold to the equivalent region of the zzso zzso of zzso coli DNA zzso I zzso pol zzso Although the zzso domain of zzso differs greatly in sequence from its counterpart in zzso pol I, it has clearly evolved from a common zzso The structure of zzso reveals the strategy zzso by this protein to maintain activity at high temperatures and provides the structural basis for future improvements of the zzso
