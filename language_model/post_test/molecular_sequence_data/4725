A fatal zzso case of zzso zzso was examined to investigate the crossing of the zzso barrier zzso by zzso zzso zzso examination showed bacteria in zzso adhering to the zzso of both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso cultivated from the blood and the zzso fluid zzso revealed no zzso variation of the zzso or the class 5 zzso whereas the expression of the zzso protein was greater in the zzso and the zzso zzso than in the zzso This was due to an increased activity of one of the zzso zzso This higher expression of zzso correlated in zzso with greater zzso to zzso zzso A zzso in the single zzso locus of this strain abolished in zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso plays an important role in the crossing of the zzso likely through zzso zzso
