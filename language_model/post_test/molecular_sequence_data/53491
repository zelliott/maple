To better understand the emergence of zzso C and its potential impact on vaccine efforts in Uganda, we have characterized zzso C sequences from Uganda zzso zzso zzso Zimbabwe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso South Africa zzso zzso zzso and India zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso C sequences in the zzso zzso gene region revealed multiple zzso within zzso zzso Further, while most Ugandan zzso zzso together, other zzso did not reflect a clear geographic zzso The zzso divergence within the Ugandan subset was zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso for the other zzso C zzso zzso The protein sequence alignment revealed marked sequence conservation of major zzso zzso within the zzso zzso
