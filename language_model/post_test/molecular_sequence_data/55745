We report the discovery of a zzso zzso gene cluster zzso in which zzso resulted in defective soybean zzso zzso development and symbiotic nitrogen zzso The predicted, zzso protein sequences suggested that zzso is a zzso b and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 54 zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso c and that they are all zzso The isolation and analysis of membrane proteins from zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells revealed two zzso zzso of 28 and 32 zzso as the likely products of the zzso and zzso genes and showed that both were zzso only under zzso growth zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso deletion zzso grown zzso or zzso (with zzso exhibited a strong decrease in zzso zzso activity as compared with the wild zzso The data suggest that the zzso gene products are induced at low oxygen zzso and constitute a member of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso The described features are compatible with the zzso that this zzso complex is specifically required to support bacterial zzso in zzso
