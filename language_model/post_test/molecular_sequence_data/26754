zzso zzso was recently described from Northern Vietnam, but very sparse information exists for the zzso We report for the first time the zzso of this species and investigate its zzso position in the zzso division using both zzso and nuclear genetic zzso The zzso zzso number of the species is zzso This zzso set consists of one zzso pair, one zzso pair, and zzso pairs of zzso zzso progressively decreasing in zzso The X zzso is zzso and approximately equal in size to the largest zzso zzso The Y zzso is zzso and equal in size to the smallest pair of zzso The zzso reconstruction based on the zzso b zzso and zzso genes reveals that zzso zzso a species distributed in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is the closest relative to zzso zzso These two zzso are similar not only in a number of zzso characters, but also in their major ecological preferences (both are zzso species associated with limestone zzso zzso Based on our data, we can conclude that the similarities among the ecological zzso natural conditions and habitat preferences of these species are a reflection of their zzso zzso
