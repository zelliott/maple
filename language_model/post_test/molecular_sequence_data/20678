zzso b zzso b) gene complete sequences zzso of zzso zzso were zzso In order to clarify the zzso position of the zzso zzso we investigated the zzso of 15 zzso zzso distributed in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso methods using DNA fragments of zzso b zzso The results supported that the zzso merged into zzso and negated the zzso of zzso Furthermore, the prediction of zzso structures of zzso b exhibited the CD loop region contain two short zzso forming a hairpin arrangement, namely zzso and zzso zzso analysis shows that the zzso region is unstable zzso and may provide mobility to zzso acids located at the zzso and might provide high flexibility to the top of zzso zzso zzso and the cavity region of zzso binding zzso It suggested that the two short zzso of CD loop region of zzso b was a dominating portion for zzso binding zzso
