Local zzso profiles in skin zzso from allergic and zzso patch test reactions were determined by in zzso zzso to differentiate between these 2 clinically identical zzso especially at the same time of final reading in diagnostic patch zzso zzso were taken from established allergic persons after specific allergic patch tests to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and from zzso individuals with zzso patch tests to sodium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso At 72 h after application of the agents, significantly enhanced zzso of zzso zzso cells, producing zzso zzso and zzso per 100 zzso cells in the zzso were observed in allergic as well as zzso test patch zzso as compared to normal zzso zzso higher zzso of zzso producing cells were observed in zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso affected zzso The allergic and zzso patch test reactions showed similar levels of expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso confirmed by probe based detection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, the described similarity shows that zzso and zzso can induce the same profile of zzso zzso zzso and zzso production, resulting in the near impossibility of discriminating between allergic and zzso contact zzso at the time of patch test zzso
