Studies were performed to assess the genetic variation amongst zzso of the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 37 zzso were zzso from a range of zzso and zzso zzso species, as well as 21 from eight other zzso zzso Universal zzso were used to amplify the ITS zzso regions and all of the species tested produced discrete ITS groups, with the exception of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso regions from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that these three species formed distinct groups with sequence identities of zzso between the zzso An ITS size of ca 1,100 zzso was diagnostic for zzso zzso while ca 1,450 zzso was characteristic of zzso zzso zzso analysis failed to yield zzso zzso in any of the zzso zzso zzso screened, although it was useful in distinguishing between different zzso zzso Some zzso variation in the ITS region was detected in a number of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We propose that two zzso previously identified as zzso zzso based on zzso zzso are actually zzso zzso based on molecular zzso zzso analysis of the complete ITS region from zzso zzso and zzso zzso allowed zzso zzso to be developed for zzso zzso and zzso zzso These were used to screen zzso infected in laboratory zzso and from zzso samples, without prior isolation of the zzso The zzso are useful tools for zzso the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso as well as assessing competitive interactions between these two zzso
