This work introduces an integrated zzso device for measuring rapid zzso exchange zzso in zzso By monitoring backbone zzso zzso on the zzso to low second time scale, we are able to characterize zzso dynamics in zzso structured regions, such as zzso and molten zzso zzso that are zzso in conventional zzso zzso The device zzso the entire zzso zzso zzso on a single chip with residence times sufficiently small zzso 8 zzso that zzso is negligible zzso even without zzso zzso include an adjustable position zzso mixer providing a zzso labeling pulse, a zzso mixer for zzso zzso a zzso zzso for rapid protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present work, we characterize device performance using three model systems, each illustrating a different application of zzso zzso zzso is used to illustrate a zzso high zzso structural analysis based on a single zzso zzso zzso In experiments using zzso zzso we distinguish dynamic behavior in zzso establishing a link between flexibility and interactions with the zzso prosthetic zzso Finally, we zzso an unusually high zzso of zzso in the large zzso zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso region surrounding the active zzso
