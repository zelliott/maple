We present evidence that the in zzso activity of the zzso protein zzso zzso is modified because of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso Using an in zzso zzso a form of zzso that has zzso zzso at its zzso target sites has, in addition to zzso zzso functions, the ability to alter severely zzso and abdominal zzso The novel functions of this protein suggest that this form of zzso is not suppressed zzso by the more zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the in zzso activity of a form of zzso that contains zzso zzso acid zzso at its zzso target sites, thereby mimicking a zzso zzso zzso zzso is greatly zzso This zzso form of zzso but not the zzso form, is also reduced in its ability to bind to DNA zzso with the zzso protein zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso by zzso is important for preventing inappropriate activities of this zzso protein during zzso
