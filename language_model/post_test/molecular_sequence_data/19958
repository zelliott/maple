We have decided to use the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a model system to develop methods for the total chemical synthesis of G zzso zzso The most important feature of this zzso from a chemical synthesis perspective is the wealth of zzso spread throughout its zzso which are required for native chemical zzso A total of 13 zzso are located in the the zzso zzso zzso chain in both loop and putative zzso zzso zzso We envisioned a synthesis of the zzso that would make use of zzso ranging from 37 to 63 zzso in zzso Here, we report data from an exploratory synthesis of such a set of zzso For all seven zzso the crude material approximately 30 zzso into the synthesis was sufficiently homogeneous to make isolation and zzso zzso Extension of the peptides to between 40 and 50 zzso in length generally produced a significant decrease in the quality of the crude products, although in most cases, we judged that high purity peptides could probably be zzso By 60 zzso however, the crude zzso product zzso are probably too zzso to purify to zzso by zzso zzso In general, zzso zzso peptides with a single predicted TM domain were sufficiently soluble to handle zzso and to analyze by zzso zzso whereas zzso TM zzso rendered the peptides too zzso to handle or analyze by standard zzso Given the challenges of chain zzso zzso and zzso of these zzso a synthetic strategy that uses approximately 12 or 13 shorter zzso segments of zzso zzso each is probably a more feasible zzso
