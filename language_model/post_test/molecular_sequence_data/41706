The two DNA strands of the nuclear zzso are zzso zzso using three DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso Current evidence suggests that DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso is the primary leading strand zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso primarily perform lagging strand zzso The fact that these zzso differ in zzso and error specificity is interesting in light of the fact that the stability of the nuclear zzso depends in part on the ability of mismatch repair zzso to correct different zzso generated in different contexts during zzso Here we provide the first comparison, to our knowledge, of the efficiency of zzso of leading and lagging strand replication zzso We first use the zzso zzso incorporation propensity of a Pol zzso zzso zzso to confirm that Pol zzso is the primary leading strand zzso in zzso zzso We then use zzso error signatures to show that zzso efficiency in zzso strongly depends on the zzso the mismatch zzso and the location of the zzso An extreme case of variation by location is a zzso mismatch that is zzso to zzso This mismatch is flanked by an zzso zzso repeat sequence that, when zzso restores zzso to zzso zzso zzso Thus this natural DNA sequence suppresses zzso placing a nearby base pair at high risk of zzso due to leading strand replication zzso We find that, overall, zzso most efficiently zzso the most potentially deleterious errors zzso and then the most common substitution zzso In combination with earlier studies, the results suggest that significant differences exist in the generation and repair of Pol zzso zzso and zzso replication zzso but in a generally complementary manner that results in zzso replication of both DNA strands of the zzso nuclear zzso
