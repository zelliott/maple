The zzso virus zzso gene zzso encodes a protein of 340 zzso acids with the following structural features that are zzso in all zzso a site for zzso zzso 14 zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Previous studies showed that zzso is one of eight proteins associated in a putative zzso zzso Our attempt to isolate a zzso without the zzso gene was zzso suggesting that it is essential for virus zzso To further investigate its role, we constructed a zzso zzso virus in which zzso is regulated by addition of an zzso zzso zzso protein was associated with mature infectious zzso and could be labeled with a zzso zzso zzso indicating surface zzso zzso of zzso reduced the zzso yield by about zzso zzso zzso all stages of virus zzso appeared normal and zzso zzso were present on the cell zzso zzso zzso assembled without zzso had a specific zzso of less than zzso of the normal level and a comparably small amount of zzso whereas their overall zzso zzso including other components of the zzso complex, was similar to that of zzso made in the presence of zzso or of zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to cells, but penetration of zzso into the zzso and early viral zzso synthesis were barely zzso and zzso fusion was not triggered by low zzso Of the identified components of the zzso complex, zzso is the sixth that has been shown to be required for entry and membrane zzso
