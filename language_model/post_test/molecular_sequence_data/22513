In this study, three novel zzso zzso were isolated at temperatures below 15 degrees C from zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso These compounds were characterized using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The compounds were characterized as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These unusual zzso acid zzso carbohydrates were then tested in zzso for effects on cell proliferation and gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso B demonstrated potent zzso and zzso effects, while zzso C, on the other hand, exhibited significant cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso A could only be isolated in smaller zzso and it proved to be very zzso Thus no biological effects could be observed in this zzso The in zzso zzso also indicated that zzso B and C are zzso and competitive in their effects on cell zzso The results of this work represent a major step forward in the research on zzso zzso zzso This is the first time that two fully chemically characterized compounds are shown to be responsible for known biological activities of zzso zzso zzso
