A human zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso was identified by the zzso transportation zzso method zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1998, zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on sequence analysis of the full-length zzso this novel gene has two alternative zzso forms, zzso and zzso which zzso putative proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains five zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso lacks the first zzso domain at the zzso zzso zzso is detected in various human zzso by Northern zzso The zzso gene is mapped zzso to marker zzso zzso 1 in the human zzso zzso region, by zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity when tested in zzso fusion protein zzso zzso fusion protein expressed in zzso cells predominantly localized to the zzso A series of deletion zzso revealed that a minimal domain consisting of the third and fourth zzso possesses zzso targeting zzso These results suggest that zzso is a ubiquitous zzso zzso that plays a role in the zzso
