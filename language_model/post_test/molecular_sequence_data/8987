zzso viruses of zzso poultry and wild aquatic birds usually have distinguishable zzso zzso Here we used a panel of synthetic zzso and zzso zzso zzso to characterize zzso profiles of about 70 zzso influenza viruses isolated from aquatic birds, land-based poultry, and horses in zzso and zzso Unlike typical duck influenza viruses with zzso zzso zzso all avian zzso influenza zzso irrespective of the host species, displayed a zzso binding zzso zzso preferential binding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso This zzso correlated with the unique zzso acid sequence of the zzso acid 185 to 189 loop of zzso zzso and seemed to be dependent on zzso interactions between the zzso group of the zzso and zzso and on the lack of zzso clashes between the zzso zzso and zzso Many North American and zzso zzso influenza viruses displayed weak but zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso highlighting the potential of zzso influenza viruses for zzso zzso zzso zzso influenza viruses differed from other viruses by preferential binding to the zzso form of zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso site of contemporary zzso influenza viruses in aquatic and zzso birds was formed after the introduction of their common precursor from ducks to a new host, presumably, zzso zzso The uniformity of the zzso profile of zzso influenza viruses in various wild and domestic birds indicates that there is no strong zzso host range restriction in birds on viruses with this zzso zzso This notion agrees with repeated zzso transmission of zzso influenza viruses from aquatic birds to zzso
