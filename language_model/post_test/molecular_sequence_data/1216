A zzso zzso zzso from zzso a new member of the plant zzso gene family of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The expression pattern of the corresponding gene as well as its zzso from zzso was analyzed and the zzso proteins were localized in the two zzso zzso expression is strongly zzso by light in potato and zzso leaf zzso zzso gel zzso analysis, reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and zzso fluorescent protein zzso fusion studies, respectively, indicate that the gene is expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso and its zzso protein is localized to the zzso The similar patterns of zzso gene regulation in potato and zzso prompted us to screen publicly available gene expression data from zzso zzso zzso zzso covering 83 different experimental zzso zzso of zzso transcript levels was overall moderate, except for a limited number of experimental conditions where zzso zzso zzso varied between zzso and zzso Overall, these analyses suggest involvement of the zzso protein in cell wall metabolism in young, rapidly growing zzso independent of other zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso analysis allowed identification of zzso or zzso expression profiles of a small set of genes involved in zzso regulation, and zzso carbon zzso These data give clues about the possible biological function of zzso and shed light on the complex web of interactions in which zzso could play a zzso
