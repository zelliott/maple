The view has been widely held that zzso zzso zzso are found only in zzso and not in zzso However, a recent zzso search zzso zzso & zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that, in seven of zzso 1000 completely zzso bacterial zzso genes were present zzso zzso that displayed the requisite hallmark sequence motifs of zzso zzso zzso The implications of this theoretical observation prompted us to generate zzso data to validate this finding zzso The zzso zzso gene from one of the seven identified bacterial species, zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso termed zzso A, was produced in soluble form, zzso to zzso and shown to display properties remarkably similar to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso A was zzso active at zzso pH values, zzso a zzso that has been widely used for assessment of the zzso activity of other zzso zzso and displayed a clear preference for zzso zzso bonds between zzso zzso in the zzso positions of the zzso It was completely inhibited by the general inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of one of the zzso zzso zzso (in the zzso motif of the zzso zzso resulted in complete loss of zzso zzso It can thus be concluded unequivocally that this zzso gene encodes an active zzso zzso zzso It is now beyond doubt that zzso zzso zzso are not confined to zzso but are zzso within some species of zzso The distinctions between the bacterial and zzso zzso are discussed and their evolutionary relationships are zzso
