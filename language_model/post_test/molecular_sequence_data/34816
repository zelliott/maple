The zzso zzso zzso family of zzso includes over 6,000 members identified in zzso zzso Of these zzso approximately 300 have been characterized zzso and the three-dimensional crystal structures of approximately 40 have been zzso Since some zzso zzso are steroid zzso involved in hypertension, diabetes, breast cancer, and zzso kidney disease, it is important to characterize the other members of the family for which the biological functions are currently unknown and to determine their three-dimensional structure and mechanism of zzso Although the zzso family appears to have only a single fully zzso zzso it was possible, using zzso methods, to determine characteristic fingerprints composed of zzso zzso that are zzso at the zzso or greater level in zzso zzso These fingerprints permit reliable prediction of several important zzso features including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Human type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso sequence identity with a human zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso family zzso for which an X-ray structure has been zzso Both zzso and zzso appear to trace their origins back to bacterial zzso Combining three-dimensional structural information and sequence data on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso analysis, we were able to identify the zzso critical to the zzso function of zzso We also identified the zzso most probably responsible for the zzso activity of zzso We test our predictions by specific zzso based on sequence analysis and our zzso zzso
