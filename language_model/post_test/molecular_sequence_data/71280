An outstanding problem in zzso zzso is the relationship of the zzso zzso zzso the only living species of the order zzso to the extant zzso zzso In order to examine this problem the complete zzso DNA zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso differs from that of other zzso zzso reported and appears to have reversed to the ancestral secondary structure of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis of 12 zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso included the zzso and 15 additional zzso two zzso and a zzso The most strongly supported tree identified the zzso as a sister group of a zzso including the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso By applying three molecular zzso points the divergence between the zzso and zzso was estimated at zzso 90 million years before zzso
