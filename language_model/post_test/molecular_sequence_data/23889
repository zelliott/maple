zzso from zzso T cell immunity through zzso of viral zzso structure is a zzso feature in the zzso of zzso infection and a major obstacle to zzso vaccine zzso However, the molecular zzso of this phenomenon at the T cell zzso zzso interface are zzso Here, we show that zzso escape is intimately linked to the structural zzso of constituent zzso zzso within zzso zzso T cell zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso sequences revealed that zzso T cell populations characterized by highly zzso zzso zzso motifs were rendered zzso by single zzso zzso in the zzso viral zzso zzso diverse zzso zzso without discernible motifs were not associated with viral zzso Thus, fundamental differences in the mode of zzso engagement direct the pattern of zzso viral zzso These findings have profound implications for the development of vaccines that elicit T cell immunity to combat pathogens with unstable zzso
