Multiple signaling pathways are thought to control the selective expression of genes over the course of zzso zzso One approach to zzso these pathways is to identify specific zzso elements that serve as the final targets for these signaling pathways in zzso zzso We now identify a novel repressive element from the zzso protein 43 zzso gene that can contribute to zzso gene expression by zzso zzso in a wide range of zzso cell zzso This repressive element is located downstream of the zzso zzso box and is highly zzso When transferred to viral promoters this element zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso show that the repressive element comprises at least two protein recognition zzso One of these is a novel sequence motif that we designate the zzso element, because it occurs downstream of the zzso boxes of the zzso protein of 25 zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso The zzso repressive element is distinct in sequence and position dependence from the zzso element zzso zzso element previously described in other neural genes and therefore is a likely target for a distinct set of signaling pathways involved in the control of zzso zzso
