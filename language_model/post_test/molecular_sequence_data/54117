A novel, zzso and zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a hot spring in zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The strain grew zzso and was capable of zzso growth on zzso and hydrogen, zzso growth on zzso zzso zzso and on zzso in the presence of zzso extract and zzso growth on several organic compounds, zzso and/or zzso During growth on zzso the final product was zzso resulting in a drop in pH from zzso to zzso zzso growth on zzso was observed at pH zzso zzso pH 4) and zzso zzso zzso 45 zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso As determined by zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, strain zzso represents a distinct species belonging to the class zzso and is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gave zzso values below zzso These results, together with zzso zzso showed that strain zzso represents a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
