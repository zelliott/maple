zzso the iron storage zzso plays a key role in iron zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso of Chinese shrimp, zzso zzso The predicted protein contains 170 zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular weight zzso about 19, zzso Da and theoretical zzso point zzso of zzso zzso acid alignment of zzso revealed zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso showed that the expression of zzso zzso was zzso after shrimp was challenged with either white spot syndrome virus zzso or heavy metal zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso A fusion protein containing zzso was produced and the zzso zzso protein exhibited similar function of iron zzso in zzso The result of zzso zzso and identification using zzso showed that two zzso fragments zzso and zzso of the zzso protein were identical to the corresponding sequence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein will be proved useful for study on the structure and function of zzso in zzso zzso
