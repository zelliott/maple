A zzso zzso zzso rod strain, designated zzso was isolated from a pool of marine zzso zzso zzso zzso China, and was subjected to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can grow in the presence of zzso % zzso zzso zzso zzso and pH zzso and grew zzso at 30 zzso pH zzso in natural seawater zzso The polar lipids were composed of zzso three unidentified zzso and three unidentified polar zzso The respiratory zzso was zzso 8 zzso and the major fatty acids were zzso zzso feature 8, zzso zzso zzso zzso feature 3, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was 58 zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso belonging to zzso it shared zzso and zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to the type strains in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition to the large zzso zzso gene sequence difference, zzso can also be distinguished from the reference type strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by several zzso characteristics and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso properties, strain zzso is suggested to represent a novel species of a new zzso in zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
