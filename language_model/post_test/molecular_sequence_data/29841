zzso of zzso zzso recognized by zzso T zzso which has evolved during recent years opens new possibilities for specific zzso zzso Among different groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in many tumors and among normal zzso only in zzso represent the most perspective zzso for zzso because of their broad zzso zzso More than 50 CT zzso have been described so far and, for many of them, zzso recognized by T zzso have been zzso The most studied group of CT zzso is the zzso zzso which form the so-called zzso zzso together with some zzso proteins that have a different distribution than classical CT zzso The zzso zzso includes five families: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the structure of members of zzso zzso points to the existence of a domain organization of these zzso The central, core domain zzso zzso is highly zzso The first domain is zzso among zzso family members with a CT zzso but unique for each member of the zzso and zzso zzso In addition to the zzso of the central domain, the third domain is also zzso among all members of zzso zzso but to a much lesser zzso The zzso proteins contain an zzso fourth domain, which in the case of zzso zzso with zzso a separate zzso described previously as an zzso zzso that zzso in zzso zzso The structural zzso of the members of zzso zzso might help in the future to understand the biological function of zzso zzso One important property of the CT zzso is the zzso of their expression by DNA zzso agents, indicating a possible mechanism for their zzso in zzso One of the implications of this particular property could be that a combination of zzso targeting CT zzso with chemotherapy inducing zzso of CT zzso might result in more efficient tumor zzso
