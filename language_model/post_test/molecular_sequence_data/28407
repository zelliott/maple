We have tested the functional zzso between rev protein of human zzso virus type I zzso and zzso protein of human zzso zzso virus type I zzso Each protein recognized the other's zzso zzso albeit at reduced zzso Both proteins zzso predominantly in the zzso We have identified a new zzso signal in rev zzso which was zzso to that of zzso zzso The sequence zzso in rev zzso when fused to the zzso of zzso directed the hybrid protein to the cell zzso A deletion zzso which lacks several zzso acid zzso within the signal failed to function in the zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso targeting signals are essential for the functions of Rev and zzso
