Numbers of zzso per site for 15 zzso genes and six zzso of the plant zzso were estimated to compare modes and tempos of evolution between zzso and zzso and numbers of zzso per site also were investigated in zzso zzso zzso of numbers of zzso per site was assessed further among different zzso and between zzso and nuclear zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso differences in numbers of zzso per site were found to be higher for zzso than synonymous sites, and this could be due to differential selection if zzso rate is assumed constant for the zzso Some zzso genes have evolved as fast as zzso zzso thus faster than previously zzso For zzso relative rate tests showed that woody zzso evolved slower than zzso at synonymous zzso Generation time, population size, and zzso rate are likely factors involved in this rate zzso zzso were less constrained than their adjacent zzso for both overall numbers of zzso per site and zzso but, on average, overall numbers of zzso per site for zzso were similar to numbers of synonymous zzso per site for zzso zzso were generally high between numbers of zzso and numbers of zzso per site for the same zzso zzso genes transferred to the nucleus had an accelerated rate of substitution per site, which was most significant at synonymous zzso These differences between zzso in two different zzso are likely the result of different zzso zzso
