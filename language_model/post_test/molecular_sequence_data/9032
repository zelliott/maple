zzso is an zzso zzso mechanism for the degradation of cellular zzso but its role in zzso during differentiation has not been zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with two functionally distinct zzso the zzso zzso and the germ line zzso zzso These zzso are produced during sexual reproduction zzso which involves differentiation and selective degradation of several specific zzso To examine the role of zzso in nuclear degradation, we studied the function of two zzso genes in zzso Through fluorescent protein zzso we found that both proteins are targeted to degrading zzso at specific zzso with some enrichment on the nuclear zzso suggesting the formation of zzso surrounding these zzso In addition, zzso knockout zzso cells showed a pronounced delay in nuclear degradation without apparently preventing the completion of other zzso zzso This evidence provided direct support for a critical role for zzso in programmed nuclear zzso The results also showed differential roles for two zzso zzso with zzso playing a more significant role in zzso than zzso although both are important in nuclear zzso
