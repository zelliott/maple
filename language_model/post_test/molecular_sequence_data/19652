zzso zzso are universally zzso in both cellular organisms and zzso Their three-dimensional structures have the shape of a right-hand with the active site located in the palm region, which has a zzso similar to that of the zzso recognition motif zzso found in many zzso zzso Considering that zzso have well zzso structures, it was surprising that the zzso zzso zzso from zzso a group of zzso zzso have their zzso motifs arranged in a zzso order in zzso Here we report the zzso A structure of a zzso zzso in which the zzso palm zzso adopts a new active site zzso that has not been previously observed in other zzso In addition, the zzso motif C of zzso has the sequence of zzso a highly unusual feature for zzso zzso Through zzso zzso we have shown that changing the zzso motif C from zzso to zzso results in a zzso with an increased zzso synthesis zzso Our results indicate that the active site zzso of zzso may represent a newly developed branch in zzso evolution, and that zzso may have acquired the zzso zzso to control their growth zzso
