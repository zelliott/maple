The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that regulates gene expression in response to the steroids testosterone and zzso zzso gene expression is likely to play an important role in a number of zzso disorders, such as prostate cancer, spinal zzso muscular zzso male type zzso and zzso The zzso contains two zzso zzso termed zzso zzso function 1) located in the zzso and zzso zzso function 2) in the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits weak zzso activity, whereas zzso is a strong regulator of zzso zzso regulation by zzso is thought to be modulated by a number of proteins that interact with this region, and by zzso zzso Our focus is on the zzso proteins and their regulation of zzso via interaction with the zzso To better understand the mechanism of zzso action, we have zzso zzso activity in zzso nuclear extracts using a unique dual reporter gene zzso Multiple zzso sites in the promoter allow zzso to be driven by a zzso zzso fusion zzso The findings from initial experiments suggest an increase in zzso initiation and zzso rates by zzso The role of zzso interactions involving zzso and zzso zzso factors and zzso activity are zzso
