Type I zzso zzso are zzso zzso that have diverse biological activities despite the fact that they appear to interact with the same zzso zzso To achieve a better understanding of the structural basis for the different activities of alpha and beta zzso we have determined the crystal structure of zzso human zzso at zzso resolution by molecular zzso The zzso adopts a fold similar to that of the previously determined structures of zzso zzso and human zzso but displays several distinct structural zzso Like human zzso human zzso contains a zzso site at the interface of the two molecules in the zzso unit, raising the question of functional relevance for zzso zzso However, unlike the human zzso zzso in which zzso surfaces form the zzso human zzso zzso with contact surfaces from opposite sides of the zzso The relevance of the structure to the effects of point zzso in zzso at specific exposed zzso is zzso A potential role of zzso interactions in the zzso assembly of zzso zzso components is zzso
