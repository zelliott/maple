zzso zzso zzso C zzso is a potential new drug target for the treatment of zzso disease but has not been well zzso This study reports the zzso properties of various zzso zzso and the crystal structures of the zzso zzso zzso domain and its complex with an zzso zzso of zzso during the course of evolution led to zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso is active in all other zzso The zzso zzso domain zzso both zzso and zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of 31 zzso for zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of 17 zzso for zzso thus confirming its dual zzso The crystal structures show that the zzso zzso wraps around the zzso zzso domain and may thus regulate its zzso activity via direct interactions with the active site zzso A zzso selective inhibitor that has an zzso of 230 zzso for zzso binds to zzso in an orientation opposite to that of zzso This zzso together with the screen of the zzso potency of human zzso zzso against zzso implies that the scaffold of some human zzso zzso might be used as the starting model for design of zzso zzso zzso The structural study also identified a unique zzso pocket that neighbors the active site and may thus be valuable for the design of zzso zzso
