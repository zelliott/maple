zzso degradation, a hallmark of zzso arthritis, is attributed to zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso lining cells, zzso and zzso A large proportion of zzso fluid zzso contains the zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso We report that zzso of zzso zzso contain an zzso activity zzso cartilage zzso zzso zzso release zzso zzso zzso degrading zzso that zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is stored in dense zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not free zzso zzso acid, or type II zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso protein with zzso properties identical to zzso B, zzso as it zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso that binds to a zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso and has zzso sequence identity with human zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso gel zzso technique to assess zzso of the rat zzso zzso the zzso efficiency of zzso B for the zzso of zzso zzso efficiency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso faster than the zzso efficiency reported for human zzso at pH zzso zzso efficiency zzso zzso zzso and zzso faster than zzso zzso Based on these zzso we propose that zzso B, zzso from zzso zzso within the zzso joint, may contribute to cartilage loss by degrading resident zzso
