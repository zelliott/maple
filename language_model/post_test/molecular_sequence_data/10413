zzso proteins contribute to the regulation and activity of zzso and zzso the zzso activity of the zzso zzso expression of zzso proteins has been linked to certain pathological conditions such as zzso We have isolated and characterized a zzso for the zzso protein zzso zzso from a marine zzso the zzso clam zzso zzso and we have examined its pattern of zzso expression in the zzso and zzso The zzso zzso contains a 450 zzso zzso open reading frame zzso flanked by 89 zzso and 26 zzso of zzso and 3' untranslated regions, zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso recognize a single transcript of approximately 550 zzso in four different zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence from the zzso exhibits zzso identity with human and rat zzso Southern analysis of zzso DNA suggests that zzso zzso may have multiple copies of zzso a feature that is more similar to zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso was elevated throughout zzso until after zzso when a decrease in zzso message was zzso A comparison of zzso zzso levels in zzso animals revealed a trend of elevated expression in zzso and zzso affected by a zzso zzso indicating that zzso may be a useful molecular marker for the pathological zzso
