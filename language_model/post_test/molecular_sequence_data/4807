The zzso fat zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that regulates a cell communication zzso essential very early in eye development, prior to facet zzso to limit the number of zzso cells in each facet of the compound eye to zzso The Fat zzso protein zzso the production of a signal in cells outside the developing zzso that zzso neural development of particular facet precursor zzso Novel zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso genes are described zzso that interact genetically with fat zzso zzso Analysis of these genetic interactions reveals that Fat zzso has an additional function later in eye development involving zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the results suggest that zzso cells outside the facet continue to influence facet assembly later in eye zzso
