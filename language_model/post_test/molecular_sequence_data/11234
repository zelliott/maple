The DNA sequences of four zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined in zzso salmon zzso zzso from an interior zzso zzso and a coastal zzso zzso population in the Fraser River drainage of British zzso zzso class I zzso zzso and A3 sequences and a class II B1 sequence were obtained by zzso from each of zzso salmon from each zzso The class I A1 and a pair of linked zzso zzso were derived from two different classical zzso class I zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso variation for zzso A1 and zzso was characterized by the high levels of zzso substitution indicative of the effects of natural selection on zzso zzso that contain zzso binding zzso The number of zzso detected at each of the four zzso ranged from three zzso to 22 zzso but levels of zzso sequence divergence at all four zzso were low relative to classical zzso zzso zzso The zzso similarity among zzso ranged between 89 and zzso over all zzso and all four zzso possessed only two major sequence zzso zzso zzso at zzso A1 and A3 confirmed the genetic distinctiveness of the Harrison and zzso zzso salmon populations revealed in previous zzso The two major zzso motifs of B1 and A1 zzso strongly between the zzso In spite of evidence that zzso diversity at these zzso salmon zzso zzso has been generated by selection, the level and distribution of diversity in the two salmon populations strongly reflected the demographic history of the species, which has been characterized by repeated bottlenecks and zzso in glacial zzso
