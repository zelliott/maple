The model zzso zzso zzso contains at least six zzso zzso five of which zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are members of a zzso family, whereas a single gene zzso has closer zzso in zzso zzso analysis has revealed that the proteins zzso by these two plant gene families are more similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso and to two proteins zzso by newly described zzso genes zzso and 6) than they are to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Northern analyses and analyses of the zzso of expressed sequence tags zzso in different zzso libraries suggest that in roots, leaves, and flowers, the more highly expressed genes are zzso zzso and zzso zzso In roots, at least four of the zzso genes are induced zzso within 3 to 6 h by a stress response that seems to be zzso independent because it occurs after treatment with an zzso synthesis inhibitor and also in the zzso zzso zzso This response also occurs in roots of the following symbiotic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso No evidence was obtained for a zzso zzso and specific induction of the zzso genes in roots in response to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, our data suggest that the zzso zzso which in several zzso have been implicated to play a role in the zzso zzso (with some members being described as early zzso zzso are not regulated zzso by zzso in zzso zzso
