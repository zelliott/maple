In this report, we describe a newly developed method for zzso outer zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The purity of the outer membrane fraction was verified by zzso analysis using zzso against zzso marker zzso We investigated the protein composition of the outer membrane using two-dimensional gel zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso followed by database zzso zzso proteins were identified corresponding to 29 different gene zzso All of the identified proteins have a putative zzso signal zzso About zzso of the proteins identified represent hypothetical proteins with unknown zzso Among the proteins identified are a zzso zzso a protein that was initially found in the outer envelope of zzso in zzso as well as zzso putative zzso and a zzso zzso Other proteins identified include ABC zzso and zzso which has a suggested function in zzso zzso A number of zzso such as zzso were also found in the outer membrane of zzso zzso zzso zzso
