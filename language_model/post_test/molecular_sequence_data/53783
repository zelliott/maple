Using a combination of zzso chain reaction zzso procedures, we have cloned and zzso the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso The putative protein corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso was predicted to comprise 350 zzso acids which, when zzso between zzso acid zzso 236 and zzso would yield a mature zzso of approximately zzso 12 500 with a predicted zzso of zzso Two zzso transcripts for zzso zzso were zzso these differed by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were expressed only in rat liver and lung tissue as assessed by Northern zzso and zzso zzso Relatively higher levels of both transcripts were found in the liver, whereas the lung contained lower levels that were zzso by zzso zzso In zzso zzso data showed that, within the liver, zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso In zzso treatment with zzso as a means of zzso the immune system and the zzso zzso response resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, compared with zzso control zzso This increased expression was accompanied by a preferential increase in the amount of the long zzso zzso transcript over the shorter zzso These findings suggested that the two zzso zzso zzso transcripts may be products of alternative zzso events or use alternative zzso sites which are zzso regulated during zzso These data provide evidence of a role for zzso zzso in liver function and inflammation in the zzso
