Respiratory zzso virus strains zzso zzso isolated from around the world during the period zzso were zzso to determine their zzso Analysis was by restriction mapping and zzso sequencing following amplification of selected regions of the virus zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso viruses of zzso A isolated from cities in temperate regions of the Northern and Southern zzso and the zzso during the period zzso fell into distinct groupings closely related to four of the six lineages defined in analysis of zzso zzso within the same city zzso zzso during the same zzso These observations confirm that multiple lineages of zzso virus zzso locally, and show that very similar viruses are present simultaneously in widely separated zzso
