The genetic properties of the zzso element, zzso suggest that it is a prion zzso zzso form of zzso a zzso of nitrogen regulation in zzso zzso Into a zzso strain zzso lacking zzso we introduced a zzso zzso zzso This induced the frequent zzso zzso of zzso with properties identical to the original zzso zzso the zzso frame only in the zzso domain of zzso shows that it is zzso protein (and not zzso zzso that zzso appearance of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is unique to zzso strains and is not seen in nitrogen regulation of normal zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso in the absence of the zzso part of the zzso In contrast, the zzso part of zzso cannot be converted to the prion zzso form without the zzso domain zzso zzso These experiments support the prion model for zzso and extend our understanding of its zzso
