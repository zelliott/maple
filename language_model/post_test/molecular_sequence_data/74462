zzso zzso in the zzso zzso a member of the zzso family, cause both familial and sporadic Parkinson zzso zzso genes had so far been detected only in zzso zzso In zzso including humans, two zzso genes zzso and zzso exist, while in zzso a single zzso gene has been zzso In this study, I combine structural and zzso analyses to show that the zzso zzso zzso has four zzso zzso One of them is a bona fide zzso of the human zzso zzso demonstrating that this gene has an ancient zzso Two others are, respectively, zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The fourth gene is probably zzso This precise characterization of the early evolution of zzso genes in animals has important zzso because it indicates that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are studied to gain an understanding of zzso function, are not true zzso of the human Parkinson disease zzso Novel functional insights are also gained by comparison of the structures of zzso genes in zzso related zzso
