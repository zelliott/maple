Many bulbous plants need a zzso treatment for zzso zzso for example, affects the zzso of the zzso thereby influencing the quality of the cut zzso How the zzso of the stalk is promoted by cold and which zzso and zzso mechanisms are involved have remained zzso As zzso has been shown to be involved in the zzso zzso of the flower stalks of tulips zzso et zzso 1994, Plant zzso zzso zzso we further characterized this zzso by cloning the zzso and zzso its expression in various zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the role of zzso zzso was zzso Since zzso pressure is an important force driving cell zzso the role of a zzso protein zzso was studied in relation to these two zzso The zzso level of the zzso found was substantially zzso as a result of cold zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence of this zzso revealed the presence of a zzso targeting zzso Two different forms of zzso zzso were found, the expression of one of them appeared to be restricted to the vascular tissue while the other form was present in the surrounding zzso Both zzso zzso were present in the stalk during the entire period of bulb storage and after zzso but their activities declined during stalk zzso The expression of the zzso gene was restricted mainly to the vascular tissue and its expression profile was identical to that of zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso possibly leads to an increase in zzso potential and zzso water zzso thus providing a driving force for stretching the stalk zzso
