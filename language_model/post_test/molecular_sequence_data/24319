An zzso against a transition state analog zzso may share some common features with an zzso that produces such a transition zzso zzso zzso binds specifically to zzso a zzso of zzso in the zzso reaction, but has no zzso zzso To understand how the zzso recognizes zzso and to find out if it is possible to convert it to a zzso zzso we made and zzso the zzso zzso and constructed a 3-D model of zzso The zzso contains a unique sequence with zzso at zzso The 3-D model showed that zzso is exposed inside the zzso zzso After affinity zzso 4 types zzso In type I, the zzso group of zzso is located near the zzso and neighboring positively charged zzso The change of zzso to zzso by zzso zzso decreased the binding activity, while a change to zzso did zzso These and other zzso experiments, and further modeling of zzso zzso support the 3-D model and zzso type zzso A comparison with zzso indicates that zzso zzso appears to have some groups of zzso that are zzso at the active site of the zzso The possibility of zzso zzso being converted to a zzso zzso is zzso
