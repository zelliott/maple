The eye zzso zzso sepia zzso is defective in zzso zzso or zzso zzso involved in the conversion of zzso zzso also known as zzso into zzso a key intermediate in zzso zzso However, the identity of the gene zzso this zzso as well as its molecular properties, have not yet been zzso Here, we identify and characterize the gene zzso zzso zzso and show that it is the structural gene for zzso Based on previously reported information zzso zzso and Brown (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Brown (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Andres zzso zzso zzso zzso 19, 45; zzso zzso Howard and zzso zzso zzso 111, zzso Howard, zzso and zzso (1988) Genes zzso 2, zzso we isolated five candidate genes predicted to zzso zzso zzso zzso from the presumed sepia locus zzso zzso on zzso zzso All cloned and expressed candidates exhibited relatively high zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities and low activity towards zzso characteristic of zzso class zzso whereas only zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso in zzso The molecular mass of zzso zzso was estimated to be 28 zzso by zzso and 56 zzso by gel zzso indicating that it is a zzso under native zzso zzso of the zzso region spanning zzso revealed that the zzso zzso has a zzso zzso from zzso to zzso at zzso zzso and that this generates a premature stop zzso zzso of the zzso open reading frame in an zzso background rescued the eye zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso The extent of rescue was dependent on the dosage of transgenic zzso In conclusion, we have discovered a new zzso activity for an zzso class zzso and that zzso is the structural gene for sepia which encodes zzso zzso
