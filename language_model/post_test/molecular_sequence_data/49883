The zzso gene is located immediately upstream of, and zzso transcribed from, the replication initiation zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and related genes have been found in association with a range of zzso distinct replication genes on plasmids from various zzso zzso zzso has been shown previously to extend the zzso stability of a zzso zzso Here we describe an investigation into the basis of zzso zzso zzso was not found to influence zzso of zzso zzso indicating that it is not directly involved in zzso zzso This was confirmed by demonstrating that zzso is able to enhance the zzso stability of zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that it encodes a zzso maintenance zzso Evidence inconsistent with zzso killing and zzso resolution mechanisms was zzso however, the zzso region upstream of zzso was found to mediate zzso zzso as would be expected if it encodes a zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings zzso active zzso as the probable basis of the activity of zzso which is therefore zzso zzso Since it is unrelated to any gene known to play a role in zzso zzso it seems likely that zzso par potentially represents the zzso of a novel class of active zzso systems that are distinguished by their capacity to enhance zzso zzso stability via a single zzso zzso
