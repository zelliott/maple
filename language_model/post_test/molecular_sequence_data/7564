The mechanism by which zzso zzso cells, the likely zzso cells of zzso zzso recognize and zzso zzso zzso is zzso Because incubation of zzso fibers with serum increases their association with cells, we asked whether a protein coat on zzso increased zzso of fibers via specific cellular zzso zzso zzso with zzso but not with zzso or other zzso increased fiber zzso by rabbit zzso zzso cells, as measured by a new technique using zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 5, were identified on zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors by zzso cells on a zzso zzso or zzso cells with excess soluble zzso reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso of alpha v beta 5, but not alpha v beta 3, with blocking zzso similarly reduced zzso In addition, alpha v beta 5, but not alpha v beta 3, showed zzso zzso with zzso Of zzso zzso coating zzso with serum also increased zzso via alpha v beta 5, an effect dependent on the zzso in zzso We conclude that zzso zzso cells recognize and zzso zzso and zzso zzso via the zzso alpha v beta zzso Since zzso initiate some of the same signaling pathways as does zzso our findings may provide insights into the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso
