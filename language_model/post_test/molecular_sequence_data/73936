We found that zzso zzso human zzso zzso binds zzso zzso zzso human zzso alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surface zzso zzso and urinary zzso immobilized on plates or immobilized on zzso zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and these zzso was zzso since it was inhibited in the presence of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso or synthetic zzso zzso zzso at about 1 zzso On the other hand, a wide variety of compounds including zzso sugar chains derived from these zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not show any zzso effect at zzso up to 1 zzso These results indicate that zzso interacts with these zzso via the zzso zzso zzso of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso of polarized zzso canine kidney cells on zzso filter zzso were incubated with zzso in either the zzso or zzso chamber, zzso was found to bind specifically to the zzso zzso with a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the specific interaction was inhibited by 1 zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso zzso zzso exists only in the zzso zzso on plasma zzso it was evident that zzso can directly interact with the zzso zzso zzso component of the intact zzso of zzso anchors on plasma zzso
