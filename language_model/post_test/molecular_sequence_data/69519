In zzso zzso millions of zzso are zzso during the sexual phase of the life zzso Since these newly zzso zzso are longer than normal zzso zzso they must be trimmed to the mature zzso We have examined the timing and mechanism of this trimming zzso We have shown that a sudden decrease in zzso length takes place at a specific time during zzso zzso The decrease in zzso length is not caused by incomplete replication of the most terminal DNA zzso rather it is the result of an active processing event that occurs independently of DNA zzso The zzso regulated zzso zzso that takes place in zzso is reminiscent of the sudden reductions in zzso length which have been observed in other zzso
