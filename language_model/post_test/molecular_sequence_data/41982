The zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso belongs to a zzso zzso zzso We analyzed the structure and expression of a zzso region located immediately downstream from zzso This region is unique and contains two large open reading frames transcribed into stable zzso These putative zzso termed zzso and zzso can respectively zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso zzso between the zzso sites and the next 3' zzso zzso sites are very zzso 148 zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso from each of the two zzso zzso can be zzso indicating that both zzso are zzso These transcripts are zzso spliced due to a single base difference which destroys in one zzso the AG zzso site present in the zzso In the zzso zzso an alternative downstream zzso zzso site is zzso Despite its sequence conservation in both zzso this zzso site is only used in the zzso lacking the upstream AG zzso zzso The major population of zzso transcripts exhibit a long zzso extension and no zzso tail, but a minor population shows a smaller zzso region due alternative zzso closer to the initiation zzso of the zzso The zzso amounts of transcripts from individual genes in this region are zzso zzso
