zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso are formed from membrane zzso in animal zzso The zzso is initiated by zzso of zzso to form zzso zzso Despite the zzso importance of this reaction, the zzso responsible, zzso remains zzso zzso We recently demonstrated that all five members of the zzso zzso tumor family are zzso zzso with zzso activity and are renamed zzso as zzso zzso zzso However, it was poorly understood whether these proteins were involved in the formation of zzso in living zzso In the present studies, we first show that zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso cells zzso expressing zzso generated significant amounts of zzso and zzso when cells were metabolically labeled with zzso Second, as analyzed by liquid zzso mass zzso the stable expression of zzso in cells remarkably increased zzso levels of zzso and zzso with various zzso zzso Third, when zzso zzso D was additionally expressed in zzso cells, accumulating zzso was efficiently converted to zzso We also found that zzso was partly responsible for zzso formation in zzso cells that zzso express zzso These results suggest that zzso family proteins may produce zzso serving as precursors of zzso zzso in zzso
