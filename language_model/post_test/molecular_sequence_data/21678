zzso calcium channel blocking peptides were zzso and zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequences zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects of the peptides on several types of zzso calcium channels were evaluated using a zzso zzso zzso expression zzso A zzso contained in one of the zzso peak zzso inhibited zzso type zzso calcium channels zzso The zzso acid sequence of this zzso is identical to that of zzso zzso A zzso from another discrete peak, which is identical to zzso except for one zzso zzso in the zzso inhibited zzso zzso calcium channels zzso A novel zzso named zzso zzso number, zzso shows zzso sequence zzso with the sodium channel blocker zzso 3, however, zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso calcium channels zzso In zzso secondary and zzso structure prediction revealed that zzso and sodium channel zzso such as zzso zzso 3, and zzso 2 show very similar zzso zzso distribution of zzso zzso Areas zzso surface patches likely to be involved in zzso zzso and surface zzso zzso These findings suggest that these zzso toxins evolved from common ancestors by gene zzso to maintain surface zzso appropriate for interaction with zzso zzso zzso
