zzso zzso that act on zzso are a zzso family of zzso that catalyze a natural process of zzso zzso zzso they convert zzso to zzso a zzso that is read as zzso during zzso thus when editing occurs in zzso zzso can be zzso and the changes can alter protein zzso By removing the zzso targeting zzso from human zzso zzso that acts on zzso 2 and replacing them with an zzso zzso zzso we have engineered a zzso zzso that can be directed to edit anywhere along the zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that this zzso can efficiently and selectively edit a single zzso As proof of principle in zzso we correct a premature termination zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso In zzso zzso we show that a genetically zzso version of our zzso can correct zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso restore full-length zzso and zzso functional zzso currents across the plasma zzso Finally, in a human cell line, we show that a genetically zzso version of our zzso and guide zzso can correct a zzso version of enhanced green fluorescent zzso which contains a premature termination zzso This technology should zzso powerful approaches to correcting a wide variety of genetic zzso and zzso protein function through targeted zzso zzso
