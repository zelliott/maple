The zzso of the human zzso virus zzso is known to contain eight open reading frames zzso on the minus strand of the zzso DNA zzso zzso Data presented here indicate that the DNA plus strand of zzso contains a previously unidentified zzso in a region complementary to the envelope gene zzso This zzso could zzso a protein of approximately 190 zzso acid zzso with a relative molecular mass of 20 zzso if translation began from the first initiation zzso The predicted protein is highly zzso and thus could be membrane zzso It is possible, therefore, that the zzso zzso encodes a protein on zzso zzso zzso
