A zzso clone coding for an zzso of the zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso 2A was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the clone was different at 8 positions from that of rat zzso 2A alpha determined in a previous zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the clone was, however, identical to that of human zzso 2A beta and differed only at one position from that of rabbit 2A zzso Thus, the isolated zzso was identified as a clone coding for rat zzso 2A zzso Using a 2A beta specific probe, two kinds of transcripts were detected in rat zzso a major zzso zzso zzso transcript and a minor zzso zzso zzso zzso These transcripts were both greatly increased in rat liver tumors induced by zzso zzso regardless of the zzso or zzso zzso
