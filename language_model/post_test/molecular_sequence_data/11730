Based on our earlier proposal on the role of zzso in zzso recognition and the demonstration of the similarity of the zzso forms of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have undertaken the zzso analysis of a series of the zzso zzso peptides aiming to find their zzso matching zzso zzso A zzso zzso method was used to calculate 14 zzso peptides in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complexes of peptides with high zzso were found to resemble closely zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso complexes of peptides with low zzso did zzso The results are relevant for understanding the zzso relations of zzso zzso zzso
