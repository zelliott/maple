Big zzso is a zzso zzso derived from zzso of the Japanese zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of big zzso is divided into an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain, which are responsible for zzso activities against zzso and zzso bacteria, zzso The zzso domain of big zzso forms a unique zzso zzso with two zzso and a parallel zzso while the zzso domain adopts a zzso zzso Although our previous study implied that big zzso changes its zzso structure in a zzso environment, due to the poor quality of the zzso zzso it remained to be resolved whether the zzso domain adopts any structure in the presence of zzso In this analysis, we successfully determined the structure of the zzso zzso of big zzso in a zzso solution, showing that the zzso zzso forms a single zzso zzso Moreover, zzso experiments using zzso zzso revealed that the zzso domain of big zzso zzso into the zzso with a dipping at the zzso edge of the zzso Here, we propose a model for how big zzso associates with the target zzso
