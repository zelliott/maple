zzso in the zzso gene were identified as a common cause of zzso disease of bone zzso but experimental evidence demonstrated that zzso zzso is not sufficient to induce zzso in zzso Here, we identified two zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso associated with zzso and with the severity of zzso in a large population of zzso unrelated patients that were previously screened for zzso gene zzso The largest effect was found for the zzso zzso yielding an odds ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the C zzso as the risk zzso Moreover, an even more significant zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in the zzso of patients with zzso zzso with an odds ratio of zzso Interestingly, patients with the C zzso also showed an increased prevalence of zzso disease zzso zzso and 51% in patients with zzso CT, and zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso as well as an increased number of affected skeletal sites zzso zzso and zzso in patients with zzso CT, and zzso zzso respectively, p zzso zzso These differences increased when analyses were restricted to cases with zzso zzso In human cell lines, zzso with zzso zzso and zzso produced a level of zzso of zzso signaling greater than zzso with zzso zzso and zzso confirming zzso and clinical zzso These results provide the first evidence that genetic variation within the zzso system influences the severity of zzso in synergistic action with zzso gene zzso
