zzso is a zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso which links to a zzso zzso through a zzso bond with the zzso of blue zzso This study focuses on the zzso process of the emerging zzso zzso Two zzso fluorinated zzso zzso zzso and zzso were employed zzso to their different zzso activities, these being zzso and zzso compared to natural zzso zzso Each of these zzso was found to exchange with the natural zzso in zzso at pH zzso The emerging zzso zzso were zzso at the binding zzso zzso the pH of this storage form to the zzso optimum zzso pH zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso and the spent solutions were then analyzed and zzso and zzso were detected after a zzso zzso The same analysis of the zzso zzso on the other hand, afforded zzso only but no zzso When the zzso storage zzso moved to the active site at pH zzso a change in the zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Model experiments using zzso zzso supported two zzso from each zzso The significant difference in the zzso from these two zzso is attributed to a plausible mechanism including the zzso variable zzso center emerging at the storage and then the active site on the zzso It is concluded that such dynamic zzso plays a significant role in the zzso zzso
