In zzso zzso most zzso zzso stress genes are regulated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso with a regulatory zzso site that binds zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with low levels of hydrogen zzso zzso leads to zzso of two His zzso thereby leading to zzso When bound to zzso the resulting zzso is much less sensitive to zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that the structural zzso is coordinated in a highly stable, zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso site by zzso leads to the formation of zzso zzso zzso The rate of zzso is too slow to account for induction of the zzso stress response by zzso levels of zzso but could contribute to induction under severe zzso stress zzso In zzso studies demonstrated that zzso of zzso required 10 zzso zzso a level at least 1000 times greater than that needed for zzso of zzso zzso even under these severe zzso conditions there was little if any zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was correlated with zzso of the regulatory zzso Because zzso at this site required bound zzso in zzso we suggest that treatment of cells with 10 zzso zzso released sufficient zzso into the zzso to effect a transition of zzso from the zzso form to the zzso zzso zzso zzso This model is supported by metal zzso affinity zzso demonstrating that zzso bound zzso with higher affinity than zzso
