When grown zzso in the light, zzso zzso contains appreciable quantities of zzso zzso and zzso but smaller amounts of other soluble zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso is mass cultured zzso in the dark to stationary phase, the content of zzso zzso does not change zzso whereas zzso zzso is approximately zzso more abundant, zzso zzso is at least zzso less abundant, and zzso zzso is fivefold lower than in the zzso grown zzso These observations confirm previous literature reports that in this zzso a zzso zzso (or zzso in our zzso is more abundant when cells are grown zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso is positively identified with the previously characterized minor zzso zzso component of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence results show that zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso structural family, but differs from normal zzso zzso in having a zzso sixth zzso to the zzso The levels of electron carrier proteins of low zzso potential had previously been reported to be less in zzso than in zzso cells and we have verified that observation for the specific examples of zzso zzso and zzso The oxygen binding zzso zzso zzso is not induced by zzso zzso
