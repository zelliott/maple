The zzso zzso domain of the human zzso zzso zzso has been speculated to consist of a zzso domain zzso and a zzso zzso We studied the function of the zzso zzso domain by using zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso with the sequence from zzso zzso replaced by the corresponding sequence from the zzso zzso remained fully zzso Another zzso zzso with the same region of sequence replaced by the corresponding sequence from zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso still was activated by zzso zzso zzso but its function was severely zzso zzso receptors with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain plus zzso domain retained good response to zzso whether the zzso domain was from zzso or from zzso zzso zzso with the zzso domain deleted failed to respond to zzso although it was expressed at the cell surface and capable of zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso domain plays a critical role in signal transmission from zzso to zzso zzso This domain zzso a significant degree of zzso acid substitution and may not be directly involved in the binding of zzso
