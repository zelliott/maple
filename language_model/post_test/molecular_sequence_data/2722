A zzso clone derived from zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the expression product zzso was identified using a zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso gene was cloned in zzso zzso zzso transferred to a zzso and introduced into zzso coli for analysis of the gene zzso The strain carrying the zzso produced zzso as part of a fusion protein consisting of the first zzso zzso acids of zzso coli zzso and 112 zzso acids of the zzso zzso protein of approximately 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and live zzso coli containing the zzso zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso or newly hatched broiler zzso Several zzso protocols were zzso including boosts with partially zzso zzso zzso or small numbers of live zzso zzso zzso After challenge with an experimental zzso zzso infection, the birds were evaluated by scoring zzso zzso to determine the level of zzso The greatest degree of protection was seen after only a single zzso of zzso birds with a live zzso zzso coli zzso The results presented here identify zzso as a potential candidate zzso vaccine zzso and provide evidence for the first time that newly hatched chickens can be successfully vaccinated with a zzso zzso
