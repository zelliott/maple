Many amplified zzso including some zzso are organized as large zzso zzso How such giant zzso are generated remains largely zzso Recent studies of a zzso in the zzso zzso suggest a novel mechanism that requires zzso breakage next to short zzso zzso The prevalence of short zzso repeats in zzso zzso raises the interesting possibility that this process may occur widely as a response to zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that in zzso zzso large DNA zzso are formed zzso probably by zzso zzso when a zzso break is introduced next to short zzso zzso These results suggest a general mechanism for large zzso DNA formation and reveal an important new source of zzso instability resulting from zzso breakage at selective zzso
