We have developed a second zzso zzso pair for use in zzso based on the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso Using a novel genetic selection, we have identified a series of zzso zzso that selectively charge the amber zzso zzso with the zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, and the zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso allowing them to be inserted into proteins in zzso in response to the amber nonsense zzso zzso
