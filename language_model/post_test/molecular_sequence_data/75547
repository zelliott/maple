zzso zzso zzso can be classified into two groups: those zzso to here as class I zzso which are similar to zzso zzso in that they react with zzso zzso zzso and those that are dissimilar to zzso zzso in that they lack the zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso a class II zzso zzso was zzso The sole zzso segment of this strain that bore extensive zzso with the zzso locus of zzso zzso zzso was cloned in zzso zzso The production of the zzso structural zzso zzso from this zzso segment could not be detected by zzso and coupled in zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed the presence in the zzso zzso of two zzso zzso arranged zzso genes zzso 1 and zzso zzso 1 and 2 are partial zzso genes that constitute part of a silent zzso zzso gene zzso zzso region, designated zzso Both copies are zzso corresponding to variable zzso of the zzso zzso gene but lacking zzso zzso coding zzso Located within sequences surrounding copies 1 and 2 were several classes of repeated elements that are associated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso
