It has recently been shown that zzso of the zzso acid sequences of family zzso allows the generation of improved zzso Family zzso is generally achieved by a zzso I treatment and then by zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso both zzso zzso zzso was carried out by the published zzso However, zzso hybrids were only formed at a very low frequency (less than zzso zzso we developed improved methods for family zzso by which DNA was zzso by restriction zzso instead of by zzso zzso With the first improved method, five zzso fragments and five zzso fragments that had been generated by restriction zzso zzso were subjected to the zzso reactions in two steps, the first being without a primer and the second with a set of zzso This method enabled zzso hybrid genes to be formed at a high frequency zzso zzso With the second improved method, zzso and zzso were zzso by several sets of restriction zzso and these zzso were then zzso in two zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were each zzso by two (or three) sets of restriction zzso and one type of zzso digest and one type of zzso digest were mixed, thus making four (or zzso different zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso These zzso were used as templates to carry out zzso without a zzso After the first zzso reaction, all the zzso were combined, and a second zzso reaction was carried out without a zzso Following these two zzso assembly steps, a third zzso reaction was carried out with two zzso to amplify the full-length zzso hybrid zzso This second method also yielded zzso hybrids at a frequency of zzso The degree of zzso of the products with the second method was higher than that with the first zzso These methods were used to isolate zzso zzso exhibiting relatively high stability at high temperature, one of them being respectively zzso and zzso more zzso than zzso and zzso at 50 degrees zzso
