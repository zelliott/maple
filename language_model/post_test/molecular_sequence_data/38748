zzso zzso acids are zzso acids which can be translated from the corresponding zzso of a sense zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso by the zzso DNA strand have a tendency to interact with each zzso We have demonstrated that zzso zzso sequences are present zzso and these may contribute to the folding and maintenance of the zzso structure of a zzso zzso is a synthetic zzso with an zzso acid sequence in the zzso of zzso and has been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso We searched for zzso zzso sequences which are zzso to portions of zzso A synthetic zzso zzso consisting of zzso acids 84 to 97 of zzso which contains an zzso zzso sequence zzso to zzso was shown to inhibit zzso infection of zzso zzso zzso of these zzso peptides could be involved in sustaining zzso zzso The zzso site, which exists in the C1 domain of zzso is highly zzso among strains of zzso especially at zzso and in the zzso acids zzso the C zzso Although the zzso sites of 18 out of 30 zzso strains were zzso to the zzso region, those of the remaining 12 zzso including zzso were zzso However, zzso inhibited infection by zzso which has no zzso zzso in zzso corresponding to zzso although the zzso effect was zzso zzso may thus also interfere with the zzso interaction with zzso which has an zzso sequence to zzso
