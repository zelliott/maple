zzso genes of rabbit B cells are diversified by a zzso gene zzso mechanism in which zzso gene segments zzso of the zzso gene serve as zzso To assess whether zzso zzso also contributes to zzso diversification in the zzso we searched for zzso 3' of zzso genes because zzso in this region presumably result from zzso zzso rather than gene zzso We zzso and cloned the region extending zzso zzso 3' of zzso genes from zzso DNA of young and adult zzso zzso of zzso sequence analysis of the clones revealed a high zzso frequency zzso within the first 120 zzso downstream of zzso zzso This frequency decreased rapidly with increasing distance 3' of the zzso zzso The zzso demonstrated both strand bias and zzso preferences characteristic of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso diversity in rabbit is generated not only by zzso gene conversion but also by zzso zzso
