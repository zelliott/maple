zzso zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso zzso from zzso and molecular zzso In plants this zzso activity is involved in two distinct zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso We report here the molecular and zzso characterization of an zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso protein in zzso zzso We isolated a zzso zzso with one large open reading frame of zzso zzso Southern analysis strongly suggested that this zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso We investigated the zzso characteristics of this zzso by zzso the zzso protein in zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso was examined by zzso its complete coding sequence in transgenic tobacco zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso We performed western analyses for the zzso of protein extracts from zzso zzso and total leaf extracts and for the zzso on tissue zzso These analyses clearly revealed that zzso was confined to the zzso zzso not targeted to the zzso Western analyses confirmed the presence of a zzso form of zzso in cultured green zzso zzso
