Many species of zzso display an zzso zzso zzso zzso controlled by a single highly zzso zzso complex termed the zzso This comprises tightly linked zzso and zzso genes that determine the specificity of the zzso zzso We investigated zzso of zzso zzso a wild species found in small, isolated populations on the Balkan peninsula, initially by zzso experiments and identifying zzso zzso zzso Nine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso their sequence analysis showed a very high ratio of zzso to synonymous zzso zzso zzso and revealed that zzso zzso of zzso zzso unlike those of zzso zzso show positive selection in all regions except the zzso regions and that between C2 and zzso zzso zzso was found to be identical to zzso from zzso zzso a species that does not zzso with zzso zzso and, except for just one zzso acid, to zzso of zzso zzso However, the corresponding zzso and zzso zzso regions showed considerable zzso Moreover, protein sequences of the zzso zzso zzso were not zzso zzso 12 zzso replacements between those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of this finding for hypotheses about the evolution of new zzso are zzso
