The mechanism for hormonal regulation of rat zzso zzso gene zzso in rat zzso zzso cells has been zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that the minimal zzso promoter that zzso zzso expression also zzso responsiveness to zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso increase in promoter activity, and the induction is detected almost immediately after the addition of the zzso zzso also stimulates zzso promoter activity, but the effect of this hormone is weaker and slower than that of zzso The effect of zzso in increasing zzso promoter activity is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso C zzso is also involved in the regulation of the zzso promoter activity, since a calcium zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit it zzso These data indicate that the region of the zzso promoter used here contains the DNA signals necessary for its hormonal zzso zzso binding studies show that the zzso nuclear protein zzso which binds to the zzso promoter, is induced by zzso and zzso and this effect is clearly zzso as early as 5 h post zzso Moreover, the DNA binding activity of zzso is inhibited by both zzso and zzso zzso promoter zzso containing four, eight, or 12 tandem repeats of an zzso that includes the zzso binding site increase their activity in response to zzso zzso and insulin, while the the presence of zzso or zzso zzso their zzso These data indicate that the zzso protein plays an important role in the hormonal control of zzso zzso
