The AIDS epidemic in zzso India, zzso unique features, having zzso of B and C zzso zzso along with zzso zzso zzso has the highest zzso of zzso infection compared to the other states of India, but limited information is available regarding the full-length sequence of zzso zzso 

To characterize the near full-length zzso of a novel zzso zzso strain from an injecting drug user of zzso 

zzso zzso extracted from the plasma of a male injecting drug user aged 35, was diagnosed with zzso zzso Near full-length zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction using primer walking zzso zzso relationships were determined with zzso zzso The zzso break points were detected using boot scan and zzso zzso 

This zzso predominantly had zzso C zzso and exhibited mosaic structures with zzso B insertions at three different positions of zzso zzso zzso analysis of near full-length zzso sequence from the zzso zzso strain, zzso exhibited similarity with the sequence of zzso in its zzso C zzso while the zzso B insertions showed resemblance with the sequence of zzso 

This study confirms the presence of a unique zzso zzso strain, emerging as a result of zzso between zzso strains from India and zzso
