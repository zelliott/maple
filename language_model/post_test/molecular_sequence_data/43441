zzso by zzso proteins on the cell surface regulates the adhesive interactions between cells and their zzso The structure of the zzso domain that is found in some but not all zzso has been zzso However, the only zzso zzso for which structures are known, namely zzso and zzso are recognized by zzso that lack I zzso The zzso zzso molecules zzso 2 and 3 are, like zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso but they are recognized by an I zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso or zzso Here we present the crystal structure of the zzso region of zzso The zzso acid zzso at position 37 is critical for zzso binding and is proposed to coordinate the zzso zzso in the I zzso this zzso 37 is surrounded by a relatively flat recognition surface and lies in a zzso whereas the critical zzso acid zzso in zzso and zzso lie in protruding zzso This finding suggests that there are differences in the architecture of recognition sites between zzso that contain or lack I zzso A bend between zzso 1 and 2 of zzso and a zzso arrangement of zzso zzso in the zzso region of domain 2 may be important for presenting the recognition surface to zzso A model of zzso based on the zzso structure provides a framework for understanding its recognition by zzso
