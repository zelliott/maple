An zzso resistance zzso zzso from the zzso producer zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso and shown to zzso zzso zzso B resistance when transferred to zzso zzso zzso zzso From mapping studies with zzso zzso to locate the site of zzso zzso the zzso message contains a zzso zzso leader sequence upstream from the zzso major open reading frame that encodes the resistance zzso On the basis of the potential secondary structure that the zzso leader can assume, a zzso zzso model similar to that for zzso is zzso The model is supported by zzso analysis involving deletions in the proposed zzso By analysis with restriction zzso zzso is indistinguishable from the zzso gene described by Birmingham et zzso zzso zzso Birmingham, zzso zzso Cox, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Fishman, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which comprises one of at least three genes from zzso zzso that can zzso zzso resistance when zzso into zzso zzso When tested for zzso zzso appears to be strongly induced by zzso but not by zzso
