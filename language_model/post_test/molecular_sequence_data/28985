Low zzso zzso zzso zzso channels are expressed in zzso male germ cells and are believed to be pivotal in induction of the zzso reaction in mouse zzso However, in humans, very little is known about expression of zzso zzso channels in male germ cells or their zzso We have used reverse zzso chain reaction, in zzso zzso and patch clamp recording to investigate the expression of low zzso activated zzso zzso channels in human male germ zzso We report that full-length transcripts for both zzso and zzso low zzso activated channel zzso are expressed in human zzso Multiple zzso of zzso are present in the zzso and at least two zzso of zzso including a zzso zzso not previously described in the zzso zzso for all the zzso of both zzso and zzso were detected by reverse zzso chain reaction on zzso isolated from human zzso zzso In zzso zzso for zzso and zzso localized transcripts both in germ cells and in other cell types in the zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso was detected primarily in germ zzso Using the whole cell patch clamp technique, we detected zzso zzso zzso channel currents in isolated human male germ cells, although the current zzso and frequency of occurrence were low in comparison to the occurrence of zzso in zzso male germ zzso We conclude that low zzso activated zzso zzso channels are expressed in cells of the human male germ zzso
