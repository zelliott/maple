The organization of the human zzso zzso outgrowth promoting factor zzso gene is zzso Based on Southern analysis and the isolation of zzso DNA clones from a zzso zzso library, the minimum size of the gene is 42 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso are contained in five zzso which account for the 1650 zzso zzso size observed by northern zzso From the structure of the gene it is predicted that a zzso human zzso zzso with a three zzso deletion is a result of alternative zzso at the zzso site of zzso zzso Evidence is presented that indicates the existence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in bovine brain which has a corresponding zzso acid zzso This alternate form comprises approximately zzso of the total zzso protein present in bovine zzso
