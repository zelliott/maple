zzso factor 5 zzso is a zzso growth factor that plays a key regulatory role in embryonic skeletal and joint zzso zzso in the zzso gene can cause different types of skeletal zzso including zzso type C zzso and zzso zzso zzso We report two novel zzso in the zzso gene in Chinese families with distinct limb zzso In one family affected with zzso we identified a novel nonsense zzso zzso zzso G zzso which is predicted to zzso the zzso precursor protein by deleting 15 zzso acids at its zzso In one family with zzso we found a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso G zzso which changes a highly zzso zzso acid in the zzso of zzso We zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso to express human zzso or zzso zzso zzso The mature zzso protein was zzso as in the zzso in zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, but not in the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso cells, indicating that the two zzso led to different fates of the zzso zzso zzso thereby producing distinct limb zzso
