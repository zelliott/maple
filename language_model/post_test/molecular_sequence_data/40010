Competition binding zzso for zzso to G zzso receptors zzso display high and low binding zzso zzso of zzso at position 324 in zzso 6 of the zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso generated zzso receptors that had zzso single zzso binding sites for zzso and reduced zzso of full or partial zzso in stimulating zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso intrinsic activities of full and partial zzso in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso were correlated with their binding affinities to the zzso zzso In zzso such as zzso zzso and recycling, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso behaved zzso However, in zzso resonance energy transfer zzso that determined the proximity between the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso to zzso there were significant zzso The conceptual framework of the zzso complex model could not adequately account for the behavior of the zzso zzso except under assumptions of low zzso protein binding zzso The single zzso binding site of the zzso zzso to zzso was converted by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso which acts a zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso Based upon the three-dimensional architecture of the human zzso the distance between zzso and the zzso motif in zzso 3 was the shortest among the various zzso acids in zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso lies in a groove between zzso 3 and 6, and its zzso generates a zzso zzso with very low binding affinity for the zzso zzso of zzso
