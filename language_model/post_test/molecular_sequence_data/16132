zzso begins coincidentally with the expression of several zzso gene products during the transition state of a culture from exponential to stationary zzso zzso in the stage 0 zzso genes prevent the expression of these gene products in addition to blocking zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in a zzso background, restore zzso gene expression but not zzso The nature of the zzso gene product was investigated by zzso and sequencing the zzso zzso The zzso gene coded for a zzso protein zzso weight zzso and contained a zzso structure common to DNA binding zzso Analysis of expression of the zzso gene using zzso zzso zzso and direct measurement of zzso content by zzso showed that the zzso gene zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso extension analysis of zzso gene zzso revealed two initiation zzso The downstream site was dramatically zzso in zzso zzso while the upstream site appeared not to be regulated by zzso Five zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso One zzso zzso resided within the structural gene and continued to zzso zzso zzso zzso from both zzso A promoter zzso zzso reduced zzso from the downstream promoter but not the upstream zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso zzso results from zzso of the zzso gene product or by prevention of its zzso The results suggest that the zzso gene codes for a regulator which controls several genes whose products are normally produced during the transition phase between active growth and zzso The level of this regulator is, in turn, controlled by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso result from uncontrolled zzso of the zzso zzso
