zzso weight zzso zzso have become a tool of choice for the identification of zzso factor binding sites in DNA zzso zzso proteins often show zzso in their binding requirement and thus the overall binding specificity of many proteins is unknown and remains an active area of zzso Although existing zzso are more reliable zzso than consensus string matching, they generally result in a high number of false positive zzso Our previous study introduced a promising approach to zzso refinement in which known motifs are used to zzso mine putative binding sites directly from aligned promoter regions using composition of similar zzso In the present study, we extended this technique originally tested on single examples of zzso factors zzso and showed its capability to zzso zzso performance to predict new binding sites in the fruit fly zzso We propose refined zzso in zzso and zzso versions similarly zzso for a large variety of zzso factors of zzso zzso Along with the addition of many auxiliary sites the zzso includes variation of the zzso motif zzso the binding sites location on the promoters and the zzso score zzso To assess the zzso performance of the refined zzso we compared them to conventional zzso and zzso zzso The results have been verified using performed tests and literature zzso Overall, the refined zzso containing putative sites derived from real promoter content processed using zzso parameters had better general accuracy than conventional zzso
