The natural zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strong zzso resistance against small zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso species when introduced into zzso zzso zzso zzso It had very limited effect on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso resistance mechanism zzso on zzso is a zzso zzso infection system zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the Abi genetic zzso was localized on a zzso zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso allowed the identification of two large open reading zzso zzso zzso showed that only zzso was needed to produce the Abi zzso zzso zzso zzso coded for a predicted protein of zzso zzso acids zzso with an estimated molecular size of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso DNA and protein sequence alignment programs found no significant zzso with zzso However, a database query based on zzso acid composition suggested that zzso might be in the same protein family as zzso No zzso DNA replication nor zzso structural protein production was detected in infected zzso zzso zzso zzso This system is believed to act at or prior to zzso DNA zzso zzso cloned into a zzso zzso zzso efficiency increased zzso zzso provides another powerful tool that can be useful in controlling zzso during zzso zzso
