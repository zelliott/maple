The identification of fastidious zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso has remained a challenge leading to clinically significant zzso This study is intended to examine the feasibility of partial zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing for the identification of zzso zzso and zzso and defined potential reference sequences for species from each of these zzso 

The zzso zzso gene sequence based identification zzso for species identification was used and enhanced by aligning test sequences with reference sequences from the List of zzso Names with Standing in zzso 

Conventional zzso based zzso zzso gene sequencing and the alignment of the isolate zzso zzso gene sequence with reference sequences accurately identified zzso of clinical strains of zzso zzso While partial zzso zzso gene sequences of reference type strains matched with the zzso zzso gene sequences of 19 zzso in our data set, another 13 strains demonstrated a degree of zzso with a zzso zzso difference in the regions of zzso 

zzso 606 zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing, coupled with the assignment of well defined reference sequences to clinically relevant species of bacteria, can be a useful strategy for improving the identification of clinically relevant zzso zzso
