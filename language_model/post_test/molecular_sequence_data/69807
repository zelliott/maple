zzso zzso a highly potent and selective zzso zzso isolated from zzso skin, was studied in zzso solution by two-dimensional zzso zzso including the determination of zzso temperature zzso the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso from zzso correlated zzso zzso and the volumes of nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso The two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso spectrum of zzso revealed zzso zzso and long-range zzso To put this information on a quantitative basis, special attention was devoted to J zzso suppression, zzso of the zzso volumes and analysis of the zzso zzso of the zzso against diagonal zzso and H beta zzso zzso zzso Although most of the zzso angles deduced from the zzso alpha zzso zzso together with several Ni alpha i and alpha zzso zzso pointed to a partially extended zzso zzso several zzso zzso and beta zzso interactions argued in favor of a folded zzso Moreover, several long-range correlations of strong zzso were found that supported a close spatial proximity between the side chains of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso in the side chain is deduced from the zzso alpha beta zzso zzso and alpha beta and N beta zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso dependency was not indicative of stable hydrogen bonds, the zzso values of the temperature zzso may reflect an equilibrium mixture of folded and extended zzso The overall data should provide realistic starting models for energy zzso and zzso zzso
