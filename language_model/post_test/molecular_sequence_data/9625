zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes has been correlated with increased zzso zzso a zzso zzso structure, and exclusion of zzso factor binding in the zzso zzso regions of affected zzso Given the lack of understanding of what constitutes a closed zzso structure in zzso islands, however, it has been difficult to assess the relationship among zzso zzso zzso structure, and inappropriate gene zzso In this study, zzso accessibility analysis was used to more clearly define the zzso structure in the zzso island of the human zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso structure was then related to in zzso zzso interactions and zzso zzso status of the zzso zzso island in human zzso cells varying in zzso zzso The results of these studies indicated that the zzso zzso structure associated with the zzso zzso island in zzso cells consisted of an approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region of DNA, whose formation was associated with at least four zzso precisely positioned zzso zzso In zzso cells, this precise zzso array was lost and was replaced by randomly positioned zzso zzso the closed zzso zzso regardless of whether zzso of the zzso island was spread over the entire island or limited to regions outside the zzso factor binding zzso These results suggest that zzso islands facilitate the expression of zzso genes by zzso zzso positioning and that the conditions that alter the formation of this array (such as perhaps zzso may indirectly affect zzso zzso gene zzso
