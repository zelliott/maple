In response to iron zzso zzso zzso produces zzso as a major zzso Application of the zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso DNA library followed by further cloning of the surrounding regions led to the identification of two zzso zzso zzso One contains three genes zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso and the other, five genes zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso Construction of the zzso zzso polar zzso in the respective zzso allowed us to confirm their zzso The genetic arrangement of the zzso iron acquisition system in zzso zzso is unique in that the zzso zzso zzso zzso ) is zzso to the zzso zzso ) zzso components of an zzso cassette transport system for zzso zzso This is the first report demonstrating that zzso transport and zzso genes are present in a species outside the family zzso
