A point zzso in zzso that converts zzso zzso at position 145 into a stop zzso leading to a truncated prion zzso as found in an inherited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome, suggests that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso acids zzso likely plays a critical role in prion zzso as well as in zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso represents an unstable part of the prion protein that is prone to spontaneous zzso zzso protein zzso zzso amplification zzso we show that the zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso of sheep and deer zzso can be in zzso converted to zzso zzso zzso in presence or absence of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso protein full-length zzso zzso did not show a propensity for spontaneous zzso conversion to zzso resistant zzso Further, we show that seeded or spontaneously zzso zzso molecules can efficiently convert zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso resistant zzso These results establish that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso plays a role in seeding and zzso of zzso zzso
