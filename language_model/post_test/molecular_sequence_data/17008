Human zzso zzso is a potent cardiovascular zzso zzso Its activity is based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 in zzso Recently, we reported an zzso solution structure of zzso which has a zzso zzso core around zzso zzso This zzso zzso does not agree with a previously reported X-ray crystal zzso To clarify the zzso we performed zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso The zzso results revealed that the zzso 13 aromatic ring is concealed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed this is an zzso interaction in zzso form, which is also supported by zzso analysis and two-dimensional zzso zzso line zzso Thus, we confirmed the zzso zzso core around zzso 13 in zzso solution, which agrees with the solution zzso The zzso zzso zzso between the solution and crystal was caused by the zzso hydrogen bond between zzso 13 of one zzso and zzso 8 of the other in a zzso formation of zzso zzso On the other hand, we indicated that zzso another zzso of the zzso has an apparent zzso equilibrium under the same condition in which three zzso zzso
