zzso zzso zzso define a zzso of cell wall zzso zzso and zzso in genes zzso and zzso appear to interact early in such a zzso We have cloned zzso and the sequence predicts the product to be a large, zzso zzso zzso which contains the zzso zzso zzso retention zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulted in cells with zzso zzso and extremely compromised zzso zzso to the zzso deletions arose at a frequency of 1 in zzso to 1 in zzso and permitted an analysis of deletions which were found to contain no zzso zzso These results indicate a role for zzso in normal cell growth and suggest a model for sequential assembly of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
