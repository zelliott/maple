The zzso element zzso is active in both zzso and zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso of the element is greatly enhanced in the presence of zzso a genetic factor identified as an autonomous copy of zzso A strain of zzso zzso containing zzso and other copies of zzso was used to initiate a screen for visible zzso More than 20 zzso were zzso including zzso of white, yellow and zzso Six zzso were characterized at the molecular level, and all were found to contain a zzso element inserted into the affected zzso Four insertions into the white locus were zzso to determine the exact site of zzso of zzso There appears to be little sequence specificity requirement for zzso zzso other than an absolute requirement for the zzso zzso which is duplicated upon zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso obtained from various white zzso including the previously isolated zzso zzso were obtained using the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso is imprecise in both zzso and zzso and the most frequent zzso events are the same in the two zzso zzso derivatives of zzso were also zzso and were found to exhibit a wide range of molecular structures and zzso
