The zzso zzso zzso protein and its structural zzso which are present along the zzso zzso constitute a novel protein zzso family (the zzso zzso zzso related in sequence to the zzso protein zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that the zzso protein displays zzso zzso activity in zzso and contains all the zzso zzso of the zzso This novel protein zzso appears to play an important cellular role as deletion in zzso of the gene zzso zzso results in the zzso of fundamental processes such as cell growth and zzso In this work we show that the zzso activity of zzso is relevant to its functionality in zzso but is not the unique role of the zzso since zzso which have lost zzso activity but not native zzso can partially complement the disruption of the gene zzso zzso A zzso approach has led to the identification of several proteins interacting with zzso in particular a zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso and proteins of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family seem most plausible zzso We further demonstrate that zzso directly interacts with zzso and that it is zzso in zzso by zzso at zzso The functional significance of the interaction between zzso and the putative zzso zzso is supported by its evolutionary zzso
