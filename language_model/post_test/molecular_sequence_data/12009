zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids from zzso zzso zzso in a cell zzso manner between the nucleus during zzso and the zzso during zzso To characterize the regions of zzso responsible for its dynamic behavior, we injected zzso fusion proteins spanning most of zzso into early zzso zzso where their zzso were characterized using zzso zzso zzso zzso A single zzso zzso acid nuclear zzso signal was detected that causes nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a separate region of 124 zzso zzso two zzso zzso fusion proteins containing distinct portions of this region show weaker zzso zzso Fusion proteins that contain both nuclear and zzso zzso sequences zzso between the nucleus and the zzso in a manner identical to native zzso Fusion proteins containing only the zzso zzso sequence are found at zzso throughout the cell cycle, suggesting that zzso is actively recruited away from the zzso by its movement into the nucleus during zzso Both native and zzso expressed zzso zzso with zzso in zzso Tests with fusion proteins show that the domain responsible for zzso binding zzso the domain required for zzso zzso zzso a protein identified by its association with zzso also zzso to zzso and to zzso in a cell zzso zzso zzso in which zzso is used to zzso zzso in the early zzso zzso demonstrate that both zzso and zzso are able to attain and maintain their zzso zzso in the absence of zzso
