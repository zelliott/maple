zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli is inhibited by excess zzso protein zzso the product of the third gene of the zzso Previous studies suggested that zzso regulates zzso by modulating the level of zzso at an zzso in the zzso zzso To understand better the molecular details of the zzso regulation, we have determined the site of zzso termination of zzso using a method that allows us to map the zzso and 3' ends of newly zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso stimulates termination about 140 bases from the zzso start zzso Thus, the termination point is more than 30 bases upstream from the most zzso structural gene of the zzso zzso and zzso with a string of U zzso on the descending side of a zzso hairpin zzso Since zzso is also known to inhibit translation of the zzso zzso we have analyzed the role of translation control in the zzso regulation of zzso by deleting sequences downstream from the termination site, including bases involved in translation initiation of the zzso structural zzso We find that the first 150 bases of the zzso leader contain the information sufficient for zzso zzso control and, therefore, that zzso regulates zzso by a mechanisms that is independent of the zzso zzso of zzso
