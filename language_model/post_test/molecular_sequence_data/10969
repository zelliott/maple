zzso of zzso was investigated by zzso a rat zzso cell line with zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was a transient zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso prior to assembly of the zzso zzso zzso gradually increased from zzso zzso to zzso core protein where all zzso zzso were zzso zzso of the first zzso zzso was accompanied by rapid zzso zzso A treatment resulted in segregation of zzso synthesis and zzso zzso degradation of zzso immature zzso with incomplete zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso in the zzso by using zzso zzso zzso and zzso followed by zzso treatment, demonstrated the sequence zzso The zzso was resistant to direct zzso zzso but sensitive after treatment with alkaline zzso showing that the zzso was located at C2 of zzso The transient zzso of zzso may be involved in zzso transport and/or in the control of modifications of the zzso zzso
