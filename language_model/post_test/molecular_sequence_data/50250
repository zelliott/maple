The effects of zzso hormone zzso on zzso hormone zzso zzso complex formation was investigated to zzso the mechanism by which zzso zzso genes in response to zzso The data, obtained from gel shift experiments, indicate that zzso hormones alter the zzso of zzso bound to DNA, irrespective of if the element is occupied by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso complexes with the zzso receptors zzso or zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso prevents 2 zzso molecules from binding to zzso containing direct repeats or zzso zzso of the consensus zzso zzso an effect that was not detected with zzso zzso zzso bound to direct repeats were less zzso zzso were fully and zzso complexes partially resistant to zzso zzso The data suggest that a zzso zzso change in zzso prevents double zzso occupancy of a response element containing 2 direct repeats of the consensus binding zzso possibly by zzso zzso whereas such an event does not prevent zzso zzso from binding to zzso Finally, our data show that a zzso zzso zzso bound zzso to the second half site in a zzso element, and therefore indicate that zzso adjacent to the consensus half site contribute to binding zzso
