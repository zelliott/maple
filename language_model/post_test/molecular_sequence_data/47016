We have characterized two separate zzso zzso zzso gene clusters to examine how zzso zzso expressing closely linked and zzso OR genes project their zzso to the zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso and zzso share zzso similarities in the zzso acid sequences and are tightly linked on zzso zzso In zzso zzso has demonstrated that the three genes are expressed in the same zone, at the most zzso and zzso portions of the zzso zzso and are rarely expressed simultaneously in individual zzso Furthermore, we have found that zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso or zzso project their zzso to very close but distinct zzso of zzso on the zzso and lateral sides of the zzso zzso Similar results have been obtained with another zzso OR gene cluster for A16 and zzso on zzso 2, sharing zzso similarity in the zzso acid zzso These results may indicate an intriguing possibility that zzso zzso expressing zzso OR genes within a cluster tend to zzso their zzso to zzso but distinct zzso of zzso These lines of study will shed light on the molecular basis of topographical projection of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso
