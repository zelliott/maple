We show that zzso factor zzso zzso zzso the DNA zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso promoter melting during zzso zzso does not interact with the promoter region that zzso melting but instead interacts with DNA downstream of this zzso We show further that promoter melting does not change zzso interactions upstream of the region that zzso melting but does change interactions within and downstream of this zzso Our results rule out the proposal that zzso functions in promoter melting through a conventional zzso zzso We propose that zzso functions as a molecular zzso rotating downstream DNA relative to fixed upstream zzso zzso thereby generating zzso on, and melting, the intervening zzso
