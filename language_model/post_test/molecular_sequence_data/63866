The zzso acute regulatory zzso zzso transfer zzso zzso are found in a wide range of proteins involved in zzso trafficking of cholesterol and other zzso Among the zzso proteins are the zzso protein itself zzso and the closely related zzso protein zzso which both function in cholesterol zzso We compared the zzso properties of these two zzso domain zzso zzso stabilized zzso against zzso degradation, whereas cholesterol had no protective effect on zzso zzso predominantly labeled a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acids zzso which contains zzso proposed to interact with cholesterol in a zzso zzso zzso labeling studies suggest that cholesterol zzso interacts with one side wall of this zzso In contrast, zzso was distributed more or less equally among the zzso of zzso Overall, our results provide evidence for differential cholesterol binding of the two most closely related zzso domain proteins zzso and zzso
