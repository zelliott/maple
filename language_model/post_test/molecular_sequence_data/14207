zzso zzso and zzso of precursors of zzso zzso zzso by the bacterial type III zzso zzso zzso were zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were proposed and chemically zzso In the presence of zzso each of these with zzso zzso was able to form partially zzso zzso By zzso and zzso analysis, the distribution of zzso atoms in the partially zzso zzso shed light on how the zzso chain zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a manner different from that which had been zzso two molecules of zzso or one zzso plus one zzso zzso but not two molecules of zzso can form one zzso of zzso As a result, zzso serves as both the starter and zzso whereas zzso without the terminal zzso group can only act as an zzso The terminal zzso group is crucial for the zzso that likely takes place on zzso
