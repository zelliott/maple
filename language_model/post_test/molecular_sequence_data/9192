The zzso of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso camels were amplified by zzso using zzso camel sequences and subsequently cloned for sequence zzso zzso based on zzso acid sequences revealed that zzso camel zzso shared zzso and zzso identity at the zzso and zzso acid levels with zzso camel zzso In the case of zzso the identity of zzso camel was zzso and zzso at the zzso and zzso acid levels, respectively with that of zzso zzso The zzso camel zzso shared zzso identity both at zzso and zzso acid levels with zzso camel zzso zzso analysis based on zzso acid sequences indicated the close relationship in these zzso genes between the zzso camel and other zzso
