There are two main classes of hormones in zzso 1) the true hormones produced by zzso zzso and belonging to the zzso or juvenile hormones and 2) the zzso hormones produced by zzso zzso Members of these classes regulate zzso zzso and behavioral events in zzso zzso accounts are given on isolation, zzso zzso zzso mode of action, biological function, zzso zzso zzso and feedback for hormones involved in 1) zzso regulation such as the zzso peptides and the zzso and zzso zzso 2) stimulation or zzso of muscle activity such as the zzso zzso 3) control of zzso growth, and development such as zzso zzso juvenile hormones, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso hormones, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 4) regulation of zzso and of color zzso Because of the improvements in techniques for isolation and structure zzso there has been rapid progress in our knowledge of the chemistry of certain zzso zzso With the employment of molecular biological techniques, the genes of some zzso have been successfully zzso There are, however, areas that are still quite zzso These are, for example, 1) zzso studies, which are still in their zzso 2) the hormonal status of certain zzso peptides is not zzso and 3) functional studies are lacking even for established zzso The authors plead for a concerted effort to continue research in this field, which will also advance our knowledge into the use of insect hormones as safer and zzso molecules for insect zzso zzso
