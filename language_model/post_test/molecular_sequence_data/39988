zzso toxin and zzso zzso for successful infection by zzso zzso are zzso on the zzso plasmids zzso and zzso zzso Each of these plasmids also encodes proteins that are highly zzso to the signal sensor domain of a zzso zzso major zzso sensor zzso zzso zzso in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso signal sensor domain exhibited a significant decrease in zzso that was suppressed by the deletion of the zzso zzso zzso of the sensor zzso from the zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso strains carrying the zzso zzso zzso sensor zzso zzso gene resulted in zzso zzso of zzso These results indicate that zzso sensor zzso zzso is converted from an zzso to an inhibitor of zzso in its native host by the zzso zzso signal sensor zzso We speculate that zzso of these signal sensor zzso contributes to the initiation of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of its infected host, a salient characteristic in the zzso of this zzso and provides an additional role for the zzso plasmids in anthrax zzso
