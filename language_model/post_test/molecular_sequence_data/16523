zzso zzso zzso an zzso that zzso the zzso of Ala zzso is essential for the synthesis of the bacterial cell zzso We have shown that it is harder to inhibit the zzso activity of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso than that from zzso coli by zzso To obtain structural evidence for the fact that zzso zzso displays resistance to zzso we determined the precise nature of the zzso crystal structures of the zzso and zzso zzso forms of zzso zzso at high zzso zzso zzso takes a zzso structure, which is formed by interactions between the zzso domain of one zzso with the zzso domain of its zzso Each of the two active sites of zzso which is generated as a result of the formation of the zzso structure, is composed of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso acids in the immediate environment of the zzso zzso The current model suggests that each active site of zzso zzso maintains a larger space and takes a more rigid zzso than that of zzso zzso zzso determined zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso results in a slow conversion to a final form of a zzso zzso arising from either zzso of zzso which zzso the zzso activity zzso In fact, the slow conversion is confirmed by the fact that each zzso bound zzso zzso which is bound to zzso takes an zzso zzso
