zzso errors are present in almost all genetic data and can affect biological conclusions of a study, particularly for studies based on individual identification and zzso Many statistical approaches can incorporate zzso zzso but usually need accurate estimates of error zzso Here, we used a new zzso data set developed for brown zzso zzso zzso to estimate zzso error using three zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso of samples, zzso comparing unintentionally recaptured individuals and zzso zzso inheritance error checking for known zzso zzso In each data set, we zzso zzso error rate per zzso due to zzso zzso and false zzso zzso error rate per locus revealed an average overall zzso error rate by direct count of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso per zzso error zzso from replicate zzso known zzso pairs and unintentionally recaptured individuals, zzso By zzso error estimates, the recapture and known zzso data sets revealed an error rate four times greater than estimated using repeat zzso There was no evidence of correlation between error rates and locus zzso for all three data sets, and errors appeared to occur randomly over zzso in the repeat zzso but not in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, there was no correlation in zzso error rates between any two of the three data zzso Our data suggest that repeat zzso may underestimate true error rates and may not estimate zzso error rates zzso We therefore suggest using methods for error zzso that zzso to the overall aim of the study zzso known zzso comparisons in parentage zzso
