zzso profiles derived from human blood zzso of 10 healthy males were compared to those from 24 prostate cancer zzso The profiles were acquired using zzso of zzso zzso released from zzso sample zzso zzso zzso was attained using zzso zzso Principal component analysis of the zzso profiles revealed significant differences among the two sets, allowing their distinct zzso The first principal component distinguished the 24 prostate cancer patients from the healthy zzso It was determined that zzso of zzso structures is generally higher in cancer samples zzso test zzso of zzso Although more than 50 zzso structures were determined, 12 zzso structures, of which six were zzso were significantly different between the two sample zzso zzso differences were confirmed through two independent statistical tests zzso and zzso zzso Ten of these structures had significantly higher relative zzso in the case of the cancer samples, while the other two were less abundant in the cancer zzso All 12 structures were statistically zzso as suggested by their very low zzso scores zzso and zzso analysis, with area under the curve values close to 1 or zzso zzso these structures can be considered as zzso zzso and potential prostate cancer zzso zzso serum zzso profiling appears worthy of further investigation to define its role in cancer early detection and zzso
