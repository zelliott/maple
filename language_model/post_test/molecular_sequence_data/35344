zzso is a widely spread zzso disease in tropical and zzso regions of the zzso zzso fever presents clinical characteristics similar to other zzso zzso Thus laboratory diagnosis is important for adequate management of the zzso 

The present study was designed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of real-time zzso and zzso methods for dengue in a real epidemic zzso 

Clinical data and blood samples were collected from consecutive patients with suspected dengue who attended a primary health care unit in zzso zzso zzso zzso methods and real-time zzso were performed in serum samples to confirm dengue zzso 

Among the 181 consecutive patients enrolled in this study with suspected zzso 146 were considered positive by zzso criteria zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and 138 were positive by real-time zzso Clinical criteria were not sufficient for distinguishing between dengue and zzso zzso zzso The zzso reaction was zzso using samples from patients with known viral zzso It had similar sensitivity compared to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also evaluated three commercial lateral flow zzso tests for zzso detection zzso zzso and zzso All three tests showed high sensitivity zzso zzso and zzso zzso for dengue zzso 

According to our results it can be suggested that lateral flow tests for zzso detection are the most feasible methods for early diagnosis of zzso
