zzso peptides zzso are essential components of innate immunity in a range of species from zzso to humans and are generally thought to act by zzso the membrane integrity of zzso In order to discover novel zzso in the chicken, we have implemented a zzso approach that involves the zzso of more than 420,000 chicken expressed sequence tags zzso zzso searching of zzso to be zzso by these zzso zzso zzso to known zzso has resulted in the in zzso identification of full-length sequences for seven novel zzso zzso to zzso a novel zzso and a novel zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso in the zzso zzso gene expression of these novel genes has been demonstrated across a panel of chicken zzso An evolutionary analysis of the zzso family has detected zzso in the mature zzso are under positive selection in these zzso The functional implications of these results are zzso
