Rice zzso disease is caused by a combination of two zzso Rice zzso zzso virus and Rice zzso zzso virus zzso This study was performed with the objective to decipher the molecular zzso and evolution of zzso zzso present in the zzso states of Indian zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso and zzso sequences showed distinct divergence of Indian zzso zzso into two zzso one consisted zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and another from West zzso zzso West zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results obtained from zzso analysis were further supported with the single zzso zzso zzso zzso and deletion zzso and evolutionary distance zzso In addition, sequence difference count zzso revealed a maximum of 56 zzso 13 zzso and 73 zzso zzso differences among all the Indian zzso zzso taken in this zzso However, at the protein level these differences were not significant as revealed by K zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso identity at zzso and zzso acid level was zzso % zzso zzso % zzso zzso % zzso and zzso % zzso zzso % zzso and zzso % zzso respectively, among Indian zzso of zzso The divergence of zzso zzso into two independent clusters of Indian and zzso was shown with the help of the data obtained from zzso zzso and zzso evolutionary distance analysis, and zzso motifs zzso The important role of zzso and zzso in zzso diversification and adaptation to different rice growing regions is also zzso
