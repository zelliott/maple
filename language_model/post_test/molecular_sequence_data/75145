zzso coli expressing the zzso genes produce zzso that mediate specific zzso to zzso zzso We show that the major zzso zzso zzso zzso is part of a zzso zzso unit subject to specific zzso zzso A primary transcript also zzso the zzso regulatory gene product is zzso zzso resulting in the rapid zzso of the zzso zzso half of the zzso whereas the zzso 3' half remains as a quite stable zzso zzso and differential zzso stability thereby result in zzso of zzso zzso only the major zzso zzso A sequence immediately downstream of the zzso coding region may serve as a stability zzso for the zzso transcript and zzso zzso zzso zzso into the minor zzso zzso gene zzso This suggests that differential expression of genes within an zzso may include zzso and zzso processing of the zzso
