zzso zzso hormone was the first chemical substance identified as a maternal control factor that arrests offspring zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which the hormone zzso the signal to the zzso that zzso embryonic zzso immediately after zzso zzso are not fully zzso Here, we describe a zzso for a G zzso zzso hormone zzso with seven zzso zzso Its zzso sequence shows a high level of similarity to the receptors of zzso zzso U and insect regulatory zzso an zzso zzso When expressed in a zzso zzso system, the zzso exhibited the highest affinity zzso approximately zzso for zzso hormone, when compared with other zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone without zzso at the zzso which never zzso embryonic zzso in zzso had no effect in this zzso expression zzso The zzso is expressed in the zzso during zzso zzso zzso These results strongly indicate that the zzso encodes the zzso hormone zzso
