zzso virus zzso causes an zzso and zzso disease, which posed substantial threats to the commercial poultry zzso However, researches on the molecular epidemiology and the zzso mechanism of zzso are still zzso In this study, a full-length zzso zzso of zzso virus zzso strain zzso which was isolated from layer in China, was zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso zzso long, and the zzso zzso number is zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was more similar to some zzso strains that are common in the USA and Taiwan than to the early Chinese zzso zzso Next, the first efficient and genetically stable infectious clone with the genetic markers of the layer strain of zzso was zzso The rescued and parental viruses had similar biological characteristics in zzso and in zzso This study not only contributes to novel molecular epidemiology data, but also zzso researching the gene functions and evolution of zzso
