Members of the nerve growth factor zzso family of zzso bind to the second zzso motif zzso within the zzso zzso of their respective receptors zzso zzso zzso Small zzso peptides have been recently demonstrated to selectively bind the zzso revealing similar complex binding characteristics as full-length zzso We extend our recent findings, showing that the peptides (A and zzso do not block nerve fiber outgrowth through high affinity zzso receptors in a zzso zzso Since the highest concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso is found in the zzso the peptides were injected into the 3rd zzso of zzso adult zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso caused severe zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso as revealed by zzso violet zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso was protected by zzso injection of zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating a zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso did not express zzso and zzso zzso zzso in sham and zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso zzso represents a novel zzso with properties to induce zzso cell death of zzso zzso zzso and may be useful as an experimental zzso
