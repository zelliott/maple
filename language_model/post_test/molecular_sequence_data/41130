In a previous study, we reported the ecological significance of zzso bacterial group U2 in the zzso In this study, the involvement of a recently cultured group U2 zzso strain zzso in fiber zzso was tested in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Dry matter zzso zzso growth and zzso were examined in culture using rice straw as the carbon zzso Although strain zzso did not digest rice straw in zzso zzso of strain zzso and zzso zzso showed enhanced zzso zzso compared with that for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth of strain zzso and production of the main zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were enhanced in the zzso zzso zzso showed increased activities of zzso and zzso in zzso of strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso including strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed a further increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso increase in zzso produced from the conversion of zzso and zzso These results suggest that the positive interaction between strains zzso and zzso zzso causes increased rice straw zzso
