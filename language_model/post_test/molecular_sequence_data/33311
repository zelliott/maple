Plant zzso zzso (AP) play key roles in the regulation of biological zzso such as the recognition of pathogens and zzso and the induction of effective defense zzso A large number of zzso zzso have been identified in zzso in the rice zzso None have previously been isolated and functionally characterized for their involvement in disease zzso We describe here the isolation and characterization of a gene zzso from rice which encodes a predicted zzso zzso zzso of zzso was activated upon treatments with zzso and salicylic acid, which are signal molecules in plant disease resistance zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso and rice zzso enhanced resistance against bacterial and zzso zzso The enhanced disease resistance observed in transgenic plants was correlated with induction of zzso gene expression and was shown by zzso analysis to be dependent on zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso accumulates in zzso zzso zzso in transgenic zzso zzso of IF from transgenic zzso plants into leaves of zzso zzso zzso induced the systemic defense zzso These results demonstrate the conservation of zzso function between rice and zzso during the disease resistance zzso
