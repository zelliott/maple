zzso introduces a common zzso zzso sequence with an zzso cap zzso zzso or zzso to more than zzso of transcripts in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso translation system, we found that the zzso and spliced leader sequence zzso collaborate to promote efficient translation, whereas addition of either a zzso or spliced leader sequence alone decreased reporter zzso We cloned an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that this zzso protein can bind zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and that binding is enhanced by zzso Both the cap structure and the spliced leader zzso sequence affect levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Furthermore, the differential binding of zzso to a zzso and to zzso and zzso zzso is commensurate with the zzso activity of reporter zzso observed in the zzso zzso Together, these binding data and translation zzso with competitor cap zzso suggest that zzso zzso zzso activity may be sufficient to mediate translation of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrate the zzso sequence tends to zzso close to the start zzso in a diversity of zzso This evolutionary conservation is functionally reflected in the optimal zzso to zzso distance for reporter zzso translation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso leader sequence may serve at least two functions in zzso generation of an optimal zzso region length and a specific sequence context zzso for optimal translation of zzso capped zzso
