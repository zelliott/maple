DNA zzso zzso zzso is a low zzso zzso DNA zzso implicated in spontaneous and DNA zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso was frequently zzso in human lung cancer zzso as compared with their matched zzso tissue zzso In the present study, we found a close correlation between elevated zzso expression and zzso zzso in lung cancer zzso To investigate whether zzso expression might be regulated by zzso we have determined the zzso initiation site of zzso gene and examined its promoter activity in zzso zzso and zzso human lung cancer cell zzso zzso zzso but not a zzso zzso zzso devoid of the zzso activity, strongly inhibited zzso promoter activity in these zzso In addition, zzso promoter exhibited a significantly higher activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso and zzso zzso These results link zzso status with zzso expression and suggest that loss of zzso function may in part contribute to the observed zzso zzso in human lung zzso
