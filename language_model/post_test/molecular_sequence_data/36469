zzso salt zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso times higher in ferret milk than in human zzso We have used the ferret to study zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso cells isolated by zzso treatment followed by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we have compared the characteristics of zzso in the tissue preparations zzso or zzso to zzso of ferret milk and to zzso zzso from ferret and human zzso The characteristics of zzso in ferret zzso zzso preparations and milk were similar to those of human milk zzso requirement of primary zzso zzso pH optimum of zzso stability at pH zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso ferret milk zzso had a lower molecular weight zzso than did human milk zzso zzso zzso There was an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequence between zzso of ferret and of human zzso The marked similarity in characteristics between zzso in ferret and human milk and the high activity of zzso in ferret milk zzso zzso zzso and 250 zzso mature milk) indicate that this species is an ideal animal model for the study of the synthesis and zzso of this zzso zzso which constitutes a significant portion zzso of total milk zzso
