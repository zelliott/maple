zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso receptors for the zzso nerve growth factor, zzso nerve growth factor, zzso and zzso Here we report on the isolation of zzso fragments zzso a part of rat zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and characterization of a full-length zzso clone zzso rat zzso zzso expressing zzso for the different members of the zzso family were identified in the rat central nervous system by in zzso zzso using zzso zzso designed from the isolated zzso sequences and complementary to zzso sequences coding for the zzso region of the zzso The expression of zzso zzso was found to be restricted to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with features of zzso cells and to zzso zzso of several zzso zzso In contrast, cells expressing zzso and zzso zzso were widely distributed in the zzso Areas expressing high levels of zzso or zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso A similar distribution for zzso and zzso zzso was shown in most areas but each probe specific for these zzso also provided distinct labeling patterns in different zzso layers and zzso zzso between our data and previous analyses of cells expressing zzso for zzso and the zzso nerve growth factor zzso suggests that different modes of action and different combinations of receptors mediate biological responses to zzso in the adult rat zzso
