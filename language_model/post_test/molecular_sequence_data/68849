To study the function of zzso 21 of the insulin zzso a zzso human insulin zzso lacking this domain was zzso The zzso zzso delta zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso and stable cell lines were zzso The zzso delta zzso receptors were expressed on the cell surface, and they bound insulin with the same affinity as did the zzso cell line, zzso The zzso delta zzso receptors did not display zzso zzso or zzso activity, and as expected, zzso was impaired and zzso signaling properties were zzso zzso zzso ability to stimulate DNA synthesis in cells expressing zzso delta zzso receptors was far greater than that in the parental zzso cells and equal to that measured in the zzso cell zzso The enhanced zzso signaling properties of the zzso delta zzso receptors was confirmed by showing that treatment of zzso delta zzso cells with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also led to enhanced DNA zzso Thus, although no insulin zzso zzso or zzso activity was zzso in zzso delta zzso cells, these cells displayed enhanced zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that an alternative zzso zzso zzso exists for the long-term biological effects of zzso
