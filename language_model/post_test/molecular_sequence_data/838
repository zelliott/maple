Small laboratory animals have provided significant information about zzso regulation, yet most of these organisms are nocturnal and regulate zzso synthesis by mechanisms that diverge from those of zzso For example, in all zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs with a time lag of several hours after the onset of zzso in addition, zzso zzso zzso the key zzso in zzso zzso displays dynamic zzso zzso specifically at night in all zzso studied to zzso In zzso and primates including humans, on the other hand, zzso zzso occurs immediately during the early night and is controlled by zzso zzso regulation of zzso We zzso that the zzso zzso zzso (an zzso zzso could serve as an improved experimental model for studies of human zzso zzso To test this, we monitored zzso production in zzso using zzso zzso and characterized the regulation of zzso synthesis by analyzing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rises with little zzso at night, as in zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso expression displays no zzso zzso variation, suggesting that, like zzso and zzso zzso in this species is regulated by a zzso zzso Compared with zzso from all zzso examined to date, the predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso is zzso more closely related to zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso may provide an ideal model system for laboratory investigation of mechanisms of zzso synthesis and zzso in zzso zzso
