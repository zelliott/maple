The role of the zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso and positioning has been investigated by zzso zzso structural relationship of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso leaf cells of zzso and zzso the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso drugs on zzso distribution of zzso zzso of leaf cells with two zzso specific zzso which react zzso with all the expressed zzso zzso revealed two arrangements of zzso zzso zzso zzso of thick zzso zzso and randomly oriented thin zzso filaments that extended from the zzso zzso were either aligned along the zzso zzso or closely associated with the fine zzso zzso of zzso zzso were also observed around the zzso The leaf cells labeled with an zzso zzso showed dense zzso zzso of cortical zzso that exhibited no apparent association with zzso The application of zzso severely disrupted zzso filaments and their association with zzso In addition, zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso and bundle sheath zzso Double labeling of zzso treated cells with zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the zzso in these cells were zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso with zzso did not affect the distribution of zzso These results provide evidence for the involvement of zzso but not zzso in the movement and positioning of zzso in leaf zzso We propose that using motor zzso some zzso migrate along the zzso cables directly, while others are pulled along the cables by the fine zzso zzso The baskets of zzso may anchor the zzso during streaming and allow control over proper three-dimensional orientation to zzso
