The zzso zzso gene cluster of the zzso producer zzso zzso includes a gene zzso with unknown zzso zzso shows high similarity to the zzso gene from zzso zzso In almost all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso we could identify a small zzso gene whose function in zzso zzso is not zzso The zzso gene is always zzso with the zzso zzso however, it does not have a specific position in the gene zzso In all zzso zzso gene clusters the zzso gene is always located downstream of the gene zzso the last module of the zzso We zzso the zzso gene in zzso zzso by generating a deletion zzso The zzso production is not affected in the zzso zzso and is indistinguishable from that of the wild zzso For the first time, we show that the zzso of an zzso gene does not impair the zzso of a zzso zzso
