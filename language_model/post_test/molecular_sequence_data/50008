The zzso Genome Project zzso zzso contains the sequence of an zzso gene zzso expected to code for a G zzso zzso We have cloned this zzso and found that its gene was not correctly predicted, because an zzso zzso gene zzso was also part of the zzso zzso DNA corresponding to the corrected gene zzso was expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cells, where it was found to code for a zzso that could be activated by low zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso also known to occur in zzso and other insects zzso zzso zzso zzso Other known zzso zzso such as zzso hormone, did not activate the zzso The zzso is expressed in all zzso stages from zzso but only very zzso in zzso In adult flies, the zzso is mainly expressed in the zzso Furthermore, we identified a gene sequence in the zzso database from the malaria zzso zzso zzso that very likely codes for a zzso zzso zzso zzso
