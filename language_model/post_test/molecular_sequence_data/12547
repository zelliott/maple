zzso membrane associations are important for a variety of cellular zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of polarized zzso cells provide well studied examples of how integral membrane proteins are anchored via the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso membrane zzso In the present study we have generated several zzso fragments of the large zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso to define binding sites of zzso on zzso at a molecular zzso We provide evidence that a cluster of four zzso zzso zzso is essential for binding of zzso to both zzso zzso and to native zzso Once bound, zzso changes might uncover further binding sites for zzso on zzso A motif related to the zzso cluster is also present in the zzso domain of zzso where this sequence zzso turned out to be also important for zzso zzso These motifs are highly zzso during evolution of both zzso and zzso further underlining their potential role in zzso to membrane zzso
