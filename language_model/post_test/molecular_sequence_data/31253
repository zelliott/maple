zzso 1 zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein and exhibits an activity of inducing flat zzso at certain zzso zzso of total zzso when introduced into a zzso mouse zzso zzso cell line, zzso Toward understanding the mechanism of action of zzso zzso we constructed a series of point zzso of zzso zzso and tested their biological activities in zzso cells and zzso human zzso cells harboring the activated zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso in the putative zzso zzso regions zzso and zzso in the putative zzso domain zzso zzso at the putative zzso site zzso and at the unique zzso all decreased the transformation zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso such as zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso were found to significantly increase the transformation zzso zzso activity of zzso These findings are consistent with the idea that zzso protein is regulated like many other G proteins by the zzso zzso zzso mechanism probably in response to certain negative zzso zzso
