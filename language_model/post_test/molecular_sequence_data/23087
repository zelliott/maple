The zzso gene is known to display the most extensive zzso zzso among zzso class II zzso We attempted the selective identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso chain reaction zzso technique in three steps: first, we performed zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso lineage detection in each zzso second, we performed zzso zzso for amplification of full-length zzso 2; and finally, we carried out an insert check using the pattern of zzso repeat length zzso In the zzso DNA of 23 zzso nine zzso zzso containing two new zzso were zzso Our approach provides a relatively effective method of identifying zzso zzso in individual chimpanzees and should also contribute to our understanding of the features of zzso molecules in zzso zzso
