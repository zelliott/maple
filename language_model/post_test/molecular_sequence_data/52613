The zzso clone within the zzso type zzso complex of zzso zzso was first detected in Canada in 1986 and has since been associated with outbreaks of zzso disease in many parts of the zzso While the majority of the strains of the zzso complex are zzso zzso zzso determination of zzso strains may often be incomplete, with either only one or none of the two variable regions zzso of the zzso zzso outer membrane protein reacting with zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso gene from zzso strains with one or both unidentified zzso zzso was undertaken to identify the genetic basis of the lack of reaction with the zzso zzso Fourteen different zzso zzso were identified among 38 zzso strains from various geographic zzso The sequences corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified in 18, 11, 2, 2, and 1 zzso zzso Of the remaining four zzso which all were zzso two had a stop zzso within the zzso and the zzso respectively, while in the other two the zzso gene was interrupted by the zzso element, zzso Of the strains with zzso zzso one had a stop zzso between the zzso and zzso one had a zzso deletion outside the zzso and another showed no expression of zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso Our results reveal that numerous genetic events have occurred in the zzso gene of the zzso clone in the short time of its epidemic zzso The magnitude of zzso mechanisms available in zzso and the remarkable genetic flexibility of these bacteria need to be considered in relation to zzso vaccine zzso
