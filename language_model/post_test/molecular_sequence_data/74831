zzso biological zzso removal zzso selects for zzso accumulating zzso to achieve zzso removal from zzso We used high-resolution community zzso to identify key zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to evaluate the contributions of zzso strains within the dominant zzso Overall, 702 proteins from the zzso zzso population were zzso zzso highlight the importance of zzso fatty acid cycling and the zzso bypass in zzso Strong similarity in protein profiles under zzso and zzso conditions was uncovered zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins exhibited statistically significant abundance zzso By comprehensive zzso alignment of zzso zzso zzso we uncovered substantial differences in protein abundance for zzso zzso involved in both zzso and zzso pathways among the zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest an essential role for genetic diversity in maintaining the stable performance of zzso systems and, zzso demonstrate the power of integrated zzso zzso and zzso for the analysis of complex zzso zzso
