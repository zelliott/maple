zzso zzso zzso is found at low zzso in most animal zzso and recent data suggest that it may act as a zzso donor for the zzso of some zzso In the zzso brain, zzso synthesis is zzso but its zzso concentration remains low, presumably because of rapid zzso In this report we zzso a soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso ) from calf zzso The bovine zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso with virtually absolute zzso zzso sequence data obtained from the zzso bovine zzso by tandem mass zzso were used to search the zzso data zzso A significant identity was found with only one human zzso the hypothetical zzso acid protein zzso The coding regions from human and bovine brain zzso were amplified by reverse zzso cloned in zzso coli, and zzso The human open reading frame was expressed in zzso coli as a zzso fusion zzso zzso bacteria had a high zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso had properties similar to those of human brain zzso and it was specific for zzso The zzso was expressed in most human zzso but at relatively low zzso This is the first report of a molecular characterization of a specific zzso
