Like other zzso G zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso has minimal genetic space for population zzso and has attained such via multiple coding and zzso zzso Yet most clinical studies use the two zzso zzso of the coding region for association analysis despite low levels of linkage zzso with some promoter and zzso zzso To assess the potential for zzso zzso factor binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso duplexes were zzso Each was centered on variable sites representing major or minor zzso found in the human population with zzso of zzso or greater (20 zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso were performed using human airway smooth muscle or airway zzso cell nuclear zzso Many of these zzso resulted in an zzso in zzso and both major zzso and minor zzso dominance were zzso For example, in airway smooth muscle nuclear zzso 10 zzso decreased and 2 increased zzso whereas 5 showed no zzso zzso between airway smooth muscle and zzso cell nuclear extract binding to zzso zzso was found in only approximately 50% of zzso There was no tendency for the rare zzso to be more likely to have altered nuclear extract binding compared to the more common zzso Taken together, these results provide potential mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso affect zzso lung zzso
