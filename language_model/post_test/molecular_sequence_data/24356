A sequence with a high zzso zzso zzso zzso with that of the zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso and with the same zzso zzso motif has been identified in the zzso of zzso zzso and the corresponding protein has been zzso The zzso constituted by 73 zzso zzso does bind zzso under reducing conditions and fully folded in both zzso and zzso forms under the present experimental zzso The solution structure of the zzso form was determined through zzso zzso on an zzso zzso A total of zzso meaningful nuclear zzso effects, 38 zzso zzso angles, and 48 zzso zzso angles were used in the structural calculations, which lead to a family of 30 zzso with an average zzso to the mean structure of zzso zzso zzso A for the backbone and of zzso zzso zzso A for the heavy zzso zzso data on the zzso also show that, also in this form, the protein is in a folded state and essentially maintains the complete secondary zzso Some disorder is observed in the loop devoted to copper zzso These results are compared with those reported for zzso from zzso zzso whose structure is zzso only in the zzso zzso The different behaviors of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are tentatively accounted for on the basis of the presence of zzso used in the latter case, which would stabilize the zzso zzso The comparison is extended to other similar zzso with particular attention to the zzso zzso The nature and the location of zzso zzso around the zzso site are discussed with respect to their relevance for the zzso zzso zzso for the role of zzso are also zzso
