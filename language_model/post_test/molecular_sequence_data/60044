In zzso and plants the first step in the common zzso leading to the zzso of aromatic compounds is the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso giving rise to zzso zzso This reaction is zzso by zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso which in zzso is the target for zzso regulation by zzso zzso or by end zzso In zzso coli there are three zzso zzso each specifically inhibited by one of the three aromatic zzso zzso 

The crystal structure of the zzso form of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso was determined by multiple wavelength anomalous zzso phasing utilizing the anomalous scattering of zzso The zzso consists of two tight zzso The zzso of the tight zzso are coupled by extensive interactions including a pair of zzso zzso beta zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso barrel with several additional beta strands and alpha zzso The zzso and zzso are at the zzso of the beta strands of the barrel, as is zzso zzso to occupy the position of the zzso of zzso zzso that reduce feedback zzso cluster about a cavity near the twofold axis of the tight zzso and are centered approximately 15 A from the active site, indicating the location of a separate regulatory zzso 

The crystal structure of zzso reveals the active site of this key zzso of aromatic zzso and indicates the probable site of inhibitor zzso This is the first reported structure of a zzso the structure of its two zzso and of a variety of zzso should now be readily determined by molecular zzso
