zzso zzso associated with complicated urinary tract infection, expresses zzso zzso zzso zzso of these surface structures, which mediate zzso and have a demonstrated role in zzso zzso phase zzso By DNA sequence analysis, a 252 zzso zzso element was found in the zzso region between zzso the putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso the primary structural zzso zzso The zzso segment is flanked by identical 21 zzso zzso repeats and the zzso zzso for zzso binding show zzso to those recognized by zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso coli zzso zzso 1 zzso gene zzso When amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso from zzso broth cultures expressing zzso zzso the switch region was found in both ON and OFF zzso When zzso was used to amplify zzso cultures which do not express the zzso the switch region was OFF zzso A zzso zzso 70 promoter inside the zzso element drives the zzso of zzso when in the ON zzso in the OFF position it is directed away from zzso but does not appear to drive expression of zzso The zzso gene was able to zzso inversion of the zzso switch region in trans from both ON to OFF and OFF to zzso To examine the position of the switch in zzso zzso zzso and zzso from mice zzso infected with zzso zzso were used to prepare template DNA for zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso stone zzso the switch was found zzso in the ON position, a condition never observed following in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso phase variation is regulated at the zzso level by the action of zzso on an zzso element and that there is strong selective pressure for the expression of zzso zzso in zzso
