The zzso interactions that occur between the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso can serve as a simple model for the more complex zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso We have used zzso and fusion protein zzso to analyze the requirements for interaction between the single zzso core zzso zzso and the zzso promoter specificity factor zzso We were unable to define any protein zzso that retained the ability to zzso indicating that multiple regions encompassing the entire length of the proteins are involved in zzso We found that 9 of 15 zzso zzso point zzso in zzso isolated in a zzso shuffle strategy had lost the ability to zzso Some of the zzso zzso are zzso petite zzso zzso this zzso zzso with a precipitous drop in zzso transcript abundance when cells are shifted to the zzso zzso One zzso zzso demonstrated a striking pH dependence for core binding in zzso consistent with the physical properties of the zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso fall into three widely spaced clusters of zzso zzso Two of the clusters are in regions with zzso acid sequence similarity to zzso regions 2 and 3 of zzso factors and related zzso these regions have been implicated in core binding by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso By modeling the location of the zzso using the partial structure of zzso coli zzso we find that two of the clusters are potentially juxtaposed in the three-dimensional zzso Our results demonstrate that interactions between zzso specificity factors and core zzso zzso require multiple regions from both components of the zzso
