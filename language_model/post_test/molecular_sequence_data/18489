A zzso study was carried out on strain zzso which was isolated from the zzso tract contents of a zzso mullet, zzso zzso captured from the sea off zzso Island, zzso The zzso was observed to be Gram positive, zzso and zzso positive, rod zzso and zzso by zzso zzso The zzso was found to grow at zzso of zzso and at temperatures of zzso The isolate was found to zzso zzso and zzso but was unable to reduce nitrate to zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso belongs to the zzso zzso with highest sequence similarity zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while the sequence similarities to others were all below zzso The zzso zzso values between strain zzso and three type strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined to range from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso estimate values between strain zzso and the three type strains were from zzso to zzso The principal fatty acids identified were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was determined from the draft zzso sequence to be zzso The respiratory zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso and two unknown zzso were found to be zzso The combined zzso and zzso data show that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
