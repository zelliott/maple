zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and the protein was associated with two zzso bands which migrated with an apparent Mr of zzso 50,000 on zzso zzso Upon limited zzso with zzso the native zzso zzso was converted into zzso of Mr zzso and zzso Both zzso fragments displayed zzso zzso activity that was zzso A zzso zzso zzso that encodes the zzso part of the zzso zzso was isolated by zzso of a rat brain zzso zzso The zzso end of this clone was used in turn to probe the same library, yielding a clone zzso containing the entire coding sequence of zzso zzso The zzso protein of zzso zzso acids zzso Mr zzso has several putative zzso sites for zzso zzso protein zzso protein zzso C and zzso protein zzso zzso When clone zzso was expressed in zzso coli, the truncated fusion protein showed zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that the zzso part of the protein is not essential for either zzso or zzso zzso
