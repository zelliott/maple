The zzso gene zzso a membrane zzso pump is a main zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso various range of resistance to zzso was observed among zzso To explore the evolution traits of zzso zzso the population data of zzso zzso were collected and zzso The zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso population can be classified into three zzso and the positive selection was detected in population by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso ratios further showed that zzso zzso zzso was undergoing positive zzso This finding was also supported by zzso branch zzso Nine potential positive selection sites were predicted by zzso model, and four sites exclusively belong to the zzso under positive zzso The data from zzso protein structure demonstrated that three sites are zzso between polar and zzso zzso zzso and only one site of zzso from basic zzso acid to basic zzso acid zzso Because zzso acid zzso values are crucial for zzso pump to maintain their routine function, positive selection of these zzso acid zzso might affect zzso zzso zzso
