zzso is a zzso factor important for zzso muscle, and facial development in zzso To identify genes regulated by zzso we used a zzso amplification and selection of targets zzso strategy to isolate zzso elements bound by zzso zzso libraries were constructed with mouse DNA fragments bound by mouse zzso and human zzso DNA fragments bound by human zzso and the fusion protein zzso zzso 1000 clones were zzso from each of these three zzso Numerous putative targets of zzso and zzso were identified and six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined zzso The zzso DNA fragments near these genes contain zzso binding sites and zzso zzso zzso The expression levels of these genes correlate with the zzso expression levels in mouse zzso or with zzso expression levels in zzso cell lines, and indicate they may be part of the zzso regulatory zzso during zzso and tumor zzso
