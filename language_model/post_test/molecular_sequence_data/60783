We have characterized a novel zzso whose steady state zzso levels rise in the zzso 2 to 6 h following the induction of zzso zzso zzso by in zzso zzso of zzso zzso This zzso zzso contains an open reading frame zzso zzso a protein with an zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso domain and a zzso domain zzso to zzso factors zzso Northern analysis demonstrates widespread expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso of the zzso zzso levels in total zzso zzso but not in zzso from zzso zzso suggesting that this transcript is derived from a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso increase zzso transcript levels in zzso cortical zzso zzso nurse, and zzso cell zzso In the zzso cortical zzso cell line, zzso and zzso induce a protein of the predicted zzso size zzso with zzso zzso zzso Fifteen minutes of serum stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso proteins is identified as zzso zzso zzso a signaling zzso previously known to bind to a zzso factor zzso and zzso associate with the focal zzso zzso zzso with such an association, zzso zzso zzso is induced following adherence of zzso zzso to zzso or zzso zzso zzso
