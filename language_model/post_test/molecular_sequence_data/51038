The zzso zzso and its zzso zzso belong to a growing family of zzso factors that are related by the zzso zzso zzso We show here that the zzso domain and adjacent zzso zzso acids are required for DNA binding by zzso zzso differs from zzso in both the zzso sequence and an zzso acid substitution in the zzso zzso The change in the zzso sequence markedly decreases its affinity for specific DNA, and the zzso domain zzso further diminishes zzso zzso does not zzso through the zzso zzso motif in zzso Surprisingly, zzso still efficiently zzso the promoters of two zzso zzso and zzso that are found to be zzso in transformed zzso The zzso motifs of both promoters are required for efficient zzso zzso does not bind to the zzso zzso even in the presence of zzso and zzso The zzso domain of zzso is required for zzso through the zzso zzso zzso is inhibited by the expression of the zzso and zzso acid zzso suggesting that zzso by zzso does not involve reversal of negative regulators of zzso We suggest that zzso is by an indirect mechanism involving zzso of zzso zzso Our results show that zzso differs from its zzso zzso in its zzso zzso The findings suggest that zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso is important for transformation by zzso
