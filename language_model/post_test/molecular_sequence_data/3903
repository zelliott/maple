BK virus zzso was recovered by zzso chain reaction zzso from brain, zzso zzso zzso and zzso fluid zzso of a fatal case of zzso zzso zzso with dissemination to lung and zzso zzso regulatory regions in zzso urine and the lung samples were identical to the zzso structure, zzso In the brain and zzso a rearranged sequence zzso zzso A zzso deletion preceded a zzso tandem zzso because the same zzso segment was deleted from both zzso zzso regulatory region products were cloned and zzso to define further the extent of the rearranged zzso Two kidney clones were zzso whereas two others were rearranged differently from the brain and from each zzso In contrast to the brain zzso the kidney zzso seemed to involve deletion after zzso Three of four brain clones zzso were identical to the zzso found to dominate in the zzso zzso A fourth clone showed two short deletions without any zzso The four zzso clones all showed zzso identical to that which was amplified by zzso from zzso and zzso This represents the first molecular analysis of a zzso strain obtained from a central nervous system infection, and it reveals regulatory region zzso reminiscent of those described in zzso virus from brains with progressive zzso zzso We suggest that the presence in the zzso of zzso with a dominant rearranged regulatory region may be useful in the diagnosis of zzso zzso secondary to zzso zzso
