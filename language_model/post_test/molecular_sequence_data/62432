We have identified and cloned 22 human zzso zzso novel members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the identified proteins contain all structural features characteristic of these zzso zzso whereas four of them have been classified as zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that the identified zzso are broadly and zzso distributed in human zzso some of them being especially abundant in skeletal muscle or zzso zzso studies performed with the identified zzso revealed that at least twelve of them are zzso zzso based on their ability to cleave zzso from a zzso fusion zzso These results provide additional evidence of the extreme complexity and diversity of the zzso zzso system in human zzso and open the possibility to explore the relevance of their multiple components in the regulation of zzso pathways in normal and pathological zzso
