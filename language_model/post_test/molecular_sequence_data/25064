Four zzso zzso per zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso taken from 55 zzso apparently healthy zzso were identified by electron zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso A zzso fragment, zzso part of region B, all of regions C, D, and E and part of region F of the zzso zzso protein zzso was amplified from each isolate by zzso and cloned for sequence zzso zzso acid sequence comparison of these regions revealed significant sequence divergence from the zzso vaccine strain within regions C, zzso and zzso The zzso region E of the four Florida zzso and the zzso isolate contained three fewer zzso acids than the commonly used zzso vaccine zzso This work provides support to the idea that currently circulating zzso strains may differ substantially from presently used vaccine zzso
