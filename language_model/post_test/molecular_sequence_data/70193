The zzso zzso zzso is a rapidly turning over zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso h in zzso target zzso zzso analysis of the human zzso reveals a putative zzso zzso sequences rich in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso F domain of the zzso Since zzso sequences have been implicated in the rapid turnover of some zzso we have used zzso zzso to investigate the role of the F region containing zzso zzso in the stability and zzso of the zzso A truncated form of zzso lacking the last 41 zzso acids of the protein and encompassing the zzso sequences zzso acids 555 to zzso was made by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso experiments, involving zzso of zzso labeled receptors or of receptors zzso labeled with tamoxifen zzso followed by gel zzso were used to determine the zzso of the zzso and truncated zzso These experiments showed that the turnover rate of the receptors expressed in Chinese zzso zzso and monkey kidney zzso cells was 3 to 5 h and that elimination of the zzso zzso did not have a significant effect on the degradation rate of the zzso Moreover, deletion of the last 41 zzso acids zzso zzso of the zzso did not affect zzso ability, zzso binding zzso or the zzso pattern of the zzso zzso the role of domain F in zzso function remains zzso but it is not a zzso of the relatively rapid rate of zzso turnover in zzso
