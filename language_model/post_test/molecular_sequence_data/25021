zzso and Becker muscular zzso zzso are caused by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of patients have large zzso deletions or zzso and the remaining one-third have point zzso small deletions or zzso Point zzso are more difficult to detect due to the enormous size zzso zzso of the gene and its large transcript zzso zzso In the present study, a total of 50 DNA samples from unrelated zzso zzso zzso and 12 zzso patients who did not show zzso deletions by multiplex zzso were analyzed for detection of point zzso Single stranded zzso analysis and zzso analysis observed zzso mobility shifts in one zzso and two zzso and zzso patients, zzso The mobility shift and zzso were observed in zzso 17 in all of the three zzso zzso of the amplified zzso products revealed a zzso change zzso g to zzso in the zzso region in two of the patients while a zzso substitution in the zzso region in zzso zzso database search for zzso zzso showed the zzso substitution in the zzso region as a novel change in the human zzso zzso which was not reported zzso It resulted in an zzso acid transition from zzso to zzso in the zzso position of the zzso zzso This novel substitution has been included in the zzso database of zzso muscular zzso pages zzso in the rare zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso with the disease zzso in the family suggesting that it can be directly used for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis without identification of disease causing zzso
