zzso populations were isolated and characterized from an alkaline groundwater environment generated by active zzso which results in a zzso extremely diluted groundwater with pH zzso One hundred zzso strains were isolated in different media at different pH values during two sampling zzso To assess the degree of diversity present in the environment and to select representative strains for further characterization of the zzso we screened the zzso by using random amplified zzso zzso profiles and grouped them based on similarities determined by fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso content, zzso analyses by direct sequencing of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of pH tolerance were performed with the selected zzso Although 38 different populations were identified and zzso the vast majority of the zzso were gram positive with high zzso contents and were affiliated with three distinct groups, zzso strains closely related to the species zzso zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso lineages zzso of the zzso and to the type strain of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Other zzso were zzso related to strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Only five zzso were gram zzso one was related to the zzso lineage and the other four were related to the zzso zzso Despite the pH of the environment, the vast majority of the populations were zzso tolerant, and only two strains were able to grow at pH zzso
