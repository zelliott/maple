The Growth hormone zzso growth factor zzso system promotes embryonic growth in higher zzso Such a system exists in zzso but exhibits an additional level of complexity resulting from a recent whole zzso zzso Thus, two zzso zzso genes are present in the trout zzso Although the two zzso genes are similar, the possibility remains that the two genes have evolved zzso acquiring a distinct expression zzso In this study, using whole mounted in zzso zzso we observed a one stage delay between the appearance of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso soon after zzso formation zzso zzso In addition, by double in zzso zzso we clearly evidenced two types of zzso one expressing only zzso and the other type both zzso and zzso at Stage zzso zzso at this stage more cells expressed zzso than zzso as confirmed by quantitative zzso However at zzso as in adult, the difference between the expression of the two zzso genes was no longer zzso In addition, our zzso studies did not show any delay between the expression of the zzso and its translation as a protein at Stage zzso A comparison of the expression pattern of the zzso system components zzso zzso and the zzso type I) determined by real time zzso have shown an IGF-1 zzso increase zzso to the appearance of zzso zzso On the whole, our results demonstrate a differential regulation of zzso and zzso genes in rainbow trout zzso The relationship observed between the expression of different component of the zzso system seems to indicate that this system could be functional early on during embryonic zzso
