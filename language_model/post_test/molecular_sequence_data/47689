zzso is required for the organization and function of the zzso machinery of zzso In order to understand more precisely the molecular mechanisms by which zzso might contribute to the formation and maintenance of the zzso apparatus within muscle cells, we performed a screen to identify novel zzso binding partners present in chicken smooth muscle zzso In this paper, we report the zzso zzso and characterization of a zzso smooth muscle protein zzso that interacts with zzso Using a variety of in zzso binding zzso we demonstrate that the association between zzso and zzso is zzso specific, and zzso and exhibits a moderate zzso Furthermore, native zzso reveals that the two proteins are zzso in zzso zzso is expressed in cardiac muscle and zzso enriched in smooth zzso Interestingly, in skeletal muscle, a closely related protein of 40 zzso zzso is zzso The expression of zzso and zzso is dramatically zzso during smooth and skeletal muscle zzso respectively, and zzso zzso with zzso at the zzso of differentiated zzso We have established the relationship between zzso and zzso by molecular cloning of zzso that zzso both proteins and have determined that they are the products of a single zzso Both proteins display an identical zzso zzso domain and an identical zzso zzso zzso an internal zzso acid sequence present in zzso is replaced by a unique zzso acid sequence in zzso Analysis of the sequences of zzso and zzso suggest that they are the avian forms of the zzso zzso proteins zzso recently described in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1997) zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso The expression of the human zzso gene has been zzso to be affected by zzso that cause zzso muscular zzso thus, the characterization of zzso function may ultimately provide insight into the mechanism of this zzso
