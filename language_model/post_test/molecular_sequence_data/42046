The broad host range of zzso zzso zzso is based mainly on its ability to zzso a family of zzso zzso zzso To monitor zzso zzso we used the small seeded zzso zzso zzso which responds evenly and consistently to zzso zzso At zzso between approximately equal to zzso M and zzso M, this response takes the form of deformation of the root zzso Higher zzso zzso equal to zzso to zzso zzso provoked profound zzso zzso type zzso of the root zzso Similar zzso of zzso factors of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also provoked marked zzso of the root zzso but the latter two species are unable to zzso zzso On the other hand, plant hormones, zzso zzso zzso of hormone action, as well as zzso of zzso factors were without effect in this zzso We thus conclude that only zzso factors are capable of inducing zzso crook type zzso of zzso root zzso zzso in the zzso balance induced zzso zzso on zzso zzso as did zzso factors at zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso factors zzso gave rise to plants that slowly zzso showing that the zzso factors permitted entry of the zzso zzso into the zzso
