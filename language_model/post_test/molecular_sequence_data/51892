Through zzso detection screens we have isolated and cloned an essential gene that is expressed in the zzso precursors and their daughter cells in the zzso embryonic peripheral nervous system zzso The gene is named couch potato zzso because several partial zzso zzso cause zzso behavior in zzso Here, we present evidence that the structure of the zzso locus is unusually zzso It spans zzso 100 zzso encodes three different messages, is zzso zzso lacks an zzso initiation zzso and may zzso three different zzso Two putative zzso proteins contain similar but zzso zzso zzso that are most zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso embryonic lethal abnormal vision zzso gene and a human brain protein that has been implicated in a zzso sensory zzso zzso zzso raised against a fusion protein zzso zzso to the zzso zzso studies demonstrate that the zzso and zzso genes are required for proper expression of zzso in the zzso but not in other cells that express zzso On the basis of our zzso we present a model in which zzso is controlled by genes that determine cells to become zzso zzso zzso in turn, may control the processing of zzso molecules required for the proper functioning of the zzso
