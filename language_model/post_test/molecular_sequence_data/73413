A zzso zzso strain, which produces a zzso zzso zzso II zzso as a mixture of two biologically active molecules zzso and zzso was genetically engineered to produce exclusively zzso The zzso zzso which zzso a zzso zzso that performs zzso of the precursor zzso to the final product zzso were integrated in the zzso of zzso zzso using an zzso zzso of the zzso genetic element from zzso zzso zzso was due to zzso zzso at the zzso site of zzso zzso and no zzso zzso at the zzso locus was zzso The zzso site of zzso zzso was zzso and found to overlap the 3' end of a zzso zzso The zzso were stable in industrial conditions of zzso production and showed no decrease in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed a constant production of the zzso zzso in the overall zzso process due to expression of the cloned zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso This allows the complete conversion of the zzso form into zzso
