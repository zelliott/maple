To zzso the gene frequency of zzso zzso zzso and its association with zzso class II zzso in patients with systemic lupus zzso in zzso 

We investigated the gene frequency of the zzso zzso using DNA obtained from peripheral zzso cells in 141 healthy controls and in 58 patients with zzso The zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso were studied by zzso zzso A portion of zzso zzso zzso was amplified by zzso and its products were zzso with zzso restriction zzso The zzso samples of amplified DNA were analyzed by zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified according to zzso fragments on zzso restriction site in the first zzso of the zzso zzso The generic types of zzso were also determined by zzso with sequence specific zzso using zzso DNA from the same zzso 

The zzso frequency of zzso zzso was significantly increased in patients with zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The frequency of zzso was also significantly increased in patients zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, the increased frequency of zzso zzso was apparently increased in zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso whereas the significance of zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that genetic predisposition of zzso zzso is another risk factor in Korean zzso especially in zzso negative zzso In addition, zzso zzso could have a tendency for the development of zzso in patients with zzso
