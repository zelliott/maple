In the human T cell zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso variable zzso genes belonging to four zzso have been identified upstream of two constant region zzso zzso Three joining zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been localized upstream of zzso and two others, zzso and zzso upstream of zzso In this report, we demonstrate that a unique zzso I zzso of 120 zzso zzso contains the zzso zzso genes and that the zzso of that zzso in zzso gel zzso zzso allows linkage of the variable region to the constant region zzso We also show that the variable and the constant regions are remarkably close to each other since the distance between zzso the most 3' V gamma zzso and zzso the most zzso J gamma segment, is only 16 zzso With its 14 V gamma zzso spanning 100 zzso the two C gamma genes and 5 joining segments covering less than 40 zzso and only 16 zzso separating the most 3' V gene from the most zzso J segment, the human zzso locus spans 160 zzso of zzso DNA and represents a particularly condensed locus compared to the other rearranging gene zzso
