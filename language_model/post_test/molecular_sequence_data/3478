During the course of a random sequencing project of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have identified sequences that were repeated in the zzso and that matched the reverse zzso zzso sequence of zzso terminal repeat zzso zzso Extension of sequencing on each side of this zone of zzso allowed the definition of an element over 6 zzso zzso The conceptual translation of this sequence revealed two open reading frames zzso that displayed several characteristics of zzso zzso a zzso motif in the zzso an zzso zzso a central zzso and a zzso zinc finger domain in the zzso We called this element zzso (for zzso zzso zzso A total of 19 distinct repeats carrying the 3' untranslated region zzso and all ending with a zzso tail were zzso Most of them were very short, 17 being zzso zzso long or zzso The number of copies of zzso was estimated to be around 100 if these short repeats are zzso zzso No zzso zzso was clearly identified, indicating that entire and therefore active elements might be very rare in the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso does not seem to have any zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso domain zzso placed zzso within the zzso zzso It forms a zzso group with the zzso zzso zzso discovered in another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons showed that zzso of zzso is closely related to that of the slime mold zzso zzso zzso family, zzso
