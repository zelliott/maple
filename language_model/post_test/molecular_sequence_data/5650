Most DNA repair mechanisms rely on the redundant information inherent to the duplex to remove damaged zzso and replace them with normal ones, using the complementary strand as a zzso zzso zzso pose a unique challenge to the DNA repair machinery because both strands are zzso To study the repair of zzso zzso by zzso cells, we tested the activities of cell extracts of zzso or zzso zzso zzso cell lines and of zzso human zzso zzso on a duplex with a zzso zzso We found that in contrast to zzso which are removed by dual incisions zzso the zzso the zzso causes dual zzso both zzso to the zzso in one of the two zzso The net result is the generation of a zzso to zzso gap immediately zzso to the zzso This gap may act as a zzso signal to initiate zzso zzso
