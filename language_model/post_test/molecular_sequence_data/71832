The zzso gene is required for zzso repair of zzso DNA and is an important component of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene generate the zzso syndrome, zzso zzso zzso syndrome, and zzso zzso has a zzso to zzso activity and is a component of the zzso zzso factor, which is essential for zzso zzso II zzso We present here the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso encodes a product that is highly related to its human zzso The zzso protein is ubiquitous during zzso In zzso at the zzso zzso stage, zzso is zzso At the onset of zzso in zzso cells and during zzso in germ cells, zzso moves to the zzso Distribution analysis in zzso zzso shows that zzso is highly concentrated in the zzso especially in the highly transcribed regions known as zzso zzso zzso of zzso larvae zzso an increase in the signal intensity and in the number of sites where the zzso protein is located in zzso zzso indicating that the zzso protein is recruited zzso in the zzso as a response to DNA zzso This is the first time that the response to DNA damage by zzso zzso can be zzso directly on the zzso using one of the zzso zzso
