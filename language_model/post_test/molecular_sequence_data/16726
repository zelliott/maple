zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes plays an important role in generating zzso zzso The frequency of zzso zzso appears to vary throughout zzso However, this process has been difficult to study in zzso because the DNA in and around rearranged V genes zzso random zzso causing silent or replacement zzso zzso we have developed a transgenic mouse model for studying the frequency of B cells exhibiting zzso in young and old zzso The system is based on a reporter zzso zzso that encodes a zzso zzso heavy chain composed of a zzso zzso segment and a human zzso constant zzso The zzso has been zzso to contain a zzso stop zzso in the D zzso zzso the zzso is transcribed but not zzso Point zzso of the stop zzso results in expression of the zzso H chain, which is readily detected as human zzso zzso In zzso we found that the zzso zzso spontaneous reverse zzso zzso at a low zzso Treatment of zzso mice with zzso greatly increases the frequency of zzso zzso The observed zzso frequency in zzso mice increases with age until adulthood, then zzso and finally declines in aged zzso The zzso in the stop zzso were associated with increased zzso DNA breaks zzso within and around the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the rate of frequency of spontaneous reverse zzso is very low in zzso yet it is significantly increased after stimulation with zzso zzso The frequency of point zzso is age dependent and zzso with increased zzso
