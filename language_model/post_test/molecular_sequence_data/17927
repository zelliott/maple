In the zzso zzso regulate the expression of zzso the intermediate filament proteins of zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso regulatory regions of four human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and engineered zzso in which these regions drive the expression of the zzso reporter zzso By zzso the zzso into zzso cells along with the zzso expressing nuclear receptors for zzso acid zzso and zzso hormone, we have demonstrated that the receptors can suppress the promoters of zzso zzso The suppression is zzso zzso it is evident both in established cell lines and in primary cultures of zzso zzso The three zzso receptors have similar effects on zzso gene zzso Our data indicate that the nuclear receptors for zzso and zzso hormone regulate zzso synthesis by binding to negative recognition elements in the upstream DNA sequences of the zzso zzso zzso thus has a twofold effect on zzso zzso expression: zzso it regulates the regulators that effect the switch from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso it determines the level of zzso synthesis within the cell by direct interaction of its receptors with the zzso gene zzso
