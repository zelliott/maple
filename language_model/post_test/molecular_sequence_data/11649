We have zzso a DNA zzso zzso zzso from early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso DNA binding protein zzso over two zzso steps, however, the proteins can be separated by their different native molecular weight, with zzso zzso activity zzso with a zzso of approximately 200 zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso needs zzso zzso and zzso zzso for displacement zzso It is very salt sensitive, having a zzso optimum of zzso zzso and being inhibited by zzso concentration zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso moves zzso on the DNA strand to which it is zzso zzso activity decreases with increasing length of the zzso region suggesting a zzso mode of zzso However, addition of zzso to the displacement reaction stimulates the activity on zzso with zzso zzso zzso region suggesting a specific interaction between these two zzso
