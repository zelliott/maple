A zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso on zzso from the zzso of oyster zzso zzso The apparent molecular weight estimated from zzso was zzso 28 zzso The pH optimum of the zzso was zzso The zzso released zzso from zzso in the order of zzso zzso and zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso was determined, mostly by analyzing the peptides generated by zzso zzso or zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The molecular weight of the protein zzso of zzso zzso deduced from the sequence was zzso The sequence of zzso zzso contained two typical zzso zzso in segments common to the active site of zzso zzso family zzso The locations of six half zzso zzso among eight were almost zzso on those of four known plant zzso of zzso zzso zzso The sequence zzso between zzso zzso and five zzso and four plant zzso amount, to zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso part of zzso zzso is more similar to those of plant zzso than to those of zzso zzso This zzso is the first zzso zzso family zzso from zzso whose primary structure has been zzso
