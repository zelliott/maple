The major high molecular weight, zzso zzso cell surface zzso of cultured rat retinal zzso zzso zzso cells were partially zzso One zzso zzso mapping by the Cleveland method showed that the zzso chains of these proteins were not highly related in zzso zzso of zzso into these zzso was equivalent for normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of the zzso from either normal or zzso zzso with zzso H zzso zzso did not cause a shift in their zzso as determined by zzso zzso These results suggest that the high Mr zzso do not contain a large quantity of zzso zzso containing core type zzso zzso in either normal or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso labeled zzso with zzso zzso F zzso zzso demonstrated that at least zzso of the zzso incorporated into these zzso is in zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso treatment showed that at least zzso of the zzso is located in more terminal positions zzso to the zzso that is found in alpha zzso linkage to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Overall, these results support the hypothesis that if the zzso zzso possesses a zzso in zzso processing, then this zzso affects terminal processing of zzso and addition of terminally located zzso zzso A zzso group of high zzso zzso zzso was found in plasma zzso from cultured monkey zzso suggesting zzso they may be common to other zzso
