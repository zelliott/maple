zzso of the octopus lens is related to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of elephant zzso zzso zzso and Kim, zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso Only very low amounts of zzso are present in the zzso zzso Here, we have cloned zzso zzso of the octopus zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso from these species are zzso identical to each other, zzso identical to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso (which are zzso identical to each zzso and zzso identical to zzso coli and spinach zzso These data are consistent with the idea that the zzso gene zzso in zzso occurred after divergence of zzso from the line giving rise to zzso but before the separation of zzso and zzso Southern zzso zzso indicated that zzso is zzso by few genes zzso just one) in octopus and zzso Northern zzso zzso revealed two bands zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the octopus lens and one band zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in numerous zzso zzso of octopus and squid, suggesting zzso expression of this zzso Finally, extracts of the octopus lens had no zzso zzso activity using different zzso consistent with zzso having no zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso evolved by zzso of an ancestral gene zzso zzso and subsequently specialized for refraction in the transparent lens while losing zzso activity and expression in other zzso
