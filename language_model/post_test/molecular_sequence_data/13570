zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso laser zzso mass zzso were obtained by spontaneous fragmentation on a magnetic sector mass zzso by zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso instrument and by zzso zzso on a magnetic sector instrument fitted with an zzso zzso zzso fragmentation on the magnetic sector instrument produced zzso mainly by zzso zzso together with two abundant zzso formed by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were similar, the majority of zzso being formed by zzso zzso Internal zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recorded with the zzso zzso differed considerably from the other types of zzso particularly in the appearance of major zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso of most of the constituent zzso zzso These zzso allowed much sequence and branching information to be obtained from the zzso
