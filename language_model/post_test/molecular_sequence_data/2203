The zzso zzso locus encodes a zzso protein which possesses the zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities and which zzso the first two reactions of the zzso zzso We report here the zzso sequence of the central and the 3' region of this zzso The latter encodes that part of the zzso protein which has the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows a high degree of zzso with the known zzso zzso of various organisms from zzso coli to zzso The zzso acid zzso that have been shown to be involved in the zzso site of the zzso coli zzso are all zzso suggesting that, in the more complex structure of the zzso zzso the zzso sites are also located at zzso zzso There is also an important conservation of the zzso acid pairs that, in zzso coli, are implicated in zzso and zzso zzso As well as the zzso structure suggested by these two features, the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso must also be organized to account for the channeling of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso site to that of zzso zzso and for the zzso feedback zzso of the two activities by the end product zzso The zzso gene product was shown to be localized in the zzso With the aim of identifying the regions that may be involved in this zzso we have determined by electron zzso the zzso distribution of zzso zzso in three strains expressing different fragments of the zzso zzso In the first strain the protein lacks 190 zzso at the N zzso but accumulates normally in the zzso In the second strain the protein lacks 382 zzso in the central part and seems impaired in the nuclear transport zzso In the third strain the zzso protein zzso by the 3' region of zzso locus and catalyzing the zzso zzso reaction is able by itself to migrate to and accumulate in the zzso This suggests that two regions are involved in the nuclear zzso On the basis of their conservation in analogous proteins of other zzso and their similarity to sequences already identified as nuclear location signals, a sequence in the central region of the protein and two short sequences in the zzso region are good candidates for the nuclear location signal involved in the targeting of the zzso zzso
