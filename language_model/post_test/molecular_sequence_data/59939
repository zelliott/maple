zzso zzso was previously cloned as a zzso outgrowth factor from a zzso of mouse and rat cells, zzso To clarify the detailed function and tissue distribution of this zzso zzso sequences of rat and mouse were zzso The cloned sequences had no zzso with known zzso and was designated as zzso A predicted open reading frame of rat zzso was zzso into human zzso zzso The zzso protein was distributed in zzso and zzso and caused an increase in the levels of zzso associated zzso but not that of zzso zzso The percentage of cells with zzso the length of zzso and the number of zzso per cell were increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso was brain zzso These results suggest that an increase in zzso promotes zzso zzso
