The zzso relationships amongst zzso remain poorly zzso despite a rich history of zzso examination and numerous molecular zzso studies of small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We address this question using two zzso zzso the zzso zzso of heat shock protein 90 zzso and heat shock protein 70 zzso For both proteins we examined sequences from the three primary groups within zzso zzso zzso and zzso and from their close relatives, zzso zzso likelihood zzso and zzso distance analyses of these proteins support a close relationship between zzso and zzso to the exclusion of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso and combined protein analyses zzso support is very strong and alternative zzso are generally rejected by zzso zzso zzso zzso This result is consistent with recent molecular biological and zzso data, but contradicts early structural accounts and many zzso zzso analyses that zzso a closer relationship between zzso and zzso However, a zzso of an important zzso zzso data set highlights the instability of the zzso from this zzso The protein analyses also suggest that zzso are zzso with zzso grouping with zzso 2' and zzso 3' zzso to the exclusion of zzso zzso zzso
