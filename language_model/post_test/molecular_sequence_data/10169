zzso clones containing the zzso zzso gene from the gypsy zzso were isolated from two zzso libraries and zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso region of the gypsy zzso zzso was determined which included a zzso zzso region upstream from the zzso initiation site and zzso zzso region downstream from the transcribed zzso zzso extension analysis was performed to identify the zzso initiation zzso Gene sequence confirmed the sequence of zzso recently reported zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1997) zzso and indicated that the gypsy zzso zzso gene contains seven zzso interrupted by six zzso zzso analysis of the promoter region revealed presence of several motifs associated with zzso and zzso regulated genes in other zzso The zzso sequence comparison analyses showed that the gypsy zzso zzso gene had considerably similarity with the zzso zzso zzso gene but not with those from zzso zzso and Aedes zzso
