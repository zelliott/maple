The large zzso zzso of the zzso DNA repeat of zzso zzso and zzso and a closely related zzso zzso was zzso amplified via the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso length zzso were found among the lines investigated and used to zzso zzso zzso More zzso was observed toward the zzso end than toward the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso data were used to assemble a zzso tree for the zzso zzso Based on the zzso data three black zzso species zzso differed by approximately zzso zzso and zzso respectively, from all other zzso in the zzso examined in this zzso zzso zzso used as an zzso had approximately zzso difference from all members of the zzso In some cases more genetic variation was observed zzso than between putative zzso Additionally, the hypothesis that zzso is composed of only a few zzso three) zzso species was supported by our zzso
