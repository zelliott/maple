In zzso significant onset of growth hormone zzso zzso expression occurs only after birth zzso in the human, zzso zzso and protein are widely manifest from the first zzso of fetal zzso Thus, it is likely that zzso are not the best models for studying regulation of human zzso gene transcription, especially during early stages in zzso Here we have explored the potential of the zzso as a more appropriate zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned from zzso liver by reverse zzso zzso using human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso precursor protein has an identical signal zzso sequence to that of human and zzso monkey zzso and the mature zzso zzso is also zzso zzso acids long, with zzso and zzso zzso acid identity to the human and zzso monkey receptors zzso Previous studies in the human have identified eight zzso untranslated region zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso numbered according to their relative zzso We cloned the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso these zzso have a high degree zzso of sequence identity with their human counterparts and also diverge at an identical point, 12 zzso upstream of the start of zzso The expression pattern of these three zzso zzso zzso in zzso liver during development was zzso Strong expression of zzso zzso and zzso was evident by 49 days of zzso life zzso 49 days and adult zzso zzso very low levels of zzso but not zzso were observed in younger animals zzso 6 and 30 zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in all fetal zzso zzso days zzso and zzso zzso zzso days and adult zzso zzso zzso specimens zzso Analysis of zzso kidney and lung zzso 19 and zzso zzso revealed that zzso transcripts are present in these zzso but not zzso and zzso Together, these data demonstrate that, as in the human, zzso zzso and zzso expression is zzso regulated and tissue specific, while the zzso zzso is more widely zzso zzso it is likely that the regulatory regions of the zzso and human zzso genes are well zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso is an appropriate animal model in which to define the mechanisms regulating zzso gene zzso during zzso zzso
