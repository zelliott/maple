Human zzso is a zzso zzso expressed in various zzso and zzso Several biological functions have been proposed for this zzso Among others, zzso of nucleation and growth of zzso zzso in the zzso and bacterial zzso has retained attention, because zzso presents high sequence similarities with zzso (or zzso zzso To study its zzso relationship and compare it with that of zzso zzso we have built a model for zzso This model is derived from the only two zzso zzso of known zzso rat zzso binding protein and human zzso An original strategy, inspired by that proposed by zzso and Snow, was designed for model zzso We have undertaken zzso studies on the natural zzso Although complete structure determination has not yet been zzso the zzso studies did confirm the main characteristics of the zzso From analysis of the proposed model, we concluded that zzso is not expected to present zzso or zzso zzso zzso the mechanisms of bacterial zzso and zzso of zzso nucleation and growth have not yet been zzso
