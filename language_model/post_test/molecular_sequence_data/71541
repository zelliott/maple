A new zzso gene (named zzso was isolated from a strain of the white rot zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso open reading frame, containing two zzso encodes a zzso of 526 zzso acids zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was induced by various zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was abolished when cells were cultivated in media containing the above cellulosic zzso but added with zzso zzso or zzso while addition of zzso or zzso did not affect the zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso domain of the zzso protein was zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso belonging to family 7 of the zzso zzso A zzso study showed that these zzso zzso can be clearly separated from family 7 zzso zzso
