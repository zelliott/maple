The zzso zzso and basic zzso growth factors zzso zzso and their receptors in the bovine zzso are zzso By means of western zzso analysis one 18 zzso zzso and two zzso proteins (16 and 18 zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso Different zzso of these two growth factors could be measured in zzso zzso during the zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein were significantly higher at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than during the zzso phase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were higher at the zzso stage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than at the zzso stage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso indicated that these growth factors were localized mainly in zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the bovine zzso zzso zzso was partly zzso zzso of zzso by an zzso zzso zzso showed that expression of zzso and zzso was different during the zzso cycle, indicating that the regulation of zzso is separate from that of zzso Only zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be detected in zzso complexes by reverse zzso zzso In zzso the components of the zzso system were found in the bovine zzso suggesting an zzso or zzso regulation involving zzso cells and zzso zzso
