zzso of designing zzso acids capable of specific complex formation with arbitrary zzso zzso and zzso competent zzso acids are zzso The methods rely on generation of libraries of random zzso zzso selection of molecules possessing the desired property from these libraries, and amplification of the selected zzso Repeating of the selection and amplification procedures results in zzso improvement of the zzso ability to accomplish the function under zzso This molecular evolution approach opens up broad possibilities for investigation of mechanisms of molecular recognition of small zzso and zzso by zzso acids and mechanisms of reactions zzso by zzso Design of novel zzso and zzso acids capable of specific binding to certain zzso may become an efficient approach for development of practically important compounds, biologically active compounds and affinity zzso
