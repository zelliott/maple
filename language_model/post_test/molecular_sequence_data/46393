Recent genetic epidemiology studies have been dominated by zzso association zzso studies using single zzso zzso zzso However, a form of structural zzso variation, termed copy number variation zzso is also widespread throughout the human zzso and can be highly zzso between zzso Such variation has long been zzso through candidate gene studies using zzso molecular biology techniques, to have direct consequences on human health and zzso Many studies have now sought to extensively zzso this variation on a zzso scale and, zzso attempts are being made to identify associations between zzso and human zzso Although many of the study design issues that have been described for zzso zzso studies are also relevant for zzso zzso studies, zzso studies also present their own unique set of challenges and zzso New zzso technologies are enabling more accurate mapping of zzso and zzso maps of the human zzso are being regularly refined with increasing zzso The study of zzso and its effects on human health and disease therefore present a dynamic and exciting challenge for researchers in the field of genetic zzso
