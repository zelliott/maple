The zzso of zzso light chain zzso zzso enhances smooth muscle contraction at a constant zzso There are two zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso thought to be responsible for the zzso of zzso by external zzso The zzso of zzso at zzso and of zzso at zzso zzso the zzso activity in zzso Here we determined the changes in the zzso of zzso and zzso after zzso stimulation in intact as well as zzso smooth muscle strips using zzso zzso as zzso The zzso zzso zzso increased after zzso stimulation in both zzso zzso and intact zzso The time course of the increase in zzso zzso after stimulation correlated with the increase in zzso regulatory light chain zzso zzso The increase in zzso zzso was significantly diminished by zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso a protein zzso C zzso suggesting that both the protein zzso C and zzso zzso pathways influence the change in zzso zzso On the other hand, a significant level of zzso zzso at zzso an zzso site, was observed in the resting state for both zzso and intact zzso and the zzso stimulation did not significantly alter the zzso zzso level at zzso While the removal of the zzso markedly decreased zzso zzso and induced relaxation, the zzso of zzso was zzso while zzso zzso markedly zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso of zzso plays a more significant role in the zzso increase in zzso zzso and contraction of smooth muscle than zzso zzso in the zzso zzso mechanism of smooth muscle zzso
