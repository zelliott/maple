zzso regulators zzso control the zzso of a variety of genes associated with iron zzso in zzso zzso In this study we report the cloning of a putative zzso gene from the moderate zzso zzso zzso into the zzso expression zzso The expressed zzso zzso was zzso using immobilized metal affinity and zzso zzso and yielded approximately zzso zzso of protein per liter of zzso The zzso zzso protein binds the zzso operator sequence in the presence of zzso metal zzso Two zzso binding sites were identified in the zzso zzso zzso upstream of a putative zzso exporter and a putative zzso zzso zzso
