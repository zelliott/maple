A gene zzso a zzso with zzso to zzso zzso has been discovered in the zzso of zzso virus zzso strain zzso a zzso that zzso zzso zzso and zzso The predicted zzso sequence shows high levels of zzso acid identity to zzso of sheep zzso cattle zzso humans zzso and mice zzso as well as zzso proteins of zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso region, zzso two-thirds of the zzso zzso is identical to zzso zzso which suggests that this gene has been captured from its host sheep during the evolution of zzso The zzso gene is transcribed zzso zzso medium from zzso cells zzso with a zzso expression zzso containing the zzso zzso gene showed the same biological activity as zzso zzso in a zzso zzso proliferation zzso zzso zzso is likely to be important in immune evasion by zzso since zzso is a zzso zzso that has zzso effects on zzso immunity and zzso zzso zzso
