The three-dimensional zzso structures and the states of order of the zzso chains of zzso A from different zzso species were investigated at 40 degrees C, high water content zzso and different zzso zzso zzso ratios using zzso radiation X-ray zzso and zzso infrared zzso zzso were made on free zzso A from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as those from the zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Parallel to differences in their chemical primary structure, the structural zzso and states of order at 37 degrees C of the zzso zzso A were found to be different from those of zzso zzso zzso A clear correlation between the zzso structure and previously determined biological activities was zzso zzso A with a strong preference for zzso structures zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso inactive and lack zzso zzso the compounds assuming a mixed zzso structure zzso zzso A from zzso zzso are of lower toxicity in zzso but may induce zzso in zzso those zzso A with a strong tendency to form zzso zzso structures zzso A from zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibit full zzso in zzso and in zzso In contrast, zzso activity is most pronounced for compounds with zzso and least expressed for those with zzso zzso The states of order at 37 degrees C vary zzso exhibiting the highest values for zzso A of zzso zzso and the lowest for that of zzso zzso We propose to extend the term zzso zzso which is used to describe the zzso of a single zzso A zzso required for optimal triggering of biological effects, to zzso zzso zzso which denotes the particular organization of zzso A zzso in zzso zzso causing biological zzso
