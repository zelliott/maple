We zzso the zzso features of receptors for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso on blood zzso and zzso of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso of zzso were found to have a higher Mr zzso zzso than those of control zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and controls as shown by zzso zzso zzso of zzso carbohydrates from zzso zzso on zzso of zzso revealed a zzso zzso protein core, the Mr of which was still higher than that of controls zzso zzso When zzso zzso transcripts were zzso by zzso only one prominent band was zzso in zzso products from zzso zzso Since the results thus far show that zzso zzso express zzso zzso protein and zzso differently from zzso and control zzso zzso products were then cloned and zzso The zzso band in zzso products from zzso zzso was identical to that of the zzso zzso zzso transcript, and an additional 10 transcripts containing five novel transcripts were obtained from zzso and control zzso In three zzso we found an zzso sequence between the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting the existence of a new zzso These results suggest a zzso usage of zzso zzso zzso among various transcripts of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
