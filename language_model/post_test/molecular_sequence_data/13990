zzso 2 is a zzso zzso zzso found in the skin of zzso zzso zzso clawed zzso It belongs to a broad class of zzso peptides which interact directly with the zzso zzso Very little is presently known about the nature of this zzso interaction on the molecular zzso We have performed a sequence of zzso X-ray zzso experiments to provide some insight into the nature of this zzso We have found that, at zzso below the critical concentration for zzso the zzso causes the membrane thickness to decrease roughly in proportion to the zzso zzso We further show that this thinning is consistent with a model where the zzso zzso within the zzso region of the zzso zzso at these zzso The energy cost of this thinning may also explain why the zzso zzso at high zzso We have already shown that a similar interaction exists for zzso interacting with zzso and it should hold for a wide variety of zzso zzso
