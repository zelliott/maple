The zzso zzso protein of influenza virus binds to terminal zzso acid zzso present on cell surface zzso and zzso The specific zzso acids involved in this interaction have been identified for a zzso zzso zzso from the human zzso virus, zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso We were interested to examine the zzso pocket of a zzso zzso protein from the avian zzso virus zzso zzso we made zzso acid zzso at six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggested by comparison with the zzso pocket of the zzso zzso and analyzed the resulting proteins using zzso zzso zzso The use of these zzso enabled us to zzso both the ability of the zzso zzso proteins to bind with zzso cells, and also to promote zzso fusion by measuring zzso zzso Using this system, we identified a subset of zzso with impaired zzso activity and a corresponding decrease in zzso but which retained the ability to induce zzso in low pH zzso fusion zzso The most severely affected zzso contained more than one zzso with the triple zzso zzso being the most zzso These observations highlight the importance of multiple contact points for the interaction between zzso acid and zzso
