zzso with zzso in host organisms, fusion protein systems afford economical methods to obtain large quantities of target proteins in a fast and efficient zzso Some zzso used for these purposes cleave zzso to their recognition sequences and do not leave extra zzso acids on the zzso However, they are often inefficient and are frequently zzso resulting in zzso zzso of the target zzso To address these issues, we created a fusion protein system that zzso a highly efficient zzso and leaves no residual zzso acids on the target protein after removal of the affinity zzso We designed a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso with a zzso consensus zzso sequence located between the zzso zzso tag and a target zzso We show that the zzso efficiently zzso the fusion protein without leaving excess zzso acids on the target zzso In addition, we used an engineered zzso zzso that is highly stable, has increased activity relative to the zzso zzso and contains a zzso tag that allows for efficient removal of the zzso after zzso of the fusion zzso Although we have developed this system using a zzso tag, the system is amenable to any commercially available affinity zzso
