von zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso that mediates the zzso of zzso to the zzso by binding to zzso zzso zzso For human zzso this interaction can be induced in zzso by the zzso zzso or the snake zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso was identified within the proposed zzso zzso binding domain of zzso in the zzso with von zzso disease type B, a unique zzso characterized by no zzso but normal zzso binding to zzso zzso The corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso formed normal zzso and exhibited the same functional zzso as the patient's plasma zzso confirming that this zzso causes von zzso disease type zzso These data show that zzso and zzso zzso activities of zzso can be zzso by a point zzso and confirm that these zzso promote zzso binding to zzso by different zzso The normal zzso binding and the defective zzso binding of zzso suggest that the primary zzso in von zzso disease type B may be a failure of normal zzso regulation of the zzso zzso binding function of zzso
