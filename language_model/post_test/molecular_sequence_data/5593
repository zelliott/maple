Despite intensive zzso to develop effective and safe vaccines against the human zzso viruses and other zzso zzso it remains unclear whether an immune response that does not afford protection may, on the contrary, produce adverse zzso In the present study, the effect of genetic zzso with the zzso gene was examined in a natural animal model of zzso zzso infection of cats by the zzso zzso virus zzso Three groups of seven cats were zzso by intramuscular transfer of zzso zzso expressing either the zzso envelope or two envelopes bearing zzso in the principal zzso domain of the zzso zzso Upon zzso challenge, determination of plasma virus load showed that the acute phase of viral infection occurred earlier in the three groups of cats zzso with zzso envelopes than in the control zzso zzso zzso however, zzso low or zzso levels of zzso directed against envelope zzso These results suggest that zzso with the zzso zzso gene may result in enhancement of infection and that mechanisms unrelated to enhancing zzso zzso the observed zzso
