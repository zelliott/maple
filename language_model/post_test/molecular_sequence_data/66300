The development of zzso zzso often involves the zzso of cells into a zzso zzso zzso as observed in blood vessel formation in zzso and zzso development in zzso During the fusion of zzso zzso zzso fusion cells located at the tip of zzso branches contact each other and form zzso zzso cavities on opposite sides of the cells that open to connect the zzso zzso This process involves the zzso fusion of plasma zzso associated with zzso zzso Here, we studied the function of an zzso zzso small zzso zzso 3, in branch zzso zzso 3 is zzso zzso and associates with both zzso zzso and zzso In zzso 3 zzso the cell zzso of fusion cells, zzso of zzso membrane zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso proceeded zzso but the zzso cavities did not open due to the failure of zzso fusion of the plasma zzso We present evidence that the zzso 3 zzso zzso the localized assembly of the zzso complex, suggesting that the targeting of zzso machinery to specific zzso zzso is the key step in converting the plasma membrane zzso in fusion zzso
