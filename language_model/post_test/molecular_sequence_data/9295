Much of our dietary zzso of heavy metals is through the consumption of zzso A zzso strategy to reduce chronic exposure to heavy metals is to develop plant varieties with reduced zzso in edible zzso Here, we describe that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso zzso zzso was localized to zzso and enhanced tolerance to and zzso of zzso copper, zzso and zzso The action of zzso requires PC zzso and failed to zzso zzso tolerance and zzso when zzso and PC synthesis was blocked by zzso zzso or only PC synthesis is blocked in the zzso zzso which is deficient in PC zzso zzso expression enhanced zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso where only approximately zzso of the zzso in zzso was localized in zzso in contrast to the near zzso found in zzso zzso and approximately zzso in those of zzso that zzso very low amounts of zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso expression delayed zzso metal zzso and zzso expression confirmed that roots can serve as a sink to reduce metal contents in shoots and zzso These findings suggest that zzso function requires PCs in zzso and it is feasible to promote food safety by engineering plants using zzso to decrease metal zzso in edible zzso
