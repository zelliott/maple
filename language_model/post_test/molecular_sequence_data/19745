Severe zzso is a hallmark of zzso zzso To study the underlying mechanisms, we have developed a ferret model of canine distemper virus zzso The model reproduces all clinical signs of zzso but the lack of zzso zzso has limited the characterization of the cellular immune zzso zzso this, we cloned ferret zzso and established zzso real-time zzso zzso To demonstrate the utility of these zzso we compared the zzso profiles zzso by lethal and zzso strains during the zzso zzso We observed a general lack of zzso induction in animals that later succumbed to the disease, whereas survivors mounted a robust and sustained zzso The newly developed zzso zzso strengthen and expand the ferret model not only for zzso zzso studies but also for several other human respiratory viruses including influenza and zzso
