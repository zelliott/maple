zzso zzso and signatures of influenza A viruses were investigated based on the zzso protein for tracking of the zzso host of zzso Hidden zzso models zzso decision trees and zzso zzso for each influenza A virus zzso and its major hosts zzso zzso zzso were zzso Features of the zzso protein signatures that were zzso zzso were zzso zzso signatures that occurred in different zzso of the virus were zzso zzso of the zzso models based on zzso zzso and support and confidence ratings for the zzso acid zzso rules was zzso Host zzso based on the zzso zzso achieved zzso between zzso and zzso using decision trees after feature zzso zzso class association rules for zzso origins gave better support and confidence ratings, followed by human and finally zzso zzso This finding indicated the lower specificity of the zzso host, perhaps pointing to its ability to mix different zzso
