The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso is characterized by a zzso isotope effect of zzso whereas the zzso of zzso zzso shows no zzso isotope zzso The dependence of the isotope effect on the concentration of zzso in zzso for zzso II is not linear and suggests that two or more zzso are involved in its zzso zzso We propose that for zzso I the zzso step is the distortion of the zzso bond towards a zzso zzso and for zzso II a zzso change induced by the occupation of the zzso pocket in the zzso
