A full-length zzso designated as the zzso zzso disease zzso 01 zzso zzso was isolated from zzso white zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein thought to be produced by the zzso gene contains a nuclear zzso sequence zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso region, a zzso binding site zzso and a zzso repeat zzso zzso The protein also exhibits a considerable degree of zzso to zzso resistance zzso zzso quantitative zzso analysis revealed that expression of the zzso gene in zzso white zzso leaves could be induced by two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and salicylic acid zzso zzso of the zzso gene in transgenic tobacco induced enhanced resistance to tobacco mosaic virus zzso zzso resistance from the zzso gene to zzso infection was also observed in transgenic tobacco zzso Additionally, zzso of the zzso gene resulted in zzso changes in genes expressing zzso proteins in transgenic tobacco under zzso zzso These data strongly suggest that the zzso gene is involved in plant zzso responses to pathogen zzso
