The zzso zzso gene was shown to zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso By using a zzso zzso of zzso we have determined that the zzso protein is necessary for both the zzso movement of polystyrene beads on the zzso membrane and zzso transport zzso the zzso movement of zzso particles beneath the zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso Johnson, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we have correlated the presence and position of the zzso particles zzso by light zzso with that of the electron dense complexes zzso observed beneath the zzso membrane by electron zzso A role for zzso in zzso or zzso surface zzso is also strongly supported by the zzso of zzso to the region between the zzso outer zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
