zzso genes play important roles in limb zzso zzso is a recently identified zzso zzso gene whose zzso and spatial expression pattern during limb development suggests that it is a key component for specifying the identify and structure of the zzso Here we report the zzso mapping of the zzso locus in human zzso and mouse zzso Using zzso zzso analysis of zzso products amplified from a panel of zzso cell hybrid lines and two radiation hybrid zzso panels, we have physically mapped zzso to human zzso 5, closely linked to zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the Stanford zzso zzso map and to zzso and zzso on the zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso analysis of a mouse zzso zzso panel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has localized zzso to the central part of mouse zzso zzso The map position of zzso is near two mouse limb zzso zzso defined as zzso and zzso
