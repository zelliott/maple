We report, for the first time, zzso in the zzso repeat regions in the zzso of kidney tumors induced by zzso in Syrian zzso Among the 66 zzso amplified by 11 random zzso 28 zzso exhibited zzso deletions or losses or gains in intensity in the zzso of kidney tumor zzso compared with normal kidney zzso from zzso zzso Higher numbers of zzso zzso zzso were observed in the tumors of old zzso compared with young zzso In zzso and zzso zzso deletion of a zzso zzso locus amplified with primer zzso was observed in most of the female zzso but not in male zzso An zzso zzso of a zzso zzso locus amplified with primer zzso was observed in 12 of 36 zzso kidney zzso The cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso locus amplified with primer zzso revealed that it had significant sequence similarity to the mouse zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that age, sex and zzso to zzso influence zzso in the zzso repeat sequences in the zzso of zzso kidney tumors in Syrian zzso zzso zzso in zzso repeats in critical target genes may be involved in zzso zzso
