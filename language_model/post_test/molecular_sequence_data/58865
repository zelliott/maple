The zzso relationships between major slime zzso groups and the identification of their zzso relatives has been a subject of controversy for many zzso Traditionally, it has been assumed that two slime zzso groups, the zzso and the zzso were related by virtue of their cellular slime zzso zzso a view still endorsed by at least one current zzso zzso However, a decade ago, on the basis of detailed zzso zzso it was proposed that zzso of the family zzso were not relatives of other slime zzso but instead related to a group of mostly zzso zzso zzso the zzso The class zzso was created to contain these organisms and has since figured in many discussions of zzso zzso We sought to test the zzso of zzso by characterizing zzso of the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of these and other zzso zzso using maximum zzso zzso distance and maximum likelihood methods strongly supports the zzso hypothesis and zzso the concept of a cellular slime zzso zzso Moreover, all of our analyses place zzso zzso as a relatively recently originating zzso most closely related to the zzso similar to other recently published zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso do not show robust branching orders for most of the relationships between major zzso We propose that several of the zzso observed between zzso and other molecular zzso are artifacts resulting from zzso zzso of this zzso
