zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso zzso (160 zzso the zzso zzso which is processed to the zzso zzso during prolonged zzso zzso contains four zzso of 60 zzso each that do not include the zzso portion of the zzso zzso A genetically engineered zzso gene encodes a truncated zzso lacking 195 of the zzso zzso zzso four of these zzso assemble to form the zzso zzso zzso binds most strongly in zzso least in zzso The zzso zzso and its zzso zzso after extraction of zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso to zzso independent of the presence or absence of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso in contrast, do not exhibit zzso zzso The data show for the first time that a bacterial zzso has a zzso zzso activity, which depends on the presence of the zzso zzso
