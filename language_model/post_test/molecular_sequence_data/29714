zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the kidney is associated with the gamma zzso zzso zzso a zzso membrane protein that zzso zzso zzso zzso and human gamma occur in two zzso zzso zzso and zzso with different N zzso Here we investigated their structural zzso and functional effects on zzso zzso Both forms were zzso modified during in zzso translation with zzso indicating that there are four possible forms of zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso and zzso as potential sites for zzso zzso Similar modification can occur in cells, with consequences for zzso zzso We showed previously that stable zzso of zzso into zzso cells resulted in reduction of apparent affinities for zzso and zzso Individual clones differed in gamma zzso zzso however, and the effect on zzso affinity was absent in clones with full zzso Here, zzso of zzso also resulted in clones with or without zzso zzso Both groups showed a reduction in zzso zzso but modification was required for the effect on zzso zzso There were minor increases in zzso zzso The zzso importance of the reduction in zzso affinity was shown by the slower growth of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso The differential influence of the four structural zzso of gamma on affinities of the zzso for zzso and zzso together with our previous finding of different zzso of zzso and zzso along the rat zzso suggests a highly specific mode of regulation of sodium pump properties in zzso
