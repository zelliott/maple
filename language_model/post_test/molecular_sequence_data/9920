The zzso zzso zzso are a family of highly zzso zzso that degrade zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso represents one of the zzso that zzso native collagen type zzso As a basis for structural zzso the short form zzso domain, zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli as a zzso By combination of reverse zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso the truncated zzso zzso was amplified from the corresponding zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso obtained was cloned in zzso coli and zzso With the exception of one zzso inversion at position zzso zzso the zzso sequence was identical to the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso as has been previously zzso The protein was expressed in zzso coli using the zzso zzso The zzso protein was stored in inclusion bodies and extracted as a 38 zzso species from the inclusion bodies by zzso in 8 M zzso The product was zzso by affinity zzso and gel zzso zzso sequence analysis confirmed the identity with the zzso domain of zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso and yielded an active zzso with zzso zzso It degrades the native zzso collagen type IV and the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso like the full-length zzso zzso The zzso activity could be inhibited by the specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso
