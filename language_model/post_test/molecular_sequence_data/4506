The movement of zzso and other proteins to zzso is accomplished by zzso zzso zzso zzso are targeted from the zzso network via a zzso compartment to zzso The specificity of zzso transport is thought to occur through the interaction of zzso proteins with receptors on a particular target zzso The zzso are a family of zzso proteins that have been implicated as zzso receptors involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are localized to the plasma zzso and in particular, zzso zzso mediates synaptic zzso zzso in the nerve zzso zzso 5 and 6 have been localized to zzso and zzso network zzso zzso We now report the identification of zzso 7 from a human brain zzso zzso The zzso 7 gene is localized to human zzso zzso By Northern analysis, the zzso zzso was found to be broadly zzso Based on its zzso to zzso and plant zzso zzso we propose that zzso 7 has a role in zzso trafficking between the zzso complex and zzso In zzso binding studies reveal that zzso 7 binds zzso a key regulator of transport zzso fusion at multiple stages of the zzso zzso
