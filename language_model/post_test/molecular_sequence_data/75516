The influence of synthetic peptides zzso sequences in the exposed positions of the zzso region of human zzso 1 was tested on B zzso zzso zzso 2 domain peptides having an zzso effect on zzso cellular zzso as well as the whole zzso fragment, induced the appearance of the early signs of zzso on resting B zzso such as increase in cell volume and zzso zzso expression or zzso migration zzso factor zzso The peptides did not induce proliferation of resting B cells even when B cell growth factor zzso zzso were zzso Exposure to zzso fragment, however, induced a weak proliferation which was significantly enhanced by zzso On the other hand, both the zzso zzso and the zzso 2 or zzso 3 domain peptides enhanced the zzso synthesis of human blood zzso cells when a zzso dose of zzso zzso was zzso This effect was lost when zzso zzso or the peptides were added on the third day of zzso These results suggest that the early steps of B cell zzso can be induced by zzso zzso and by small molecular weight zzso zzso which are potential zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso activates B cells to the state where they respond to zzso but the peptides do not possess this zzso Furthermore, both zzso zzso and zzso peptides are able to enhance the zzso zzso when accessory cells and the appropriate zzso factors are zzso
