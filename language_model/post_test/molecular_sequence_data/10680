The three zzso crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso was compared with that of two other members of the zzso zzso family: T4 zzso H and the zzso domain of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso Though these structures were largely similar, some regions of these zzso show evidence of significant molecular zzso Previous sequence analysis had suggested the existence of a zzso motif in zzso zzso but a zzso though related structure is actually found to zzso The entire zzso zzso structure was then compared with all the structures in the complete zzso Data Bank and an unexpected similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and gamma delta zzso are zzso involved in carrying out quite different zzso on zzso zzso They appear to be unrelated at the primary sequence level, yet the fold of the entire zzso domain of gamma delta zzso is contained within that of the zzso Different large-scale zzso structures are used by both families to form DNA binding zzso
