zzso communities in zzso zzso and microbial mats of zzso Bay, Japan, were characterized using zzso zzso gene sequencing and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene isolated from these samples suggested a predominance of bacterial zzso related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso commonly found in cold zzso and zzso vents were only detected in the microbial mat zzso zzso different zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso and microbial zzso the former contained only zzso clones zzso of the total zzso zzso and the latter exclusively zzso zzso including the zzso zzso of methane zzso groups zzso and zzso Many of these lineages are as yet zzso and zzso groups of bacteria and zzso zzso fatty acid analysis suggested the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of intact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated the presence of zzso marine zzso zzso These results suggest that the microbial community in the zzso Bay zzso site is distinct from previously characterized zzso zzso
