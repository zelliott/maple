zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates a novel zzso signal zzso zzso Yet, little is known about the regulation of zzso gene expression in zzso We report the sequence and characterization of the mouse zzso locus and provide a comparison with the human and rat zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes are similar in structure and exhibit approximately zzso sequence zzso The mouse and human zzso genes contain two potential promoters producing four major zzso By analyzing 56 human zzso clones and other existing expressed sequence zzso we found that at least three protein products differing at their zzso zzso result from alternative zzso We used zzso zzso to demonstrate the presence of these zzso in zzso zzso The longest form is a zzso zzso zzso with 12 zzso repeats zzso a shorter form of zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso with 9 zzso and an zzso zzso sequence zzso An even shorter form of zzso zzso contains only 2 zzso The zzso organization of zzso appears to be highly zzso throughout zzso zzso These results provide the basis for a more detailed analysis of the significance and regulation of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso
