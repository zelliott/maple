Plants show distinct zzso in different light conditions through a process called zzso A zzso feature of zzso is the reduced growth of zzso under light conditions compared with zzso For this zzso event, the most well-known molecular mechanism involves zzso zzso of cell zzso However, it is not known whether additional pathways zzso Here, we describe a newly discovered zzso of zzso plant growth zzso by the zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein involved in cell zzso We found that light, especially blue light, suppresses growth of rice zzso by reducing the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso Both in zzso and in zzso studies showed that zzso is structurally zzso by light through zzso and by direct interaction with zzso In addition, the zzso expression of zzso is zzso regulated by different light zzso Further investigation suggested that zzso promotes cell division by recruiting a zzso system, rather than by its zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results uncover a new mechanism for zzso plant growth, zzso light not only zzso cell zzso but also suppresses cell division through zzso and zzso zzso zzso This study thus brings new insights into our understanding of plant zzso
