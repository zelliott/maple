The zzso human zzso factor, zzso zzso has been reported to possess a growth zzso motif as an zzso zzso in the zzso folded circulating form of the zzso Intermediate unfolded forms of the human zzso zzso induced by stress, zzso and high zzso zzso have revealed the presence of an encrypted zzso segment on the third domain of zzso A zzso linear synthetic zzso segment termed the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits various zzso forms with complex zzso behaviors, in which dominant zzso forms were found to be zzso in zzso of zzso zzso While several zzso acid zzso of the zzso of the zzso retained zzso activity, heavy metal binding and zzso of the peptides with a variety of zzso and hormone zzso were found to influence the outcomes of growth zzso Smaller segments of the original zzso were each found to display growth activities of their own, with the middle segment zzso also showing zzso zzso zzso Studies of zzso acid sequence identity further revealed that the zzso sequences displayed zzso matches to both zzso and zzso zzso and experimental evidence served to support these zzso That is, the zzso was capable of modulating zzso zzso cell shape, and zzso zzso phenomena reminiscent of a zzso zzso zzso studies further zzso the zzso of the zzso to zzso regions of high zzso density in the zzso Because of the involvement of the zzso in experimental models of the zzso zzso a mechanism of action is forwarded in which the linear zzso is proposed to be a zzso zzso binding zzso that is zzso across the plasma membrane via zzso zzso Thus, it was predicted that the linear zzso and possibly its zzso segments serve as decoy zzso to zzso receptors in order to gain access to the zzso compartment of the zzso
