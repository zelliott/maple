We present a patient with zzso syndrome harboring a novel zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso zzso complex was absent from the zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not detected in the zzso zzso zzso the soluble zzso fragment, was also absent in the zzso zzso analysis revealed a novel zzso zzso pair deletion in the zzso zzso zzso which was predicted to cause a frame shift and the addition of 13 altered zzso acids followed by premature zzso No zzso was found in the coding sequence of the zzso or zzso zzso We demonstrated that the novel deletion zzso resulted in complete zzso of the zzso protein and zzso expression of the entire zzso complex, and was responsible for the zzso syndrome zzso in this zzso Although the presence of a truncated zzso protein has been often zzso complete absence of the protein has been scarcely reported in zzso syndrome patients with a zzso zzso causing a premature stop zzso An underlying molecular mechanism to explain how the synthesis of a truncated protein is inhibited in selected cases remains to be zzso
