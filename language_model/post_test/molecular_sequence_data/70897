The abundance of zzso and its alpha and beta zzso zzso is zzso in cardiac and other target tissue by zzso hormone zzso Multiple zzso zzso beta 1 species zzso an identical beta 1 zzso are expressed in the zzso The different zzso beta 1 species result from zzso of two zzso zzso in the first zzso and multiple zzso zzso signals in the terminal zzso of the beta 1 zzso In the present study we identify the zzso beta 1 species that are expressed in rat zzso zzso under zzso conditions, and determine whether they are zzso regulated by zzso zzso beta 1 species were identified by zzso followed by DNA sequencing, and by Northern zzso using zzso derived from different regions of rat zzso beta zzso Five zzso beta 1 species are expressed in rat zzso zzso beta 1 species that are initiated at the first zzso zzso and end at the first, second and fifth zzso sites zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso beta 1 species initiated at the second zzso zzso and ending at the second and fifth zzso sites zzso in zzso of 1500 and zzso zzso in order of increasing zzso the five zzso constitute zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of total zzso beta 1 zzso In zzso rats zzso by addition of zzso to the drinking water for 3 weeks), total zzso beta 1 content decreased to zzso zzso levels, which was associated with a disproportionate zzso decrease in the abundance of the longest transcript zzso zzso zzso transcripts initiating at the first zzso zzso and ending at the second zzso signal in zzso hearts were zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by injection of normal rats with three doses of 100 zzso zzso g body weight every 48 h resulted in an overall approximately zzso increase in zzso beta 1 content with no change in the fractional contribution of any of the zzso beta 1 zzso The results indicate a complex zzso in the expression of zzso beta 1 in zzso
