zzso zzso is a zzso acid zzso containing three zzso bonds isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso which is a selective zzso of zzso sodium channel zzso zzso and has a long-lasting zzso zzso Drug development of zzso has long been hindered over 15 years by difficult chemical synthesis and zzso zzso zzso we describe a different approach based on the zzso expression of gene zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso fused with zzso leader signal zzso and zzso was constructed, which was transformed into zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was successfully expressed and zzso into the zzso space of zzso zzso zzso The zzso leader signal zzso was properly zzso and three zzso bonds were also formed properly to yield biological active zzso zzso zzso in the zzso fraction was isolated with a zzso affinity column, which was further zzso using zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso and identified by liquid zzso zzso zzso of flight mass zzso zzso Biological activity zzso of zzso showed it had good zzso effects in three pain zzso
