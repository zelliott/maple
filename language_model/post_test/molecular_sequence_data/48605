A survey of the zzso zzso of Australian marine zzso revealed the presence of three previously zzso species of zzso zzso zzso from sites off Southeast Queensland, off zzso Island on the Great zzso zzso Queensland, and from zzso Bay in Western zzso zzso data zzso polar capsule and zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso and maximum likelihood analyses of small zzso zzso and large zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso were used for species identification and to explore relationships among these zzso The four species of zzso for which DNA data are now available for comparative purposes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso formed a zzso zzso sister zzso to the other major zzso group, the zzso The combined zzso and genetic diagnostic approach identified an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the muscle of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso off the Southeast zzso coast and in zzso zzso and zzso zzso off zzso zzso zzso variation within zzso zzso zzso zzso varied from 2-4 zzso zzso over the zzso region to zzso zzso over the zzso zzso zzso variation between zzso zzso zzso zzso and the other three species for which genetic sequence data are now available ranged from zzso zzso zzso over the zzso region to zzso zzso zzso over the zzso zzso The host distribution observed here for zzso zzso zzso zzso (five fish species from five different fish zzso represents the broadest specificity known for a single species of zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso 1970, whose spore zzso and presence of zzso zzso immediately distinguish it from other species, was recovered from the zzso zzso zzso off zzso zzso zzso zzso Lester 1982 is reported here from zzso zzso zzso zzso from sites off zzso and from zzso Bay, Western zzso Comparative genetic analyses also revealed that an unidentified species of zzso from zzso zzso off Japan whose zzso sequence data are available on zzso is consistent with zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso may also exhibit low host specificity and may be distributed widely throughout the zzso Pacific zzso In comparison to other zzso zzso it is clear that the species richness of zzso zzso falls well below that displayed by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso The discovery of a further new species of zzso in Australia now brings the total worldwide number of formally described zzso species to a modest zzso Nonetheless, this zzso remains of significant interest to commercial and recreational fisheries through the potential production of zzso zzso in fish muscle and zzso muscle zzso both of which can render fish zzso zzso and zzso
