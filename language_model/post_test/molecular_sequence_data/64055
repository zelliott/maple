Storage of zzso zzso is associated with the zzso production of a variety of zzso compounds, including zzso organic zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Until recently, little was known about the zzso responsible for their zzso zzso from our laboratory have demonstrated that the zzso microbial populations of stored zzso zzso are zzso low zzso + zzso zzso zzso However, studies on pure cultures isolated from zzso have found few zzso that produce appreciable zzso zzso zzso selective and enrichment techniques were employed to isolate zzso bacteria from stored zzso zzso by using media containing zzso and zzso acids as carbon and energy zzso We now report on the isolation of 40 bacterial cultures, a number of which are capable of producing at least 40 zzso zzso in zzso acid zzso zzso similar to those produced by zzso producing zzso bacteria isolated from the rumen of zzso The zzso zzso zzso are zzso distinct from the zzso zzso and may prove to be intimately involved in the production of zzso during storage of zzso zzso
