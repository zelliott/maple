The human zzso gene is clearly involved in zzso zzso a common zzso zzso genetic disorder of iron zzso However, the precise role of the zzso protein is still zzso Here, to obtain new insight, we analyzed the zzso regulation of zzso gene and defined the functional organization of the zzso zzso Both in zzso zzso and reporter gene zzso in transient zzso evidenced a high liver expression of the zzso zzso The zzso end analysis of zzso showed two major initiation sites localized at zzso and zzso directed by zzso sequences and a window of initiation within the zzso to zzso zzso region upstream of the first coding zzso Positive zzso elements were characterized within the zzso region, and a negative one extending upstream zzso was zzso zzso I zzso analysis and gel shift zzso revealed several protein binding sites, and subsequent functional analysis evidenced zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso These data bring some evidence of a role of zzso in the liver and a zzso with zzso as other genes involved in iron zzso
