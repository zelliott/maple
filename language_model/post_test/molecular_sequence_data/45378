About 30 years ago, experiments found that there are polarity and zzso zzso and zzso correlations and affinity between zzso acids and their zzso Although it is shown that these experimental findings are important for explaining the origins of the genetic code, the great potential of P and H interactions in investigating other zzso have not been fully zzso Here, through zzso discussing and answering seven relevant questions hidden in zzso zzso the formation of zzso bonds, and the ending of zzso zzso we show our theoretical findings that the P and H correlations and affinity take vital roles in the protein synthesis zzso We found the relationship between the 3' end zzso sequences of zzso molecules and the activated zzso acids and its biological significance, the zzso consensus sequences zzso or zzso which may perform as functional segments of zzso to help triggering the reaction of zzso formation, and common nature of releasing factors that the first zzso acid zzso of releasing factors zzso zzso and zzso are all zzso except a few zzso which may be necessary for releasing the translated zzso and stopping the translating zzso In the terms of P and H correlations and zzso we provide explanations of why only using the zzso zzso as zzso template cannot get the zzso zzso in experiments deciphering the genetic code, why zzso often appears in beta turns and why zzso bypassing might occur when translating zzso on zzso Since zzso acids and zzso are the zzso respectively, for zzso proteins and zzso zzso these findings will help in further understanding interactions among the zzso These findings are also helpful for investigating zzso further understanding the protein synthesis process and zzso similar zzso and should be proved useful for experimental zzso
