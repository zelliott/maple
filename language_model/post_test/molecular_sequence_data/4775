In order to obtain experimental data on the question of compensation of positive charges by zzso groups in multiply charged zzso of zzso molecules in zzso zzso several pairs of peptides with the same basic structure but differentiated by one or two strongly zzso groups zzso or zzso were zzso It was found that depending on the density of basic centers and the strength of zzso groups present, the observed changes upon introduction of zzso groups ranged from complete elimination of the most highly charged state to absence of any zzso
