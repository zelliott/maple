The extended classic zzso complex model predicts that a G zzso zzso zzso exists in only two zzso zzso an inactive zzso and an active zzso However, different structural active zzso complexes may exist in addition to a silent inactive R ground state zzso Here we zzso in a cellular context, that several zzso states of zzso zzso receptors involve different zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and molecular modeling approaches, we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso results from stabilization of an obligatory double zzso switch zzso from inactive zzso to active zzso and zzso from inactive zzso to active zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso to zzso resulted in a lowering of the activity of the zzso similar to the zzso The zzso zzso shows that the zzso zzso switch plays a minor role in the stabilization of zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and is fully required in the stabilization of zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso stabilize zzso by forming a specific hydrogen bond with zzso in the active zzso zzso zzso zzso was probably the result of a direct zzso transition of zzso from inactive zzso to active zzso by hydrogen bonding of this zzso to a zzso group of zzso We were surprised that the zzso zzso switch was not necessary for zzso zzso by the natural zzso zzso zzso is probably attained through other routes of zzso Thus, different zzso arrangements occur during stabilization of zzso zzso zzso and zzso
