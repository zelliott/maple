zzso that react with the nuclear zzso zzso I zzso I) are used as a diagnostic marker of diffuse zzso To better define immune zzso to zzso I, zzso zzso in two patient populations were analyzed using zzso zzso I zzso Two overlapping partial zzso clones zzso the complete zzso acid sequence of zzso I were isolated from human zzso Using the zzso chain reaction, specific regions of zzso I were amplified and cloned into the zzso expression zzso To map zzso I zzso zzso fusion proteins were analyzed by zzso with 66 zzso I zzso from Thai and Australian patients with diffuse zzso Six distinct zzso regions were identified along the length of the zzso zzso acid zzso Almost all zzso contained zzso that recognized the zzso of zzso I zzso acids zzso as well as zzso to one of more of the other zzso zzso Sixty percent of the zzso contained zzso that recognized a zzso zzso region zzso acids zzso encompassing the active site of the zzso This subset of zzso I zzso could be responsible for the zzso of zzso activity previously reported in zzso zzso patterns of zzso with the six zzso I zzso regions were observed, although over half the zzso could be assigned to one of six distinct zzso In general, zzso in the Thai zzso reacted more strongly with the six zzso zzso Furthermore, two of the zzso regions reacted exclusively with Thai zzso suggesting a degree of racial or geographical specificity in the zzso response to zzso zzso The identification of multiple zzso in zzso I zzso with the zzso zzso response to zzso zzso found in other zzso zzso diseases and is presumed to be driven by the presentation of multiple peptides from zzso I zzso
