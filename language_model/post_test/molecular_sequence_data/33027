The zzso region zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso contains an internal zzso entry site zzso that regulates zzso zzso a zzso zzso in de zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that the zzso zzso is the first example of a cellular zzso that is zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso functionally replaced interactions between the zzso tail and the zzso protein zzso to achieve zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso protein 1 zzso from in zzso translation extracts or deletion of the zzso binding site on the zzso of the zzso transcript decreased the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso and resulted in a requirement for zzso We also identified a novel zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso that stimulates zzso zzso activity by binding to the zzso of the transcript and interacting with zzso zzso these data support a model for the zzso translation of zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso typically provided by the zzso initiation factor zzso zzso tail interaction is achieved instead through the zzso zzso interaction of the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso enhances the zzso activity of zzso by zzso the recruitment and/or recycling of zzso zzso which bind to the transcript in the middle of the zzso and migrate to the initiation zzso via zzso zzso
