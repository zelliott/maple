The zzso complex is a large zzso of zzso that zzso zzso seabirds zzso zzso and their zzso We obtained zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso I DNA sequences from 39 species from diverse hosts and zzso Resolution of deeper relationships between zzso was zzso however there is evidence for two major zzso one hosted by zzso the other by zzso Based on our results, the zzso hosted by zzso are excellent candidates for detailed analysis of zzso Our results also suggest that a previous estimate of a zzso difference in the relative rate of sequence evolution in zzso and their avian hosts is an zzso of limited zzso zzso
