zzso of the zzso zzso outer membrane protein zzso of zzso zzso is associated with resistance to zzso B, zzso and zzso zzso zzso is believed to act by replacing zzso zzso at binding sites on zzso thereby preventing disruption of the sites and subsequent zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by two cycles of zzso zzso was apparently associated with zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso in high yield by zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and was subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to clone the structural gene for protein zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso cloning was confirmed by zzso sequence zzso Southern zzso suggested that zzso was present as a zzso gene in zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed that zzso was a slightly basic zzso of 178 zzso with a leader sequence typical of an exported zzso zzso It had little zzso however, to other bacterial surface proteins for which sequence data were zzso No expression of protein zzso from its own or the zzso promoter, was detected in zzso zzso We concluded that, as for some other regulated zzso zzso expression of zzso at least under some conditions, is blocked in zzso zzso
