To investigate the influence of the angle zzso by the positively charged zzso face on membrane activity, six zzso zzso peptides with angles between 80 degrees and 180 degrees, but with retained zzso zzso moment, and positive overall charge, were designed starting from the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso CD investigations revealed that all zzso are in an zzso zzso in zzso zzso The ability of the peptides to induce dye release from zzso charged zzso zzso zzso decreased with increasing zzso However, peptides with a large angle of positively charged zzso zzso zzso exhibited a considerably higher zzso activity at zzso zzso zzso and mixed zzso zzso zzso than zzso with a small angle zzso zzso In addition, zzso with large angles were more active in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso specificity of these zzso was zzso zzso investigations showed that zzso binding is favored by a large angle and a high content of zzso charged zzso In contrast, a small angle and a low negative membrane charge enhanced the zzso efficiency of the bound zzso zzso All zzso stabilized the zzso phase of zzso over the zzso zzso zzso zzso a class L mechanism of zzso can be zzso Furthermore, the zzso do not act by the induction of positive zzso strain or by a zzso zzso Our results are in accordance with a pore zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso with enhanced angle of positively charged zzso is reduced due to zzso zzso between adjacent zzso within the zzso thus resulting in a decreased zzso probability and/or pore zzso
