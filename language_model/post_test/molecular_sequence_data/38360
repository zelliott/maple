The zzso sequence of zzso zzso protein zzso gene from wild perennial grass zzso zzso is zzso It was determined by the method of zzso amplification with specific zzso zzso and the direct sequencing of the amplification zzso The sequence of zzso zzso zzso gene for zzso predicts a zzso zzso protein of 116 zzso acids that shows strong similarity to those of wheat zzso zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso protein from zzso zzso and zzso plant's zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins shows the presence of zzso zzso zzso motif zzso zzso modified it can be found in many other zzso zzso This zzso motif is presumed to be particularly important for association of the zzso zzso protein with other proteins in the small zzso of the zzso zzso
