We have studied the effects of specific zzso acid replacements in zzso upon the zzso interactions with zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso We found that zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso affect the zzso ability to bind zzso zzso Wild type zzso zzso binds zzso and zzso much more tightly than do many of the altered zzso zzso zzso by zzso lowers the zzso affinity for zzso by about zzso relative to the change in its affinity for zzso zzso at zzso 136 by zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso further lower the protein relative affinity for zzso by factors of about 4 and 10, zzso In contrast, replacement of the zzso by zzso zzso eliminates zzso zzso binding as well as zzso zzso Apparently, the distortion of this loop by substitution at zzso 136 of a bulky zzso zzso can hamper the binding for both zzso or disrupt the folding of the zzso All altered proteins except zzso are able to bind zzso however, they require much higher zzso of zzso than wild type zzso In minimal media, zzso coli cells harboring plasmids zzso zzso or zzso suffer growth zzso relative to cells bearing the same zzso zzso wild type zzso zzso of these cells with a compatible zzso bearing the zzso gene reverses this growth zzso The growth zzso effect of some of the altered proteins can be explained by their zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is essential to the growth of zzso coli and suggest a technique for studying zzso zzso as well as for identifying other zzso zzso exchange zzso
