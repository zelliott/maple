zzso zzso zzso are widely distributed in northern latitudes and, because of their rapid turnover of organic matter, are potentially larger sources of atmospheric methane than zzso zzso per unit zzso However, studies of the zzso community composition in zzso are scarce particularly in zzso zzso Several zzso zzso primer sets were used to obtain a broad characterization of the zzso community in a zzso zzso in central New York zzso A wide zzso diversity was observed in the zzso 11 zzso and 2 zzso groups, most of which were zzso The E1 group, a novel cluster in the order zzso and zzso were the zzso groups in all libraries and results of terminal restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso Given its abundance and potential zzso methane contribution, the E1 group was targeted for culture attempts with a zzso medium zzso zzso attempts yielded zzso zzso However, by incorporating a zzso analysis as a quick selection tool for treatments and zzso we were able to select an enrichment dominated by zzso Further zzso to zzso and tracking with zzso yielded a strain named zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso slightly zzso zzso and is highly sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso We propose zzso as the first representative of a novel zzso in the zzso zzso
