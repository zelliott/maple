The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso is biased among the three zzso and that the least zzso zzso has approximately twice as many zzso as its close (and relatively zzso relative zzso than had either of the other two zzso One evolutionary scenario is that the two zzso with heavy gene losses (I and zzso were in the same nucleus for a longer period of time than the third zzso zzso with the fewest gene zzso This zzso hypothesis is essentially the same as that proposed previously for the zzso zzso however, the more recent nature of the zzso zzso zzso makes this model more zzso We found that zzso II suffered recent small deletions within zzso more frequently than zzso I, as would be expected if the genes in zzso I had already been near zzso zzso before zzso III was zzso We observed that some zzso before these zzso were flanked by short direct repeats, a unique signature of zzso illegitimate zzso We also found, through simulations, that zzso or zzso appear to dominate the zzso patterns in zzso zzso We conclude that the observed patterns of the zzso regions in the zzso zzso are best explained by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso and subsequent mode of zzso could influence the potential to generate zzso zzso hallmark of the zzso zzso
