The zzso zzso gene family of zzso zzso currently consists of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All six zzso putative type II membrane proteins with a short zzso zzso a zzso region and a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the identification of the three remaining members of this family in the zzso zzso zzso zzso to an open reading frame zzso of the left arm of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso to zzso on the left arms of zzso XVI and IX zzso The zzso zzso and zzso gene products are highly similar to the zzso family zzso zzso functional characterization revealed that some zzso zzso strains containing zzso copies of these genes displayed cell wall zzso None was zzso killer toxin resistant but zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found to be hypersensitive and zzso respectively, to the drug zzso zzso
