The organization of zzso regulatory elements of the chicken zzso zzso gene was investigated in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Various lengths of zzso zzso sequence were linked to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso into primary cultures of chicken zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso elements are present between zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these sequences revealed the presence of positive elements located within 138 zzso upstream of the major zzso start zzso zzso analysis showed that the region from the major zzso start site to zzso contains an zzso zzso box zzso a zzso element and two direct repeats of the zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso using a probe extending from zzso to zzso identified three sites protected by nuclear zzso Site I zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso was identified only on the coding zzso Site II covered the sequence from zzso to zzso and includes the zzso zzso Site III, from zzso to zzso contained two zzso zzso Site I is the zzso portion of a 10 zzso sequence zzso zzso which is perfectly zzso in the avian and the human zzso Single or multiple copies of a 37 zzso DNA zzso zzso containing the 10 zzso zzso sequence were cloned into zzso upstream or downstream of the major zzso start site and in both zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso with these zzso indicate that the zzso zzso has an zzso like zzso Additional zzso and internal deletions of zzso suggest that the factors binding to the zzso element, the zzso box and the two zzso repeats have a synergistic effect on promoter zzso
