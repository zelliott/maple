zzso of zzso plays a critical role in the regulation of several processes within the nucleus, including maintenance of zzso stability and zzso zzso The only known zzso site on zzso is represented by a zzso zzso zzso located at the C zzso of the zzso Here, we describe a novel zzso mark at the zzso tail of zzso zzso consisting of two zzso zzso at positions 13 and 15 zzso This zzso site is a target of the DNA damage response zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso site impair zzso and DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso site prevents the zzso zzso of zzso zzso but does not abolish the zzso induced by zzso A zzso zzso is obtained by zzso both the zzso and the zzso sites, suggesting that these are unique, zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso This unprecedented result implies that zzso generates a zzso different zzso mark on zzso
