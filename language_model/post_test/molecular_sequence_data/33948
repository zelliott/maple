zzso is an zzso family zzso involved in DNA repair that is widely zzso in zzso zzso tuberculosis has two zzso zzso zzso here we investigate the role of zzso The zzso gene at its native locus could be knocked out only in the presence of a second copy of the zzso demonstrating that zzso is zzso Analysis of the putative protein domain structure of zzso shows a distinctive domain architecture, with an extended C zzso containing an zzso domain normally found in zzso family zzso and a linking domain carrying a zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso of zzso were able to compensate for the loss of the zzso zzso showing that these zzso zzso are not zzso Although zzso is a functional zzso a zzso form of the protein lacking zzso activity was able to permit deletion of zzso at its native zzso However, a zzso protein unable to zzso zzso or zzso along DNA was not able to compensate for lack of the zzso zzso zzso we concluded that the essential role played by zzso is unlikely to involve its DNA unwinding activity and is more likely to involve DNA zzso and, zzso protein zzso
