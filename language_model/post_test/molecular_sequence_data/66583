The zzso protein of zzso virus zzso is an zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso host protein expression by interfering with zzso zzso Here, we show that the ability to inhibit both host zzso and the zzso response is linked to interaction of zzso with the zzso component of zzso a protein complex necessary for zzso zzso The interacting domain on zzso was mapped to the zzso region, which contains zzso acids zzso among zzso zzso zzso A zzso virus in which the interacting domain in zzso was deleted had strongly reduced ability to inhibit host protein expression and was unable to inhibit the zzso zzso This study provides further information on the mechanisms by which zzso zzso proteins are involved in zzso
