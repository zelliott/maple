zzso adapter protein zzso is a recently identified protein that zzso regulates zzso in zzso zzso zzso Roche, zzso Alonso, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1998) and comprises an zzso and zzso domain with striking identity to the corresponding zzso zzso In light of this, we sought to investigate whether zzso could be an zzso of all zzso zzso Like zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso and largely zzso with zzso when zzso in zzso zzso zzso of a zzso construct into zzso zzso zzso cells inhibited zzso growth factor zzso DNA zzso and the zzso was rescued by the zzso factor zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso the zzso block induced by both zzso and a zzso zzso with a deletion of its C zzso zzso but not the block induced by zzso or zzso zzso that the C zzso is a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso adapter zzso zzso fused to the zzso C zzso zzso also inhibited zzso function during the zzso response in a zzso manner, as zzso zzso could not rescue zzso zzso zzso however, did not reverse zzso zzso cell zzso as it was unable to inhibit zzso of zzso stress fibers while still being able to inhibit zzso DNA zzso This was attributed to a distinct zzso zzso binding zzso since the zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso was replaced by the zzso zzso zzso substantially restored stress fiber zzso Indeed, three zzso acids important for zzso binding in zzso zzso were replaced in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not bind to the zzso zzso partners zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso fused to the zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso was not regulated in zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso domain is required for signaling during zzso and since zzso behaved as a dominant negative in the zzso zzso response when zzso into zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso during zzso involving both the zzso and the C zzso zzso in a zzso manner, but it does not regulate all zzso function due to specific zzso binding zzso
