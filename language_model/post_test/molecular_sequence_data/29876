The single nuclear gene zzso human zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso complex, was isolated previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso 161, zzso The zzso region contains four putative zzso boxes, one putative zzso site, and one sequence zzso to the zzso recognition site, but lacks typical zzso and zzso zzso Three common zzso sequences zzso zzso and zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found in the zzso regions of the genes for human zzso protein and for human zzso zzso another zzso of the zzso zzso zzso All three sequences are located in the zzso pair zzso zzso of the zzso protein gene and in the zzso pair zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, a zzso zzso search revealed that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene is related to the long terminal repeat of an zzso zzso zzso highly zzso to the three zzso were also found in the zzso regions of the genes for the beta zzso of human zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso is similar to the zzso recognition site zzso found in the zzso regions of the zzso nuclear genes for three zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that protein factors in a whole zzso cell extract bound to both of those zzso At least three different specific binding sites were thought to exist in the zzso zzso binding of the protein factors to the sites, possibly to the three Mt zzso may play an important role in the coordinate regulation of the zzso of nuclear genes zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso
