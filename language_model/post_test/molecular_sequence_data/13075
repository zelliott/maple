The crystal structure of the rat alpha 1 zzso hormone zzso zzso domain bound with a zzso hormone zzso reveals that zzso is completely buried within the domain as part of the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso domain forms an zzso zzso with its zzso face zzso part of the hormone binding zzso These observations suggest a structural role for zzso in establishing the active zzso of the zzso that is likely to zzso hormonal regulation of gene expression for the nuclear zzso
