zzso have demonstrated significant power for zzso analyses of gene zzso and recently have also revolutionized the genetic analysis of segregating populations by zzso thousands of zzso in a single zzso Although zzso zzso approaches have been successfully applied in zzso and several zzso plant species, their power has not been proven in an zzso species with extensive genetic zzso Here we have developed methods for zzso zzso zzso in such species using a zzso progeny of 154 individuals of zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyzed with zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our analysis resulted in zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression marker zzso zzso Using these zzso and an established zzso zzso framework map, we produced a zzso genetic map zzso over 600 zzso zzso and zzso The abundance of zzso markers allowed us to zzso over 35 million base pairs of previously zzso zzso shotgun zzso scaffold sequence to putative locations in the zzso of zzso zzso A high proportion of sampled scaffolds could be verified for their placement with independently mapped zzso demonstrating the previously zzso power that zzso zzso can provide in the context of zzso zzso sequence zzso Our results provide a substantial contribution to the continued improvement of the zzso zzso zzso while demonstrating the feasibility of zzso zzso in a highly zzso zzso The strategies presented are zzso to genetic mapping efforts in all plant species with similarly high levels of genetic zzso
