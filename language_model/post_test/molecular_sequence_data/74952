The major zzso protein of avian zzso pp 12, binds to zzso viral zzso with high zzso zzso at zzso is necessary for this zzso In order to examine the role of zzso of zzso 40 in the biological function of pp 12, we have introduced a series of zzso acid zzso at this position in the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or three other zzso acids for zzso had very little or no zzso effect on viral zzso nor did the control substitution of zzso for zzso a zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso the zzso and probably the zzso zzso p 12 proteins are zzso at alternative sites which are zzso to a minor extent in zzso in the wild type zzso A study of the zzso binding properties of zzso zzso p 12 has indicated that the protein has been stabilized in a high affinity zzso binding state which is independent of zzso The viability of the zzso zzso virus indicates that this high binding affinity may be required for biological zzso
