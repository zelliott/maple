zzso are zzso zzso peptides produced by plants with the presumed natural function of defense agents against insect zzso They are present in a wide range of plant zzso being zzso zzso via precursor proteins that are zzso processed to produce mature peptides with a characteristic zzso backbone and zzso knot motif associated with their six zzso zzso zzso Their processing is not fully understood but involves zzso zzso zzso In addition to interest in their defense roles and their unique zzso zzso have attracted attention as potential templates in zzso drug design zzso This chapter provides protocols for the isolation of zzso from plants, their detection and sequencing by mass zzso and their structural analysis by zzso as well as describing methods for the isolation of zzso acid sequences that zzso their precursor zzso zzso to assess their zzso interactions are also zzso These protocols provide a zzso zzso for researchers entering the zzso zzso
