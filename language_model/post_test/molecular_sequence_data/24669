The zzso growth zzso signaling zzso promotes growth in zzso and zzso by increasing the levels of zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Two key zzso of this zzso are the zzso protein zzso 1 zzso and zzso Although genetic analysis in zzso zzso has implicated zzso as the only relevant zzso zzso cell culture studies have suggested that zzso has additional zzso Here we show that, in zzso zzso controls cellular and zzso growth by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso genetically interacts with zzso but not with zzso zzso two zzso of zzso in zzso Thus, the results suggest that zzso is required for zzso but not zzso zzso and that it regulates zzso growth through two main zzso zzso zzso and zzso
