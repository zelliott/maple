In zzso zzso channels, the zzso loop forms the narrow zzso and the zzso zzso The identity of an zzso zzso leading toward the zzso remained zzso Using the zzso zzso accessibility method zzso we identified zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the region preceding zzso zzso the zzso part of zzso zzso and the zzso part of zzso zzso These zzso are located on the zzso side of the zzso and, with one exception, are exposed to the pore independently of channel zzso suggesting that the gate is at the zzso or further zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso was decreased by zzso in zzso and zzso but not by zzso in zzso suggesting a functionally distinct contribution of the segments to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
