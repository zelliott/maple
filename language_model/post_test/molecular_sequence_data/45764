Recently, the zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso related zzso which is located at human zzso zzso where loss of zzso frequently occurs in zzso was zzso The present study aimed to explore the zzso approach to zzso protein and its expression pattern in zzso with tissue zzso The full length coding sequence of zzso was zzso into a zzso expression zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli as a zzso zzso With modification of the zzso method, zzso fusion protein achieved a high level of zzso The New Zealand rabbit was zzso with the zzso fusion protein to prepare zzso zzso following standard zzso With this zzso zzso analysis of zzso protein expression using zzso was performed on self-made tissue zzso consisting of zzso zzso specimens from 148 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with different zzso zzso zzso we found that there was a significant decrease in the percentage of positive expression in all zzso on protein levels for zzso zzso compared to that of the zzso zzso zzso The result suggests that zzso might be a potential effective diagnosis candidate for zzso and decreased expression of zzso protein is a possible point of dysfunction along the zzso zzso for zzso that may contribute to zzso zzso
