zzso zzso is a major cause of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso finger zzso genes would be good candidates for being involved in the multiple zzso defects associated with zzso zzso virtue of their role as zzso regulators, their abundance in the zzso and their known association with specific zzso zzso We have isolated and mapped a zinc finger zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso mapped to the zzso end of the zzso zzso smallest region of deletion overlap of zzso 300 zzso from the zzso zzso on zzso zzso defining the anonymous locus zzso zzso was expressed zzso at low levels in the zzso zzso The identification of a candidate gene for a zzso zzso syndrome belonging to a class of evolutionary zzso genes will provide options for studying its normal and abnormal expression during zzso zzso
