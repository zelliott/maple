The zzso contains of 200 base pairs of DNA zzso with four core zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The fifth zzso species, the zzso zzso interacts with zzso DNA connecting zzso zzso We have studied the influence of the zzso on the interactions of a repeating unit 15 zzso long, containing the zzso zzso the motif thought to induce turn along peptides zzso enclosed within the trout zzso zzso zzso domain with zzso by means of the zzso zzso and CD zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso binds to a single stranded zzso It has been shown further that there is no beta structure present but a distorted zzso structure has been zzso
