A synthetic zzso zzso matching zzso acids zzso of the skeletal zzso zzso zzso binds to both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso 276 (2001) zzso We report here that zzso increases zzso binding to zzso in a zzso and zzso manner; it also zzso zzso release from zzso zzso and increases open probability zzso of single zzso channels zzso in zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso removes zzso associated with zzso zzso and increases zzso binding to zzso zzso suggesting that its mechanism of action is zzso it removes zzso zzso and also interacts directly with complementary regions in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso activates zzso while the zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity, suggesting the presence of two discrete functional zzso within this zzso A zzso zzso lacking this region, zzso was constructed and expressed in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in these cells were dramatically reduced compared with cells expressing wild type zzso zzso of the zzso region also resulted in profound changes in zzso zzso and channel zzso We thus propose that the zzso zzso region acts not only as the zzso binding site, but also as an important zzso domain for zzso zzso
