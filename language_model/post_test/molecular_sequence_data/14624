Of the mechanisms known to protect vascular plants and some algae, zzso and zzso from the toxic effects of zzso heavy metals such as zzso zzso or zzso one of the most sophisticated is the zzso synthesis of zzso zzso PCs, zzso zzso zzso which serve as zzso zzso cellular zzso and contribute to the zzso of heavy metal zzso are derived from zzso zzso zzso and related zzso in a reaction zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso from zzso zzso zzso as a model, the reasoning and experiments behind the conclusion that PC zzso are novel zzso zzso zzso zzso members are zzso The status of zzso zzso derivatives as generic PC zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso domain of the zzso from zzso and its zzso zzso from zzso sources, for net PC synthesis and zzso of zzso and its zzso respectively, are zzso The question of the common need or needs met by PC zzso and their zzso is zzso Of the schemes proposed to account for the combined zzso and zzso zzso capabilities of the zzso zzso vs the limited zzso capabilities of the zzso zzso two that will be considered are the storage and zzso of essential heavy metals in zzso and the metabolism of zzso zzso derivatives in both zzso and zzso
