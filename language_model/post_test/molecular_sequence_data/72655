zzso protein is a zzso zzso regulator which contains a zinc cluster in its zzso zzso It was recently shown by selecting random zzso binding sites that zzso protein recognizes with a higher affinity targets containing the zzso consensus zzso zzso this ideal sequence is however not found in zzso zzso target zzso In order to investigate how zzso protein actually binds to its targets, zzso were introduced in three of them zzso zzso zzso and the consequences towards the binding of zzso zzso were zzso Our data support the following zzso zzso When the sequence element contains two zzso and no zzso both zzso are essential for zzso zzso If the sequence element contains only the right zzso and the zzso both are sufficient but indispensable for the binding of zzso zzso When two zzso and the zzso are present, the right zzso and not the left one, is essential for the binding of zzso zzso zzso is usually a zzso in solution but binds DNA as a zzso Finally, we found evidence for the presence of two zzso with different measured affinities in the zzso sequences of some zzso zzso
