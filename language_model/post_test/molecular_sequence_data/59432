The proliferation and differentiation of zzso cells are zzso by a group of zzso called colony stimulating factors zzso Previously, we found that the human zzso cell line zzso zzso a high level of human zzso zzso factor zzso The zzso of zzso including the signal zzso zzso was amplified from the total zzso of zzso by a zzso zzso chain reaction and was cloned into the zzso zzso After confirming the zzso zzso the zzso was inserted into a zzso zzso transfer zzso The zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso was generated by zzso the zzso zzso transfer zzso and zzso zzso DNA into the zzso insect zzso The expected zzso transcript was detected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso media of the infected cells were analyzed by a zzso zzso The results indicate that the infected insect cells produced and zzso zzso According to colony forming zzso a maximum zzso of zzso zzso zzso U zzso of zzso in the medium was obtained on the third day after zzso
