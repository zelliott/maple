zzso cells zzso are key participants in zzso processes that characterize tumor growth, wound repair, and inflammatory diseases, such as human zzso arthritis zzso We and others have shown that zzso zzso such as soluble zzso mediate zzso Here we describe an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that shares some structural features with the soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One of the main previously recognized functions of zzso is as a blood group zzso Here we show that zzso is rapidly zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso where it is zzso and zzso in the soluble form in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso joint zzso zzso zzso also has a novel function, for it is a potent zzso zzso in both in zzso and in zzso zzso These results suggest a novel paradigm of soluble blood group zzso as zzso of zzso responses and suggest new targets for therapy of diseases, such as zzso that are characterized by persistent zzso
