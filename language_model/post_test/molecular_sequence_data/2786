zzso protein and zzso expression was examined in a collection of 18 zzso zzso B cell lines derived from five patients with zzso zzso zzso A diversity of H and L chain zzso were zzso by these zzso the majority (12 zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso delta zzso zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso expression was also zzso For all the zzso zzso zzso B cell lines, the zzso and zzso zzso transcripts were of native size, and sequence analysis across the regions of zzso and V zzso J zzso gene joining showed that zzso gene zzso occurred in a typical zzso A variety of zzso and V zzso J zzso gene zzso were observed, not only within the set of zzso zzso zzso B cells as a whole, but also among the cell lines derived from single zzso Southern zzso analysis for zzso zzso H chain gene zzso was done to fully assess the extent of zzso zzso among multiple zzso zzso zzso B cell lines derived from two zzso all the B cell lines possessed distinct gene zzso patterns demonstrating their zzso zzso Our findings indicate that the B cell repertoire in individual zzso patients is zzso diverse and that it is unlikely that the zzso in B cell differentiation in zzso is the result of inefficient or ineffective zzso of zzso H or L chain zzso Rather, this study provides support for the idea that the zzso zzso relates to a more generalized cellular function, such as regulating the proliferation and/or zzso expansion of cells of the B zzso zzso
