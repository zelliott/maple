The structure of the zzso domain of bovine zzso zzso in the zzso form was investigated using two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso resonance assignments were made using standard zzso Using information from medium and long range contacts revealed by nuclear zzso enhancement, the secondary structure and global fold were zzso The zzso protein possesses essentially the same secondary structure as that in the calcium activated form of intact zzso However, the secondary structural elements are rearranged so that the zzso binding pocket is closed in the zzso
