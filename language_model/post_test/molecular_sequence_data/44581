Chicken zzso is a small, approximately 30 zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso breakdown of the precursor protein zzso In principle, zzso is small enough to directly diffuse into the zzso Our results, however, demonstrate that its nuclear transport is an active process which can be inhibited by wheat germ zzso chilling, and energy zzso The zzso sequence analysis identifies chicken zzso beginning at zzso in the zzso region of zzso yielding of protein of zzso zzso
