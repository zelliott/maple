zzso truncated human zzso receptors were constructed and zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones expressing comparable zzso zzso were studied for zzso binding properties, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso served as zzso The binding properties of all the constructions were zzso As judged by the intrinsic activity of the partial zzso zzso the shortest receptors have a moderate impairment of the zzso efficacy to zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso and zzso truncated receptors had a two- to zzso higher zzso zzso zzso activity than those expressing the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso and other zzso was zzso This suggested that zzso zzso and zzso receptors had a zzso zzso The selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced by zzso the zzso activity with an zzso value of 3 zzso comparable to its zzso value for zzso This zzso behaved thus like an inverse zzso on the zzso active zzso receptors generated by zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso
