It is believed that the exposure of organisms to harsh climate conditions may select for differential zzso activities, making the surviving organisms a very promising source for zzso zzso bacteria play an important role in degradation of organic matter, which is mostly due to their ability to decompose zzso zzso This work focuses on the isolation and identification of zzso bacteria from soil found in two environments with stressful climate conditions zzso and the Brazilian semi-arid zzso zzso bacteria were selected using zzso at high and low temperatures (4 or zzso in liquid media zzso soy zzso and minimum salt zzso supplemented with cellulose zzso Many of the zzso zzso out of zzso displayed the ability to degrade zzso indicating the presence of zzso activity, while only a minority of these zzso zzso out of zzso showed zzso activity zzso of zzso The obtained zzso revealed a preferential zzso activity according to the temperature of zzso Also, the identification of some zzso by partial sequencing of the zzso zzso gene indicated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the main zzso of zzso bacteria isolated from soil in zzso the zzso zzso zzso were more commonly isolated from samples from the zzso and zzso were found in both types of soil zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, this work reports the isolation of bacteria able to degrade zzso material from soil at very low or very high temperatures, a finding that should be further explored in the search for zzso zzso to be used in the zzso zzso
