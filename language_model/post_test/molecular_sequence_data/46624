zzso particles generated by the zzso expression of virus structural proteins are able to zzso the zzso of foreign zzso presented on their zzso In recent years zzso of various origin have been inserted into the core zzso of zzso B virus zzso allowing the formation of zzso zzso core zzso zzso core particles carrying the 45 zzso zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso protein induced protective immunity in bank zzso the natural host of this zzso zzso applied in the absence of zzso are still zzso and partially protective in bank zzso Although a zzso truncated core zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of extended foreign zzso for the construction of zzso vaccines the limited zzso capacity is still a critical zzso Recently, we have described a new system for generating zzso zzso zzso in an zzso coli zzso strain based on a zzso mechanism on a stop zzso located in front of the zzso Those mosaic particles are built up by both zzso delta and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The particles formed presented the 114 zzso acid zzso long zzso zzso at least in part, on their surface and induced zzso against the zzso sequence in bank zzso zzso of the stop zzso still allowed the formation of mosaic particles demonstrating that stop zzso suppression alone is sufficient for the packaging of longer foreign sequences in mosaic zzso Another approach to increase the zzso capacity is based on the simultaneous zzso of different zzso zzso protein sequences zzso zzso and zzso zzso into two different positions zzso 78 and behind zzso zzso of a single zzso zzso The data presented are of high relevance for the generation of zzso vaccines requiring a high zzso capacity for foreign zzso
