The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in determining zzso zzso activity and thus the zzso response to zzso acid and zzso Of the four zzso zzso is unique in zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso the other three zzso are exclusively zzso with no zzso zzso We have zzso a series of zzso zzso to zzso the zzso of zzso transport in zzso Two generations of zzso zzso zzso initially localized this characteristic to within a zzso expansion of the zzso C zzso between zzso zzso and zzso This region of zzso is rich in zzso zzso and charged zzso and encompasses two predicted zzso zzso zzso of this region in zzso with the equivalent sequence of zzso resulted in a zzso zzso that was devoid of zzso activity, with intact zzso zzso A third generation of zzso demonstrated that a domain just zzso to the zzso sequences zzso zzso transport on zzso zzso of this region revealed that zzso zzso of zzso are sufficient for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso A, whereas zzso transport zzso by zzso zzso and zzso is completely resistant to this zzso zzso zzso In zzso a zzso zzso domain in zzso is both necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso Furthermore, unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso is completely independent of zzso zzso activity, suggesting that these two modes of transport are activated by distinct zzso
