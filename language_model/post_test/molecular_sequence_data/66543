The zzso zzso gene of the zzso epidemic zzso virus zzso strain zzso which was previously isolated in zzso province, China, was zzso zzso and compared with published sequences of other avian and zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso the entire N gene open reading frame zzso of zzso was zzso bases long and zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with predicted Mr of 49 zzso It consisted of 405 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison with other zzso strains selected from zzso revealed that the zzso N gene has a high sequence zzso to those of other zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso with zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso The zzso protein shared zzso zzso acid identities compared with zzso zzso with zzso zzso with zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence contained seven potential protein zzso C zzso sites, nine zzso zzso II zzso sites, one zzso zzso zzso site, two zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso
