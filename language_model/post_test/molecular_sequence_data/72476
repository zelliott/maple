Since the zzso near zzso region zzso zzso of zzso A zzso has tentatively been identified as the zzso membrane interacting region using synthetic zzso it was necessary to confirm this finding with zzso deletion zzso In order to address this need and to clarify the discrepancies of the published zzso acid sequences of zzso we cloned a zzso gene and produced zzso deletion proteins of various zzso The zzso zzso protein lacking the first 16 zzso acid zzso bound to the zzso membrane as well as the full-length zzso at pH zzso However, the zzso protein lacking the first 39 zzso acid zzso which include the zzso near zzso region zzso zzso failed to interact with the zzso membrane at pH zzso clearly indicating the essential role of the zzso near zzso region in the zzso interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso
