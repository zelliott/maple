zzso is a human zzso class I zzso zzso zzso that binds the host zzso zzso zzso and the only known viral zzso zzso that presents zzso The zzso structure of a zzso complex reveals increased contacts and optimal surface zzso in the zzso interface compared with zzso zzso resulting in a zzso higher zzso Despite sharing only approximately zzso sequence identity, zzso structure and zzso binding are surprisingly similar to host zzso The crystal structure suggests that most of the zzso surface, except where zzso and the zzso light chain zzso is covered by carbohydrates attached to 13 potential zzso sites, thereby preventing access to bound zzso and association with most zzso zzso The zzso structure demonstrates how a viral protein zzso from its host zzso to impede unwanted interactions while preserving and improving its zzso zzso
