zzso zzso zzso is one of the pathogens that should be eliminated from pigs intended for use as organ donors in zzso For this purpose, reliable diagnostic test systems are zzso To provide a basis for this goal and to zzso the evolutionary relationships of zzso within the zzso family, the putative zzso B zzso gene of zzso was identified by assuming gene zzso and a relative conservation of zzso sequences in comparison with closely related zzso Using this approach the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso gene was zzso A protein of 860 zzso acids was deduced and a putative zzso site, zzso zzso zzso as well as potential zzso zzso motifs were zzso In a comparison of zzso zzso with the corresponding region of other zzso the highest identities were found with human zzso 6 and 7 zzso and 7; zzso and zzso zzso Also in zzso analysis, the zzso zzso clustered with zzso and zzso Between the complete zzso sequences of five different zzso strains and zzso from the United zzso Germany, Spain, Japan and Sweden, differences of zzso were found, indicating a considerable zzso zzso The zzso of the protein deduced from the identified gene provides further evidence that this is indeed the zzso gene of zzso and provides important zzso information regarding zzso The identification of the zzso gene should facilitate the development of sensitive and robust diagnostic methods for the zzso screening of zzso
