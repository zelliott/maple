The protein zzso zzso is critical in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso Its activity is regulated by its binding proteins and by zzso We have recently shown that zzso is zzso and that the amount of zzso zzso increases during zzso zzso maturation zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that protein zzso zzso with zzso zzso during column zzso of bovine zzso zzso Western zzso analyses confirmed the presence of protein zzso not only in bovine zzso but also in zzso of diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The binding between zzso and protein zzso was confirmed by zzso experiments and in pull-down zzso with zzso zzso Western zzso analysis and protein zzso zzso with zzso against the consensus binding domain of protein zzso reveal that, in addition to zzso at least two other protein zzso binding partners are present in zzso Fluorescence zzso results indicate that zzso zzso and protein zzso both zzso to the zzso region of the head and principal piece of bovine zzso Together, these results provide conclusive evidence that protein zzso is present in mature zzso and that zzso is one of its binding zzso
