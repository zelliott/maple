zzso is the major nitrogen form supplied as fertilizer in agricultural plant production but also an important nitrogen zzso in zzso We report the cloning and functional characterization of zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso contains 14 putative zzso zzso and represents an individual member in zzso that belongs to a zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso clamp and zzso studies using zzso zzso in zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso mediates zzso zzso In both zzso systems, zzso transport was zzso at low zzso In zzso inward currents indicated that zzso is zzso with zzso By contrast, a supply of zzso zzso could not stimulate zzso zzso Transport of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso exhibited zzso zzso with a zzso of approximately 3 zzso zzso zzso was expressed in shoots and roots and zzso during early zzso and under nitrogen zzso in zzso We propose a role of zzso in zzso zzso by plant cells at low external zzso zzso
