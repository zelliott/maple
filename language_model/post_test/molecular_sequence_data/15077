zzso protein zzso zzso are essential zzso of calcium signaling pathways in zzso zzso characterization of zzso is of great interest because they play important roles during growth, development, and in response to a wide range of environmental zzso The zzso zzso encodes 34 zzso but very few zzso of these zzso have been zzso In this study, we exploited the unique characteristics of zzso to develop an efficient approach for the discovery of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction screens with two different zzso libraries each containing 18 million prey clones were performed using zzso impaired and zzso active zzso and zzso zzso as zzso The use of the zzso active versions of the zzso zzso improved the recovery of positive interacting proteins relative to the wild type zzso zzso of interaction strength by growth under increasing zzso of zzso zzso a zzso analog and competitive inhibitor of the zzso gene product, confirmed these zzso zzso mechanisms for this observed improvement are zzso The zzso of this approach was assessed by the overlap of several interacting proteins of zzso and zzso and the recovery of several putative zzso and indicated that zzso zzso screens using zzso active and/or zzso impaired forms of zzso provides a useful tool to identify potential zzso of the zzso family and potentially the entire protein zzso zzso
