The conversion of a soluble protein into zzso zzso structures and further fiber formation are critical steps in the zzso of the group of human diseases known as zzso Drugs that interfere with this process may thus be able to prevent and/or cure these zzso Recent results have shown that short zzso acid stretches can provide most of the driving force needed to trigger zzso formation of a zzso These evidence suggest that compounds that specifically bind to peptides zzso upon the sequence of such zzso protein stretches might also be able to inhibit zzso formation of the corresponding full-length protein and, zzso zzso zzso as zzso Here we present a general strategy to obtain zzso that specifically interact with protein zzso zzso The screening of a zzso zzso library for zzso of an zzso zzso designed de zzso has allowed us to extract a set of empirical rules for the design of zzso zzso of any zzso zzso zzso zzso generated on these bases prevent zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso of different zzso zzso identified in human zzso zzso In addition, they are also specific for their target zzso The zzso designed here for the Alzheimer's zzso zzso not only zzso and zzso zzso material but also reduces zzso zzso zzso in cell zzso
