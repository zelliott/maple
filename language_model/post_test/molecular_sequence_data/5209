Recently, zzso T cell zzso has been reported in affected zzso of patients with zzso zzso To characterize such zzso accumulating T cells, we zzso monitored their frequency by analyzing zzso B zzso As a result, despite a similar zzso zzso usage between zzso fluid zzso and zzso obviously skewed zzso zzso usage was detected in zzso zzso DNA sequencing demonstrated that the skewed zzso gene usage in zzso resulted from zzso T cell zzso The zzso region 3 of zzso B chains of the detected clones appeared to have zzso zzso acid zzso Further, one of the zzso zzso B chains of the clones was identical with that reported zzso In the follow-up study, most of the accumulated clones zzso however, in some, proportions were drastically decreased or increased during the time zzso In particular, one of the clones expanded zzso from 11 to zzso in the zzso zzso population of zzso even though the clone was not detected in zzso In zzso zzso T cell zzso in zzso was persistent, but it appeared to zzso independently of the zzso in zzso The expansion of the clones in zzso may occur by zzso stimuli within the zzso
