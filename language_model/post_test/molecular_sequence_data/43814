The zzso zzso zzso prevents the formation of zzso by specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso The biological and zzso action of zzso on zzso pathogens has been well investigated, but little is known at the molecular zzso Here we report the zzso sequencing and expression of the target of zzso from the major pathogen zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso DNA library was constructed in gamma zzso Express and screened with a DNA zzso obtained by zzso chain reaction with two zzso designed from sequences common to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two types of zzso approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Both contained an identical open reading frame of zzso zzso while a few sequence differences were found in the zzso regions, suggesting an zzso zzso The deduced protein sequence of zzso zzso SE, zzso zzso acids zzso zzso is zzso and zzso identical to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso transcript was observed on Northern blots of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against an internal zzso of zzso zzso SE, recognized a protein associated with the particulate fraction of zzso zzso on Western blots of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso with the expression zzso zzso In zzso from zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso activity was zzso higher than the zzso activity from zzso
