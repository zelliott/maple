Two zzso of zzso zzso one susceptible and one resistant to zzso zzso were previously shown to differ in quantity and activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the target for zzso zzso The resistant isolate also had a lower zzso level of zzso but not of zzso or zzso than the susceptible zzso In the present study a zzso increase in the copy number of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was zzso The amount of zzso zzso transcript in the resistant isolate was eight times greater than it was in the susceptible zzso zzso experiments on zzso blots indicated that this increase in copy number was due to zzso of the entire zzso containing the zzso zzso The zzso instability of the resistant isolate was demonstrated zzso a gradual loss of the duplicated zzso was seen in successive subcultures of the isolate in zzso medium and correlated with zzso to zzso The greater abundance of the amplified zzso induced pronounced differences in the protein patterns of the susceptible and zzso zzso versus that of the resistant zzso as demonstrated by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso zzso of the zzso product indicated zzso of at least 25 proteins and zzso of at least 76 proteins in the resistant zzso
