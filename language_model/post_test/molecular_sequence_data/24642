Studies on the zzso zzso which is crucial to the control of DNA replication in zzso and animal cells, are lacking in zzso We have isolated an zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein and studied its possible connection to the occurrence of zzso regulated zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed zzso in early zzso and its promoter contains an zzso consensus site that mediates the binding of a plant zzso zzso zzso plants carrying an zzso zzso fusion revealed that it is active in zzso cells and, interestingly, in zzso zzso In particular, the extra zzso cycle that occurs in zzso zzso cells is associated with zzso of the zzso zzso This was zzso using zzso zzso zzso altered in their zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in transgenic plants induced zzso and produced a change in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in a zzso and zzso manner by extracts from zzso cells, but it was zzso poorly by extracts from zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is associated with expression of the zzso gene and, most zzso the stability of its zzso it also apparently requires zzso of the zzso zzso These conclusions may apply to zzso cells in other zzso of the plant and to zzso cells in other zzso
