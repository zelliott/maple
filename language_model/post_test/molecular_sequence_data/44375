Three zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso resistant to zzso were isolated and zzso They were found to take up zzso as zzso cells, via an zzso zzso transport system specific for zzso with a zzso of 300 zzso and a zzso of 7 zzso zzso zzso Resistance to zzso was not due to zzso zzso zzso but to zzso expression of the zzso zzso as measured by the specific activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso respectively, of the zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso obtained from zzso cells grown in minimal medium with or without zzso suggested that zzso expression resulted from deficient zzso zzso The enhanced expression of the zzso genes in the zzso was found to result in zzso zzso pools that were two- to fourfold higher than in the wild zzso zzso of the region upstream of zzso revealed in two zzso point zzso mapping on the zzso of the zzso box A, whereas in the third zzso this region did not differ from that of the wild zzso These results suggest that zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso arises from zzso in components of a regulatory system controlling zzso of the zzso genes and zzso zzso sequence elements in front of the zzso promoter may form part of this zzso
