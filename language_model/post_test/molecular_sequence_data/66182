zzso zzso plays a critical role in the growth, development, and metabolism of zzso In this study, two unique zzso that zzso zzso were isolated, cloned and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso of rainbow zzso One zzso zzso zzso 1) encodes a zzso acid protein and the other zzso zzso zzso 2) encodes a zzso acid zzso The sequences share zzso zzso identity and zzso deduced zzso acid zzso zzso real-time zzso revealed that the two zzso zzso were zzso zzso both in terms of distribution among zzso as well as in terms of abundance within selected zzso of juvenile zzso Both zzso 1 and zzso 2 zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso however, only zzso 1 zzso was detected in upper and lower zzso and zzso In all cases where zzso 1 and zzso 2 were zzso zzso 1 was more zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2 also were zzso expressed in various body regions zzso body, and zzso during embryonic zzso Both zzso 1 and zzso 2 zzso were detected early in development (29 days zzso but their expression declined as development proceeded (through 90 days zzso in most cases, unlike the situation in zzso zzso 2 zzso was more abundant than zzso 1 zzso in zzso These findings contribute to our understanding of the evolution, distribution, and function of zzso
