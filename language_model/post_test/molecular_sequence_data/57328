zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso regulate cellular activity by zzso to hormone or sensory zzso zzso receptors zzso the release of zzso from G protein zzso and zzso bound to the empty zzso provides signals that control zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three zzso zzso of the activated zzso are thought to interact with three sites on the zzso G protein to provide zzso interaction and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso is particularly important for interaction with the zzso Here we study the structure of part of the active interface between the zzso zzso zzso and the G protein zzso or zzso using nuclear magnetic zzso An zzso zzso from the C zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso and mimics the G protein in stabilizing its active form, zzso zzso The zzso alpha zzso zzso binds to both excited and zzso zzso and zzso differences between the two bound forms suggest a mechanism for zzso of G proteins by zzso zzso Insight into zzso zzso release will have broad application because the zzso exchange and the intrinsic zzso activity of zzso proteins constitute a widespread regulatory zzso
