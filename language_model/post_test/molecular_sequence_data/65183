zzso zzso zzso zzso is a surveillance mechanism by which zzso cells detect and degrade transcripts containing premature termination zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are essential for this process in organisms ranging from zzso to zzso We present a crystal structure at a resolution of zzso A of the complex between the interacting zzso of human zzso and zzso which are, respectively, a zzso zzso portion of zzso domain and an zzso domain zzso zzso zzso The zzso interface is zzso by highly zzso charged zzso in zzso and zzso and involves the zzso surface of the zzso zzso domain, which is generally used by these zzso to bind zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso does not bind zzso whereas the zzso construct and the complex zzso Our results advance understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso quality control zzso
