zzso of the zzso zzso fat body of newly zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulate zzso in zzso stem cells of zzso zzso cultured in zzso Using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso we have isolated a protein from these fat body extracts that accounts for the observed stem cell zzso zzso analysis of the protein results in a single band of 77 zzso zzso of zzso peptides from this protein are identical to internal sequences of the storage zzso zzso The zzso isolated by our procedure represents a small fraction of the total zzso present in the fat body zzso However, it alone seems responsible for the stimulation of zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso stem zzso
