The zzso zzso consists of two identical zzso molecules zzso linked by their zzso zzso regions zzso zzso The high level of sequence and structural conservation of this region zzso with its important functional involvement in the viral cycle, making it an attractive target for zzso treatments based on zzso zzso Ten unmodified DNA zzso zzso zzso targeted against different zzso structural elements within the zzso zzso were zzso for their capacity to interfere with zzso zzso zzso inhibit gene zzso and prevent virus production in cell zzso The results show that, in addition to the zzso zzso initiation site zzso targeting of the zzso structural element may reflect its direct role in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Similarly, blocking the 3' end sequences of the zzso domain containing the primer zzso site interferes with zzso zzso zzso the zzso portion of the zzso element, however, appears to promote zzso zzso targeted against the zzso zzso signal zzso the primer binding site zzso the major zzso donor zzso or the major packaging signal zzso and zzso structural elements led to a highly efficient zzso of zzso gene expression and virus production in cell zzso Together, these results support the idea that zzso possess great potential as molecular tools for the functional zzso of viral zzso structural zzso Moreover, the targeting of these zzso leads to the potent zzso of viral zzso zzso the potential of zzso structural zzso elements as zzso zzso
