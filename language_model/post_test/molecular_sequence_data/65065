zzso transmission accounts for the majority of human zzso zzso zzso infections worldwide, yet the viral properties that determine transmission fitness or outgrowth have not been zzso Here we show, for eight zzso transmission pairs, that recipient viruses were zzso zzso zzso zzso envelope zzso These viruses were also uniquely sensitive to zzso by zzso from the zzso zzso Thus, the exposure of zzso zzso which are lost in chronic infection because of immune escape, appears to be favored in the newly infected zzso This reveals characteristics of the envelope zzso that influence zzso transmission and may have implications for vaccine zzso
