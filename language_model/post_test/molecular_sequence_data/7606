The zzso gene product of human zzso virus type 1 is a zzso protein that is important for efficient viral replication in zzso cells such as zzso At the cellular level, zzso is primarily localized in the nucleus when expressed in the absence of other viral zzso zzso of zzso into viral particles requires a zzso within the zzso domain of the zzso precursor zzso zzso In the present study, we have used zzso zzso to identify a zzso of zzso involved in zzso incorporation and nuclear zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain, rich in basic zzso resulted in a less stable zzso protein and in the impairment of both zzso incorporation and nuclear zzso However, introduction of individual substitution zzso in this region did not impair zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that this region is necessary for the stability and/or optimal protein zzso relevant to these zzso zzso In contrast, the substitution zzso within the zzso zzso region of zzso that is predicted to adopt an zzso structure zzso from zzso acids 16 to 34) impaired both zzso incorporation and nuclear zzso suggesting that this structure may play a pivotal role in modulating both of these biological zzso These results are in agreement with a recent study showing that the introduction of zzso zzso in this predicted zzso region abolished zzso zzso zzso presumably by zzso this secondary structure zzso zzso zzso zzso Khan, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso Interestingly, our results show that two zzso zzso harboring single zzso acid zzso zzso to F at position 23 zzso and zzso on the zzso face of the predicted zzso coded for relatively stable proteins that retained their ability to zzso to the nucleus but exhibited dramatic reduction in zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso face might mediate zzso interactions required for zzso zzso incorporation but not nuclear zzso Furthermore, a single zzso zzso located on the zzso face of this predicted zzso structure affected not only zzso incorporation but also nuclear zzso of zzso The differential impairment of zzso nuclear zzso and zzso incorporation by zzso in the predicted zzso zzso region suggests that this region of zzso plays a role in both of these biological functions of zzso
