The zzso coli DNA repair zzso zzso plays an important role in the recognition and repair of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso prevents DNA zzso caused by the zzso of A opposite zzso by catalyzing the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is representative of a unique zzso of DNA repair zzso that also contain a zzso zzso which has been implicated in zzso zzso Previously, we have used zzso zzso to individually replace the zzso zzso to the zzso cluster of zzso coli zzso with zzso zzso or zzso These experiments suggested that zzso coordination to the zzso cluster may be zzso in zzso at position zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso and zzso forms indicated that these forms behave nearly identical to the zzso zzso Furthermore, introduction of the zzso zzso in a truncated form of zzso zzso allowed for zzso and structural characterization of the modified zzso cluster zzso The zzso structure showed that zzso coordinated to the iron cluster although comparison to the structure of the zzso truncated zzso indicated that the occupancy of iron at the modified position had been reduced to zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso on samples of zzso indicates that a significant percentage zzso of iron clusters were of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso increases the amount of the zzso cluster by approximately zzso zzso kinetic analysis on samples containing a mixture of zzso and zzso forms indicated that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso does not differ significantly from that of the zzso truncated zzso The relative resistance of the zzso cluster toward zzso as well as the retention of activity of the zzso form, may be an important aspect of the role of zzso in repair of DNA damage resulting from zzso zzso
