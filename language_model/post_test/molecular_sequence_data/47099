zzso zzso zzso cleave off the zzso zzso acid zzso from proteins and zzso Here we describe a zzso that unites classical zzso with other zzso most of which are known (or zzso to participate in zzso zzso bond zzso but not necessarily in zzso zzso It is demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are members of the zzso zzso The zzso site along with the structural core of the protein is shown to be zzso between zzso and another large family of zzso that includes mostly zzso zzso Both families zzso and zzso include not only zzso but also zzso that perform zzso and zzso that catalyze zzso of zzso zzso This is a result of functional convergence that apparently occurred after the divergence of the two zzso
