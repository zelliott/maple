zzso peptides corresponding to zzso acid sequences present in the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso were used to raise zzso rabbit zzso The three peptides described in detail in this report were among seven sequences chosen for initial studies designed to generate zzso capable of recognizing discrete regions of the zzso pol protein from the zzso to zzso zzso Two of the zzso designated zzso and zzso representing zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso of the deduced zzso zzso zzso DNA pol sequence zzso zzso produced zzso that could not only recognize the native zzso pol zzso but also could specifically neutralize zzso zzso pol activity in a zzso zzso An additional zzso designated zzso representing zzso zzso produced an zzso that was unable to recognize the native protein but could react with zzso pol in a zzso form by zzso zzso
