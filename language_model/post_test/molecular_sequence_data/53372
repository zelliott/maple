The zzso dual specificity zzso is involved in the control of the zzso transition of the cell zzso zzso zzso might represent an important aspect of the regulation of its zzso We have examined in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells the zzso of zzso zzso proteins and found that they are nuclear or zzso suggesting the existence of an active zzso zzso zzso analysis of deletion and zzso proteins indicates that zzso contains a putative nuclear zzso signal located between zzso 335 and zzso We also demonstrated that a short 58 zzso deletion of the zzso end of zzso is sufficient to retain it to the zzso zzso analysis indicates that a nuclear export sequence is located between zzso 28 and zzso In addition, treatment of the cells with the zzso zzso zzso B, has the same zzso The zzso of zzso a zzso that is essential for the interaction with zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is therefore dependent on the combined effects of a nuclear zzso zzso a nuclear export signal and on the interaction with zzso zzso
