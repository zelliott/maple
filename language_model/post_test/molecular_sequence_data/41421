The zzso pathogen zzso zzso uses zzso zzso to adhere to zzso zzso on zzso Here we analyzed zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 70 zzso from zzso and zzso human extremes zzso zzso 19 subjects) by zzso sequence typing zzso zzso full-length gene sequencing, and zzso to zzso saliva matched from the strain donors zzso from a zzso sample of defined zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso as well as zzso gene sequences showed unique sequence types between, and identical types zzso the zzso The matched zzso levels ranged widely zzso zzso zzso from low to moderate to high, between subjects but were similar within subjects (or sequence zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso of the strains was narrow, normally distributed for high, moderate, or low zzso reference saliva or pure zzso regardless of the sequence zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and matched zzso and saliva samples correlated zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the host specify about zzso zzso zzso zzso of the variation in matched zzso Half of the variation in zzso zzso zzso zzso to saliva from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was explained by the primary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso also zzso although less so, in zzso to standardized saliva zzso zzso zzso and clustered into three major zzso groups zzso A, zzso and zzso due to two variable zzso segments and diverse zzso sequence types due to a set of zzso zzso zzso with zzso type A versus types zzso and zzso tended to differ in zzso binding zzso and qualitative zzso profiles for saliva zzso zzso In conclusion, the host saliva zzso plays a more prominent role in zzso zzso zzso than anticipated zzso
