The gene zzso the zzso protein of the zzso zzso F was zzso zzso and the gene product was zzso The zzso protein was found in the zzso of cells carrying the F zzso with a smaller amount in the inner zzso zzso I zzso experiments showed that the zzso protein protects three regions in the F zzso locus with different affinity for the upper and lower strands of zzso A zzso motif was identified within the protected regions that represented the zzso zzso The zzso protein was also found to bind to a sequence in the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso that resembles the three binding sites in the F zzso zzso
