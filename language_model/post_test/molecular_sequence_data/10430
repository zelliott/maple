Human zzso candidates, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso D zzso D, zzso zzso were evaluated for their ability to enhance zzso (A zzso zzso when zzso in beta zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso or Cat D and zzso zzso were metabolically labeled with zzso and A beta zzso was zzso in the zzso media by zzso and zzso without showing any significant increase in A beta zzso Because Cat D is known to have a higher affinity for zzso containing the Swedish familial Alzheimer's disease double zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in beta zzso than for the wild type zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 224 zzso zzso the effect of Cat D zzso was tested in a zzso zzso stable cell zzso zzso analysis of the zzso media from these cells did also not reveal any increase in A beta zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso an zzso zzso spanning the zzso site zzso at multiple sites, but the zzso zzso was only a minor one; zzso occurred predominantly at zzso and zzso zzso Human liver Cat D also zzso the same zzso at multiple sites, yet the major zzso at pH zzso occurred at the zzso D1 zzso These findings indicate that zzso does not have the zzso specificity required for a zzso zzso and although Cat D fulfilled the zzso zzso zzso the results of the zzso experiments make both zzso less likely candidates as relevant zzso
