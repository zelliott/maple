A negative, regulatory DNA element from the mouse cellular zzso zzso protein I gene promoter was zzso This DNA element, located approximately 1 zzso upstream from the zzso initiation site of this zzso contained a pair of direct repeats zzso separated by 4 base pairs zzso zzso By examining a series of reporters deleted or zzso within this zzso region, it was concluded that the core sequence of this zzso including both repeats and the zzso was required for zzso activity in the mouse zzso zzso cell line zzso From gel zzso experiments, it was concluded that both repeated sequences were essential for specific protein zzso but the zzso sequence was not as zzso zzso zzso required for protein binding to this zzso were zzso In zzso cells, zzso acid induced the binding of nuclear factors to zzso and suppressed the activities of the reporters containing this zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso beta or zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the expression of this reporter in zzso zzso zzso zzso with in zzso nuclear receptors demonstrated specific binding of this zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso X zzso A biological function of zzso in zzso gene regulation in zzso cells was zzso
