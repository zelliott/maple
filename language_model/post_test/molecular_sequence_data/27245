The zzso tumor zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso factor that plays an essential role in organ development, most notably of the zzso Despite its importance for zzso knowledge of the regulation of zzso expression is zzso Here, we have used zzso in zzso harboring two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in order to define regulatory elements that drive zzso expression in the zzso zzso transgenic lines with approximately 30 zzso of the upstream zzso regions of zzso or zzso almost exactly zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso In the case of zzso we have identified an zzso that is located in the far upstream region that is necessary and sufficient for reporter gene expression in the zzso zzso Regarding zzso we could also identify an zzso that is located approximately 4 zzso upstream of the zzso start site that is required for expression in the intermediate zzso Interestingly, this intermediate zzso zzso is highly zzso between fish and zzso is bound by members of the zzso acid zzso family of zzso factors in gel shift experiments and mediates responsiveness to zzso acid both in zzso and in cell zzso To our knowledge, this is the first functional demonstration of defined regulatory elements controlling zzso expression in zzso The identification of zzso zzso elements will help us to better understand the integration of zzso signals into zzso networks in zzso
