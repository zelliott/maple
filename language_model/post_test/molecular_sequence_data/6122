zzso and point zzso analyses were employed to determine gene products and zzso signals involved in translation, zzso and zzso of barley yellow dwarf virus zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Of the six open reading frames zzso only zzso 1 and 2, which include the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso were required for zzso In zzso translation of these zzso revealed that sequence upstream of the zzso zzso was required for zzso zzso and that a zzso zzso zzso translation more efficiently when located in closer proximity to the translated zzso zzso of the coat protein gene reduced the zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso The zzso extended form of the coat zzso produced by zzso of its stop zzso was not required for zzso Although the zzso product was not necessary, zzso zzso signals in and around zzso were required for zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring various deletions were not zzso in trans by the zzso zzso helper zzso suggesting that replication of zzso zzso may be coupled to zzso
