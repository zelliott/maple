zzso is a repetitive DNA sequence element that is extremely amplified as a common component of two different zzso a tandem repeat zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso To zzso the origin and evolutionary history of zzso zzso we investigated their species specificity among three zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by sequence alignment and zzso with restriction zzso of zzso zzso sequences revealed that the zzso zzso zzso was well zzso among the three zzso species, with small zzso zzso On the other hand, the tandem repeat element zzso in zzso zzso was different from the zzso that zzso zzso and zzso borealis have in zzso Both sequences of zzso and zzso were, however, different segments of the zzso zzso The results suggest that these tandem repeats were formed by partial tandem zzso of the zzso internal sequence in each lineage of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso after their zzso A molecular mechanism for creating and zzso the tandem repeats from the zzso is zzso
