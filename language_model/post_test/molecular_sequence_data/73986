The complete zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and results of a comparison of these sequences with zzso sequences from several zzso species supported affiliation of zzso zzso with the beta 1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso form a zzso cluster that comprises some of the zzso capable of zzso zzso This cluster is related to some zzso and zzso species belonging to the beta zzso In addition, a zzso restriction zzso analysis zzso of some zzso zzso and some related species was carried out by using zzso gel zzso zzso to determine the zzso and zzso zzso patterns and zzso sizes of these zzso The correlation of the zzso results and the zzso zzso analysis results and the usefulness of the two analyses are zzso The zzso fingerprints suggested that zzso zzso strain zzso zzso is related to zzso zzso rather than to zzso zzso as described zzso The distinctive characteristics of the zzso species analyzed in this work, their zzso zzso and their zzso differences from other groups belonging to the zzso including other zzso suggest that these organisms should be transferred to a new zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso
