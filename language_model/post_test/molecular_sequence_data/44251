zzso of the T cell zzso zzso zzso activates a set of zzso protein zzso zzso that assist in delivering signals to the cell zzso Among the presumed zzso for these zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso systems with the zzso zzso complex, figure zzso Previous studies suggested that zzso a zzso protein consisting of a single zzso domain and a region containing potential zzso zzso sites, might serve to join zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso To zzso the zzso roles of zzso in T cell signal zzso we isolated the mouse zzso zzso characterized the structure of the mouse zzso zzso and generated transgenic mice that zzso zzso in zzso Here we report that although zzso becomes zzso during T cell zzso it plays no limiting role in the zzso signaling zzso Moreover, we have distinguished zzso from the more prominent zzso zzso zzso that appear in activated T zzso Together these studies suggest that zzso zzso in signaling from receptors other than zzso receptors in zzso
