Gateway cloning technology zzso zzso cloning of target sequences by making use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Target sequences are first captured in a commercially available zzso zzso and are then zzso into various zzso zzso for expression in different experimental zzso Gateway technology has been embraced by a number of plant laboratories that have engineered destination zzso for promoter specificity zzso protein zzso studies, zzso interaction studies, zzso or zzso protein expression studies, gene zzso by zzso zzso or affinity zzso zzso We review the various types of Gateway destination zzso that are currently available to the plant research community and provide links and references to enable additional information to be obtained concerning these zzso We also describe a set of zzso zzso zzso for zzso plant transformation that zzso fuse zzso zzso zzso zzso or tandem affinity zzso zzso tags onto target zzso with or without an adjacent fluorescent zzso The zzso zzso tags allow the affinity zzso zzso or zzso of zzso proteins expressed in zzso We demonstrate the utility of zzso destination zzso for the expression of zzso proteins that can be affinity captured or localized by zzso zzso zzso detecting the zzso zzso zzso and zzso tags show relatively little zzso with zzso proteins in a variety of zzso and zzso plants, suggesting broad utility for the tags and zzso
