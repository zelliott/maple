A highly zzso 35 zzso zzso zzso the zzso initiation site zzso in the zzso untranslated region zzso of the human zzso virus type I zzso zzso has been identified as the sequence primarily responsible for initiation of viral zzso zzso The zzso zzso viral zzso zzso through a zzso zzso interaction and is converted from an intermediate zzso to a more zzso stable extended duplex zzso in a zzso zzso that is zzso by the zzso zzso protein zzso Here we describe zzso methods designed to probe local zzso dynamics and structural transitions associated with the zzso zzso formation and its zzso zzso structural zzso These methods take advantage of the exquisite sensitivity of the quantum yield of the fluorescent zzso base zzso zzso zzso to its immediate structural and dynamic zzso The zzso zzso methods described allow a detailed kinetic and zzso examination of this type of zzso interaction, as well as an analysis of the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso zzso
