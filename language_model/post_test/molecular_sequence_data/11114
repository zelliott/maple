zzso class I typing performed in parallel by molecular biology and zzso has revealed cases where an zzso class I zzso was identified but the corresponding zzso on the cell surface was not zzso In the present report, we describe three members of a family in whom an zzso zzso identified at the molecular level was typed as A zzso by zzso This zzso blank zzso was nevertheless faintly zzso by zzso focusing zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from the promoter region to the eighth zzso region revealed a point zzso in the zzso site of the second zzso as compared to the normal zzso zzso This zzso could lead to incorrect processing of zzso through a cryptic zzso site located at the beginning of the third zzso and hence to alternative zzso with a frame shift introducing an early stop zzso into the fourth zzso
