We identified zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso induced in zzso mice by zzso with the retinal zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso peptides of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso They were tested for zzso zzso with the native zzso zzso zzso and ability to prevent zzso when given in zzso before zzso challenge with native zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were unable to elicit disease but zzso with zzso by zzso zzso Mice zzso with either of the zzso peptides failed to develop zzso after challenge with the native zzso zzso and had reduced cellular responses by zzso proliferation and by delayed zzso Their zzso response profile to zzso showed reduced zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso mice were increased, and serum zzso zzso to zzso revealed reduced zzso and elevated zzso zzso suggesting a zzso shift in the zzso Protection was zzso with zzso cells from protected donors to zzso recipients, who were subsequently zzso for zzso Thus, zzso zzso prevents induction of zzso by skewing the response to a subsequent zzso challenge with the native zzso to a zzso zzso as well as by zzso zzso regulatory zzso
