A wide spectrum of birth defects are caused by deletions of the zzso syndrome critical region zzso at human zzso zzso Over one hundred such deletions have now been examined and a minimally deleted region of zzso zzso Within these sequences we have identified a gene expressed during human and zzso zzso The zzso named zzso and its zzso zzso encodes a protein containing repeated motifs similar to the zzso zzso found in the zzso of split zzso zzso The zzso product has several features typical of zzso control proteins and in particular has zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso for zzso is at least partly responsible for zzso syndrome and related zzso
