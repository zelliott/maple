Two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso with either a high or a low affinity for zzso were shown to provide zzso of filtered zzso in the zzso We have previously reported the characteristics of the high affinity zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and human kidney and the low affinity zzso zzso zzso from human zzso Because the molecular identity of zzso as the kidney cortical low affinity zzso zzso has been recently challenged based on studies of the zzso low affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Wright, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have reevaluated the properties of zzso in greater zzso We zzso report new data on the regulation of zzso and zzso during kidney zzso To analyze and compare zzso and zzso in adult and embryonic zzso we have cloned and characterized zzso from rat kidney and determined its tissue distribution based on Northern analysis and in zzso zzso When expressed in zzso zzso rat zzso zzso transport of zzso (2 zzso in zzso up to zzso over controls with an apparent zzso of zzso zzso The transport properties zzso a zzso to zzso zzso of zzso and lack of zzso zzso generally matched those of the kidney cortical low affinity zzso We show that expression of rat zzso zzso is kidney specific and that it is strongly and exclusively expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were performed to zzso determine whether zzso zzso to the kidney cortical low affinity zzso zzso of rat kidney superficial zzso zzso into zzso zzso the zzso of zzso (2 zzso zzso We show that hybrid depletion of this kidney zzso using an zzso zzso zzso completely suppresses the zzso These data strongly indicate that zzso is the major kidney cortical low affinity zzso zzso We therefore propose that zzso be renamed zzso zzso addressing the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in embryonic rat zzso reveal that the two zzso zzso are zzso regulated and that there may be a different zzso zzso for zzso in embryonic kidney compared to the zzso
