The African zzso represent a neglected area of zzso zzso zzso the zzso relationships and zzso divergence dates among the living forms will provide insight into the evolution of this group and may shed light upon the evolution of other African primates as zzso This is the first molecular assessment of the evolutionary relationships among the modern zzso zzso which are comprised of the zzso olive, and red zzso zzso Over 4,000 base pairs of zzso DNA were amplified and zzso in over 40 zzso monkey individuals incorporating representatives from all commonly recognized zzso Gene trees were zzso using maximum likelihood and zzso zzso and penalized likelihood was employed to estimate zzso divergence dates among the sampled zzso The results are zzso with some aspects of previous zzso hypotheses based on zzso and zzso although the relationships among several West and Central African zzso differ to some zzso The divergence date analysis suggests that the zzso olive, and red zzso had zzso from one another by the end of the zzso and that by the zzso many of the species lineages were already zzso This demonstrates that the initial extant zzso monkey diversification occurred much earlier than previously thought and was likely part of the same zzso radiation that produced the diverse zzso zzso seen in the African zzso fossil zzso The lack of early members from the modern lineages in zzso deposits suggests that they resided in part in the forests of Central and West Africa, which also currently harbor the highest levels of zzso monkey zzso These forests should not be ignored in models of zzso human and nonhuman zzso zzso
