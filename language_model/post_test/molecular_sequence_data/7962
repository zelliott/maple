zzso zzso is the newest member of the zzso family of zzso zzso proteins and it is highly expressed in muscular zzso during zzso To gain insight into the possible functions of zzso during development, we evaluated its expression in the rat zzso Using an 800 zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso we show that zzso expression begins in zzso cells of the zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso provides zzso of zzso and vascular tissue to the developing zzso After the zzso is complete, zzso is expressed in the zzso space in association with developing blood vessels, and later by zzso dispersed through the zzso zzso A similar pattern of zzso zzso first in zzso tissue surrounding muscle, and then by a subset of cells within muscle, was seen in zzso body wall, zzso and zzso zzso This pattern suggests a role in zzso tissue cell migration and late muscle zzso zzso is also highly expressed in the zzso space at zzso and surrounding developing zzso suggesting an additional role in cell fate zzso Although the pattern of zzso expression is distinct from that of zzso C, they are frequently expressed in close zzso zzso genetic evidence in humans suggests an essential function for zzso and the pattern of zzso expression in heart, skeletal muscle, and limb is consistent with this zzso
