A zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a single stripe of cells in the early neural plate zzso By late zzso the gene is expressed predominantly in zzso two, three and four, and in the anterior spinal zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso protein causes anterior neural zzso with a zzso expansion of zzso and spinal zzso zzso zzso expression zzso anterior neural induction in zzso animal cap zzso zzso without zzso induction of zzso zzso In zzso animal cap zzso zzso zzso expression activates zzso of the zzso expressed neural zzso but not zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso such as zzso can alter zzso patterning in the nervous system in the absence of neural zzso zzso expressed proteins like zzso could be required to overcome anterior signals and to specify zzso cell fates along the zzso zzso
