The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a marker widely used clinically for monitoring zzso zzso Under normal conditions, this zzso is mainly involved in the post zzso degradation of the major human seminal zzso the seminal plasma zzso inhibitor zzso I zzso which is the zzso protein component of human zzso zzso zzso primary structure and activity on synthetic zzso predict a zzso activity whose specificity remains to be zzso The present study was aimed at characterizing the zzso processing of the zzso by zzso zzso zzso was incubated with zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso General zzso zzso zzso heavy metal zzso zzso and zzso and the heavy metal zzso zzso partially or totally inhibited the zzso activity of zzso toward zzso Under identical conditions, other zzso such as bovine serum zzso zzso and zzso were very poor zzso for zzso zzso products were separated by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso activity, and analyzed by zzso and mass zzso The region responsible for the zzso zzso zzso activity and containing an zzso zzso zzso was localized to the zzso portion of the zzso between zzso 85 and zzso On the other hand, a zzso zzso against a seminal zzso zzso zzso recognized fragments derived from the central part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred almost exclusively at either zzso or zzso zzso demonstrating directly for the first time a restricted zzso activity on a zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso is the main zzso responsible for the processing of zzso in human zzso and that this zzso zzso unusual specificity with respect to zzso zzso and sites of zzso
