In search of possible zzso regulatory mechanisms ruling the initiation of zzso by zzso we studied the influences of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso on the zzso in zzso addition of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso were zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso tandem repeat zzso carrying zzso or zzso at different zzso The zzso products were analyzed by zzso mass zzso and zzso degradation for the number and sites of incorporated zzso zzso placed on the first position of the zzso zzso prevents zzso of the second, whereas zzso on the second position of zzso and zzso does not prevent zzso addition to the zzso Multiple zzso zzso suppress any further zzso at the remaining zzso zzso of zzso is zzso affected by zzso at position zzso zzso or zzso zzso and is inhibited by zzso at position zzso zzso suggesting the occurrence of zzso effects on distant zzso zzso zzso studies revealed the accelerated addition of zzso to zzso adjacent to zzso zzso demonstrating positive regulatory effects induced by zzso on the zzso zzso These zzso effects of zzso and zzso could zzso a zzso regulatory zzso
