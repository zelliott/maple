zzso searches in the zzso zzso zzso Database were performed using zzso regions as query sequences to find genes zzso protein regions similar to the zzso parts of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso region in its zzso end, and several other clones that overlapped zzso were zzso The combined data made it possible to assemble a full-length zzso zzso This zzso sequence is zzso zzso containing an initiation zzso zzso an open reading frame of 400 zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso We found zzso identity between the zzso part of the consensus sequence and the zzso sequence named zzso The zzso sequence is fused to the 3' end of zzso generating the zzso fusion transcript found in zzso zzso zzso The zzso therefore represents the full-length transcript of the zzso zzso zzso was localized to zzso by zzso in zzso zzso The 3' and the zzso ends of the zzso zzso probe zzso to a zzso band on Northern zzso filters in all zzso zzso
