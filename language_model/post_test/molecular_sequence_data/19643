zzso plays a central role in the zzso repair of stalled replication zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is a potential negative regulator of zzso zzso Here, we have determined the crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a unique fold and can be divided into three structural zzso tip domain, center domain and base zzso Two such zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso of approximate zzso zzso Of the two zzso zzso within the zzso one interface zzso zzso between zzso zzso is more zzso than the other zzso zzso between base zzso The structure allows us to propose that the zzso zzso binds zzso through the central hole of approximately 30 A zzso The proposed model is supported by our zzso zzso coupled with zzso which indicate that the zzso positively charged zzso on the protein surface around the central hole play important roles in DNA zzso The novel zzso architecture of the zzso zzso has significant implications for its role in zzso zzso
