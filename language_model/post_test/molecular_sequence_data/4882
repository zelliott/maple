The core zzso zzso complex of zzso consists of an assembly of zzso alpha and beta zzso each of which binds one zzso zzso In this study we have used zzso zzso to demonstrate that the zzso zzso binding site of zzso shows a high degree of specificity for the zzso that provides the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso was changed to zzso zzso and zzso and beta zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso genes were expressed to yield both zzso and zzso + zzso zzso in two different zzso zzso None of the zzso zzso formed an zzso complex either in isolation or with zzso Of the zzso of zzso those to zzso and zzso formed zzso complexes but in the latter case the complex was very unstable and occurred at very low cellular zzso In a similar study, the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso complex were changed to zzso However, no complex was formed in either zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso shows zzso of the interaction state of the zzso zzso of one zzso which sheds light on the possible zzso partners for these zzso zzso These data directly address the zzso binding site of the core zzso complex and show that it is subtly different from the zzso binding site of the peripheral zzso zzso A model of this binding site may be proposed from these zzso
