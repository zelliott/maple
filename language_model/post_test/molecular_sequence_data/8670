We studied 12 zzso zzso having similar zzso profiles which did not permit their assignment to any recognized zzso Human zzso was the source for seven of these zzso whereas the other strains were isolated from zzso zzso and blood specimens of adult male zzso These bacteria were found in significant quantities zzso to zzso zzso in zzso specimens from zzso male patients with the diagnosis of zzso These strains had characteristics of the zzso zzso such as 60 zzso G + C in the DNA and zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso in the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso based on comparisons of zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences confirmed that these strains constitute a single new species within the zzso zzso All 12 strains showed similar zzso features, zzso good growth on sheep blood zzso in contrast with poor growth on the same medium supplemented with zzso zzso 80, a positive zzso test in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the presence of zzso Some strains reduced nitrate and zzso zzso or zzso These features allowed us to distinguish these strains from members of any other zzso zzso and the proposed name is zzso zzso with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso The description and zzso of these strains as a new species should be useful for further studies, including evaluations of their prevalence among the normal zzso and their clinical zzso
