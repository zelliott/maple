The putative capsule zzso gene zzso is highly zzso across various zzso zzso zzso but the role of the gene in capsule zzso and bacterial fitness remains largely zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso arise from precursors expressing zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso to zzso To define the zzso role of zzso zzso we characterized the structure and zzso properties of zzso zzso and zzso capsule zzso zzso zzso data revealed that both zzso and zzso zzso are composed of an identical zzso repeat unit, as reported zzso However, in sharp contrast to previous studies on zzso zzso being devoid of any zzso we identified zzso of zzso acid and zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso also contained zzso zzso of zzso a modification that disappeared following in zzso zzso deletion of zzso We also show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso specific for zzso and zzso bound capsule zzso in an zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and to a lesser extent zzso from human donors zzso with zzso zzso zzso displayed stronger binding to zzso compared with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso of zzso This zzso modification can be selectively targeted by zzso in zzso individuals, identifying a potential selective advantage for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
