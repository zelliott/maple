We created a novel zzso form of human zzso zzso in which a positively charged zzso zzso at position 112 was zzso to a zzso charged zzso acid zzso This zzso termed zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso to near zzso zzso was found to be a potent zzso zzso with zzso improved binding affinity to zzso receptors compared with zzso zzso zzso The conclusion of zzso zzso activity was drawn on the basis of approximately zzso improved activity over zzso in several zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in primary zzso zzso proliferation of zzso and zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso B cells, primary zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso neutralized the zzso activity of a zzso fusion protein composed of zzso and a zzso zzso A zzso approximately 10 times better than zzso Based on these results, it was concluded that zzso interacts with much stronger affinity than zzso on all cell types tested and that zzso plays an important role in the interaction with its receptors zzso Thus, these results suggest that zzso may be a useful zzso for the study of zzso interaction with its receptors or, zzso in designing specific targeted agents for zzso zzso
