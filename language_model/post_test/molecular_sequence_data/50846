It has been shown that heavy metal administration induced the synthesis of zzso the small metal zzso zzso with the general structure of zzso in the zzso zzso and in zzso Besides heavy metals, wounds to the cell surface or the incubation with zzso induced the zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso Under these induction conditions, the membrane zzso of the zzso zzso significantly increased suggesting the structural zzso of the zzso In these zzso the zzso zzso formed complexes with the cellular zinc zzso together with or without zzso
