Assuming that new zzso arise mainly during DNA zzso sequence evolution in zzso has been seen as 'male zzso zzso 1) because of the many more cell divisions in zzso than in zzso zzso support for this idea has been obtained from the observation of higher substitution rates in genes on the Y than on the X zzso of primates and zzso which are species with male zzso but has not been confirmed by the zzso analysis of organisms with female zzso The recent suggestion that an intrinsic reduction in the zzso zzso rate may be zzso with male effects in previous zzso and the paradoxical finding of low levels of zzso on the zzso Y zzso indicate that the idea of zzso zzso rate needs to be zzso We have zzso the molecular evolution of the gene zzso which is present on the Z and W sex zzso of zzso The substitution rate at synonymous positions, as well as in zzso DNA, was considerably higher on the Z zzso than on the zzso W zzso with an estimated zzso bias in zzso rate zzso zzso of zzso Thus, evolution appears to be male driven in zzso situation that supports a neutral model of molecular zzso
