zzso Lon zzso catalyze the degradation of various regulatory proteins and abnormal proteins within zzso zzso zzso Lon zzso is a zzso of zzso coli Lon zzso but has two zzso zzso within its zzso zzso zzso We solved the crystal structure of the zzso domain of zzso using zzso anomalous zzso refining it to zzso zzso The structure displays an overall fold zzso in the zzso domain of zzso however, the active site shows uniquely configured zzso zzso zzso that are not seen in zzso which contains a zzso zzso In zzso the zzso half of the zzso segment is an zzso whereas it is a zzso in zzso zzso the zzso of the active sites differ due to the formation of a salt bridge between zzso and zzso in zzso Moreover, unlike zzso zzso has a buried cavity in the region of the active site containing three water zzso one of which is zzso to zzso zzso The geometry and environment of the active site zzso in zzso suggest that the charged zzso assists in lowering the zzso of the zzso zzso group via its zzso potential, and the water in the cavity acts as a zzso zzso during zzso zzso sequence alignment and comparison of the structures of the zzso zzso clearly indicate that Lon zzso can be classified into two groups depending on active site zzso and the presence of zzso or zzso consensus zzso as represented by zzso and zzso
