zzso protein synthesis initiation factor 4A zzso a zzso zzso is involved both in zzso cap recognition and in the binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso probe was zzso complementary to a portion of the published coding sequence of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso and used to screen a mouse zzso zzso We have isolated and characterized a full-length clone from that zzso The zzso sequence is contained in zzso zzso The zzso zzso also has the zzso sequence and two separate zzso zzso zzso analysis of mouse zzso indicates that there are several distinct zzso species coding for zzso Two of these contain the same coding sequence and differ only in the length of the zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso are therefore likely to be the result of differential processing at the zzso We have used a zzso of the zzso clone to measure the zzso levels of zzso zzso during the induced differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protection experiments demonstrated that by the fourth day after induction zzso zzso declined to zzso of its zzso level in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso level of zzso zzso increased dramatically during zzso In zzso zzso zzso using zzso isolated from zzso and induced cells show that the rate of zzso of zzso zzso was zzso greater in differentiated cells, indicating a zzso component is involved in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso
