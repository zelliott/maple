A simple zzso chain zzso zzso zzso was employed for the rapid laboratory diagnosis of human zzso directly from peripheral zzso Whole blood and serum specimens were collected from 243 patients with acute zzso as determined by blood culture, zzso tests, and the patients' clinical characteristics and from a control group of 50 healthy zzso Diagnosis of zzso was established in 179 cases by isolation of zzso zzso in blood culture and in 64 cases by clinical signs and zzso zzso Following the amplification of a zzso sequence of a gene that codes for the synthesis of an zzso membrane protein specific for the zzso zzso the amplified product was detected in a zzso plate by zzso Two hundred zzso of the 243 patients tested had zzso zzso DNA in either whole blood or serum zzso 149 zzso patients were positive in both whole blood and serum zzso 43 zzso were positive in serum specimens only, and 49 zzso were positive in whole blood specimens zzso The diagnostic specificity of the zzso zzso for both zzso categories was zzso while the sensitivity was zzso for whole blood zzso zzso for serum zzso and zzso for whole blood and serum specimens zzso The results suggest that the detection of zzso DNA in whole blood and serum specimens by zzso zzso is a sensitive and specific method that could assist the rapid and accurate diagnosis of acute human zzso
