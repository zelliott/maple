For zzso zzso zzso used as a model system to study zzso and zzso aspects of zzso zzso several nearly zzso colored wild type lines and zzso zzso lines are available, each with a specific zzso in the genes responsible for zzso production zzso zzso zzso and zzso For gene f supposed to code for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the key zzso of the zzso zzso zzso belonging to the group of type III zzso zzso zzso the wild type zzso sequence of zzso zzso line 04 was determined in comparison to the zzso zzso zzso line zzso The type of zzso in the zzso gene was characterized as a single zzso substitution in a zzso zzso coding for an evolutionary zzso zzso into zzso coding for zzso zzso Northern blots and zzso demonstrated that the zzso gene is expressed in flower zzso zzso expression of the wild type and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso coli, verified by Western zzso and zzso zzso with various starter zzso revealed that the zzso protein had no zzso activity, indicating that the strictly zzso zzso zzso is essential for the zzso zzso This zzso which previously was not detected by zzso zzso is discussed in the light of structural and functional information on alfalfa zzso and related type III zzso zzso
