The zzso cell surface is rich with zzso zzso involved in a diversity of biological recognition zzso Dynamic zzso of surface zzso mediate zzso communication in the immune system and host specificity of bacterial and viral zzso In addition, altered surface zzso has been implicated in disease progression of many zzso and may serve as important new targets for zzso Despite the importance of zzso the systematic analysis of zzso zzso zzso has lagged behind the well-studied disciplines of zzso and zzso This zzso is due in part to the unique zzso challenges presented by zzso and the overwhelming diversity of zzso in zzso New zzso technologies have provided a zzso methods with which to probe the zzso Our laboratory has pioneered a shown zzso zzso zzso zzso method that rapidly evaluates differences in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso we present a detailed protocol of our zzso zzso methodology for the differential analysis of zzso zzso
