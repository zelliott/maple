We have isolated a zzso DNA zzso from zzso cells containing the promoter region and the first two zzso of the human gene zzso DNA zzso I zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso at multiple sites which are clustered 247 zzso and 210 zzso upstream of the zzso site of the protein coding zzso The zzso sequence of the region preceding the zzso sites is zzso rich and contains sequence motifs which are known binding sites of the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso factor 1), zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Furthermore, one zzso element is present 50 zzso upstream of the zzso site nearest the zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso boxes were found in the promoter region of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing the sequence elements described above drives the transient expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition we analyzed a zzso zzso containing the promoter and zzso 1 and 2 for regions of zzso I zzso We detected one prominent zzso region in the promoter close to the putative zzso sites and several weaker regions in zzso zzso
