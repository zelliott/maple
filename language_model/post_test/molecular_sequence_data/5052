We studied a zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso in a preparation obtained from fetal bovine serum by zzso affinity zzso This zzso transferred zzso from zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso It required zzso for zzso activity and showed a sharp pH optimum between pH zzso and zzso The apparent zzso value of the zzso for zzso was 51 zzso The specificity was investigated using structurally defined zzso zzso which consisted of chemically zzso zzso zzso and zzso and various zzso zzso with a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso prepared from zzso and zzso by zzso ABC zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso a zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso and a zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso as zzso In contrast, neither a zzso Gal beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso nor an zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso that is a model compound of the reaction product formed by the action of the zzso zzso recently demonstrated in fetal bovine serum zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso as an zzso Besides, all zzso zzso zzso except for the zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso served as zzso and the transfer rates roughly increased with increasing chain zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso terminal zzso markedly enhanced zzso transfer, whereas zzso had little effect on zzso These results indicated that at least two zzso are involved in the zzso of zzso and that zzso reactions may play important roles in chain zzso
