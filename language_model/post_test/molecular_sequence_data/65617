In zzso zzso the earliest definitive marker for the neural plate, which will give rise to the entire central nervous system, is the zzso factor zzso Although some of the zzso signals that regulate neural plate fate have been identified, we know very little about the mechanisms controlling zzso expression and thus neural plate zzso Here, we use zzso for zzso and zzso in the chick zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso screens, zzso zzso and reporter zzso to study protein interactions that regulate expression of zzso the earliest zzso of zzso to be activated and which directs expression to the largest part of the neural zzso We show that interactions between three zzso domain proteins zzso zzso and zzso the zzso proteins zzso and zzso acting as zzso and the zzso zzso zzso acting as zzso control the zzso zzso We propose that this mechanism regulates the timing of zzso expression as part of the process of establishing neural plate zzso
