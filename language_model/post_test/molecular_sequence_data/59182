In this paper we describe the sequence analysis of two zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso which are believed to participate in the transport of the zzso zzso to the zzso in other bacterial zzso The characterized DNA region was isolated by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso which was affected in the production of zzso zzso zzso analysis of this region identified three open reading zzso two were identified as the zzso and zzso zzso The predicted protein sequence of zzso showed significant zzso with zzso binding proteins of the zzso zzso systems, while zzso encodes for a zzso protein probably associated with the zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso in zzso strain was located in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso mapping of the zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso showed that it involved a deletion of approximately zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region with a zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that the zzso in zzso and not the zzso was responsible for the zzso of zzso strain and that zzso and zzso are independent zzso zzso We found that a region located downstream of zzso is reiterated twice, one near the zzso zzso locus while the second in zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso had zzso levels of C1 zzso which did not contain bound zzso This data could suggest that zzso binding to the zzso occurs after the zzso of the zzso form of zzso to the zzso
