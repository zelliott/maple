Forward genetic screens using novel zzso of zzso zzso to soluble compounds identified three independent zzso zzso in the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso These disruptions were mapped and cloned using a newly developed zzso zzso zzso The zzso were demonstrated to be zzso to the zzso genetic zzso This zzso of zzso shows temporally and zzso restricted expression in zzso sensory zzso and zzso show progressive zzso defects of the zzso zzso These results are consistent with a role for this motor protein in the process of zzso zzso zzso zzso acts in concert with a number of other proteins to establish and maintain the structural integrity of the zzso sensory endings in zzso zzso
