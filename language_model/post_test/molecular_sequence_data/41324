Thirteen zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso all of which are capable of causing zzso zzso or zzso With the emergence of the newer zzso zzso zzso the development of an effective vaccine has only become more zzso One of the factors responsible for the generation of zzso diversity is an zzso zzso zzso integral membrane protein known as zzso or zzso zzso functions by adding an zzso group to a specific zzso sugar, thus changing the zzso signature of the parent zzso zzso zzso zzso is a membrane zzso consisting of zzso and zzso zzso zzso bears zzso to several known and predicted zzso with most zzso existing in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In this study, the zzso motifs in the TM regions and in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were targeted for zzso with the aim of identifying the zzso acid zzso essential for the function of zzso We previously identified three critical zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso loop 3 of zzso zzso that these zzso are critical, in this study we suggest a zzso role for zzso and a structural role for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso motifs zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso motif zzso found in TM segments and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso found in zzso zzso were also found to be critical to zzso zzso 

By studying the effect of the zzso on zzso function and zzso an insight into the possible roles played by the chosen zzso acids in zzso was zzso The zzso zzso motifs and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to have an affect on zzso assembly which suggests a structural role for these zzso The zzso and the zzso motifs affect zzso function which could suggest a zzso role for these zzso zzso
