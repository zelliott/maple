Variation in the adhesive protein gene sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso collected in Delaware, zzso zzso and Alaska, respectively, was analyzed by the zzso chain reaction zzso using two sets of zzso zzso The first set, Me 13 and Me 14, was designed to amplify the repetitive zzso The length of the amplified fragments was highly zzso even among samples of the same zzso Another set, Me 15 and Me 16, was designed to amplify a part of the zzso zzso The length of the amplified fragments was uniform in each species and differed zzso 180, zzso and 126 zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The amplified sequence of zzso zzso resembled that of zzso zzso zzso from other sites were also examined by zzso using Me 15 and Me zzso Wild zzso from zzso zzso and cultured zzso from Brittany zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso from the Mediterranean coast of France and wild zzso from Shimizu zzso were identified as zzso zzso Some wild zzso from zzso zzso were identified as a hybrid between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the length of this part zzso zzso of the sequence is proposed as a diagnostic marker for these three zzso similar species and their zzso
