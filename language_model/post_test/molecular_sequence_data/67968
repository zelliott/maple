zzso of viral envelope proteins to specific receptors on human zzso is considered to be an important step in zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that a zzso human liver plasma membrane protein specifically binds to small zzso in a zzso zzso By partial zzso acid sequence analysis of zzso isolated zzso protein zzso with zzso protein obtained from binding zzso on zzso we have identified this zzso protein as zzso II zzso Native human liver zzso zzso binding of zzso to intact human zzso and shows specific binding to small zzso This binding can be inhibited by human liver plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Despite zzso sequence zzso rat liver zzso does not bind to small zzso and does not inhibit significantly (less than zzso binding of zzso to intact zzso zzso of small zzso and zzso human liver zzso resulted in a specific additional protein complex on PAGE with an apparent molecular weight of 90 zzso corresponding to a complex of zzso and small zzso with a ratio of 2 to 1 or 1 to zzso These findings indicate that zzso found in human liver, is a specific zzso protein and might play an important role in the initiation of zzso zzso
