The zzso protein zzso has recently been demonstrated to associate with zzso that is a human zzso of zzso zzso (also named zzso and a member of the family of small zzso proteins named zzso implicated in playing roles in zzso body zzso In addition to the previously isolated zzso for two zzso proteins zzso and zzso we isolated a zzso for a new member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses revealed different expression patterns of the zzso for the three zzso zzso in human zzso zzso messages were expressed at higher levels in all 12 zzso tested in comparison with the zzso and zzso zzso particularly in heart and skeletal zzso The interaction with zzso was detected for each zzso zzso by zzso experiments using zzso of zzso cells expressing each zzso zzso protein and zzso fused with green fluorescent zzso Further, using zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion protein of truncated zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso zzso the direct interactions were detected by a zzso pull-down zzso where zzso showed a stronger interaction than other zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a major binding partner of zzso among the three zzso zzso
