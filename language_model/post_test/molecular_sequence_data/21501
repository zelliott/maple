Members of the zzso family of proteins have opposing roles in programmed cell zzso family members can play either zzso or zzso zzso zzso interactions between zzso and zzso members of the zzso family are critical for the regulation of zzso and are important targets for cancer zzso zzso family interactions are zzso by the zzso zzso domain, corresponding to a single zzso zzso which binds in a zzso zzso of its zzso family interaction zzso Here, using a zzso zzso interaction zzso based on bacterial cell surface display and flow zzso we present quantitative data for a near-complete set of 17 zzso zzso from the human zzso binding to each of the 5 zzso zzso family zzso zzso insights into the affinity and specificity of these interactions are provided by analysis of the zzso zzso In addition we carried out a zzso study of the zzso zzso domain to define the core zzso responsible for zzso protein zzso The zzso data from this study has implications both in basic research on zzso and in the design of zzso cancer zzso
