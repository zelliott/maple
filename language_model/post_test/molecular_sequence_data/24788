Our recent analysis indicates that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is critical for its high-level zzso activity, suggesting that mature zzso in the zzso are more accessible to zzso than zzso in the nucleus zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 2001, zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 2001, 29, zzso Although studies in zzso zzso led to the proposal that only correctly processed mature zzso are exported from zzso in a zzso manner zzso and zzso Science 1998, zzso zzso our zzso with an extended 3' end can also be exported to the zzso in zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso cells, with recognition basically resembling the recognition of mature zzso In contrast, no binding to zzso zzso occurred in zzso zzso The injection of a nuclear extract of zzso zzso together with zzso zzso inhibited the export of zzso zzso but not mature zzso in zzso cells, suggesting the existence of an zzso of the zzso export zzso Moreover, the zzso appears responsible for a zzso mechanism that operates in zzso
