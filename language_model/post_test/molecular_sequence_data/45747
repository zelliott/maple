The molecular diversity and zzso relationships of two class II genes of the zzso whale major zzso complex were investigated and compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 2 provided sequences showing high zzso and zzso zzso diversity and uninterrupted reading frames consistent with functional class II zzso found in related zzso zzso zzso Cloning of amplified products indicated gene zzso in the zzso whale and zzso in the southern right zzso with average zzso diversity of zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso of each zzso zzso higher zzso divergence at sites coding for zzso binding zzso for zzso and zzso for southern right) suggested that these zzso were subject to positive zzso zzso A population survey of zzso zzso detected 23 zzso differing by up to zzso of their zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 2 resulted in two groups of zzso One was most similar to the zzso of the cow and present in all zzso screened to date, including zzso zzso The second was most similar to the zzso of the cow and was found only in the zzso and right zzso Both zzso showed low diversity among species and apparent loss of function or altered function including interruption of reading zzso Finally, comparison of zzso protein sequence of the zzso locus suggested convergence with the zzso perhaps resulting from zzso conversion or zzso
