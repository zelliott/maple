zzso zzso has been used as a zzso to control agricultural zzso zzso zzso group zzso were found to have a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso with 20 to zzso identity to viral zzso zzso which can enhance viral infection by degradation of the zzso zzso zzso of the insect zzso In this study, the bel gene was found to have an activity similar to that of the viral zzso zzso A bel knockout zzso was constructed by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The 50% lethal zzso of this zzso plus the zzso zzso protein gene were about zzso higher than those of the zzso zzso When zzso zzso was mixed with the zzso protein and fed to zzso zzso larvae, 3 zzso zzso alone induced zzso zzso Meanwhile, the mortality rate rose to zzso when the same amount of zzso was mixed with zzso zzso of zzso zzso observation showed a significant disruption detected on the zzso PM of zzso zzso larvae after they were fed zzso In zzso degradation zzso showed that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso larvae to various degrading products, similar to findings for viral zzso These results imply zzso toxicity enhancement depends on the destruction of zzso PM and zzso similar to the case with viral zzso This discovery showed that zzso has the potential to enhance zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and transgenic zzso
