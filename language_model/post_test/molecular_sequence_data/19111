Group I zzso are zzso zzso zzso that zzso themselves from zzso primary transcripts by catalyzing two successive zzso zzso These zzso zzso can be converted into zzso zzso which can modify the sequence of a separate zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso Previous work on zzso zzso has mostly focused on the zzso zzso group I zzso zzso from zzso zzso Here, we test the zzso potential of the zzso group I zzso zzso from the zzso zzso This zzso is only half the size of the zzso zzso and folds faster into its active zzso in zzso Our results showed that in zzso the zzso and zzso zzso favored the same set of zzso sites on a zzso zzso Both zzso showed the same zzso efficiency when containing their individually zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the previously zzso zzso design of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso was most efficient with a zzso design that resembled the secondary structure context of the natural zzso zzso zzso which includes zzso between the zzso zzso portion and the zzso 3' zzso These results suggested preferred zzso interactions for the zzso zzso under zzso in zzso zzso Despite the high activity in zzso however, the zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso in zzso coli cells was significantly below that of the zzso zzso
