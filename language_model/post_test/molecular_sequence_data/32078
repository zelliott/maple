Species of zzso are an important component of the zzso zzso of freshwater zzso particularly fishes, and yet their systematic relationships with other zzso have not been zzso zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes from 3 representative species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and from 79 other zzso representing 78 families of zzso obtained from zzso were used in a zzso analysis to address the relationships of zzso with other zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of combined zzso and zzso zzso gene sequence data place 2 of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso with species of zzso and zzso which, in turn is sister to a zzso containing zzso zzso and representatives of zzso zzso and zzso a grouping supported by high zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is not an zzso a conclusion that is supported by reported differences between its zzso and that of other zzso Although details of the life cycle of zzso the sister zzso to zzso remain unknown, the relationship of zzso and zzso is consistent with their zzso development in zzso rather than zzso zzso and with their host relationships zzso freshwater zzso The results also indicate that, whereas zzso is not a zzso zzso it is not included within the zzso zzso No support was found for a direct relationship between zzso and zzso zzso
