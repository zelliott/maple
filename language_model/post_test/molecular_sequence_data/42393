zzso is a zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso It contains four zzso zzso Since the zzso bonding is critical for biological zzso it is very important to assign the zzso linkage in this zzso zzso was incubated in 250 zzso zzso acid at 100 degrees C for 4 zzso under zzso Under these conditions, many overlapping zzso peptides were identified by zzso mass zzso zzso zzso data indicate that the four zzso bonds are zzso zzso 11, zzso zzso 32, zzso zzso 37, and zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first time all four zzso bonds in zzso have been assigned in one experiment without zzso bond zzso This approach, which combines zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso may be very useful for assigning zzso bridges in other proteins from the zzso zzso
