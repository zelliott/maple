We have used rat zzso zzso to identify zzso genes that could play an important role in zzso differentiation or zzso Here, we report the cloning and identification of a zzso zzso coding for a putative protein that we have designated as zzso The novel gene is expressed predominantly in zzso zzso and its expression is induced early during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were regulated by the nutritional status of animals, being zzso induced during zzso In zzso zzso gene expression was zzso by zzso in a zzso manner but not by zzso suggesting that zzso could mediate the increase in zzso zzso levels observed during zzso zzso zzso codes for a zzso acid putative protein containing a zzso domain, characteristic of many plant zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of enhanced green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso cells showed that the fusion protein localized in the zzso Moreover, cells zzso zzso by zzso showed an increase in zzso zzso Interestingly, we also found that the zzso gene expression level was lower in zzso and zzso obese mouse zzso Overall, our data suggest that the newly identified zzso gene codes for an zzso protein that may function as a zzso and play a role in the zzso response to a low energy state, such as zzso by providing fatty acids to other zzso for zzso In addition, decreased expression of zzso in obesity models suggests its possible contribution to the zzso of zzso
