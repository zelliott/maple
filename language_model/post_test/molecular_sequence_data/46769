The zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso the precursor of the essential zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is present in bacteria and plants but is absent in zzso Due to their conservation in bacterial species and their absence in humans, the zzso synthesis genes should be well suited either for detection of bacterial DNA in human specimens or for the differentiation of zzso bacteria by molecular zzso A DNA zzso carrying the genes zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, was isolated from a zzso DNA library of the human pathogen zzso zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene region in strains of zzso zzso which were previously shown to be genetically different, revealed that the zzso gene is highly zzso at the species zzso zzso amplification with zzso derived from the zzso locus of zzso zzso was used to isolate the corresponding DNA regions in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso synthesis genes are zzso and show the same zzso genetic organization in all four zzso zzso zzso zzso designed on the basis of localized differences within the zzso DNA region were successfully used to develop zzso zzso zzso for the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results obtained indicate that the zzso synthesis genes are excellent targets for zzso differentiation of these emerging zzso The zzso zzso developed should increase our diagnostic potential to differentiate zzso species, especially zzso zzso and the newly recognized species zzso zzso
