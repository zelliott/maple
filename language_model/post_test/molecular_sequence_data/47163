zzso of zzso zzso regulation have suggested a role for zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Given the presence of at least four possible consensus recognition sites for zzso on the zzso zzso zzso a reasonable hypothesis is that some of these zzso effects are caused by zzso of the zzso As an initial test of this hypothesis, we used zzso zzso to create a zzso zzso zzso with zzso at each of its four potential zzso zzso zzso The modified zzso acids are as zzso zzso to zzso zzso to Ala, zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso receptors zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells suggests that the zzso have no effect on zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or on functional zzso with respect to zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cells expressing either the zzso or zzso zzso receptors results in an zzso loss of zzso binding activity zzso in an identical zzso In contrast, the time of onset of zzso zzso is greatly attenuated in the quadruple zzso zzso After 1 h of zzso zzso the zzso zzso exhibits approximately zzso zzso of the zzso response, whereas the zzso zzso is zzso by only approximately zzso Further analyses of single zzso zzso in which only one of the four putative zzso sites is zzso reveals that zzso in the third zzso loop of the zzso protein is primarily responsible for regulating the zzso zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso of the zzso zzso on zzso is important for rapid zzso zzso zzso
