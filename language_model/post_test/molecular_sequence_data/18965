The protein zzso zzso was identified over a decade ago and recently raised great interest as its derived zzso zzso was shown to reduce food intake and body weight in zzso However, the involvement of zzso in feeding behavior has not well been studied in zzso In the present study, we characterized the structure, distribution, and meal responsive of zzso in zzso zzso zzso for the first zzso The full length zzso of zzso was zzso pair zzso which zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso including a 23 zzso acid signal zzso A high conservation in zzso sequences was found in zzso however the proposed zzso zzso site zzso zzso among other species is not present in zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in all test zzso and abundant expression was detected in several regions including the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression respond to feeding status change may vary and be tissue zzso zzso zzso levels significantly increased zzso in the zzso and zzso after feeding and substantially decreased zzso during a week food deprivation in the zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso in the zzso was significantly elevated zzso during food zzso and a similar increase was also found after zzso zzso This points toward a potential zzso specific local role for zzso in the regulation of metabolism during food zzso zzso these results provide the molecular and functional evidence to support potential zzso and zzso roles for zzso in zzso
