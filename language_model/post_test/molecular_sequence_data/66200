The zzso mouse zzso gene cluster contains more than 30 zzso genes that are candidates to regulate multiple steps in male and female zzso The founding member of the zzso gene zzso zzso is an zzso gene expressed in zzso cells that promotes the survival and differentiation of the adjacent male germ zzso Here, we report the first identification and characterization of a zzso zzso This zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso with tumor zzso activity that we found is zzso regulated by zzso in the zzso in zzso zzso analyses in cell lines of different origin indicated that zzso zzso of zzso requires another zzso zzso zzso zzso of other mouse zzso family members revealed that mouse zzso and zzso also have the ability to zzso zzso zzso The human zzso protein zzso zzso also had this ability, indicating that zzso repression is a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified a zzso element in the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso regions typically house zzso zzso several lines of evidence indicated that zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The repression of zzso expression by zzso may, in part, mediate the zzso function of zzso in the zzso as we found that zzso zzso mice have decreased germ cell zzso in the zzso Along with our other data, these findings led us to propose a model in which zzso is a negative regulator upstream of zzso in a zzso zzso that promotes zzso zzso
