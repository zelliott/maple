Nuclear protein 1 zzso is a stress-related protein and closely related to zzso in the development of zzso In the present paper, the full-length zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was isolated by zzso technology for the first zzso The putative zzso protein consists of 66 zzso acids with a basic zzso zzso motif and a zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso Multiple sequence alignments revealed that the putative zzso protein sequence was relatively zzso across species, especially in the zzso zzso The expression of zzso is widely distributed during zzso zzso zzso This is followed by a dramatic zzso after zzso and is newly zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso transcripts are highly zzso under conditions of high zzso and low zzso These findings suggest that zzso is stress-related and may act as a protective factor in embryonic zzso
