zzso domain zzso factors have two separate zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain zzso Each zzso recognizes a specific zzso of 4 or 5 zzso in the zzso recognition zzso The zzso zzso zzso are connected by a 23 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso To investigate the requirements for the zzso and its role in DNA recognition, we constructed zzso zzso in which the zzso are connected with zzso varying in length between 2 and 37 zzso zzso zzso to the natural zzso site required a minimal zzso length of between 10 and 14 zzso zzso A zzso domain with an eight zzso acid zzso however, had a high affinity for a site in which the zzso recognition sequence was zzso Computer zzso shows that inversion of the zzso zzso shortens the distance between the zzso sufficiently to enable an eight zzso acid zzso to bridge the zzso zzso I zzso as well as zzso of the zzso site confirms the zzso orientation of the zzso zzso Switching of the zzso and zzso zzso and separation by 3 zzso leads to a large distance which could only be bridged effectively by a long 37 zzso acid zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso affected zzso As shown by surface zzso resonance zzso this was caused by a decrease in the zzso Our data indicate that there are both length and sequence requirements in the zzso region which allow flexibility leading to selective binding to differently spaced and oriented zzso
