zzso are ubiquitous hydrogen zzso zzso that are central to the cellular zzso zzso Of two zzso activities detected in the fungus zzso zzso the zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso A zzso Here we characterize a second zzso zzso identified after probing a zzso library with zzso and demonstrate that it encodes zzso zzso This zzso designated zzso predicts a zzso zzso zzso showing zzso identity to an zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity to zzso zzso zzso zzso similar levels of identity are found when comparing zzso to zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the predicted zzso of a presumed zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the last two peptides share a zzso zzso The zzso B activity was barely zzso in asexual spores zzso disappeared after zzso and started to accumulate 10 h after spore zzso throughout growth and zzso The zzso zzso was absent from zzso and its zzso correlated with zzso activity, suggesting that zzso expression is regulated at the zzso zzso In contrast, the high zzso activity found in spores was lost gradually during zzso and zzso In addition to its zzso regulation, zzso was induced by zzso heat zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso but not by zzso zzso This pattern of regulation and the protective role against zzso offered by zzso and zzso at different stages of the zzso zzso life cycle, suggest that zzso gene zzso performs the function of satisfying zzso demand at the two different stages of zzso and genetic regulation represented by growing zzso versus zzso Alternative zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso were indicated by the fact that zzso double zzso were able to grow in zzso whose zzso generates zzso
