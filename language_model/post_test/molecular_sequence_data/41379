The zzso zzso zzso pump zzso resistance to a wide variety of antibiotics and other compounds in zzso zzso Here we show that zzso (formerly named zzso a zzso inner membrane zzso associates with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in the absence of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicate that this interaction occurs through the inner membrane protein zzso The highly zzso zzso gene is zzso with zzso through induction by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso lacking zzso are sensitive to many, but not all, of the antibiotics transported by zzso This differential zzso sensitivity suggests that zzso may enhance the ability of the zzso pump to export certain classes of zzso
