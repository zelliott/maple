zzso A factor X zzso was isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a zzso zzso of 75,000 and an zzso point of zzso Upon reduction, this zzso migrated as two bands with zzso zzso of 16,000 and 14,000 in sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso The zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso shortened activated partial zzso time zzso of normal plasma and factor zzso plasma from zzso zzso Factor X incubated with isolated zzso and calcium zzso drastically shortened zzso of factor zzso plasma and expressed zzso activity against synthetic zzso for factor zzso however no zzso activity was detected with the zzso alone, indicating that the zzso converted factor X to the active zzso
