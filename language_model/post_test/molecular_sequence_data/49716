The development of zzso inflammation in zzso A zzso zzso has been associated with various zzso including zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso A zzso zzso in the promoter region of the zzso gene zzso at position zzso has been described zzso and zzso and is associated with increased zzso production for the zzso zzso Another zzso zzso has been described for zzso which is functional and associated with increased production of zzso for the zzso zzso 

We have studied these two zzso in 242 Caucasian patients with zzso zzso zzso male, 73 zzso who were followed from 1990 to 1999, and in 210 appropriate local Caucasian controls zzso male, 77 zzso for comparison of zzso and zzso zzso 

The respective zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso in zzso vs zzso zzso and zzso in controls zzso For zzso the zzso of the respective zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly different zzso zzso zzso with an increased frequency of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients (24 vs zzso The combination of zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that compared with controls, patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were more common (18 vs zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso we could not demonstrate significant differences between the different zzso of zzso However, zzso zzso patients zzso and zzso zzso had more chronic zzso failure than others zzso vs zzso at last follow-up and their survival without chronic zzso failure zzso was zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso were not an independent risk factor for the progression of the zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso seem to influence the occurrence or initiation of the disease, but do not play a significant role, if any, in the progression of zzso zzso
