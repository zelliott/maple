Previous data indicated that zzso zzso zzso S zzso zzso Ras at multiple zzso One site appeared to be zzso but the second site could not be zzso In this study, the sites of zzso of zzso by zzso were directly zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso zzso Ras to a zzso of 2 zzso of zzso incorporated per zzso of zzso zzso occupancy did not influence the zzso or zzso of zzso of Ras by zzso zzso degradation and mass zzso of zzso zzso generated peptides of zzso Ras identified the sites of zzso to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso the double zzso zzso to a zzso of 1 zzso of zzso incorporated per zzso of zzso which indicated that Ras possessed an alternative site of zzso The alternative site of zzso on Ras was identified as zzso which was on the same zzso as zzso zzso and zzso are located within two different secondary structure zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and are zzso separated within the three-dimensional structure of zzso The fact that zzso could zzso a target protein at multiple sites, along with earlier observations that zzso could zzso numerous target zzso were properties that have been attributed to several zzso zzso This prompted a detailed alignment study which showed that the zzso domain of zzso possessed considerably more primary zzso acid zzso with the zzso zzso than the bacterial zzso These data are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso may represent an evolutionary link between bacterial and zzso zzso
