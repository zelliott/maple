The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso having the zzso modification of the zzso bond, has been determined by zzso zzso zzso The zzso are zzso space group zzso with a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, zzso zzso zzso The structure was solved by direct methods and refined with zzso zzso factors to a final R value of zzso for the zzso observed zzso Reversal of the zzso zzso bond zzso the folding tendency of the backbone shown by the parent zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are found in the zzso and the extended zzso zzso zzso hydrogen bonding is not zzso The molecules in the crystal are held together by the formation of two zzso hydrogen bonds of the zzso zzso zzso type with N zzso O distances of zzso and zzso A, zzso
