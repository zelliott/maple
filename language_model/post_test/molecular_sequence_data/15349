zzso hormones produced by zzso cells in the central or peripheral nervous systems regulate various zzso and behavioral events during insect development and zzso zzso is a major zzso family, characterized by a zzso zzso zzso zzso This family of peptides has been implicated in regulating various zzso functions including, zzso zzso muscle contraction, zzso induction or zzso zzso and zzso formation in different insect zzso In the present study, we report a new member of the zzso family from the red imported fire zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso Three additional peptides were deduced from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that zzso to zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are found in many zzso zzso Five zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso are zzso from zzso genes of zzso zzso but in the fire zzso the zzso is zzso Each of the four synthetic peptides from the fire zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso activity in a zzso model, indicating that these peptides are zzso zzso induced the highest amount of zzso production of the four peptides zzso The zzso zzso had the lowest zzso activity, but was still significantly greater than control zzso When the deduced zzso acid sequences zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso were compared with other known zzso the fire zzso was most similar to the honey zzso but zzso distant from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso unlike the other three peptides shows a low degree of sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso acid sequences zzso from insect zzso genes identified to date, zzso diversity is correlated with the zzso or zzso zzso of zzso From the present study we report the first zzso identified and characterized from the central nervous system of zzso
