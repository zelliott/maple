zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso is thought to facilitate protein synthesis by participating in the nuclear export of specific zzso In zzso there are three zzso of zzso One of them, zzso has been shown to be expressed in vascular zzso specifically developing vessel members, using zzso as a zzso In order to determine whether zzso plays a role in zzso formation, its full-length zzso was zzso zzso in transgenic zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso area of the zzso in the main zzso stems of transgenic plants was zzso higher than those of corresponding zzso stems of zzso zzso In zzso zzso the primary zzso typically comprised six cell layers and was approximately 105 zzso thick, but increased to zzso cell zzso zzso zzso thick, in transgenic zzso Similarly, the secondary zzso increased from six cell zzso approximately 70 zzso thick, in control stems to approximately 9 cell zzso zzso zzso thick, in transgenic zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso using zzso technology resulted in the major suppression of zzso formation compared with control plants, and the zzso transgenic plants were also zzso These data collectively indicate that zzso plays a role in zzso
