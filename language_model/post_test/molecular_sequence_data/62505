To construct a zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso promoter and zzso gene for specific expression of zzso gene in zzso producing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Based on the zzso expression system, the human immediate early zzso promoter zzso zzso was removed from the zzso zzso and replaced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter that was zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso The enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso gene was inserted into the zzso site zzso and then the zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso promoter and zzso gene was zzso zzso of a normal liver cell line zzso a zzso cell line zzso and a cervical cancer cell line zzso were zzso with the zzso Northern zzso and zzso zzso were used to detect the expression of the zzso gene at zzso or protein level in three different cell zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso promoter was zzso through zzso from the human zzso The zzso promoter and zzso gene were directly inserted into the zzso zzso as confirmed by restriction zzso and DNA zzso Northern zzso showed that zzso gene was markedly transcribed in zzso cells, but only slightly in zzso and zzso zzso In addition, strong green zzso was observed in zzso cells under a zzso zzso but zzso was very weak in zzso and zzso zzso 

Under control of the zzso zzso human zzso promoter, the zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso gene can be specially expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso system can be used as a novel, potent and specific tool for zzso therapy for the zzso positive primary zzso zzso
