zzso and zzso fruits have traditionally been viewed as representing two distinct zzso of zzso associated with differential zzso and zzso hormone zzso In zzso zzso such as tomato and zzso the zzso process is marked by increased zzso and is induced and zzso by zzso while in zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso it is controlled by an zzso process with little change in zzso zzso The two contrasting mechanisms, however, both lead to texture, zzso and zzso changes that probably reflect some common zzso of regulatory zzso It has been shown that a zzso gene is necessary for normal zzso in zzso It has been demonstrated here that zzso a zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso leads to the zzso of normal development and zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, analysis of zzso profiles reveals zzso effects of zzso on fruit development and zzso gene zzso It is concluded that zzso genes play a central role in the zzso regulation of zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso These findings provide important information to extend the molecular control of zzso in a zzso fruit beyond the limited genetic and cultural options currently zzso
