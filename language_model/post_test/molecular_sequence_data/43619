A continuous zzso zzso sequence from human zzso 6 zzso B zzso strain zzso zzso zzso number zzso is genetically zzso with a discrete segment of the human zzso zzso zzso region and with zzso zzso A zzso Short zzso sequence zzso at multiple sites within an zzso zzso region immediately 3' to the zzso zzso zzso revealed additional zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies with the predicted zzso sequences from 11 complete and 12 partial zzso open reading frames zzso revealed that most zzso proteins zzso to varying degrees in all previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and major zzso zzso Several zzso proteins had limited zzso acid similarity to their zzso zzso in other zzso Each gene identified is highly zzso to its zzso counterpart, including two unique zzso genes predicted to zzso zzso zzso However, two regions of substantial divergence were noted, one spanning the origin of replication and the other zzso one of the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso in the latter region lead to predicted differences in reading frames and protein lengths among zzso zzso
