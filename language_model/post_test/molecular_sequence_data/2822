A sequence of zzso zzso is reported for the zzso of potato zzso zzso zzso The sequence contains six large open reading zzso and zzso regions of 174 zzso at the zzso end, 141 zzso at the 3' end and 197 zzso between two large blocks of coding zzso The zzso coding region encodes two zzso of 28,000 zzso and zzso which overlap in different reading frames and circumstantial evidence suggests that the third open reading frame in the zzso block is translated by zzso zzso near the end of the zzso zzso to give a zzso zzso The zzso part of the zzso protein contains the consensus sequence for zzso zzso zzso In zzso translation of zzso zzso resulted in the synthesis mainly of zzso and zzso zzso and the largest product made was about zzso these sizes are similar to those predicted for the translation products of the zzso block of coding zzso The 3' block of coding sequence codes for three zzso a zzso coat zzso a zzso zzso which is zzso in a different frame, and a zzso zzso which immediately follows the coat protein coding zzso and is in the same reading zzso zzso evidence suggests that the zzso zzso is translated by zzso of the amber termination zzso of the coat protein zzso The zzso acid sequences zzso by the 3' block of coding sequence show many similarities with analogous zzso translated from the zzso sequences of zzso of barley yellow dwarf virus, zzso strain zzso and, in particular, beet western zzso virus zzso The zzso zzso has some similarities with the putative zzso of southern bean mosaic virus and much more extensive similarities with the corresponding zzso zzso but almost none with that of zzso In contrast, the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso is not like that of proteins of the other zzso or of viruses in other zzso The zzso sequences reported will appear in the zzso zzso and zzso databases under the zzso number zzso
