G zzso receptors zzso are part of zzso networks called zzso These zzso interacting proteins zzso in the zzso control the zzso trafficking and signaling of zzso zzso domain proteins constitute the largest protein family among the zzso and the zzso function of the zzso domain proteins is to assemble signaling zzso components into close proximity by recognition of the last four zzso zzso acids of zzso We present here a machine learning based approach for the identification of zzso zzso domain zzso In order to characterize the network of interactions between zzso acid zzso that contribute to the stability of the zzso zzso complex and to zzso the complex into a feature zzso zzso acid contact zzso and zzso distance zzso were constructed and zzso This novel machine learning based method displayed high performance for the identification of zzso zzso interactions and allowed the identification of novel zzso domain protein zzso
