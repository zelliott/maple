zzso analyses of zzso zzso binding to its zzso zzso have shown that some zzso cells display a zzso nature of the zzso curve, indicating the presence of two classes of binding sites with different zzso The zzso basis accounting for this observation is zzso We found that the culture of a human zzso cell line with zzso an inhibitor of zzso converted the zzso zzso plot to a single phase with zzso zzso zzso plots of baby zzso kidney zzso cells that had been engineered to express cloned mouse zzso were also zzso and the plots of cells cultured with zzso became a single phase with zzso zzso Mouse zzso is zzso at one zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in which zzso zzso responsible for zzso was replaced with zzso zzso was expressed on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was similar in zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso cells that expressed zzso zzso showed zzso zzso plots that were converted to zzso plots with only zzso sites by zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso sugar of zzso is not involved in the manifestation of two classes of binding sites, and that there is a yet unidentified zzso crucial for the zzso characteristics of zzso
