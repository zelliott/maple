The major outer membrane protein of zzso zzso zzso CD, was zzso from the bacterial cell wall and zzso to zzso in high yields by a simple zzso The zzso protein appeared to exhibit zzso properties similar to those of native CD exposed on the surface of the zzso zzso to CD raised in mice specifically bound to intact zzso zzso as determined by flow zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso from mice zzso with zzso CD or with zzso zzso were also zzso CD was found to be zzso zzso among a panel of zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by the consistent zzso of mouse zzso zzso with a common 60 zzso protein on zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso collected from patients with zzso media due to zzso zzso infection were found to be zzso with the CD protein by zzso Finally, the zzso protein induced zzso in guinea pigs and mice that exhibited in zzso zzso activity against the zzso zzso the native CD outer membrane protein represents a potentially useful zzso for inclusion in a vaccine against zzso zzso
