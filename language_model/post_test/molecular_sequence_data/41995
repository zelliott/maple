The zzso of plant storage proteins is controlled primarily by the zzso zzso of their zzso Two classes of storage zzso the zzso or zzso and the zzso such as zzso zzso have been zzso Gene expression analysis in transgenic plants has defined small regions of the promoters of such genes that are able to zzso the appropriate patterns of zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso have revealed proteins that bind to regions implicated in zzso and these may be zzso zzso zzso deletion analysis has determined the role of some of these zzso zzso such as in determining zzso or levels of zzso A common theme linking the expression of both classes of storage proteins is the involvement of zzso levels in directly controlling gene zzso
