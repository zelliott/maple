zzso coli zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso zzso the production of zzso the zzso donor compound required for synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso We report the molecular cloning of human and mouse zzso of the zzso zzso designated zzso which contains an zzso zzso zzso at a site corresponding to the zzso putative active zzso These sequences allow the identification of zzso gene zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso which had been previously zzso due to their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are elevated in zzso previously implicated in the synthesis of zzso and in active sites of blood cell zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso is zzso upon zzso of T zzso and have mapped the zzso gene to mouse zzso zzso Using the mouse gene isolated from the zzso cell line zzso we devised a construct for protein expression that results in the zzso of a zzso tag sequence at the N zzso of the zzso zzso This strategy allowed us to document the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the incorporation of zzso into zzso These results suggest the existence of an zzso mechanism involving the incorporation of zzso into zzso that might be relevant to blood cell zzso This mechanism is likely to have been present in ancient life forms and zzso in a variety of living organisms from all zzso of zzso
