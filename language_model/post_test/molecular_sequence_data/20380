The zzso zzso zzso family of proteins are cell wall anchored zzso expressed on the surface of oral zzso The zzso proteins interact with molecules on other bacteria, on the surface of host cells, and with zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and one of the primary zzso that initiate the formation of the oral zzso zzso zzso expresses two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are closely zzso One of the zzso of zzso called the variable zzso domain, is significantly different from corresponding zzso in zzso and all other zzso zzso As a first step to zzso the differences among these zzso we have determined the crystal structure of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso at zzso A zzso The domain comprises a zzso with a putative binding zzso stabilized by a metal zzso The overall structure of the zzso zzso is similar to the previously reported zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso despite their low sequence zzso In spite of the zzso architecture of the binding zzso the cavity is significantly smaller in zzso which may provide clues about the difference in zzso zzso We also verified that the metal in the binding zzso is a calcium zzso in zzso with previous biological zzso It was previously suggested that zzso zzso are zzso zzso However, we tested that hypothesis by screening the zzso zzso for binding to over 400 zzso and found that the domain does not interact with any of the zzso
