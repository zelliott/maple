We have examined zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso gene expression for evidence of zzso in 15 zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in all but one sample of normal juvenile kidney and liver, and in zzso associated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso adrenal zzso A single patient with zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso expression of the zzso derived zzso zzso in normal zzso associated zzso zzso and in peripheral blood zzso The observed zzso expression of the zzso gene in all but one patient strongly suggests that the human gene is not normally zzso
