To study translation initiation in zzso zzso we zzso the initiation zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso which encodes zzso f of the zzso zzso zzso zzso f accumulated to zzso levels in all zzso strains except the one with a zzso zzso but only the zzso with an zzso zzso grew well at 24 degrees C under conditions that require zzso Because no zzso f was zzso in the zzso zzso and because each zzso that accumulated zzso f did so at a different level, we concluded that any residual translation probably zzso at the zzso zzso As a further demonstration that alternative initiation sites are not used in zzso we introduced zzso zzso stop zzso immediately downstream or upstream or in place of the initiation zzso Stop zzso at or downstream of the initiation zzso prevented zzso of zzso zzso whereas the one immediately upstream of the initiation zzso had no effect on the zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that an zzso zzso is not required to specify the site of translation initiation in zzso but that the efficiency of translation initiation depends on the identity of the initiation zzso
