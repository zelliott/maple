zzso 30 zzso is one of the most frequently isolated zzso causing extensive outbreaks of zzso zzso meningitis in temperate zzso zzso is zzso heterogeneous, and three major zzso groups have been zzso although the basis for the zzso differences is zzso A reverse zzso zzso which zzso the zzso region of the zzso gene directly from clinical samples was selected for studying zzso molecular zzso since the major zzso sites in this region reflect the zzso pattern of this zzso The different previous approaches to the genetic zzso of zzso were zzso A complete study of the zzso strains was performed by analyzing the sequences from the 112 zzso strains amplified in this work and the complete set of zzso strains previously zzso A total of zzso strains of zzso were divided into two broad zzso (I and zzso This zzso was supported by the zzso trees obtained from zzso acid zzso and it correlated with the zzso zzso of the reference strains described in earlier zzso The zzso could be further divided into subgroups, and these zzso could be divided into lineages based on their zzso distances and levels of zzso On the other hand, the zzso and lineages did not result in the same correlation between zzso acid and zzso zzso The molecular epidemiology of zzso can be compared to influenza virus zzso where prevailing lineages zzso the less established lineages on the basis of immune zzso This pattern of evolution is clearly different from that of other zzso A single lineage at a time appears to be circulating zzso This behavior may be related to the epidemic activity of zzso
