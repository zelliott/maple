zzso are an economically and ecologically important zzso zzso zzso The organization of their zzso zzso appears to be radically different from that in plants and other zzso The gene content has been dramatically reduced in zzso with the large-scale transfer of genes to the zzso Most of the remaining genes zzso zzso of zzso I and II, the zzso zzso complex, and zzso zzso as well as zzso and a few zzso Whereas conventional zzso zzso have all their genes physically linked on one zzso zzso zzso genes are located on small zzso termed zzso Each zzso has at most a few zzso and a distinguishable zzso zzso Genes are always in the same orientation with respect to the core zzso There are also zzso zzso including zzso forms of zzso apparently derived from other zzso by zzso The evidence that the zzso are located in the zzso and that there is no conventional zzso zzso in addition to the zzso is zzso zzso of zzso is probably initiated close to the core, generating transcripts corresponding to an almost entire zzso The transcripts are then zzso to molecules corresponding to individual zzso zzso modifications include editing and addition of a zzso zzso It is discussed why these particular genes have been retained in the zzso zzso together with the possibility that the zzso supplies zzso to the zzso
