In the zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso C virus zzso zzso within the zzso zzso region zzso the zzso domain zzso the variable region 3 zzso and the zzso zzso region zzso have been correlated with the zzso therapy zzso In zzso where a high prevalence of zzso has been found, no data regarding the implication of zzso in treatment response were zzso The current study examined the relationship between the zzso zzso number within zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as in the entire zzso region of zzso zzso zzso and the response to the zzso course of combined zzso plus zzso therapy in 15 zzso zzso zzso Referring to zzso zzso a significant high genetic zzso was observed within zzso in the sustained zzso zzso patients compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso More importantly, when considering the entire region from zzso to zzso referred to as zzso a clear difference in the zzso number was observed between sustained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, a more detailed analysis of zzso region revealed an elevated degree of zzso rate within the region located between zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, an analysis of specific zzso acid variations defined zzso and zzso at position zzso as signature patterns for sensitive and resistant zzso zzso The genetic zzso within the zzso region of zzso strains was associated with the response to the combined zzso plus zzso therapy in our zzso zzso
