For 5 consecutive days repeated zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso to G alpha zzso zzso was used to impair the function of mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulatory zzso zzso of 20 to zzso on the G zzso zzso could be observed in neural structures of mouse brain, an effect that was not produced by a zzso zzso used as a zzso The zzso to zzso alpha zzso lacked effect on zzso zzso In mice injected with the zzso to zzso alpha zzso the zzso activity of all the zzso studied appeared greatly zzso The zzso to zzso alpha zzso reduced the effects of the selective zzso of delta zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the analgesia evoked by zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso appeared consistently and significantly attenuated in mice injected with the zzso to zzso zzso The effect of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso and delta receptors was also reduced by zzso to zzso alpha or zzso alpha zzso zzso injection of zzso directed to these G alpha zzso antagonized zzso analgesia with a pattern similar to that observed for the zzso Thus, the zzso and delta zzso receptors regulate different classes of G zzso proteins to mediate the zzso effect of zzso The in zzso zzso strategy and the use of specific zzso to G alpha zzso gave comparable results, indicating that in the neural tissue the zzso and the G alpha zzso can be zzso by the corresponding zzso and zzso
