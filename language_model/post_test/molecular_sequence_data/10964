The zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso An zzso of 903 zzso was found coding for a protein of Mr zzso The coding region has a very high overall zzso content of zzso zzso zzso zzso displays zzso zzso acid identity with other zzso the most closely related proteins being zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and from zzso zzso The zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso to zzso using a zzso followed by affinity zzso on zzso The native zzso has an Mr of about zzso suggesting a zzso structure, as for most anabolic zzso from various zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso for both zzso The pH optimum was dependent on zzso concentration with an optimum at pH 8 for zzso zzso around zzso zzso Higher zzso shift the optimum towards lower zzso The optimal temperature was above 65 degrees C and the zzso energy zzso zzso The zzso is highly zzso In the presence of its zzso the zzso time was several hours at 85 degrees zzso zzso and zzso interactions contribute to the zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso was zzso regulated by zzso
