This study investigates the effects of the zzso zzso zzso on the human colon cancer line zzso zzso cells per zzso grown zzso in severe combined zzso zzso zzso The efficacy of zzso was zzso evaluated by comparing the zzso weight, zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso and the expression of the zzso nuclear zzso in zzso animals and control zzso The zzso cell carbohydrates were assessed using a zzso zzso A significant reduction in the zzso weight was found 4 days after initial zzso zzso zzso treatment reduced the percentages of zzso but increased the zzso index in the zzso zzso In addition, zzso induced an increase in the zzso ring cell population and an increased binding for zzso specific for zzso and zzso However, the vast majority of zzso ring cells were negative for zzso The results of this study indicate that continuous treatment with zzso for 4 days targets zzso processes relevant for both cell division and zzso The relative increase in the zzso ring population can be explained by the fact that the more zzso stem cell population of the zzso is the primary target of the zzso The zzso patterns reflect these changes and are therefore differentiation zzso
