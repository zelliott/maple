The V gamma 5 chain of T cell zzso gamma delta is zzso expressed by zzso fetal zzso The fetal V gamma 5 gene is known to be homogeneous and lacks N zzso zzso We previously reported that V gamma zzso cells were detected among zzso zzso from zzso zzso mice soon after zzso with zzso fetal liver zzso cells, but that only a few V gamma zzso were detected among zzso zzso from zzso zzso mice zzso with adult bone zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that preferential use of V gamma 5 is determined at the level of T cell precursor zzso In the present report, we analyzed whether the zzso region of zzso V gamma 5 genes in the FL zzso is of fetal zzso zzso analysis showed that V gamma 5 genes from FL zzso contained extensive N zzso addition and were diverse both in zzso sequences and deduced zzso acid zzso V gamma 5 genes from zzso zzso of zzso zzso which by zzso chain reaction were revealed to be less frequent than those of FL zzso also showed extensive N zzso Furthermore, the terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes an zzso that adds N zzso into the zzso region, was expressed at high level in the zzso zzso of FL zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso but at low level in day 17 fetal zzso zzso Our results suggest that the preferential zzso of the V gamma 5 gene is determined at the level of T cell precursor generation but the homogeneous V gamma 5 sequence of fetal type is generated only in the fetal zzso zzso where zzso gene expression is low or zzso The nomenclature of zzso zzso gamma chains is according to zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The relationship between the different nomenclature systems is summarized in zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
