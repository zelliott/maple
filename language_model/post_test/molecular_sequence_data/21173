zzso zzso coli is a zzso agent of gastrointestinal and zzso zzso These zzso zzso coli express a zzso protein machine, known as the type III zzso system zzso used for the injection of zzso factors into the zzso of the host zzso zzso zzso the zzso plasma membrane requires formation of a zzso pore that contains the zzso protein zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso segment of zzso encompassing zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso and zzso with the latter of these zzso being critical for zzso zzso Fluorescence and circular zzso analysis revealed that, in solution, zzso adopts a native zzso zzso however, on binding zzso small zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso a pH depended zzso change that increases the zzso content of this protein approximately zzso This change zzso with zzso of the region zzso zzso into the zzso core of the zzso zzso On the zzso cell plasma zzso zzso forms a zzso that is zzso to promote zzso zzso and pore zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso bacteria with an zzso gene showed that this protein was zzso but zzso
