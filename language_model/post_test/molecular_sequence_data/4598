The pharmacology of the majority of zzso channels in the nervous system is very zzso Although attempts have been made to zzso native zzso channels into the framework provided by the six zzso molecules cloned to date, refined zzso analysis of zzso zzso expression techniques and the use of selective toxins have helped to identify zzso only a limited number of zzso zzso In fact, many native zzso channel activities remain as zzso waiting for their molecular counterparts to be zzso In this article, Janet zzso zzso Lambert and Anne zzso systematically delineate the well characterized zzso zzso channel activities and the missing elements in our knowledge of the zzso channel zzso
