We have isolated two nitrate zzso genes and their corresponding zzso from zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso when compared to a sequence of a barley zzso zzso confirm their identity as nitrate zzso clones and show that they are closely zzso The two genes have been mapped using restriction zzso length zzso zzso is close to the previously identified zzso locus and is probably identical to it, while zzso maps to a new locus zzso on zzso 1, near zzso
