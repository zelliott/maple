zzso of the zzso family contain a zzso zzso domain of about 200 zzso zzso We now report the zzso structure corresponding to the zzso domain for one member of this family, the mouse zzso alpha zzso This is the first such description for the zzso zzso zzso It consists of four small zzso zzso to 222 base zzso and three large zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso organization zzso well with the secondary structure elements of the domain as predicted by computer zzso zzso zzso contains beta strand I, and zzso consists of zzso A and beta strands zzso zzso zzso to beta strands zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso C and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are present at the beginning of zzso A and beta strand IV, respectively, and zzso is between zzso B and zzso Similar analyses of sequences previously published by others, have extended this correlation to other zzso family members from different zzso The relationship between gene and protein structures within the zzso family provide novel information on the evolution of this family in relation to other gene zzso
