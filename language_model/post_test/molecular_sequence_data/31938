zzso growth factor zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso signals via lateral zzso in the plasma zzso and plays an important role in human development and zzso Eight different zzso zzso implicated in zzso and growth disorders, have been identified in the zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the zzso of the zzso zzso domain in zzso zzso zzso zzso In the solved zzso structure, the two zzso zzso pack into a zzso left-handed zzso with zzso stacking interactions occurring in the zzso central zzso Some zzso zzso fall within the zzso zzso whereas others are located within a putative alternative zzso This implies that although the observed zzso structure is important for zzso zzso the mechanism of zzso zzso across the membrane is zzso We propose an zzso signaling mechanism that is based on the solved structure, available structures of isolated soluble zzso zzso and published zzso and zzso zzso
