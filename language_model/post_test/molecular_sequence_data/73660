A new zzso zzso protein zzso has been zzso from the edible zzso zzso zzso and designated zzso Analysis of the zzso protein by zzso followed by zzso Blue zzso demonstrated that zzso is a single zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that this single zzso lacks zzso Using an in zzso zzso measuring zzso zzso activity, zzso was shown to stimulate the maximum proliferation of human peripheral blood zzso at a concentration of 5 zzso zzso was capable of zzso rat red blood zzso Neither zzso nor zzso activities were inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso In zzso repeat administration of zzso greatly reduced the production of zzso zzso reaction in mice, whereas little effect was observed on the prevention of systemic zzso zzso The selectively enhanced zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso was also demonstrated by reverse zzso This finding suggests that zzso exerts its zzso effects via zzso zzso In addition, the complete zzso acid sequence of zzso was obtained by direct protein zzso This protein consists of 112 zzso acid zzso with a blocked zzso end and has a calculated molecular mass of zzso Da not including the zzso blocking zzso By gel zzso analysis, zzso exhibited a molecular mass of 26 zzso for the native molecules in zzso This result indicates that native zzso is most likely a zzso associated zzso zzso
