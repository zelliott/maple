zzso differentiation factor 2 zzso binds zzso bacterial zzso with high affinity and is essential for zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso has recently been recognized as a type II acute phase zzso Plasma zzso of the soluble form of zzso increase markedly during the course of severe zzso Its production is regulated in zzso and zzso cells by zzso zzso but not zzso In the present work we show that two zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso protein beta zzso participate in the zzso of the human zzso gene in zzso cells after stimulation with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding sites in the zzso promoter were shown to be critical for the zzso activity of the promoter as well as for zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso of zzso portions of the zzso promoter containing zzso and/or zzso consensus binding sites as well as zzso zzso of these binding sites zzso zzso zzso gene zzso We show that the cooperation between zzso and zzso is critical for the zzso zzso of the zzso gene by zzso zzso was essentially known as a zzso involved in the differentiation of zzso precursor cells and the expression of surface receptors of the innate zzso zzso we show that it also zzso in the regulation of an acute phase zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso a classical zzso zzso
