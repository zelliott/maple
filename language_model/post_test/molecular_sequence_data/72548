Clinical zzso of zzso coli were found to host a zzso of zzso These were resolved from zzso gel profiles, from the properties of various zzso and zzso of zzso coli zzso by the zzso I relaxation of zzso closed circle zzso DNA, by electron zzso and by the determination of their zzso The majority of these were unusually small, cryptic plasmids zzso From one strain, zzso 13 zzso bands were resolved to five zzso three of which were zzso zzso were zzso zzso and the smallest of these, zzso contained barely enough information for zzso A zzso of zzso zzso in which the zzso was restricted to a small zzso region, was zzso maintained in zzso zzso zzso and zzso species and its replication was zzso zzso zzso zzso only a single zzso zzso (Mr zzso which specifically bound to zzso zzso No apparent zzso with other zzso protein sequences could be zzso Thus the zzso zzso is a novel minimal zzso zzso zzso only enough information to ensure zzso A hypothesis is presented describing zzso as a class of selfish DNA that persists simply due to its ability to replicate and to its stability based on high copy zzso
