This study was designed to determine the effects of zzso peptides zzso on the zzso of growth hormone zzso and to characterize the zzso zzso zzso these effects in zzso Four experiments were zzso zzso six zzso were randomly assigned to receive intravenous zzso zzso injections of 0, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso seven zzso calves were IV injected with zzso zzso zzso zzso six zzso were IV injected with zzso bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso (an zzso for the zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone, zzso zzso zzso B zzso and zzso four rats were IV injected zzso zzso zzso A serial blood sample was collected before and after zzso Plasma zzso levels zzso increased at 5 zzso after zzso injection and the minimal effective dose was zzso zzso Plasma zzso level was elevated by zzso but not by zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was completely blocked by zzso The administration of zzso elevated zzso level in zzso calves but not in zzso zzso level was unaffected by any zzso and zzso did not block the zzso zzso of zzso The results indicate zzso zzso of zzso levels is zzso by the zzso zzso but not through a zzso zzso in zzso
