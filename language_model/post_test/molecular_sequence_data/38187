We have investigated the expression and regulation of the zzso for the type I zzso zzso zzso and zzso in quail zzso in zzso and in neural crest cultures in zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the primordial sympathetic zzso at stage 17, soon after the first expression of zzso zzso the avian zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso at stage 17, zzso with zzso zzso expression in the sympathetic zzso zzso zzso was first expressed in the sympathetic zzso at stage zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso was detected in the sympathetic zzso starting at stage zzso zzso and zzso were zzso regulated in cultured neural crest zzso zzso was expressed in primary zzso of neural crest cells but was zzso after primary zzso were harvested and zzso in secondary zzso In secondary cultures of neural crest cells, zzso zzso and zzso increased the expression of zzso but decreased the expression of zzso The expression of both type I zzso receptors was inhibited by zzso zzso Our results suggest distinct roles for zzso and zzso in the development of the zzso zzso from cells of the neural zzso
