Four surface membrane proteins of zzso zzso have previously been shown to induce a degree of protective zzso and to carry both unique and zzso zzso zzso clones for two of the genes coding for these proteins have been isolated and used as zzso to isolate a single large zzso DNA zzso which contained all four zzso DNA sequence of two of the genes and their predicted zzso acid sequences confirmed that the proteins had zzso sequences at their zzso and zzso an observation consistent with their proposed cell surface zzso zzso in both zzso acid and zzso sequences were found at the zzso at the zzso ends, but considerable sequence variations existed elsewhere in the genes and their zzso The genes coding for these four proteins were zzso arranged along a single relatively short length of zzso and such structures, because of their sequence zzso probably could have arisen by gene zzso The extensive variation suggested that there may be a functional need for these proteins to be different or capable of zzso although computer analysis implied that the extent of this variation may be constrained by structural zzso This variation could be indicative of a role for these proteins in the zzso relationship or immune zzso
