Human growth hormone zzso is a zzso protein hormone consisting of several zzso The sources of this zzso reside at the level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso modification and zzso The zzso gene cluster on zzso zzso contains 2 zzso genes zzso or zzso and zzso or zzso in addition to zzso genes zzso the related zzso zzso Alternative zzso zzso of the zzso transcript yields two zzso zzso (the principal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso modified zzso forms include zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso forms, as well as both zzso and zzso zzso up to at least zzso zzso zzso fragments generated in the course of peripheral metabolism may be measured in zzso for zzso The zzso gene is expressed in the zzso the zzso gene in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso forms is zzso under control from the zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso is zzso and rises progressively in maternal blood during the 2nd and 3rd zzso zzso zzso forms are zzso during a zzso zzso no zzso stimuli have been zzso There are minor differences in zzso and zzso zzso among the zzso zzso depending on species and zzso system zzso Both zzso and zzso have poor zzso zzso zzso zzso forms have zzso diminished zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in most zzso but zzso specific for zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso The zzso clearance of zzso and zzso zzso is delayed compared to that of zzso The zzso mixture of zzso zzso in blood is further complicated by the presence of two zzso zzso which form complexes with zzso zzso proportions also vary depending on the lag time from a zzso pulse because of different zzso zzso forms zzso in the urine reflect zzso zzso zzso in blood, but constitute only a minute fraction of the zzso production zzso The zzso of zzso is one important reason for the notorious disparity among zzso zzso It also presents an opportunity for distinguishing zzso from zzso zzso
