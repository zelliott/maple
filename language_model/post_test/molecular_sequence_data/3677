zzso zzso are the most studied class of zzso zzso and a primary target for drug zzso Despite the large number of zzso developed so far, very few make contact with the prime site of the zzso which constitutes an almost untapped opportunity for drug zzso In the course of our studies on the zzso zzso zzso of zzso C virus zzso we found that this zzso is an excellent example of both the opportunities and the challenges of such zzso We had previously reported on two classes of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso product zzso which include the zzso region of the zzso and derive much of their binding energy from binding of their zzso zzso in the active site, and zzso zzso zzso which span the zzso zzso of the zzso whose zzso zzso zzso zzso contributes to zzso Here we report on further work, which combined the key binding elements of the two series and led to the development of zzso binding exclusively to the prime site of zzso We prepared a small zzso library of zzso capped with a variety of constrained and zzso zzso The zzso was derived from multiple zzso of the initial zzso zzso zzso of the zzso to the zzso was further characterized by circular zzso zzso zzso a probe displacement zzso and zzso to unequivocally prove that, according to our design, the bound zzso occupies zzso the zzso zzso and the active site of the zzso In addition, on the basis of the information collected, the zzso series was evolved toward reduced zzso character, reduced molecular weight, and higher zzso Beyond their interest as zzso zzso these compounds represent the first example of prime site zzso of a zzso zzso We further suggest that the design of an inhibitor with an analogous binding mode may be possible for other zzso zzso
