zzso of acute zzso conjunctivitis zzso caused by a zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared in Taiwan in zzso and again in zzso 

To analyze the molecular epidemiology of zzso in recent outbreaks in zzso 

A zzso zzso of zzso region was analyzed in 30 zzso zzso during zzso zzso tree was constructed along with 130 zzso zzso available from the zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso region was similarly analyzed in 15 randomly selected strains isolated during zzso zzso zzso was constructed for the zzso region in 105 zzso strains zzso zzso distances were calculated using Kimura zzso model, and zzso trees were constructed by zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso depicted zzso IV zzso a new zzso that can be further divided into three clusters zzso The zzso outbreaks were caused by zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso isolated in the zzso outbreak belong to zzso also in the same cluster as Singapore strains from zzso Analysis on zzso revealed only zzso zzso and zzso in line with the zzso in zzso zzso All zzso IV strains were also divided into three zzso though the zzso 2' were isolated from broader geographic areas and over a longer period of zzso 

Analysis of the zzso region is more zzso than the zzso region in the molecular epidemiology of zzso The zzso zzso accurately and zzso identified all zzso involved in the worldwide zzso
