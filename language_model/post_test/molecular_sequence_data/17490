The zzso gene of zzso zzso is a member of a class of genes involved in the zzso transmission of the zzso state of zzso regulatory genes through zzso zzso evidence, and the finding of a molecular similarity between the zzso protein and a zzso protein of zzso suggest that this mechanism of repression might be imprinted in the structure of the zzso rather than being sustained through the action of zzso regulatory zzso
