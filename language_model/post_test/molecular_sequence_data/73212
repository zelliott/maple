zzso of zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated in the zzso and zzso layers of the large zzso zzso of the chicken zzso by Northern zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Northern zzso results showed multiple zzso and zzso zzso transcripts and the zzso species were zzso and zzso zzso zzso The highest abundance of zzso zzso was found in the zzso layer of the largest zzso zzso zzso while the abundance remained low in the zzso layers of the third zzso and fifth largest zzso zzso zzso zzso abundance was the highest in the zzso layer of F5 zzso but decreased in the zzso layers of F3 and F1 zzso In the zzso layers of all the three zzso examined zzso and zzso zzso were extremely zzso These results were confirmed by zzso experiment which involved zzso of zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the internal zzso The zzso zzso product was zzso and indicated zzso zzso with the corresponding region of the quail zzso zzso This study indicated that the marked increase in expression of zzso zzso in zzso layer of the F1 zzso might be important for zzso protein synthesis and succeeding bonus zzso production in F1 zzso destined to zzso However, higher expression of zzso zzso in the zzso layer of the less mature zzso may be involved in the differentiation and maturation of zzso cells in these zzso
