To compare the zzso zzso H inclusion test with zzso detection of embryonic zzso chains in screening for alpha zzso 

Blood samples from 115 patients with relevant clinical history and zzso zzso indexes were screened using the zzso inclusion test and the zzso zzso Testing System zzso zzso CA, zzso 

The zzso inclusion test was positive in 61 of 115 cases, three of whom had zzso disease confirmed by zzso The remaining 58 had alpha zzso zzso All three zzso cases and 56 of 58 cases of alpha zzso 1 expressed embryonic zzso zzso giving a specificity of zzso Fifty four of 115 cases had a negative zzso inclusion test, of whom 50 had beta zzso trait and three had iron zzso No diagnosis was reached for the remaining zzso 

The zzso test is as sensitive as the zzso inclusion test in screening for alpha zzso The presence of zzso chains is highly specific for alpha zzso 1 incorporating the zzso zzso The specificity and simplicity of the zzso test make it the test of choice in screening for alpha zzso
