In recent years a great deal of zzso and genetic research has focused on the zzso domain zzso of the largest zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This strongly zzso domain of zzso repeated zzso has been linked functionally to important steps in the initiation and processing of zzso transcripts in both animals and zzso Although they are absolutely required for viability in these organisms, zzso tandem repeats do not occur in zzso sequences from diverse zzso zzso Here we present zzso analyses of zzso sequences showing that zzso zzso zzso are strongly zzso in only a subset of zzso groups, all apparently descended from a single common zzso Moreover, zzso groups in which the most complex patterns of zzso development occur are descended from this zzso zzso zzso with the results of genetic and zzso investigations of zzso function, these analyses suggest that the enhanced control over zzso zzso II zzso conveyed by acquired zzso interactions was an important step in the evolution of intricate patterns of gene expression that are a hallmark of large, zzso complex zzso zzso
