A zzso study was carried out on strain zzso which was isolated from a zzso zzso enriched from marine zzso of the zzso Gulf, zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso showed highest similarities to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similarities to other members of the zzso zzso were zzso The dominant fatty acids of strain zzso were zzso summed feature 3 zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso G and zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso These results are consistent with characteristics of members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso could, however, be readily distinguished from all known zzso species by a number of zzso zzso zzso according to the zzso and zzso zzso gene sequence data, strain zzso represents a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed zzso strain zzso zzso AB zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
