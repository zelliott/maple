This study presents the first complete sequence of an zzso zzso zzso This zzso was originally isolated from a strain of zzso zzso from hospital zzso zzso General Hospital, zzso United zzso in September 1997 zzso Rhodes, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Smith, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and belongs to a group of related plasmids with global zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and has 94 predicted coding zzso only 12 of which do not have a possible function that has been zzso zzso zzso zzso and transfer functions have been identified and are located in a region in the first 31 zzso of the zzso The replication region is poorly understood but exhibits some identity at the protein level with replication proteins from the zzso bacteria zzso and zzso The mating pair formation system is a zzso zzso type IV zzso zzso that is similar in its structural organization to the mating pair formation systems of the related zzso zzso environmental plasmids zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso and maintenance genes are zzso of genes in zzso zzso The DNA transfer genes and the putative zzso site also exhibit high levels of similarity with those of plasmids zzso zzso and zzso The genetic load region encompasses 54 zzso comprises the resistance zzso and includes a class I zzso an zzso relative, and other zzso elements in a zzso region that may be a novel zzso composite zzso This region also contains 24 genes that exhibit the highest levels of identity to zzso genes of several zzso zzso The features of the backbone of zzso that are shared with this newly defined group of environmental zzso plasmids suggest that zzso may be a relative of this group, but a relative that was isolated from a clinical bacterial environment rather than a zzso bacterial zzso
