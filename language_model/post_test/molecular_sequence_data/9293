zzso is one member of the third zzso of zzso zzso factors in rice zzso zzso It has high sequence similarity to zzso element binding factor zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso two zzso zzso positively regulating stress tolerance in zzso zzso zzso and rice, zzso zzso of zzso was strongly induced by drought, heat, hydrogen zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso however, it was not induced by salt and cold zzso zzso of the native zzso gene increased zzso sensitivity but had no positive effect on drought zzso The zzso domain of zzso was defined by a series of zzso and a region zzso zzso was identified as having a negative effect on the zzso We produced a zzso active form of zzso zzso with a deletion of domain zzso zzso of zzso in rice significantly increased tolerance to drought and zzso zzso Gene chip analysis of the two zzso zzso zzso and the zzso active form zzso revealed that a large number of stress-related zzso many of them predicted to be downstream genes of zzso were activated in the zzso zzso but not (even zzso in the zzso zzso zzso can interact with zzso of zzso protein zzso that zzso zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso is a positive regulator of zzso signaling and drought stress tolerance of rice depending on its zzso The stress-related genes activated by zzso are largely different from those activated by the other rice zzso zzso (such as zzso further zzso the value of zzso in genetic engineering of drought zzso
