The genes zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that removed zzso from zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso bond were zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso that removes either the terminal or central zzso groups from zzso and that reduces zzso but did not readily reduce zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso that exhibits fivefold zzso for removal of the central zzso group from zzso and that zzso TNT but did not readily react with zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso was demonstrated in zzso coli zzso The zzso initiation sites of both zzso and zzso were identified by primer extension zzso zzso analyses conducted with the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso sequences demonstrated that these genes are similar to several other bacterial genes that zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso described zzso likely shared a common zzso with old yellow zzso of zzso a zzso zzso which may serve a zzso role in zzso defense zzso
