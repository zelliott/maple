zzso zzso zzso is a zzso pathogen that causes diseases in animals and zzso zzso activity has been detected in multiple zzso strains and zzso has been shown to be important for the zzso of zzso Three putative zzso genes have been identified in zzso zzso strain zzso We have reported previously that a zzso gene zzso in zzso strain zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate here that while zzso prefers to use zzso as zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene zzso in the same zzso strain is a novel zzso zzso that prefers to use zzso lipids as zzso zzso zzso and zzso thus complement each other for an efficient synthesis of zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso lipids are better zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used successfully in the zzso scale synthesis of zzso zzso zzso which is an important zzso and an intermediate for zzso more complex zzso such as zzso
