The structure and organization of five genes responsible for the synthesis of six zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso are reported in this zzso This also forms the first report which describes the synthesis of two zzso zzso zzso from one of these genes zzso as a result of alternative zzso Each gene consists of three zzso which are separated by two zzso and each has a functional zzso The promoter activity was confirmed by both zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso initiation site, two putative zzso boxes, one zzso box and the zzso factor binding consensus sites for zzso zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso region of each zzso zzso analysis showed that these five genes from zzso zzso constituted a distinct group which has evolved by gene zzso followed by accelerated evolution from an ancestral zzso
