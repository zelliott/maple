zzso of zzso origin occupy approximately zzso of zzso zzso Various infectious zzso zzso zzso and functional zzso elements have been reported for several zzso but not zzso Here, we identified two zzso designated bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso containing full-length envelope zzso genes in the bovine zzso zzso analysis revealed that they belong to the zzso zzso By reverse zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso were detected in the zzso and cultured bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso isolated from various bovine zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in the zzso Moreover, we also found the expression of doubly spliced zzso named the zzso and zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso proteins have motifs for a putative nuclear zzso signal and a nuclear export zzso zzso and zzso fused with green fluorescent proteins were localized mainly in the zzso when they were expressed in bovine and zzso zzso In the zzso and 3' long terminal repeats of zzso and zzso we found regulatory elements responsible for the zzso and transport of viral zzso and/or translation of the zzso zzso Although we have not identified the expressed zzso proteins in bovine zzso these data suggest that both zzso and zzso express zzso proteins and that these proteins may have zzso functions in zzso
