As a first step in understanding the regulation of the expression of zzso zzso zzso we have isolated the zzso genes from the rabbit and characterized the gene for zzso zzso based on the zzso middle and zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were generated by zzso chain zzso A mixture of the zzso zzso was used to screen a zzso library, and isolated clones were identified by zzso with individual zzso zzso The complete gene for zzso was isolated as three overlapping clones and found to span approximately 40 zzso The gene contains eight zzso ranging in size from zzso to 10 zzso and nine zzso ranging in size from 73 to zzso zzso The gene for zzso seems to have multiple zzso start zzso A zzso clone containing a zzso segment of the zzso gene was isolated and found to contain zzso 1, zzso 1, and part of zzso zzso The first zzso of zzso is considerably smaller than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its 3' junction is 52 bases to the zzso of the start zzso compared with 6 bases in the case of zzso In contrast, the zzso junction of zzso 2 is the same distance from the start zzso in both zzso The zzso regions of the zzso and zzso genes contain several putative zzso responsive zzso
