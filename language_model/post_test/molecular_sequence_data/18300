Disease resistance response genes zzso of peas are expressed as the tissue is expressing zzso or zzso zzso A pea zzso clone zzso encompassing one zzso structural zzso the expression of which is correlated with the expression of disease resistance, was zzso and zzso The zzso zzso segment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the major zzso initiation site, a zzso zzso frame interrupted by one zzso zzso zzso and an additional zzso segment 3' from the stop zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso structural gene is one of a zzso family, and an estimated five copies exist within the pea zzso zzso extension analysis of the zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso suggested the presence of one major transcript with possibly two minor zzso The major transcript, located 65 zzso from the zzso initiation site, was expressed when challenged with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso The structural gene sequence corresponding to the zzso clone zzso is not identical with the structural gene of the zzso clone zzso used as a probe for northern zzso analysis, and thus, a possibility remains that it is not expressed in zzso however, the zzso promoter was able to express the zzso zzso reporter gene in tobacco zzso Western zzso analysis using zzso prepared from a zzso fusion protein identified the zzso gene product as a major protein accumulating during the zzso zzso
