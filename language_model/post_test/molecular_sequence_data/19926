zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a central zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso is an important target for zzso and zzso drugs since rapid cell proliferation often depends on the de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso from the zzso plant pathogen zzso zzso We were able to show that zzso contains a functional zzso targeting zzso The deletion of zzso resulted in zzso zzso enhanced sensitivity to zzso zzso and a loss of zzso on corn zzso The zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli revealed that the zzso zzso zzso uses zzso electron zzso zzso and is resistant to several commonly used zzso zzso Here we show that the expression of the human zzso gene fused to the zzso zzso zzso targeting signal is able to complement the zzso zzso of zzso zzso While zzso zzso zzso cells were resistant to the zzso inhibitor zzso strains expressing the human zzso gene became sensitive to this zzso zzso Such engineered zzso zzso strains can be used in sensitive in zzso zzso for the development of novel drugs specifically targeted at either human or zzso zzso
