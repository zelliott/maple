zzso the major structural protein of zzso such as zzso comprises a series of zzso connected by flexible zzso These zzso drive viral assembly by zzso multiple interactions between adjacent zzso molecules and by binding to viral zzso zzso and host cell zzso Upon viral zzso zzso is processed by the viral zzso to liberate distinct zzso as separate zzso The first two regions of zzso are MA, a zzso zzso and CA, which is a zzso protein that makes important zzso zzso forms the zzso outer shell of the core (the zzso in the mature zzso zzso and makes an important interaction with the cellular protein zzso A zzso Here, we report crystal structures of the mature CA zzso domain zzso and a zzso fusion zzso at zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with earlier studies, a comparison of these structures indicates that processing at the zzso junction causes CA to adopt an zzso zzso zzso that seems to be required for zzso zzso and viral zzso In contrast with an zzso study zzso zzso et zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso structural overlap reveals only small relative zzso for zzso 6, which is located between the zzso and the zzso zzso These observations argue against the proposal that zzso binding is coupled with zzso formation and support an earlier surface zzso resonance study zzso zzso et zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which concluded that zzso formation and zzso are energetically independent zzso
