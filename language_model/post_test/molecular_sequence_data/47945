1 The rabbit zzso for zzso was cloned from a zzso library and found to be zzso identical to the human zzso the highest degree of similarity found so far in zzso laboratory zzso 2 The rabbit zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells binds human zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso analogue zzso zzso were found to be competitors of that zzso the zzso analogue retaining approximately zzso of the affinity of human zzso 3 The order of potency human zzso was zzso in zzso based on rabbits zzso of the isolated portal vein and pulmonary zzso acute in zzso zzso but with a decreasing potency gap between the two compounds, a likely consequence of the resistance to zzso of the zzso 4 The molecular definition of the rabbit zzso zzso evidenced a high preservation degree of sequence and zzso properties relative to the human zzso zzso thus defining a set of molecular tools for the investigation of the role of zzso in zzso and zzso models based on the rabbit zzso zzso zzso
