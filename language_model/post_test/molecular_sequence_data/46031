zzso zzso zzso are frequent targets of zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso have been identified in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but little is known about how these modifications regulate zzso We systematically zzso the zzso domain of zzso zzso both at known sites of zzso zzso and elsewhere, and characterized the resulting changes in zzso expression in each zzso zzso Our results indicate that known sites of zzso zzso in this domain are required for zzso zzso zzso However, the entire zzso zzso domain is principally required for the zzso repression of a large subset of the zzso zzso We find that the zzso zzso repression zzso domain, comprised of zzso 30 to 37, is necessary and sufficient for this zzso Many of the genes zzso by the zzso domain are located adjacent to zzso or function in vitamin and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain also zzso an increased sensitivity to DNA damage by zzso zzso We mapped the critical zzso in the zzso domain required for its repression zzso Finally, comparisons of these data with previous studies reveal that a surprising number of genes are zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso
