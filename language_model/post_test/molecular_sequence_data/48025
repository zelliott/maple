The zzso gene encodes a large, zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso cells to form a protective barrier against the external zzso Recently published zzso sequences for the zzso region of zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso possesses two zzso growth factor zzso zzso and putative zzso and zzso zzso whereas the sequence of human zzso predicted termination after the first zzso zzso Here we describe the complete zzso sequence encompassing the zzso terminal region of human zzso revealing the boundaries of 11 zzso zzso and zzso library cloning experiments indicate that the gene is alternatively zzso yielding a major zzso form as well as multiple soluble zzso Thus, this work indicates that both zzso and soluble zzso zzso proteins are produced by alternative zzso of a single zzso A potentially important zzso involving a zzso zzso with a proposed role in zzso is described as zzso
