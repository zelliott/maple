zzso encodes an zzso zzso channel that plays an important role in zzso of the cardiac action zzso zzso zzso of zzso channels results from rapid and zzso zzso zzso combined with very slow zzso zzso We asked whether the zzso sensor is implicated in the unusual properties of zzso zzso does the zzso sensor move slowly to account for slow zzso and zzso or could the zzso sensor move rapidly to account for the rapid zzso and intrinsic zzso dependence of zzso To probe zzso sensor movement, we used a zzso technique to examine zzso changes near the positively charged zzso zzso Fluorescent zzso attached to three different zzso on the zzso end of the zzso region zzso zzso and zzso reported both fast and slow zzso changes in zzso The slow changes in zzso correlated strongly with zzso zzso suggesting that the slow zzso gating of zzso results from slow zzso sensor zzso The fast changes in zzso showed zzso dependence and zzso similar to zzso zzso though these zzso signals were not affected by external zzso blockade or zzso that alter zzso A working model with two types of zzso sensor movement is proposed as a framework for understanding zzso channel gating and the zzso zzso
