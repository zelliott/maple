The zzso zzso the human zzso gene have been analyzed for their ability to direct expression of a reporter gene (the zzso zzso gene zzso in cell lines that normally express or do not express the zzso zzso A construct containing zzso zzso pairs of zzso zzso sequence sequence showed expression of zzso in breast and pancreatic cell lines but not in the zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed that maximum expression was obtained in zzso zzso cancer line) and zzso zzso cancer line) with only 743 base pairs of zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso pairs of the zzso start site showed enhancing activity in a zzso carrying an zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso showed that sequences between zzso and zzso were crucial for zzso zzso An zzso site at zzso and an E box zzso at zzso in this region were shown by zzso analysis to play a role in the regulation of zzso zzso shift analysis with zzso and nuclear extracts of zzso showed protein binding to both of these zzso zzso binding activity was similar in zzso and zzso cells, whereas binding of factors to the zzso zzso revealed quantitative and qualitative differences between zzso and zzso zzso
