Most known zzso DNA zzso belong to the type B family, which also includes the DNA replication zzso of zzso but maintain high zzso at extreme zzso We describe here the zzso A resolution crystal structure of a DNA zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and identify structural features of the fold and the active site that are likely responsible for its zzso zzso zzso with the zzso B type DNA zzso zzso of the zzso zzso highlights zzso zzso which include the presence of two zzso bonds and an enhanced zzso zzso at the zzso zzso In contrast to zzso several zzso in the zzso and thumb zzso are more closely zzso this apparently blocks primer binding to the zzso active zzso A zzso role of this zzso zzso is unknown but may represent a zzso mode, in contrast to an editing mode with an open zzso zzso This zzso B DNA zzso structure provides a starting point for zzso design of zzso or zzso with applications in biotechnology and the development of zzso or zzso zzso
