We designed a universal primer zzso for DNA amplification of AIDS-related zzso The zzso tree constructed from the presumed sequences amplified with zzso was representative of the tree calculated from whole pol gene sequences so far zzso zzso was able to amplify the sequences of all four major groups of zzso zzso and also that of a distinct virus from a zzso patient with an AIDS-related complex, designated zzso This strain scarcely zzso with known zzso zzso virus zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis of the only amplified zzso revealed rapidly that zzso was quite similar to the recently reported zzso and that these two viruses form a new zzso zzso from known zzso and zzso in the large zzso zzso This system will be useful for further zzso study of various zzso zzso
