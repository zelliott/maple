Using synthetic zzso zzso we cloned zzso DNA sequences zzso an zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments, using a portion of this cloned zzso to probe DNA from zzso zzso suggested the presence of two zzso gene copies which were subsequently cloned as 7 zzso zzso as zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso and zzso genes revealed the zzso zzso Both genes are arranged as nine zzso and eight zzso zzso The zzso sequences of zzso and zzso are identical throughout all but the last few zzso of their respective coding zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes from zzso zzso share extensive zzso zzso than or equal to zzso zzso with the genes zzso zzso from zzso zzso In order to test whether both zzso and zzso were functional in the zzso we constructed zzso containing gene zzso of either zzso and zzso to bovine zzso zzso and used these zzso to transform zzso zzso zzso which contained either the zzso or zzso gene zzso produced zzso zzso suggesting that both genes are zzso
