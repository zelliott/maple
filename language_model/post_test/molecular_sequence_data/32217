zzso zzso heat shock proteins zzso are known to play a prominent role in the zzso of zzso It is also known that several zzso growth conditions, such as heat, iron zzso or exposure to gamma zzso result in the development of persistent zzso forms that often exhibit enhanced expression of zzso We have shown previously that the expression of zzso is greatly enhanced in zzso zzso zzso E zzso in an zzso zzso The objective of this work was to determine which single zzso or combination of the three zzso zzso zzso by this zzso responds to iron zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso that recognize only zzso zzso or zzso we found that expression of zzso is responsive to iron zzso Overall, our studies suggest that the expression of zzso zzso differs among the mechanisms currently known to induce zzso
