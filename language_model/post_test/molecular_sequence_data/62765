zzso zzso zzso zzso the first step of fatty acid zzso the synthesis of zzso from zzso using zzso and zzso In zzso coli and most other bacteria, zzso is composed of four zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Prior work from this laboratory showed that the in zzso expression of the zzso zzso had a zzso zzso response to gene copy number zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in that the presence of 50 or more copies of the zzso zzso resulted in only a zzso increase in zzso and zzso We now report that zzso functions to zzso regulate zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso protein consisting of the N zzso of zzso coli zzso and the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso A truncated form of zzso consisting of the zzso 68 zzso acids of zzso coli zzso was sufficient to zzso regulate the zzso zzso In zzso bypass of zzso zzso activity by expression of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso allowed construction of strain deleted for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso could not be resolved from the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso strain continued well into stationary phase under growth conditions that normally result in greatly decreased zzso These data support a model in which zzso acts as an zzso of zzso zzso zzso
