zzso zzso that respond to small organic molecules have previously been generated by appending binding species zzso to zzso In order to determine if zzso can similarly be activated by zzso zzso we have appended an zzso zzso to a selected zzso zzso The zzso zzso are specifically activated by zzso zzso of the joining region resulted in zzso that are activated up to zzso by zzso The selected zzso zzso zzso largely via a zzso zzso zzso zzso is surprisingly achieved by suppression of the rate of the background, zzso zzso reaction in the absence of the zzso zzso probably by zzso of the zzso zzso This novel zzso mechanism has not previously been observed for zzso zzso and is rare even in protein zzso
