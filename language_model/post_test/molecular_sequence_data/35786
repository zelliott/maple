The residence times of individual zzso water molecules in the major and minor grooves of DNA were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso in zzso solutions of zzso and zzso The experimental observations were nuclear zzso effects zzso between water zzso and the zzso of the zzso The positive sign of zzso with the zzso zzso groups shows that the residence times of the zzso water molecules near these zzso in the major groove of the DNA must be shorter than about 500 zzso which zzso with the behavior of surface zzso water in peptides and zzso zzso zzso were observed with the hydrogen atoms in position 2 of zzso in both duplexes zzso This indicates that a zzso of zzso in the minor groove, as observed by X-ray zzso in DNA zzso is present also in solution, with residence times significantly longer than 1 zzso Such residence times are reminiscent of zzso zzso water molecules in zzso zzso which are an integral part of the molecular architecture both in solution and in zzso
