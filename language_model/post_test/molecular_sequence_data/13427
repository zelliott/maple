zzso zzso which were usually of zzso type, were induced in 10 of 13 zzso male rabbits zzso white, zzso New Zealand white, zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso Of 7 rabbits injected with zzso zzso from zzso cultures, 5 also developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso development was completely inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso from zzso culture with zzso zzso and was almost suppressed by zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso particles were discovered very rarely in zzso cells, in addition to zzso virus zzso by electron zzso zzso cells were positive for zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso response to viral zzso zzso of zzso was also detected in zzso from rabbits zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated in zzso the tumor zzso and all rabbit tumor cell lines by in zzso zzso zzso DNA was also detected in zzso and rabbit zzso cell lines by zzso chain reaction zzso and Southern zzso However, zzso DNA was amplified only by some zzso complementary to human zzso sequence zzso but not by other zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso could not be detected in zzso rabbit tumor zzso Moreover, no zzso was induced by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso human cell zzso zzso cell line) or zzso and peripheral zzso from normal zzso zzso Neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso cells by IF zzso These data suggest that the high rate of zzso induction in rabbits may not be caused by zzso human zzso zzso or well-known zzso zzso zzso but by zzso zzso derived from zzso cells or zzso cells, with which zzso was zzso The availability of this animal model promises to clarify the role of zzso in human zzso and provides a means of studying zzso and therapeutic zzso
