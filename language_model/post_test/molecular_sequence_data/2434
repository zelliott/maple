zzso directed by the zzso long control region zzso is conditional upon zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso there are five separate regions, A to zzso that contain zzso responsive zzso The smallest functional region, A, is only 38 zzso and contains two copies of the consensus sequence zzso that is known to function as an zzso binding site in zzso We show that a pair of these constitutes a minimal functional zzso responsive zzso element but that the strength of zzso activity is dramatically reduced both by increasing the spacing between them and by removing the dual elements from the proximity of other key promoter zzso Furthermore, pairs of dual elements activated zzso to varying levels depending upon their spatial arrangement and promoter zzso We have also identified a low level zzso zzso in the D region which lacks an zzso consensus binding site but which can be activated by zzso We show that the zzso potential of this zzso zzso is increased by association with a single zzso binding site suggesting some zzso between viral and cellular zzso zzso
