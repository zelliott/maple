We identified four zzso DNA fragments with autonomously replicating sequences zzso functional in zzso zzso A zzso zzso which, mapped to zzso to zzso map units within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso showed the strongest zzso activity of the zzso zzso analysis of this zzso DNA segment revealed an zzso region separated from a zzso region by 320 zzso Although no sequence matched exactly the zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso differing by only one or two zzso from the zzso zzso were zzso Ten zzso were clustered within a zzso zzso region, and were arranged as zzso zzso A section of bent DNA structure was predicted within this zzso The bent DNA, which showed zzso zzso during zzso gel zzso was unique as its sequence was arranged as a symmetrical zzso zzso zzso The second zzso zzso and third zzso zzso zzso fragments mapped within zzso and zzso fragments which contain zzso repeat zzso The fourth zzso zzso zzso had the weakest zzso activity and mapped to the zzso or zzso regions of the zzso
