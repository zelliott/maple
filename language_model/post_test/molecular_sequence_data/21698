The delta zzso of the zzso sodium channel zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso is distinct from the related zzso zzso and zzso zzso known for their role in sodium zzso and blood pressure control, as zzso is expressed in brain zzso and activated by external zzso zzso zzso metabolism zzso domain 1) was previously found to associate with and zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso interacts with zzso through its zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso significantly reduced zzso surface zzso and led to an increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies show that zzso promoted zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso pool where the two proteins were localized zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso activity by reducing zzso surface expression through promoting zzso of surface zzso to an zzso recycling pool, possibly via enhanced zzso
