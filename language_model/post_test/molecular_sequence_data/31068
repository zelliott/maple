G box and I box sequences of the zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso promoter are required for expression zzso by the zzso zzso promoter in transgenic tobacco plants and are bound in zzso by factors from plant nuclear extracts termed zzso and zzso zzso We show here that a zzso to zzso zzso promoter zzso containing the G box and two I boxes activates zzso from a truncated zzso c zzso gene promoter in zzso zzso zzso of either the zzso G box or both I box sequences eliminated the expression zzso by this zzso When zzso I box zzso were also capable of enhancing expression from the truncated zzso zzso zzso G box sequences from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and tomato zzso promoters were more potent zzso and were used in mobility shift zzso to identify a DNA binding activity in zzso functionally similar to zzso In zzso interference experiments, the binding specificity of the zzso protein was indistinguishable from that obtained with plant nuclear zzso
