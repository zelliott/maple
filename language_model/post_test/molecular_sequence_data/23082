The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso from the major malaria zzso zzso zzso is solved at zzso A zzso The structure of zzso is of interest due to the dependence of the malaria zzso in infected human zzso on the zzso zzso for its energy zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso may also be required for other critical activities such as zzso complex zzso The zzso zzso is bound to all four zzso of the zzso zzso displaying excellent electron zzso In addition, in all four zzso a completely unexpected large island of extra electron density in the active site is observed, approaching closely the zzso zzso of the zzso This density is most likely the zzso inhibitor zzso found in maps from two different zzso This putative zzso zzso is positioned in a crucial location and hence our structure, with expected and unexpected zzso bound, can be of assistance in lead development and design of novel zzso
