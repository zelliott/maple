The nine zzso genes contained within the zzso gene complex zzso are precisely regulated during embryonic zzso It is not known to what extent the physical linkage of these genes contributes to their normal patterns of zzso Here we show that zzso regulatory elements associated with one zzso gene can act over a long distance zzso 20 zzso to influence the expression of another zzso zzso Specifically, zzso zzso zzso promoter elements can direct the periodic expression of the zzso zzso which normally shows a simple zzso zzso zzso pattern of zzso An 80 zzso deletion within the zzso zzso juxtaposes the zzso and zzso zzso resulting in a hybrid expression pattern zzso zzso transcripts are distributed within periodic stripes that are confined to zzso and lateral zzso and not observed in the zzso zzso This observation suggests that separate promoter elements of different genes can function in a zzso manner, and that the patterns of zzso gene expression might depend on zzso regulatory zzso
