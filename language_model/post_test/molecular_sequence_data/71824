zzso targeting and the activity of zzso zzso zzso are likely to be regulated by interactions with cellular zzso This report describes the identification and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso that binds via a zzso domain to the C zzso of zzso The interaction requires the zzso four zzso acids of zzso and is zzso specific because zzso does not interact with the C zzso of zzso or zzso Most rat zzso examined contain both zzso and zzso zzso whereas only small zzso lacked zzso zzso zzso zzso is also expressed in primary cultures of zzso and zzso as well as in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso canine zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso is able to bind to native zzso extracted from cell zzso zzso or interact with the zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso The presence of a zzso domain places zzso among a growing family of structural and regulatory zzso many of which are localized to areas of membrane zzso This and its ability to interact with zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso in cellular mechanisms for targeting zzso to specific zzso sites either by zzso the zzso to zzso motor proteins or by zzso the zzso to the zzso zzso
