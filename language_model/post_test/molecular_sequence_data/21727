Two zzso peptides zzso 1 and 2) derived from sequences zzso zzso zzso are zzso Their zzso acid sequences are zzso and zzso zzso One zzso zzso bridge is formed by these two zzso in both zzso 1 and zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso against several kinds of zzso were zzso They showed zzso activities against zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and fungus zzso zzso but little zzso activity against zzso zzso The results of zzso test showed they exerted strong zzso activities against zzso zzso following exposure for 5 h at zzso as low as 10 zzso They had weak zzso abilities against human and rabbit red zzso At the concentration of 250 zzso they induced red cell zzso of less than zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso peptides were investigated in several zzso Their main secondary structure components are zzso and zzso The current work provides a novel family of zzso and zzso peptides with unique zzso loop containing nine zzso acid zzso
