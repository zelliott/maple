The microbial communities of membrane zzso occurring in two zzso water zzso processes employing zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso zzso were characterized using a zzso approach that employed bacterial zzso zzso zzso clone library and zzso in zzso zzso zzso All methods showed that the zzso was the largest microbial fraction in the samples, followed by the zzso This suggested that members of these two groups could be responsible for the zzso on the zzso zzso Furthermore, the microbial community structures between the zzso and zzso samples were considerably different in composition of the most zzso zzso zzso clones and bacterial zzso from the zzso and only shared two common groups ( zzso zzso out of more than 17 different bacterial groups zzso The zzso and zzso samples further contained zzso and zzso zzso as the second zzso bacterial zzso respectively, and differed in minor bacterial clones and zzso The community structure differences were mainly attributed to differences in feed water, process zzso and operating zzso such as the pressure and zzso conditions present in the water zzso zzso
