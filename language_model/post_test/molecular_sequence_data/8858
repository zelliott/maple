zzso colonization on new zzso zzso represents the initiation of new soil zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed early bacterial communities growing on volcanic ash deposits derived from the 2000 Mount zzso zzso on the island of Miyake zzso zzso A site was established in an zzso area near the summit and investigated over a zzso period from 2003 to zzso zzso samples were zzso zzso zzso did not zzso any organic zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso around 106 cells zzso dry zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso groups I, II and III were found to be abundant in the deposits by clone library analysis of bacterial zzso zzso zzso The zzso dominance of zzso zzso was also supported by analysis of the gene coding for the large zzso of the form I zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparing the zzso zzso gene clone libraries from samples differing in age, shifts in zzso populations seemed to occur with deposit zzso The detection of known zzso zzso gene sequences from zzso zzso promoted us to propose the zzso iron cycle for the early microbial zzso on the zzso
