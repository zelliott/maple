zzso virus zzso are composed of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso is necessary for viral infection, it is not essential for zzso zzso The other zzso zzso zzso and zzso are sufficient for zzso formation, but the functional roles of each protein are still not well zzso By analyzing a series of deletion zzso of zzso we identified a region necessary for nuclear transfer of zzso and found that the efficiency of nuclear zzso of the zzso proteins and the efficiency of zzso particle zzso formation correlated zzso To confirm the importance of the nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso we fused the nuclear zzso signal of zzso virus 40 large T zzso to zzso zzso We show that this fusion protein could form zzso indicating that the zzso region located on the zzso side of the protein is not structurally zzso This finding suggests that zzso has sufficient information for zzso formation and that zzso is necessary only for nuclear transfer of the zzso zzso
