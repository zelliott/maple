Recently, we have designed a series of simplified artificial signal sequences and have shown that a zzso zzso in the signal sequence plays an important role in the zzso of human zzso in zzso presumably by altering the zzso of the signal sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso To zzso the zzso requirement of the signal sequence in more detail, functional and zzso signal sequences connected to the zzso five zzso of mature human zzso were chemically zzso and their zzso in a zzso environment zzso zzso zzso or sodium zzso zzso zzso analyzed by circular zzso zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso including functional zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso was estimated from CD zzso to be zzso and zzso respectively, indicating that the zzso structure is more abundant in the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso analyses in 50% zzso revealed that each zzso adopted a zzso zzso throughout the sequence except for a few zzso at the zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso exchange experiments indicated that the zzso structure of the zzso region of the functional signal sequences zzso and zzso was less stable than that of the zzso signal sequences zzso and zzso On the basis of these results, a model was developed in which the functional signal sequence is inserted in the membrane with a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso unraveled in an extended zzso form through an interaction with the signal zzso
