The structural proteins of zzso virus zzso are translated as a large zzso zzso zzso which is processed to produce the mature zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso and the two envelope zzso E1 zzso and zzso zzso to zzso The precise processing mechanism has not been zzso however it must include at least two zzso zzso to release the individual zzso components from the zzso and it must provide for their zzso zzso zzso The C protein remains in the zzso where it zzso in the formation of zzso while the envelope zzso enter the cellular zzso zzso and are zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso precursor suggests that both E1 and zzso are preceded by signal peptides for zzso across the membrane of the rough zzso zzso A recent study has provided direct evidence that the putative signal zzso preceding E1 can in fact mediate zzso of zzso In this study, we have used in zzso zzso zzso to examine further the processing of RV zzso We have shown that the putative signal sequence preceding zzso can mediate zzso of the zzso protein in the absence of an intact E1 signal zzso The experiments also revealed that zzso of the zzso zzso requires zzso the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences beyond the zzso half of the E1 signal zzso Together these results suggest that separation of the zzso signal sequence as well as the zzso zzso of E1 from zzso is performed by the cellular zzso signal zzso
