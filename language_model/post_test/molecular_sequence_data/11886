The zzso zzso zzso is an integral part of the signal zzso pathways of a number of zzso and growth factors, including zzso Previously, we identified a zzso binding site for the C zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso on the membrane zzso region of the zzso domain of the zzso R zzso Using both a zzso binding zzso and zzso with zzso zzso we were able to demonstrate specific interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this interaction is increased by the addition of zzso zzso or its zzso zzso zzso We also identified two regions of the zzso domain of the zzso that interact with zzso using synthetic peptides of the zzso zzso in zzso competition zzso These regions are zzso by zzso zzso zzso which is adjacent to the membrane zzso region at which the C zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which lies near the C zzso of the zzso encompassing a potentially important zzso zzso These data show zzso interaction between zzso and zzso with the zzso R and have broader implications for the role of the zzso zzso in the zzso signal zzso zzso Furthermore, the data support previous studies that demonstrated that zzso zzso plays a role in cell zzso
