The process by which zzso zzso a soluble zzso protein found in tissue zzso forms zzso zzso networks in the zzso zzso is poorly zzso zzso sites found in zzso type III zzso have been hypothesized to function as nucleation points, thereby initiating zzso Exposure of these sites could occur upon zzso mechanical zzso of type III zzso Here, we present the solution structures of the second type III domain of human zzso zzso and that of an interaction complex between the first two type III zzso zzso The two zzso are connected through a long zzso flexible in zzso A weak but specific zzso interaction maintains zzso in a closed zzso that associates zzso with the zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso interaction by zzso zzso dramatically enhances association with zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso reveals that the zzso zzso is necessary for robust zzso zzso zzso We speculate on the importance of this interaction for zzso function and present a possible mechanism by which tension could initiate zzso
