A novel zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso stem of the zzso plant zzso zzso zzso collected from zzso Province, zzso China, and was characterized to determine its zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the isolate was closely related to members of the zzso zzso in the family zzso being most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso and zzso nova zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between strain zzso zzso and the type strains of other recognized species of the zzso zzso were less than 97 zzso zzso data supported the affiliation of the new isolate to the zzso zzso However, the novel strain could be distinguished from its closest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a range of zzso zzso The combination of low zzso zzso values and zzso differences from zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso
