The zzso sequence of the gene zzso the zzso zzso protein of zzso virus zzso zzso strain, has been determined from several overlapping zzso zzso The M protein zzso is zzso zzso in zzso exclusive of the zzso tail, and codes for a protein of 375 zzso acids zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the M protein of the zzso strain with that of the zzso strain revealed that the M proteins of both strains are highly zzso A significantly lower rate of zzso differences conducive to zzso acid differences in the M gene compared with other genes appeared to indicate the importance of the zzso primary structure of the M protein for its zzso
