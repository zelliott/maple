Currently, 16 zzso that contribute to the development of zzso in the zzso mouse have been mapped by linkage zzso To fine map these zzso we used zzso zzso Using this approach, we localized the zzso locus to a zzso zzso on zzso 3 containing the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the known variations within this zzso indicated that only one zzso a zzso substitution at position 6 of the mature zzso zzso zzso consistently zzso with zzso in crosses between zzso and a series of zzso mouse zzso These data, taken together with the zzso role of zzso provide circumstantial evidence in support of the hypothesis that zzso is an zzso variation of the zzso zzso or a zzso in strong linkage zzso
