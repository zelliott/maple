We identify an zzso zzso in the zzso gene in a family with a chronic zzso This zzso zzso energetically favors zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso domain, and thus, strongly promotes zzso zzso of the zzso and hypersensitivity to zzso for proliferation and zzso which ultimately leads to chronic zzso zzso zzso stem cells yield a zzso disorder in zzso and zzso mouse bone zzso zzso zzso The survey of 12 affected individuals during three generations indicates that only one patient had a zzso zzso Our data thus indicate that zzso in the zzso gene can be responsible for zzso zzso mimicking a zzso zzso
