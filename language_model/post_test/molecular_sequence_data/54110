A zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from soil attached to a spawn used in the laboratory to grow the edible mushroom zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence similarities, strain zzso was shown to belong to the zzso zzso and was most closely related to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso system was determined to consist predominantly of zzso zzso minor amounts of zzso and zzso The polar zzso profile consisted of the major compounds zzso and zzso moderate amounts of two zzso zzso and zzso and minor amounts of zzso three unidentified zzso two zzso and a zzso zzso acids were zzso These zzso traits and the major fatty zzso which were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso supported the affiliation of strain zzso to the zzso zzso The results of zzso and zzso tests allowed clear zzso differentiation of strain zzso from the most closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
