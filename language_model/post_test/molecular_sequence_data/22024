The bacterial strain zzso along with 15 other zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated by enrichment on reduced sulfur compounds as the sole energy and electron source from zzso immediately adjacent to the roots of zzso zzso a slender zzso herb of the Lower zzso plains of zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso and zzso sulfur for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso analyses showed that the zzso zzso zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso low zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso gene sequence similarities to all existing species of the most closely related zzso a unique fatty acid profile, a distinct zzso content zzso zzso and zzso characteristics all suggested that strain zzso represents a novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso proteins also confirmed the zzso uniqueness of zzso It is therefore proposed that isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso be classified as the type strain of a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso
