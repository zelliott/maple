The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is an zzso zzso required before the first zzso reaction in zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso in the absence of zzso and is released following zzso zzso It contains three zzso a unique zzso domain, a zzso domain that is highly zzso in the zzso protein family, and a zzso domain that is zzso in zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso We examined the role of each domain of zzso by deletion zzso Whereas deletions of either the zzso or zzso domain are zzso deletions in the zzso domain have no zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of a zzso strain, suggesting that the zzso interferes with the activity of the zzso zzso A genetic approach was then taken to study interactions between zzso and the zzso Previously, we isolated dominant negative zzso in the zzso domain of zzso that inhibit the activity of zzso zzso when the zzso protein is zzso We zzso one zzso release zzso gene and screened for loss of dominant negative zzso Several weak binding zzso were isolated and mapped to the C zzso of zzso further indicating the importance of the C zzso in zzso zzso This study is the first to indicate that zzso acid zzso outside the zzso domain can abolish zzso contact and zzso activity of a zzso zzso zzso
