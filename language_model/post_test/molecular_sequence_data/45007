zzso proteins are important zzso zzso proteins zzso during the development of zzso zzso Members of the zzso gene family have not been detected outside the zzso raising unanswered questions about their evolutionary zzso Here we report a highly unusual zzso gene from a zzso a close zzso relative of the zzso The deduced zzso domain, zzso is zzso to the zzso domain of zzso proteins and is predicted to function in zzso zzso of the precursor zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso has no similarity to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Instead, zzso is deduced to be a zzso protein with an enormous zzso domain of unprecedented size and purity (over 200 zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that these zzso have a novel combination of features found in zzso zzso zzso of types zzso and zzso and are expected to bind zzso We propose that the two zzso zzso enable zzso to bind to plant matter, zzso an zzso zzso anchor, zzso transient zzso of the zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso are zzso but zzso and zzso are not, we argue that zzso zzso genes evolved by fusion of two distinct zzso
