The zzso zzso elicits a range of biological effects by interaction with specific zzso zzso Human and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso clones have previously been isolated using expression zzso We have used the human zzso zzso in zzso screening to isolate the gene zzso zzso in both human zzso and mouse zzso The gene spans approximately zzso zzso in both zzso its structural organization is zzso and is unique among zzso zzso The coding sequence is contained on three zzso with zzso 1 zzso the zzso end of the zzso and the first five zzso zzso zzso 2 encodes the third zzso loop, while zzso 3 encodes the remainder of the zzso from zzso domain 6 to the zzso of the zzso zzso The mouse and human zzso zzso proteins are 348 and zzso zzso acids long, respectively, and display zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso The mouse zzso gene has been localized to zzso zzso zzso with the previously reported zzso of the human zzso gene to zzso in the same zzso group as the genes zzso nuclear factor of activated zzso zzso 1, and zzso basic zzso
