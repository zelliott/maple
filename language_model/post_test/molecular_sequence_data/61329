In an earlier report we identified specific modifications and zzso of zzso releasing factor zzso that led to the discovery of zzso with extended duration of action as compared to that of zzso zzso zzso These additional modifications included zzso of the zzso chain by three zzso at the zzso its zzso and the zzso substitution to yield zzso zzso zzso which was found to be longer acting than zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1998, 41, zzso To further increase the efficiency zzso duration of action, and zzso of this family of antagonists, we introduced two or more zzso zzso at positions shown in earlier studies to be favorable zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1993, 36, zzso Whereas the introduction of zzso zzso at positions 27 and either 18 zzso 37 zzso or 40 zzso resulted in dramatic increases in duration of zzso action in the zzso zzso rat after intravenous injection, the same substitution at positions 27 and either 15 zzso zzso 17 zzso 19 zzso zzso or 41 zzso led to short acting zzso Other zzso by zzso at positions 27 and either 10 zzso 13 zzso 14 zzso 21 zzso 24 zzso 36 zzso or 38 zzso yielded zzso with duration of action intermediate between those mentioned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, zzso was one of the most zzso zzso of this series zzso h zzso of zzso zzso at 25 zzso zzso It was found to be even longer acting via subcutaneous administration in either an zzso zzso h zzso of zzso zzso at 100 zzso zzso or zzso milieu zzso oil, zzso h zzso of zzso zzso at 30 zzso zzso than after intravenous administration zzso h zzso of zzso zzso at 100 zzso zzso We concluded that zzso at some positions may favor a zzso zzso while also preventing degradation and/or zzso resulting in significant extension of duration of zzso
