The zzso zzso cascade is essential for the development of both zzso and zzso and is altered during zzso Although a general framework for zzso zzso has been zzso not all of the components have been zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso which was isolated by expression cloning in zzso zzso zzso reproduces several properties of zzso signals, including generation of complete zzso zzso stabilization of zzso and induction of genes that are direct targets of zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso and a pharmacological blocker of zzso inhibited zzso signals in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso generated worms with a mom zzso indicative of a loss of zzso zzso In addition, zzso bound to and increased the zzso of zzso a known component of the zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso may be a zzso component of the zzso zzso
