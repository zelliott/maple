The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a small zzso zzso zzso required for normal production of zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in impaired processing of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and marked zzso of mature zzso zzso The present report describes results of functional mapping of zzso by a variety of zzso zzso Special attention was directed at assessing the importance of sequence elements zzso between zzso and mouse zzso as well as other zzso zzso zzso was assessed in a test strain containing a zzso dependent zzso zzso The results show portions of three zzso zzso regions to be required for zzso zzso or zzso These regions include bases in: zzso the zzso box C region, zzso the zzso box D region, and zzso a 13 base domain complementary to zzso zzso Point and zzso substitution zzso in the zzso zzso box C and box D regions prevent zzso zzso zzso in the essential zzso related domain do not effect zzso levels, but do disrupt synthesis of zzso zzso indicating that this region is required for zzso Taken together, the results suggest that the box C and box D regions influence zzso expression or stability and that zzso function might involve direct interaction with zzso zzso
