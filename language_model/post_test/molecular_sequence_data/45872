Under conditions of zzso pH and elevated temperature, insulin partially unfolds and zzso into highly structured zzso zzso zzso of insulin leads to loss of activity and can trigger an unwanted immune zzso zzso that prevent protein zzso have been used to stabilize zzso these compounds generally suppress zzso only at relatively high inhibitor zzso For example, effective zzso of zzso of zzso zzso insulin required zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso Here, we investigate a targeted approach toward zzso insulin zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of full-length insulin, was identified as a short zzso that interacts with full-length zzso A hybrid zzso was zzso that contained this binding domain and zzso zzso this zzso significantly reduced the rate of insulin zzso at zzso zzso An effective binding domain and zzso placement of the zzso zzso were necessary for zzso zzso The data were analyzed using a simple zzso model of zzso zzso These results are useful not only in identifying an insulin zzso inhibitor but also in extending a targeted protein strategy for zzso zzso of zzso zzso
