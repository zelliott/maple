The zzso cassette zzso associated with zzso processing zzso plays a key role in the zzso immune defense against infected or zzso transformed cells by zzso zzso degradation products into the zzso of the zzso zzso for loading onto zzso class I zzso The broad zzso spectrum of zzso rendering peptides from 8 to 40 zzso including even zzso or modified zzso suggests an unforeseen structural flexibility of the zzso zzso Here we used zzso zzso to reveal zzso details of the bound zzso zzso dynamics and environmental polarity were derived from zzso attached zzso spin zzso whereas zzso acid zzso peptides were used to detect backbone zzso zzso on the spin zzso position, striking differences in zzso zzso and polarity were zzso The zzso mobility was strongly restricted at the ends of the zzso whereas the central region was flexible, suggesting a central zzso zzso In the end, double electron electron resonance allowed the determination of zzso distances in doubly labeled peptides bound to zzso zzso based on a zzso library led to the conclusion that peptides bind to TAP in an extended zzso structure, analogous to those bound to zzso class I zzso
