In examining the production of valuable compounds by marine zzso we isolated a novel zzso strain that produces a large amount of zzso and several zzso fatty zzso zzso and zzso analyses of the zzso DNA suggest that the isolate belongs to the zzso zzso which comprises zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of an internally transcribed zzso region from isolate zzso zzso zzso showed zzso similarity with those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are close relatives of the zzso In considering use of zzso zzso zzso for zzso production, the efficiency of zzso production was investigated under different zzso zzso was the best carbon source for the production of zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso production was activated and an optimum ratio of zzso to zzso extract was zzso For the optimal zzso production, the concentration of zzso was 40 g zzso and the best nitrogen source was sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to produce up to zzso zzso of biomass and zzso zzso of zzso In an optimal condition, the content and yield of zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso were much greater than those obtained from zzso previously reported as zzso zzso We identified, zzso and characterized zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso The zzso production rate of zzso zzso zzso makes it an ideal candidate for the commercialization of microbial zzso
