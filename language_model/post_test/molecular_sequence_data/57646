The zzso associated system I fibers of the zzso apparatus of the flagellate green zzso zzso zzso are zzso and display a zzso zzso zzso with similar zzso are formed in zzso by zzso which is the major protein component of system I zzso We have determined the zzso acid sequence of zzso and show that it contains two structural zzso The zzso 31 zzso form a zzso domain rich in zzso The rod domain of zzso zzso is zzso and seems to form a segmented coiled zzso with a zzso repeat pattern based on four zzso followed by a skip zzso The distinct cluster of zzso zzso at the zzso end of the motifs zzso about 4 zzso may be related to zzso binding of zzso and/or its self zzso A similar structure has been predicted from zzso cloning of zzso a protein of the complex zzso apparatus of the sucking disc in the zzso flagellate zzso zzso Although the rod zzso of zzso and zzso share only zzso sequence identity, they have exactly the same length and display zzso sequence zzso These results predict that system I fibers and related zzso associated structures arise from molecules able to form a special segmented coiled zzso which can pack into zzso zzso Such molecules seem subject to a strong evolutionary drift in sequence but not in sequence principles and zzso This conservation of molecular architecture may have important implications for zzso zzso
