zzso zzso are zzso drug zzso zzso in the liver and zzso zzso Human zzso is uniquely stable against heat zzso To understand the unique properties of zzso the three-dimensional structure was constructed by zzso modeling using a crystal structure of zzso as zzso zzso alignment analysis revealed that 13 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are unique to zzso as compared with zzso zzso and zzso To examine the roles of these zzso in the zzso stability of zzso molecular dynamics simulation of the structures was carried out at 310 K and 360 K in zzso solution for zzso zzso Root mean square zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were responsible for the zzso zzso Root mean square fluctuation analyses and a zzso cross correlation map revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were responsible for the zzso zzso In zzso study using zzso of these zzso demonstrated that all these zzso acids may be collectively involved in the zzso stability of zzso The results presented here provide a molecular basis for the zzso stability of human zzso
