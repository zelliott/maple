The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso to zzso The zzso had an apparent molecular mass of 140 zzso and was composed of a single type of zzso of 33 zzso suggesting a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence did not show significant similarity to zzso isolated from zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were determined for both reaction directions at pH 6 and at 85 degrees zzso Rate dependence on all zzso followed zzso zzso The apparent zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso the apparent zzso was about 41 zzso zzso could not be replaced by zzso zzso or zzso as zzso zzso thus defining the zzso as an zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso the zzso accepted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, less zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso activity was not zzso regulated by classical zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso or zzso The zzso also zzso in zzso the reverse reaction with an apparent zzso for zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and an apparent zzso of about zzso zzso zzso zzso were required for zzso zzso zzso which was most effective, could be replaced partially by zzso zzso or zzso The zzso had a temperature optimum of 90 degrees C and showed a significant zzso up to 100 degrees C, which is in accordance with its zzso function under zzso zzso This is the first description of an zzso zzso from the domain of zzso characterized as an extremely zzso zzso zzso
