The zzso factor zzso belongs to a family containing a zzso zzso zzso This zzso domain is composed of a zzso domain zzso and a zzso zzso connected by a flexible zzso The left half of the optimal zzso binding site, the zzso zzso is recognized by zzso and the right half by zzso We have determined the solution structure of zzso by nuclear magnetic zzso It consists of four zzso connected by short zzso zzso I and IV are in a parallel zzso zzso The folding zzso appears to be similar to that of the zzso zzso and 434 zzso For the well defined parts of the protein zzso zzso the average zzso square zzso for the backbone atoms is zzso zzso Based on the observed selective exchange broadening in the zzso zzso multiple quantum zzso spectrum of the zzso complex we conclude that zzso is zzso by zzso zzso We propose a model for the zzso complex in which both recognition zzso from the two zzso have adjacent positions in the major zzso
