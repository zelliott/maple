A zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the host zzso coli was screened for zzso and plasmids zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso was found to contain a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso termed zzso which encodes an zzso zzso assigned to family zzso zzso zzso acid sequence determination revealed that zzso zzso the full-length zzso zzso including a signal zzso while zzso carried a zzso zzso gene expressed as an zzso fusion zzso zzso delta zzso without a signal zzso zzso was zzso into the zzso in zzso zzso In this zzso zzso zzso of zzso at or near a putative zzso region resulted in the appearance of two active zzso of molecular masses 57 and 47 zzso The former was the full-length zzso while the latter consisted of the zzso domain from which the zzso domain zzso had been removed zzso delta zzso The zzso zzso delta N' was not subject to zzso zzso The pH and temperature zzso of zzso were pH zzso and 43 degrees C, zzso zzso zzso barley zzso zzso zzso and zzso It showed preferential activity against the larger zzso zzso and zzso zzso was the smallest zzso zzso zzso
