Using zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso we identify two zzso that are required to generate stable, zzso active zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequence zzso to zzso results in the formation of stable zzso zzso that lack zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso Genes incorporating either the processing zzso or the zzso substitution suppress zzso zzso gene expression in a zzso zzso zzso occurs because the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso to form inactive or unstable zzso zzso is exerted across zzso zzso thus, the mouse zzso chain zzso inhibit the activity of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene suppresses expression of zzso zzso as well as zzso The processing zzso zzso however, suppresses only zzso zzso zzso of zzso and other growth factors which, like zzso function as zzso may prove useful for creating animals models of growth factor zzso disease states and for revealing the function of growth factors during early embryonic zzso
