In zzso the products of the zzso group zzso of genes act as zzso zzso protein complexes that repress expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified, but the nature of the complexes they form and the mechanisms of their action are largely zzso The zzso zzso zzso is implicated in zzso patterning in the mouse and here we show that it acts as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we have identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that interact directly with the zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso display blocks of similarity throughout their zzso including an zzso zzso finger zzso However, the interaction with zzso occurs through a region at the zzso zzso zzso zzso through sequences not involved in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in nuclear zzso with zzso and other zzso zzso such as zzso The expression of zzso at early stages of development is restricted to the neural tube, whereas zzso is expressed zzso Within the neural tube, zzso zzso is located at the zzso boundaries of the zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso may contribute to a zzso function of zzso complexes during zzso zzso
