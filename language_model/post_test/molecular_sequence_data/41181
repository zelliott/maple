Many inherited disorders of calcium and zzso zzso are unexplained at the molecular zzso 

The objective of the study was to identify the molecular basis of zzso and calcium abnormalities in two zzso zzso zzso 

The affected members in family 1 presented with zzso due to profound urinary zzso and zzso zzso In the previously reported family 2, patients presented with zzso zzso zzso and zzso yet normal or only mildly increased urinary zzso zzso 

zzso linkage scans and direct zzso sequence analyses of candidate genes were zzso Transport of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso 2 zzso was assessed using zzso zzso Renal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso expressions were evaluated in zzso rescued zzso mice zzso 

In both families, genetic mapping and sequence analysis of candidate genes led to the identification of two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso the gene zzso in zzso syndrome, a rare disease usually characterized by zzso zzso impaired zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso showed a significant reduction in zzso zzso but neither zzso nor zzso zzso facilitated zzso import or zzso zzso mice demonstrated a profound reduction of zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso which cause zzso syndrome, can lead to very different clinical and zzso findings that are not limited to mild zzso zzso zzso but can include significant zzso and highly variable degrees of urinary zzso and zzso possibly because of the impaired zzso zzso expression of zzso
