Low temperature is one of the important environmental changes that affect plant growth and agricultural zzso To investigate the responses of rice to cold stress, changes in protein expression were analyzed using a zzso zzso zzso rice zzso were exposed to 5 degrees C for 48 zzso then total crude proteins were extracted from leaf zzso leaf zzso and roots, separated by zzso and stained with zzso Of the zzso protein spots from each organ, 39 proteins changed in abundance after cold stress, with 19 proteins zzso and 20 proteins zzso In leaf zzso it was difficult to detect the changes in zzso proteins due to the presence of an abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso large zzso zzso zzso which accounted for about 50% of the total zzso To overcome this problem, an zzso column was prepared to trap zzso zzso and the remaining proteins in the flow through from the column were subsequently separated using zzso As a result, slight changes in stress responsive proteins were clearly displayed, and four proteins were newly detected after cold zzso From identified zzso it was concluded that proteins related to energy metabolism were zzso and zzso proteins were zzso in leaf zzso by cold zzso These results suggest that energy production is activated in the chilling zzso zzso stress-related proteins are rapidly zzso while zzso proteins disappear, under long-term cold zzso
