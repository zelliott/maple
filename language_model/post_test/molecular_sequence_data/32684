The zzso domain zzso by an zzso zzso zzso gene zzso of the zzso fungus zzso was expressed in zzso zzso under the control of the zzso promoter and zzso No zzso protein was detected in zzso zzso culture zzso when the original sequence was fused to the zzso zzso zzso region coding for its signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso AT zzso with a synthetic sequence containing lower AT content zzso supported the zzso production zzso zzso zzso of the fusion zzso by zzso zzso Northern analysis revealed that successful production after the decrease in AT content was related to higher levels of the zzso zzso Another construct with an zzso sequence inserted between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain allowed production of the fully processed active zzso zzso zzso Both the fusion (40 zzso and the fully processed zzso zzso forms displayed zzso properties of family 11 zzso Both the R and the zzso zzso sites were recognized during zzso resulting in a mixture of two zzso zzso for the zzso zzso The work demonstrated for the first time that zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso can be produced by zzso zzso
