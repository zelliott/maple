zzso zzso the native structure of proteins and induce zzso zzso The potential of alcohols causing such effects varies substantially depending on the alcohol zzso With zzso as a model zzso we compared the effects of various alcohols and observed the additive contribution of each group zzso the alcohol zzso Whereas the zzso hydrocarbon group promotes the transition according to their size, zzso zzso group suppresses the zzso zzso groups promote the transition depending on their type and zzso It has been known that alcohols induce the zzso structure on the short peptides such as zzso There is a close correlation between the zzso of alcohol in zzso zzso and those in inducing the zzso structure in zzso indicating that the underlying mechanisms of the two phenomena are the zzso
