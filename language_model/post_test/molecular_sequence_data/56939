DNA of human zzso type 18 is present in several human cancer cell lines that were derived from oral or cervical tumors, and it is known that several features of the transformed zzso can be inhibited by expression of zzso zzso to human zzso zzso The present study was performed to find out whether zzso zzso were also zzso zzso zzso were made that were complementary to regions of the start zzso of the E6 and zzso genes of zzso These were added to cultures of the oral cancer cell line zzso and the cervical cancer cell line zzso each of which contain DNA of zzso As controls we used the oral cancer cell line 183 and the monkey kidney cell line zzso which do not contain zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso between 1 and 5 zzso significantly inhibited the growth of the zzso and zzso cells, but not the 183 or zzso cell zzso Treatment of the zzso cells with a combination of zzso zzso of each of the zzso zzso was a more effective inhibitor than 5 zzso of either one used zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the ability of zzso cells to form zzso in soft zzso nor on their zzso efficiency or serum zzso zzso examination of zzso cells showed that the zzso zzso zzso produced zzso detachment from the surface of the culture zzso and cell death, while the zzso E6 zzso had none of these zzso zzso zzso had no effects of any type on any cells that were growing in zzso However, if zzso zzso were added to cells at the time they were passed to a new culture vessel, they produced severe zzso toxic zzso These results show that the use of synthetic zzso is an effective way of producing zzso changes in the behavior of human cancer cells that contain DNA of zzso
