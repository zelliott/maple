The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso gene was identified in a comprehensive zzso zzso aimed at identifying genes regulated by zzso in the rat zzso zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso that were discovered in zzso zzso as zzso that have the same zzso sequence and differ only in their metal zzso This family of proteins is zzso zzso from bacteria to humans and is involved in the zzso salvage zzso Northern and Western zzso confirmed the regulation of zzso by zzso in the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a variety of zzso however, its regulation by zzso was specific to the zzso zzso is expressed by the zzso zzso cells of the rat zzso with little or no expression in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the different rat zzso tumor cell lines compared with the normal or zzso rat zzso zzso studies showed that zzso zzso is not tolerated by zzso zzso Further studies demonstrated that zzso is also zzso in the human prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso cell death in these zzso Taken together, our observations suggest that zzso may have an important role in zzso regulated prostate zzso as well as in prostate cancer progression by regulating cell death of prostate cancer zzso
