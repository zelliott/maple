The exact molecular mechanism of zzso zzso death still remains unclear from zzso to zzso A number of studies using lower species animals have suggested implication of zzso zzso while using monkeys the authors recently claimed necrosis cascade by zzso leakage of zzso zzso zzso zzso This paper is to study implications of zzso versus zzso zzso for the development of zzso zzso zzso death in the zzso brain undergoing complete global zzso Here, we focused on two terminal cell death zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso II, in the monkey zzso sector undergoing 18 zzso zzso The expressions of their zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso as well as zzso and specific DNA gel zzso were zzso zzso of zzso was much less in the normal brain, compared with the zzso zzso or heart zzso On day 1 after zzso however, zzso zzso and protein were significantly increased in the zzso sector, and then zzso protein zzso showed a zzso from the zzso into the zzso zzso zzso II protein was significantly increased on days 2 and 3 after zzso and also showed a similar zzso indicating zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso showed positive terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso zzso on days zzso they showed zzso zzso necrosis on light zzso and frank membrane disruption and mild zzso zzso on electron zzso Furthermore, DNA zzso pattern typical for necrosis was observed instead of DNA zzso These data altogether suggest that the zzso zzso zzso death of the monkey occurs not by zzso but by necrosis with zzso of zzso zzso zzso II and zzso as well as zzso The interactions between zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso should be studied zzso
