The zzso zzso protein is an integral membrane protein expressed exclusively in zzso where it plays a critical role in the ability of these cells to destroy zzso zzso The zzso mechanism of action of zzso remains zzso We report the identification and characterization of zzso clones corresponding to three zzso of the zzso zzso gene from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These three genes zzso a novel group of highly similar zzso zzso sharing between zzso and zzso sequence zzso that show similar zzso profiles, and predicted secondary structure, including the same number, position, and sequence characteristics (including zzso zzso of zzso zzso Together, these define a highly zzso membrane associated zzso zzso The three plant proteins show a remarkable degree of sequence similarity with their zzso counterpart zzso to zzso zzso including primary and secondary structure elements previously described in zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies in normal plant zzso indicate that while zzso is expressed primarily in roots, and zzso is primarily expressed in leaves, zzso is expressed in both zzso The recent discovery that the zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso raises the exciting possibility that zzso encodes a family of metal zzso zzso in zzso
