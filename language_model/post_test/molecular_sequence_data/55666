A simple and sensitive procedure of reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was developed previously such that all 4 zzso of dengue viruses could be detected and their zzso identified simultaneously in a zzso zzso In this study we compared the zzso with a conventional zzso zzso zzso method for the identification of dengue viruses currently isolated from patient zzso zzso zzso taken from dengue zzso fever zzso patients were subjected to virus isolation by zzso onto zzso cell zzso zzso for the presence of dengue viruses in culture zzso was done after 7 days of incubation by zzso zzso using zzso rabbit zzso virus zzso as the primary zzso zzso viruses in positive cultures were further identified for their zzso by zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso out of the 66 serum specimens tested zzso were positive for dengue zzso Of these, 5 were type 1 zzso 25 were type 2 zzso and 2 contained both zzso and zzso All cultures that were positive by zzso method were also positive by zzso and vice zzso Thus, the results obtained by zzso were in good agreement with those by zzso It is important to point out that while all 5 zzso zzso reacted readily with the zzso zzso only 2 of them could be identified by the zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso variation among zzso zzso occur frequently and this should be taken into consideration in the selection of appropriate zzso zzso for zzso of dengue zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
