Several zzso of zzso coli that had lost their ability to zzso zzso acid zzso via the zzso zzso were zzso Their defective zzso were classified into two groups, zzso and zzso The genes that zzso these zzso were zzso zzso sequencing indicated that the gene that zzso zzso was identical to zzso which is located at 4 zzso on the zzso coli zzso and encodes zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso contained an open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids that was found to be a new gene involved in the synthesis of zzso via the zzso zzso Thus, we designated the gene zzso The zzso gene was adjacent to zzso that is located at 27 zzso and previously thought to zzso zzso zzso However, we found that zzso zzso both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso defective in the zzso zzso although the zzso showed small colonies on the selective medium without zzso These results suggest that zzso is not involved in the zzso pathway, but controls a second, minor zzso for the synthesis of zzso
