In a screen for novel sequences expressed during embryonic heart development we have isolated a gene which encodes a putative zzso zzso This protein is a member of one of the largest families of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene has been named zzso (for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is zzso acids long and contains a single zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is expressed at highest levels in the zzso of the heart and to a lesser extent in the zzso layer of the zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in each of these zzso begins at approximately the time of differentiation and is maintained throughout zzso Analysis of the zzso expression of the zzso zzso from chicken and mouse reveals that, like zzso the most prominent tissue of expression is the developing zzso The sequence and expression pattern of zzso suggests a role in zzso regulation of heart zzso
