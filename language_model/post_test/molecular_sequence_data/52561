The nuclear zzso and zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the activity of other zzso factors in the zzso differentiation and inflammatory response zzso We examined the possible function of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso formation from zzso zzso stem cells zzso zzso using a zzso system comprised of human zzso stem cells zzso and zzso zzso both derived from bone zzso zzso formation in this zzso system is enhanced by the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso an essential zzso differentiation factor, and zzso stimulating factor zzso The data indicate that soluble zzso zzso and zzso stimulate zzso formation in the zzso up to zzso compared with zzso zzso alone treated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso express zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso completely blocked the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso formation and zzso The zzso effect of zzso is specific to the zzso lineage in both human and mouse models of zzso zzso parallel experiments demonstrate that zzso activates the zzso zzso within mouse zzso zzso and this effect was abolished by zzso These data establish a link between zzso and zzso signaling within zzso zzso and support a role for zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso
