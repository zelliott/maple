We have isolated zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso with the alpha 1 external domain of the zzso zzso by selecting for T cells capable of recognizing a zzso major zzso complex zzso class I zzso sharing alpha 1 sequences with zzso Using these zzso we demonstrate that a synthetic alpha 1 zzso corresponding to one of the zzso derived from the zzso zzso can be presented by a class I restriction element to zzso a zzso zzso borne by intact zzso Moreover, several other zzso zzso generated independently were also able to recognize zzso either as an intact zzso or as a zzso in conjunction with appropriate class I restriction zzso These data demonstrate that an zzso zzso can zzso a zzso target structure and suggest that some zzso T cells in fact might be directed against zzso class I peptides in the context of a class I zzso
