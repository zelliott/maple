zzso zzso is a key zzso in the recycling of the neurotransmitter zzso zzso of this zzso is regulated by zzso which induce a high level of zzso zzso in neural but not in various zzso zzso This is despite the fact that zzso cells express functional zzso zzso molecules capable of inducing other target zzso zzso and functional analysis of the upstream region of the zzso zzso gene identified, zzso to the zzso response element zzso a zzso pair zzso zzso zzso element zzso which showed considerable zzso with the neural restrictive zzso element zzso The zzso was able to markedly repress the induction of gene zzso by zzso in zzso cells and in embryonic neural zzso The repressive activity of the zzso could be zzso on a zzso zzso promoter and was zzso and zzso with respect to the zzso start site, but appeared to depend on a location zzso to the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso cells and cells of early embryonic zzso contain a high level of zzso binding activity and that this level declines progressively with zzso Our results suggest that the zzso might be involved in the restriction of zzso zzso induction by zzso to differentiated neural zzso
