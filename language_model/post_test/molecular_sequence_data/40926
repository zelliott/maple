zzso zzso zzso is central for understanding the transmission and zzso of zzso zzso We performed a zzso comparison between the zzso evolution of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso B and zzso The results showed that zzso and zzso zzso experienced differential evolutionary patterns and different zzso genes encountered various positive selection pressures, suggesting that complex selection pressures are driving zzso zzso Compared with other zzso regions of zzso significantly more positively selected sites were detected in the zzso region of zzso B zzso zzso V2 region of zzso B zzso zzso and zzso and zzso regions of zzso C zzso zzso indicating an association of positive selection with zzso zzso zzso a significantly higher proportion zzso and zzso zzso of positively selected sites were identified in the zzso region than other zzso regions of zzso in all the analyzed zzso zzso indicating that the zzso region might be more important to zzso adaptation than previously zzso zzso half of the positively selected sites identified in the zzso gene were identical between zzso and zzso zzso There were three common positively selected sites zzso 113 and zzso identified in zzso of all zzso and zzso zzso from zzso B and zzso These sites might not only suggest a functional importance in viral survival and adaptation, but also imply a potential zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso which has important implications for AIDS vaccine zzso
