The zzso acid sequences associated with zzso zzso binding sites in chicken liver fatty acid zzso have been zzso a site whose modification causes selective zzso of the zzso zzso activity and a site zzso I) that is not associated with zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of peptides obtained by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso labeled zzso were zzso For the site associated with zzso zzso activity, the sequence similarities between chicken and goose are extensive and include the sequence zzso a characteristic structural feature of zzso zzso In addition, the spatial relationships between the zzso zzso binding sites and zzso zzso have been studied with zzso resonance zzso zzso The distances between site I and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites are greater than 50 and zzso A, zzso The distance between the two zzso sites is greater than 49 zzso
