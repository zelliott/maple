zzso from the zzso of the Antarctic zzso zzso zzso is composed of a single zzso that contains both the zzso center zzso typical of zzso H zzso and the zzso zzso forming the zzso nucleation site, typical of zzso L zzso zzso of the zzso sequence with those available from lower zzso indicates that zzso zzso zzso can be classified as an zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso chain shows zzso identity with a zzso zzso chain of the rainbow trout zzso zzso The structural and functional properties indicate that cold zzso and functional adaptation to low temperatures are achieved without significant modification of the protein zzso In fact, the stability of zzso zzso zzso to zzso induced by acid or temperature closely resembles that of zzso zzso zzso zzso iron is taken up efficiently and the zzso energy of the reaction is zzso zzso a value slightly lower than that measured for the human zzso H zzso zzso zzso
