The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were subjected to local zzso searching against the zzso local zzso of zzso zzso The full length zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso gene with an open reading frame of zzso and zzso 337 zzso acids was zzso The protein molecular weight was zzso The DNA sequence of zzso gene was obtained through zzso amplification with specific zzso of zzso zzso and 3' untranslated zzso The analysis of DNA sequence indicated that zzso gene have 3 zzso and 2 zzso The zzso analysis revealed that zzso acids sequence of zzso gene from zzso zzso shared zzso high similarity with zzso zzso and zzso low zzso with zzso zzso A transgenic zzso harboring zzso zzso zzso was generated under the control of a zzso expressed zzso zzso The results from zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso had significantly higher resistance to zzso zzso and heat zzso The zzso DNA and deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso gene were accepted by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
