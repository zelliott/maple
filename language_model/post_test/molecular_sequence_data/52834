In an attempt to determine the mechanism of human zzso we have searched for zzso and recently reported the molecular cloning of a potent zzso zzso from human zzso zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in various human tumors and tumor cell zzso zzso of zzso in the mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso results in an increase in cell zzso zzso cellular transformation in zzso and promotes tumor formation in nude zzso The zzso gene isolated from the human zzso library consists of five zzso and four zzso and spans over zzso In the studies reported here, we further investigated the possibility of the presence of additional genes zzso to zzso in the human zzso which was first indicated by Southern zzso analysis of the human zzso DNA and zzso mapping of the zzso gene using DNA from zzso hybrid cell lines in zzso zzso and restriction map analysis of the additional zzso clones identified two zzso genes zzso to zzso This finding was confirmed by the zzso location of the second gene to zzso zzso and the third gene to zzso zzso Based on the similarity in zzso we proposed that zzso be renamed zzso and the new genes be named zzso and zzso zzso was found to be zzso identical and zzso zzso identical with zzso at the zzso acid zzso Northern zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analyses of the zzso from various human zzso revealed differential expression of the zzso and zzso genes in normal and tumor zzso suggesting that these genes may be associated with zzso
