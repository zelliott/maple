The synthesis of zzso zzso involves the zzso of an internal zzso zzso as a site for zzso zzso This zzso event is directed by a zzso zzso sequence in the zzso zzso Because zzso also functions as a signal for zzso zzso we have investigated how the rates of zzso termination and zzso incorporation relate to zzso elements in the zzso as well as to zzso factors in the zzso We used zzso from the zzso zzso zzso gene as the basis for this work because of its relatively high efficiency of zzso zzso The last two zzso preceding the zzso were found to exert a far greater influence on zzso incorporation than zzso downstream of zzso The efficiency of zzso incorporation was generally much less than zzso but could be partially enhanced by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The combination of two or three zzso zzso in one reading frame led to a dramatic reduction in the yield of full-length zzso It is therefore unlikely that multiple zzso of zzso are zzso with respect to the mode of action of the zzso complex binding to the zzso zzso These observations are discussed in terms of the mechanism of zzso synthesis and its ability to compete with termination at zzso zzso
