zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso species originally isolated from zzso leaves in zzso zzso zzso zzso is affiliated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and represents a zzso zzso lineage of this zzso zzso To perform a comparative analysis of zzso zzso with other zzso we determined and analyzed its complete zzso DNA zzso The zzso zzso is represented by zzso base pairs long, circular DNA containing 32 % zzso and zzso zzso Its genetic organization is relatively compact and comprises typical genes for 15 zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso 8, and 9; zzso zzso 2, and 3; and zzso 2, 3, 4, zzso 5, and 6) and translation zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso transfer zzso zzso Although the gene content is similar to other zzso the gene orders in the examined species exhibit only a limited zzso reflecting their zzso distances and extensive zzso zzso In addition, a comparative analysis of zzso zzso zzso indicates that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was accompanied by structural zzso of zzso These results provide an insight into the evolution of the genetic code in zzso zzso
