zzso zzso is known to play an essential role in various cellular responses, such as proliferation and zzso and zzso zzso are commonly employed to investigate the mechanism of the zzso signaling zzso In this study, we developed a single chain zzso zzso zzso as a blocker for zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso specifically bound to zzso with high affinity zzso zzso in zzso zzso also bound to zzso in zzso and altered the distribution pattern of zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso where zzso was zzso Moreover, zzso interrupted the zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso to the membrane ruffle and attenuated zzso zzso zzso generation and zzso calcium zzso These results indicate that zzso blocks zzso zzso zzso by causing zzso of zzso into zzso zzso and may therefore be useful in studies of the zzso signaling zzso
