The fetal zzso undergo striking changes in structure before delivery that involve zzso of the zzso zzso To investigate the role of specific zzso in this process, we examined zzso activities in rat zzso visceral zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso fluid between Days zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in zzso on all days, and its activity increased slightly on Day zzso The zzso zzso zzso was not detected on Days zzso but appeared by the morning of Day zzso There was a marked increase in zzso zzso in the zzso on Day 20, preceding the appearance of zzso zzso Western zzso confirmed an increase in zzso protein in zzso on Day zzso zzso and zzso activities were detected in extracts of whole zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fluid, but there were no striking changes in these zzso between Days 18 and zzso However, the zzso regions of the visceral zzso zzso zzso which thin and zzso during labor, did show higher zzso activity on Day 21 than on Days 18 and zzso We suggest that the striking increase in zzso expression in zzso and possibly the zzso region of the visceral zzso zzso zzso approximately 12 h prior to delivery is responsible, in part, for the zzso in the structure of these fetal zzso before zzso
