zzso produced by zzso and zzso zzso coli belongs to the zzso family of adhesive factors, which are under zzso zzso zzso Common features of zzso zzso members of this family include two zzso zzso sites in the upstream regulatory region, and zzso regulators zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso protection of zzso sites was previously shown to be dependent on the zzso regulatory protein zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was required together with zzso to establish the phase variation control, which gave rise to zzso cells that expressed zzso and zzso cells that did not express zzso In zzso cells, the zzso site was zzso and the zzso site was protected from zzso whereas in zzso cells, the inverse situation was zzso Unlike Pap zzso zzso synthesis was dramatically reduced in media containing zzso or zzso zzso prevented the zzso switch, zzso zzso expression in the OFF phase, whereas zzso zzso zzso without obvious effect on the switch frequency of phase zzso In zzso cells, zzso and zzso promoted zzso of zzso and zzso protection of zzso increasing the zzso pattern characteristic of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso prevented the zzso zzso protection of zzso and thus the appearance of zzso zzso In addition, analysis of zzso expression in a zzso background indicated that zzso and zzso also zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso
