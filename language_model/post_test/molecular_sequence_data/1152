An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pair was generated for use in zzso zzso The zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso three positions in the D arm were zzso to generate an internal promoter zzso and the zzso gene was inserted between the zzso and 3' zzso sequences of the zzso gene from zzso to enhance its expression in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso suppression zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso charges only the zzso zzso and no zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso is specifically charged by zzso zzso zzso and not by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was then used to alter the specificity of zzso to uniquely charge zzso The resulting zzso zzso pair allows the efficient and selective incorporation of zzso into zzso proteins in response to the zzso zzso This zzso acid can be used as a zzso probe and also zzso zzso zzso in zzso to generate an efficient protein zzso
