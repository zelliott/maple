zzso zzso zinc fingers are widespread DNA binding motifs in zzso zzso zzso zzso fingers are short protein motifs composed of two or three zzso and one zzso Two zzso and two zzso zzso located in certain positions bind zinc to stabilize the zzso Four other zzso acid zzso localized in specific positions in the zzso region of the zzso participate in DNA binding by interacting with hydrogen donors and zzso exposed in the DNA major zzso The number of zinc fingers in a single protein can vary over a wide range, thus enabling zzso of target DNA zzso Besides DNA zzso zinc fingers can also provide zzso and zzso zzso For the most part, proteins containing the zzso zinc fingers are trans regulators of gene expression that play an important role in cellular processes such as development, zzso and suppression of zzso cell transformation zzso
