In mantle cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso D1 is the hallmark of zzso transformation and results from it's juxtaposition to the zzso heavy chain zzso In addition, zzso deletions or point zzso leading to premature zzso of the zzso D1 3' untranslated region zzso have been reported in a several zzso patients as well as in cell lines isolated from various tumors zzso We demonstrate that the expression of zzso D1 with or without the zzso has different zzso consequences in zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso D1 closely linked to the deletion of its zzso In our study, the loss of the zzso D1 zzso led to a significant zzso of the zzso However, the loss of zzso elements zzso from the zzso D1 zzso results in a significant decrease in zzso D1 protein and zzso reporter zzso In contrast, the levels of zzso D1 protein can be significantly reduced by zzso of the zzso family and the zzso cluster that directly target the zzso D1 zzso Most importantly, these zzso regulated the levels of the zzso zzso D1 protein zzso by an zzso with a full zzso but not with 3' zzso zzso Taken together, our data highlight the regulatory role of the zzso D1 zzso in the expression and zzso of zzso D1 and suggest that in zzso and solid tumors with zzso D1 zzso zzso the loss of zzso target sites, rather than ARE elements contribute to the zzso zzso of the zzso D1 zzso
