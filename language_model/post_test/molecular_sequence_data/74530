zzso zzso is a major zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of SC zzso zzso is used as an zzso marker and 10 types zzso have been zzso so zzso To clarify genetic diversity of SC within a single and among different zzso we determined approximately 1500 zzso sequences of SC gene zzso zzso zzso and central regions zzso half and central regions of zzso zzso for a total of 33 zzso zzso strains zzso two to three strains from individual zzso types zzso zzso and 10 strains which were not determined as previously known SC zzso zzso zzso acid sequence identities of zzso among strains with a single zzso type of II, III, IV, zzso VI and X were extremely high (more than zzso whereas lower identity zzso was observed among different zzso In contrast, within a single zzso type of I, zzso or VIII, sequence divergence was found zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences from the zzso were zzso into two genetic groups with an identity of zzso to each other zzso assigned to zzso zzso and zzso and exhibited less than zzso sequence identities to those of most known zzso zzso All the types zzso and zzso strains were zzso susceptible and belonged to different sequence types from those of zzso types zzso strains reported so far by zzso sequence zzso These findings indicated genetic zzso of SC in zzso types I, zzso and VIII zzso and the presence of two novel SC zzso related to zzso of SC zzso
