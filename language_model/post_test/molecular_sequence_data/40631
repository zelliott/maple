In contrast to zzso zzso zzso which require zzso disruption of the membrane to gain access to attack the cell wall, signal anchor release zzso zzso are zzso by the host zzso system, where they accumulate in an inactive form zzso to the membrane by their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso become activated by various mechanisms upon release from the zzso In its inactive form, the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has an zzso zzso zzso blocked by a zzso zzso zzso involves a zzso bond zzso driven by a zzso in the newly released zzso domain, zzso the zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is also a zzso zzso Although zzso does not have a zzso zzso genetic evidence suggests that it also is activated by a zzso zzso triggered by a zzso in the zzso zzso In this case, the zzso zzso in nascent zzso is formed between zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso the active zzso Thus, zzso and zzso define zzso of zzso zzso that differ in the nature of their zzso zzso and zzso is the first zzso found to be regulated by zzso bond zzso of its active zzso
