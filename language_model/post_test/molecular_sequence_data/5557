To carry out a genetic analysis of the degradation and zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso various zzso zzso zzso with characteristic defects in zzso production were isolated and partially zzso Prior to the isolation of the zzso proteins zzso into culture medium in the presence of zzso were zzso Four zzso A, B, zzso and zzso among other zzso were detected in the culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso All four zzso and a zzso protein zzso lacking zzso activity showed zzso binding zzso Cloning and sequencing analysis of the genes zzso zzso A and B of strain zzso revealed extensive similarities to those of other strains of zzso zzso described zzso zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso was carried out, and zzso which formed altered clearing zones of zzso zzso were zzso The obtained zzso were divided into five classes as zzso zzso with zzso no clearing zones, zzso fuzzy clearing zones, zzso large clearing zones, zzso delayed clearing zones, and zzso small clearing zzso zzso characterization suggested that some of these zzso have defects in zzso zzso a zzso regulating mechanism of zzso gene zzso an essential factor for zzso gene zzso and a structural gene for a particular zzso These zzso could allow researchers to identify the genes involved in the degradation and zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso
