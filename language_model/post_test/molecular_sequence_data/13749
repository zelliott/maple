The rapid and zzso identification of new cellular DNA sequences adjacent to known sequences is difficult to achieve with the currently available zzso Here we describe a novel approach based on the zzso chain reaction zzso using a primer specific to the known sequence and another directed to a human zzso zzso To avoid zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso are constructed with zzso and destroyed by zzso DNA zzso treatment after 10 initial cycles of zzso Only desirable fragments are then further amplified with specific zzso to the known region and to a tag sequence introduced in the zzso zzso Using this zzso we have successfully identified cellular sequences zzso integrated zzso B virus DNA from the human zzso of three zzso zzso The method enables a direct specific amplification without any zzso or zzso zzso steps as required by previous zzso zzso This rapid and straightforward approach will be a powerful tool for the study of viral integration sites, but is also widely zzso to other studies of the human zzso
