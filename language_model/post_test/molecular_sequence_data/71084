zzso have developed multiple mechanisms to coordinate the replication of zzso and genetic zzso zzso encodes the maintenance zzso zzso which is responsible for zzso the DNA zzso pattern and the zzso information that it encodes during zzso zzso sequence analysis and zzso mapping of the zzso region of zzso 1 zzso have indicated the presence of many sequence elements associated with previously characterized origins of DNA zzso This study tests the hypothesis that the zzso region containing these elements is an origin of replication in human zzso First, we demonstrate that a zzso containing this zzso sequence is able to support autonomous replication when zzso into zzso zzso Second, using a gel zzso zzso we show that it contains a site for binding of zzso sequences binding activity, a recently zzso replication zzso Finally, using competitive zzso chain reaction, we show that replication zzso in this region in zzso Based on these lines of evidence, we propose that initiation sites for DNA replication are located between the first zzso and zzso 7 of the human zzso zzso
