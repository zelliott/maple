The zzso of many zzso cells via zzso zzso as well as B and T cell zzso leads to the zzso zzso of zzso and its association with both zzso complexes and with a 145 zzso protein referred to as the zzso containing zzso zzso zzso In a search of putative zzso zzso we have isolated a second zzso domain containing zzso zzso referred to as zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso in human T zzso This was shown at the protein level by Western zzso analysis in transformed T cell lines and in peripheral blood T zzso either zzso or after in zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso protein level was not modulated after zzso of T zzso in contrast to zzso which was increased after long-term zzso zzso was zzso zzso in resting zzso T zzso This was not observed in the transformed T cell zzso T zzso is therefore a model of zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
