zzso and zzso zzso of the major zzso class II zzso gene involves the upstream S element and the zzso X and Y zzso In this report we have addressed the roles of spatial constraints and zzso alignment between the upstream S and X zzso and the X and Y zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso expression in B cell lines zzso has previously shown that the X and Y elements must be zzso Further study reveals that any spacing changes between S and X, regardless of the zzso alignment of these two zzso is not zzso These same restraints are involved in an zzso system, because the response to zzso treatment requires both stereo alignment between the X and Y elements and precise spacing between the S and X zzso Neither zzso nor zzso expression can be restored by correcting the distance and spacing between only the S and Y elements with zzso of zzso These results reveal a common zzso for zzso and zzso expression that may require either direct or indirect protein complex formation among proteins bound to three highly zzso regulatory zzso We have also evaluated the role of the zzso sequence located immediately zzso of the Y element and show that it exerts little effect on zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso
