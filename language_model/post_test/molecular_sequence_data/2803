The evolutionary relationships of epidemic influenza A zzso viruses isolated between 1982 and 1986 have been examined by zzso mapping and partial DNA zzso The zzso mapping studies confirmed our previous report that the evolution of the influenza virus zzso generally results in an average of four to six zzso changes per zzso Between 1982 and 1986, however, two apparent exceptions to this finding zzso zzso zzso zzso (including the zzso and zzso reference zzso that caused influenza outbreaks and zzso from 1983 to 1984 differed by 20 to 30 zzso from viruses isolated during the previous influenza zzso zzso mapping of individual zzso segments and sequencing revealed that all six internal genes of a representative 1983 zzso virus were more closely related to genes of zzso zzso viruses that circulated from 1977 to 1982 than to genes of zzso zzso zzso the 1983 zzso viruses were not zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso that emerged in zzso Asia in the spring of 1986 and caused epidemic activity the following winter also exhibited changes of 20 to 30 zzso from the zzso or zzso zzso viruses that circulated during the previous influenza zzso Fewer zzso changes were observed between the 1986 zzso and zzso viruses isolated before 1983, however, suggesting that the former evolved from viruses that circulated before the 1983 zzso zzso became the zzso zzso epidemic virus zzso This was confirmed by sequencing the zzso domain of the zzso genes of three zzso zzso These studies provide evidence that other genes of influenza A zzso in addition to the zzso zzso may evolve zzso along two or more separate zzso
