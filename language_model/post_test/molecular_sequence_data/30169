The patterns of protein synthesis in rat zzso ranging in age from newborn to 4 months were zzso After incubation of zzso in zzso medium it was possible to identify the de zzso zzso zzso by two-dimensional gel zzso and zzso in combination with zzso mapping and zzso It was found that the relative synthesis of alpha A and beta A3 stays fairly constant in rat zzso of all investigated zzso The relative synthesis of beta B2 and gamma s shows a pronounced increase with age in these zzso zzso A differential decrease can be observed in the relative synthesis of the other six zzso zzso zzso zzso There appears to be a good correlation between the changes in relative synthesis of the various zzso and previously reported zzso in zzso levels, although certain zzso exhibit marked differences in zzso zzso
