zzso skipping that accompanies zzso zzso might be caused by an effect of the zzso on zzso secondary zzso Previous attempts to associate predicted secondary structure of zzso with zzso skipping have been hindered by either a small number of available zzso zzso structures, or weak effects on zzso zzso This report identifies more extensive sets of zzso from the human and zzso zzso gene whose association with zzso skipping is zzso zzso secondary structures of the zzso and zzso zzso surrounding each zzso were predicted by energy zzso and were compared by energy dot zzso A significant association was found between the occurrence of zzso skipping and the disruption of a stem containing the zzso site consensus sequences of zzso 8 of the human zzso zzso However, no change in secondary structure was associated with skipping of zzso 4 of the zzso zzso zzso Using updated energy parameters we found a different structure than that previously reported for zzso 2 of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the previously reported structure, no significant association was found between predicted structural changes and skipping of zzso zzso For all three zzso zzso zzso there was a significantly greater number of zzso zzso among zzso accompanied by zzso skipping than among zzso without zzso zzso For zzso 8, zzso substitution was also associated with structural changes in the stem containing the zzso site consensus zzso For zzso 51 of the human zzso zzso structural differences from wild type were predicted for all four zzso accompanied by zzso skipping that were not were predicted for a single zzso without zzso zzso Our results suggest that both primary and secondary zzso structure contribute to definition of zzso zzso which may involve zzso zzso zzso
