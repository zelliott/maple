zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso disease leading to lack of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene are a very rare cause of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso zzso that affects the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was identified in a zzso zzso in nine zzso subjects from four unrelated families, giving evidence for a putative zzso zzso Interestingly, all the zzso patients carry this zzso in zzso that zzso contrasts with the zzso inheritance associated with frame shift and zzso zzso zzso after exclusion of a second genetic event, a comprehensive functional characterization of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso Using different cellular models, we clearly demonstrate a dramatic reduction of the zzso zzso capacity to bind zzso to activate zzso zzso and to trigger zzso zzso zzso and zzso calcium zzso In addition it is less able than wild type to induce zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Finally, the absence of a negative dominance in zzso offers a unique opportunity to discuss the complex in zzso zzso of this form of zzso
