zzso in zzso disease of zzso or zzso origin with zzso at zzso band zzso frequently result in zzso of the zzso zzso gene 6 zzso As a consequence either the zzso zzso domain or the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso is fused to different partner zzso We show here that a zzso in a case of early zzso acute zzso leukemia and a zzso in zzso chronic zzso leukemia in transformation involve the zzso gene at zzso and the zzso gene at zzso In each case different fusion zzso were found, with only one resulting in an open reading frame for a zzso protein consisting of the zzso zzso domain of zzso and the protein zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso The cloning of the complete human zzso coding and zzso sequences and of the zzso junction fragments of the zzso allowed a characterization of the different zzso events leading to the various zzso zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso which could explain its involvement in zzso of different zzso zzso Besides hop in zzso no member of the zzso family has yet been implicated in zzso
