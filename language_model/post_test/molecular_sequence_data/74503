zzso the functional response of bacteria to their natural environment is one of the current challenges in zzso Over the past decades several techniques have been developed to study gene expression in complex natural zzso Most of these methods, however, are laborious, and validation of results under in zzso conditions is zzso Here we report the improvement of the zzso in zzso expression technology zzso by the zzso of two additional reporter zzso The first one is an zzso gene zzso which zzso the rapid identification of in zzso zzso Second, the bacterial zzso genes zzso are zzso coupled to the zzso zzso which allows rapid validation and characterization of in zzso zzso The system is implemented and validated in the industrially important zzso acid zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate the zzso of the advanced zzso system by the identification and validation of zzso promoter elements that are induced in minimal medium compared to the commonly used rich laboratory medium zzso zzso screening led to the identification of 19 promoters that predominantly control expression of genes involved in zzso acid and zzso metabolism and in transport zzso Furthermore, the zzso allows high-resolution zzso analysis and enabled the identification of complex medium constituents and specific molecules involved in promoter zzso Rapid target validation exemplifies the zzso potential of the extended zzso zzso The system can be applied to other bacterial species, provided that the reporter genes used are functional in the zzso of zzso
