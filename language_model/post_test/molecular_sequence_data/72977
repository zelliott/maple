The processing of the zzso precursor protein zzso was investigated in cells zzso expressing different zzso hybrid zzso The zzso domain of zzso was either deleted or replaced by the corresponding domain of the membrane protein zzso zzso or zzso The zzso domain of zzso in the zzso zzso did not alter the zzso of beta A4 when compared with the zzso zzso however, zzso associated with the cell surface and the zzso processing of zzso were zzso With the zzso molecules carrying the zzso targeting signals of zzso or zzso a decrease in the zzso of beta A4 was zzso Cell surface association and zzso processing were also zzso This suggests increased degradation of zzso and thus efficient targeting to the zzso zzso zzso expressing the Swedish zzso zzso generated zzso beta A4 that accumulated after treatment with zzso This effect was more dramatic with zzso zzso carrying zzso targeting signals than with full-length zzso Our data suggest the existence of an zzso site of beta A4 generation from where beta A4 is zzso rather than zzso
