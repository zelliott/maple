In zzso zzso zzso required for nitrate zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso induction of zzso zzso expression is determined by a zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso gene product responds to nitrate or zzso and overcomes zzso termination at the zzso zzso site located in the zzso upstream leader zzso Previous studies led to the hypothesis that the zzso protein mediates zzso zzso through interaction with zzso leader zzso Here, we report a DNA sequence comparison that reveals zzso zzso and zzso zzso secondary structures in the zzso leader zzso from two zzso zzso Additionally, we found that specific binding of the zzso protein to zzso leader zzso was zzso by nitrate and zzso We combined zzso analysis, in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso mobility shift zzso to define regions in the zzso leader that are essential for zzso and for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso stem structure and the specific sequence of the zzso zzso loop were required for both nitrate induction and for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region that abolished nitrate induction also zzso with zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso or additions in the zzso region between the zzso and zzso zzso were deleterious to zzso zzso induction but not to zzso zzso zzso We zzso that zzso protein recognizes the zzso zzso structure in the zzso leader zzso to mediate zzso zzso in response to nitrate or zzso
