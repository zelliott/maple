Late zzso abundant zzso proteins are associated with zzso tolerance in zzso zzso The larvae of an African zzso zzso zzso are able to withstand almost complete zzso during which they enter a state of suspended zzso Here, we developed an zzso database from zzso larvae and isolated three zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso with highly significant matches to Group 3 zzso zzso Both zzso and protein levels of all three examples were increased by zzso stress imposed by either zzso or zzso and one zzso zzso is likely to be zzso processed into smaller zzso This first description of zzso protein genes in zzso suggests that this protein family is widespread throughout zzso zzso and that animals, plants, and zzso possess similar mechanisms for combating zzso zzso
