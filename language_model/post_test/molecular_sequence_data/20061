zzso wood is mainly composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso genes for cellulose and zzso have been studied zzso little is known about the genes involved in the zzso of zzso during wood zzso Here, we report the molecular characterization of two zzso zzso and zzso which zzso putative zzso in the hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso exhibit 89 and zzso similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, both of which have been shown to be required for zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes were found to be expressed in cells undergoing secondary wall zzso including the primary zzso secondary zzso and zzso fibers in zzso and the secondary zzso in zzso Both zzso and zzso are predicted to be type II membrane proteins and shown to be targeted to zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso was able to rescue the defects in plant size and secondary wall thickness and partially restore the zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso and zzso are zzso secondary zzso zzso and zzso is a functional zzso of zzso involved in zzso zzso during wood zzso
