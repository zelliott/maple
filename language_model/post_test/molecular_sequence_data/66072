zzso of zzso techniques for zzso purposes have focused on increasing the reliability of this zzso Here we report the development of a zzso method where a zzso was spotted with zzso zzso especially designed to zzso the zzso specificity of complementary DNA zzso This accurate method was used to screen for four common zzso zzso involved in a neurological disorder called zzso disease zzso Healthy zzso and patients' DNA were amplified and labeled by zzso and zzso on zzso The spot signal zzso were 81 to zzso times greater for perfect compared with mismatched target zzso differing by only one zzso zzso zzso for healthy individual zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso DNA samples gave rise to signal intensity ratios close to 1, as zzso The zzso obtained by this method were perfectly consistent with those determined by direct zzso zzso zzso rates were very low, resulting in further zzso zzso In this study, we also demonstrated the feasibility of real-time zzso detection of labeled synthetic zzso with zzso as low as zzso zzso
