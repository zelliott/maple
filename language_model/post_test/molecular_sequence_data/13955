zzso 10 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from African horse sickness virus zzso 4 zzso was cloned and zzso The sequence of the coding region showed a total length of zzso zzso zzso comparisons showed a zzso sequence similarity between zzso 4 and 9, and zzso between zzso 4 and zzso zzso clones containing the coding region were cloned in the zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso gene product was zzso at very high level as an zzso fusion zzso The zzso protein was used in a differential zzso to distinguish horses that were infected with zzso or vaccinated with zzso virus from those vaccinated with a zzso zzso zzso The results obtained indicate that zzso zzso can indeed differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals zzso that this zzso could be developed as a diagnostic zzso and it would allow the mobility of vaccinated zzso Thus, economical losses associated with this disease could be zzso
