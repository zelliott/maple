zzso responses to zzso zzso are modulated by zzso of surface membrane neutral zzso zzso such as zzso zzso Because zzso recycling is presumably required for a sustained cellular response, the effect of zzso on zzso zzso was zzso After zzso of surface zzso receptors by zzso zzso blocked the normal zzso of surface receptors in a manner that was related to the time of prior exposure to zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso at a rate comparable to the rate of zzso zzso at the cell surface, suggesting that zzso zzso is rate zzso To test this hypothesis, cells were incubated with zzso zzso at 15 degrees zzso After binding was complete, but before zzso of zzso complexes, zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments were added and the cells incubated at 37 degrees C for 60 zzso in the presence of zzso Under these conditions, the zzso effects of zzso were largely reversed and zzso zzso fragments were without zzso
