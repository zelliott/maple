The results of zzso analysis of linear and zzso peptides from the zzso sequence of zzso D of zzso zzso virus are zzso The zzso peptides were zzso by zzso and on zzso zzso was applied for preparation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infrared zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso were used to determine of the solution structure of both linear and zzso zzso The results indicated that the zzso containing the core of the zzso zzso as a part of the cycle have more stable zzso structure than the linear peptides or the zzso zzso where the core motif is not a part of the zzso zzso study of zzso confirm presence of a type I zzso structure which includes the zzso zzso zzso
