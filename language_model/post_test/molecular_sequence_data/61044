In the present report, we describe the cloning of a human zzso zzso that describes the full-length zzso zzso zzso 2 coding zzso The human zzso zzso zzso encodes for a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a zzso overall identity to both rabbit and rat zzso zzso In comparison with zzso recently reported as the human zzso the zzso zzso is 115 zzso acids longer in the zzso end and shows only an zzso DNA zzso sequence zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso message has an uneven tissue distribution, with high levels in the skeletal muscle, zzso and kidney and lower levels in the zzso zzso zzso and small zzso zzso expression studies with zzso clone showed that a zzso protein was zzso zzso expression of zzso full-length zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited zzso pH recovery after an acid zzso that was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that this zzso is the true human zzso zzso and that the zzso protein is capable of catalyzing zzso exchange zzso
