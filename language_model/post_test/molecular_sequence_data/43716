The partition zzso is a zzso tool for comparative analysis of zzso sequences following zzso It is particularly useful for investigating the divergent zzso of sequence regions undergoing zzso zzso A partition zzso is generated by determining the consistency of the zzso zzso sites in a set of aligned sequences with the zzso partitions zzso from the zzso Since the linear order of sites is zzso the zzso can be used to assess whether the distribution of sites either supporting or conflicting with particular partitions changes along the length of the zzso The usefulness of the zzso in allowing visual identification of differences in evolutionary history among regions depends on the order in which partitions are zzso several suitable ordering schemes are zzso We demonstrate the use of the partition zzso in interpreting the evolution of the zzso boundary region on the sex zzso of zzso zzso Its routine use should help to avoid attempts to derive single zzso from sequences whose evolution has been zzso and to identify the gene conversion or zzso events underlying the zzso The method is relatively zzso It is zzso and it can form the basis for more formal analysis, which we zzso
