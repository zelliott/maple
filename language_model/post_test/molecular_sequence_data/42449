Strong zzso dependency of zzso zzso zzso clones was observed in the recognition of cells bearing closely related zzso zzso The single zzso acid exchange in the zzso sheet of zzso completely abolished the responses of all zzso whereas an zzso acid exchange in the alpha 2 zzso of the newest zzso member zzso only altered zzso of one zzso zzso demonstrating the differential impact of these positions on zzso binding to zzso zzso In contrast to T cells, a zzso zzso recognizing the zzso specificity in a zzso manner bound to the zzso zzso irrespective of their sequence zzso However, quantitative binding differences were detected with cells bearing the same zzso zzso This is most likely due to variations in the amount of zzso that associates with zzso and forms the zzso seen by this zzso These results reveal how naturally occurring single zzso acid zzso have led to generation of functionally distinct molecules of another zzso zzso class I zzso
