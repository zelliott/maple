zzso and zzso nuclear pores display significant zzso similarity by electron zzso but sequence similarity between the respective proteins has been more difficult to zzso zzso we have identified a zzso zzso zzso in both human and zzso that has proved to be an zzso related zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to human zzso detects corresponding proteins in human, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the nuclear basket and at or near the nuclear entry to the gated channel of the zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso cell extracts indicates that a small fraction of zzso physically interacts with the zzso zzso just as zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso However, a large fraction of zzso zzso is extracted from pores and is also present in zzso egg extracts in complex with a newly discovered zzso zzso Mass zzso sequencing of the human zzso protein reveals that this protein is zzso by an open reading frame, zzso present in the human zzso The putative human zzso of 205 zzso has related sequence zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The analyze the role of the zzso complex in the zzso zzso were assembled that lack the zzso complex after zzso of a zzso nuclear zzso zzso The zzso zzso are clearly defective for correct nuclear pore zzso From these experiments, we conclude that the zzso and zzso pore have significant zzso in their functionally important zzso and that, with the identification of zzso and the zzso zzso we have extended the knowledge of the zzso interactions of this core in both zzso and zzso
