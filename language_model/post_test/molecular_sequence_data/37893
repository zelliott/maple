The Berg River zzso zzso zzso is a critically endangered endemic zzso from South zzso We investigated zzso DNA control region variation among specimens representative of five populations drawn from two adjacent river zzso zzso zzso a minimum spanning network, and an analysis of molecular zzso underscore the pronounced genetic separation of zzso originating from the geographically closely allied zzso and Berg Rivers, two populations that may have remained isolated since the zzso Despite a lack of geographic structuring within the Berg River, historic female gene flow among the upper and zzso parts of the river appears to be limited and the contemporary populations are probably isolated due to deterioration of the mainstream of the zzso Our results suggest that the Berg and zzso populations should be managed as distinct conservation zzso We encourage the use of zzso particularly by private zzso within both river systems, as this approach may contribute effectively to preserving genetic diversity within the zzso
