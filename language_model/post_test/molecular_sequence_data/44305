zzso zzso sequences of partial zzso zzso gene were used to zzso zzso relationships among zzso zzso by using maximum zzso and likelihood zzso zzso analyses support zzso and zzso belonging to different zzso There was more sequence divergence in zzso species than in zzso zzso These results are zzso with the zzso based on zzso life cycle, and zzso zzso zzso of all trees within zzso of the length of the most zzso trees and zzso analyses support most relationships among zzso species but the relationships among zzso species were not zzso We suggest that the partial zzso zzso gene sequences may be too zzso for zzso zzso among zzso species, but are well suited for zzso zzso within and among closely related families and zzso of zzso zzso and for zzso zzso relationships among zzso zzso
