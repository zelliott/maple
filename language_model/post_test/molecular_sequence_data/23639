The zzso surface zzso zzso of zzso zzso comprises repeats flanked by zzso zzso defining the zzso families zzso and zzso Here, we examined sequence diversity at the zzso locus in Brazil and its impact on zzso zzso recognition by local zzso Only 25 unique partial sequences of zzso were found in 61 zzso zzso The finding of identical zzso sequences in unrelated zzso collected zzso years apart, suggests that no major directional selection is exerted by zzso immunity in this zzso zzso To examine zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from locally prevalent and foreign zzso zzso were used in zzso Foreign zzso zzso such as zzso zzso tested for human zzso were less frequently recognized than zzso and local zzso zzso zzso zzso between local and foreign zzso zzso but zzso structurally different local zzso zzso The use of evolutionary models of zzso is suggested to design vaccines that minimize differences between local zzso and vaccine zzso
