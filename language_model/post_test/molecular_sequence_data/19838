zzso expression patterns were analyzed in a rat model of zzso zzso to detect changes reflecting biological mechanism or potential therapeutic zzso The rat resistant zzso model of zzso was zzso with a focus on the earliest zzso zzso visible in the liver, the zzso zzso zzso zzso differences were shown by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso and image zzso zzso masses were measured by zzso mass zzso using zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and their sequences were obtained by tandem mass zzso zzso in expression of zzso and functional proteins were demonstrated, consistent with biological changes known to occur in the zzso zzso Of particular interest was the differential expression of a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso with a role implicated in zzso zzso implicated in the zzso of zzso is present in normal liver but has greatly reduced expression at the zzso stage of liver cancer zzso zzso zzso with zzso to this zzso zzso supports the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso to the blood vessel marker von zzso factor provides evidence for zzso in the liver containing multiple zzso zzso These observations suggest that at an early stage of liver zzso reduction or loss of zzso zzso may contribute to initiation of zzso A number of other identified proteins known to be associated with zzso are also present at zzso zzso
