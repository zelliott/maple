The three SAT zzso zzso endemic in Africa, are well known for their difficulty to adapt to cell zzso The viral mechanism involved in zzso disease virus zzso tissue zzso and zzso is not well zzso A zzso small zzso virus zzso derived from a tissue zzso zzso virus zzso revealed four zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso compared to the zzso isolate collected from infected zzso zzso One substitution added a positively charged zzso zzso to the short zzso loop of zzso Furthermore, zzso displayed a high affinity for zzso cells possibly via interaction with zzso charged zzso zzso while zzso zzso strain relied strongly on zzso zzso receptors for cell zzso The cell culture adaptation and small plaque zzso of zzso was accompanied by differences in particle zzso and significant differences in acid zzso Based on limited cross zzso data, the zzso features seem to be zzso Thus, acquisition of positively charged zzso in the zzso may be beneficial for adaptation of SAT type field strains to cell zzso
