zzso of the zzso C virus zzso is a highly zzso protein involved in resistance against zzso and required most likely for replication of the viral zzso zzso of this protein is zzso by a cellular zzso generating multiple proteins with different zzso zzso In the case of the zzso zzso isolate zzso in addition to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso form zzso was found on zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kimura, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a comparative analysis of two full-length zzso of zzso zzso competent or defective for zzso zzso we investigated the requirements for this zzso zzso We found that zzso occurs when zzso is expressed as part of a continuous zzso zzso but not when it is expressed on its own or trans zzso with one or several other viral zzso zzso obtained with zzso of both zzso show that single zzso acid zzso within zzso that do not affect zzso zzso can enhance or reduce zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso in the central or zzso zzso domain as well as small deletions in zzso can also reduce or block zzso without affecting zzso zzso These requirements most likely reflect the formation of a highly ordered zzso zzso complex responsible for the differential zzso of zzso and probably also for zzso of its biological zzso
