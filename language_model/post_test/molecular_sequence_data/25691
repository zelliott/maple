zzso of the zzso zzso zzso locus is controlled by the zzso gene product, which zzso zzso structural gene zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso and activates it in the presence of zzso In zzso DNA zzso of the zzso regulatory region zzso shows that, with or without the zzso zzso zzso strongly protects four zzso zzso in a zzso region located between the zzso and zzso zzso of the structural gene promoter zzso Prior to induction by zzso zzso zzso is also bound at zzso occupancy of the zzso promoter by zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate that induction by zzso results in zzso promoter DNA melting in the zzso region of zzso and in additional DNA structural zzso within the region of zzso zzso Thus, zzso fosters the binding of zzso zzso to an inactive promoter, and upon zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso suitable for efficient formation of the active zzso zzso
