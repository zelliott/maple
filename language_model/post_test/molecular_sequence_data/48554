Low density zzso zzso zzso was shown to mediate clearance of blood zzso factor VIII zzso from the zzso To zzso the mechanism of interaction of zzso and zzso our objective was to identify the region of the zzso necessary for binding zzso Using surface zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso and its cluster of zzso repeats zzso bind zzso in the same zzso This indicated that the zzso site for zzso is located within the zzso zzso Similar results were obtained for another zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso a common zzso of receptors from the zzso zzso We further generated a set of zzso fragments of the zzso cluster and assessed their structural integrity by binding to zzso and by circular zzso A number of fragments overlapping zzso of the cluster were positive for binding zzso and zzso The specificity of these interactions was tested by zzso zzso of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso For zzso the specificity was also tested using a zzso variable zzso zzso directed against the zzso light chain as a zzso Both cases resulted in decreased zzso thus confirming its zzso The zzso study also showed an importance of the zzso zzso in zzso for both zzso and the competitive binding results showed an involvement of the light chain of zzso in its interaction with zzso In conclusion, the region of zzso of zzso was defined as the binding site for zzso and zzso
