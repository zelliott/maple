zzso X syndrome zzso is characterized at the molecular level by an expansion of a naturally occurring zzso repeat in the promoter and zzso region zzso of the fragile X mental zzso zzso gene on human zzso zzso When expanded, this region is usually zzso zzso of the zzso promoter and absence of the zzso protein are the likely cause of the zzso By using the zzso protocol of the zzso sequencing method, we have determined the zzso patterns in this region on single zzso of healthy individuals and of selected zzso carriers and zzso zzso In control experiments with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso this protocol has been zzso to reliably detect all zzso or zzso as zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of the DNA from zzso patients reveal considerable zzso in the lengths of the zzso repeats and in the levels of zzso in the repeat and the zzso In one patient zzso with high repeat length zzso ( zzso zzso 15 to zzso shorter repeats zzso zzso zzso were zzso or zzso longer repeats ( zzso zzso zzso were often completely zzso but one repeat with zzso zzso 160 proved to be completely zzso This type of zzso zzso was observed in several zzso zzso In healthy zzso zzso zzso sequences were found in some repeats and zzso as expected for the sequences from one of the X zzso The natural zzso promoter is zzso sensitive, as demonstrated by the loss of activity in zzso experiments using the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter fused to the zzso gene as an activity zzso
