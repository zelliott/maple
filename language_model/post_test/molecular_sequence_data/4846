A nuclear DNA zzso zzso zzso from yellow zzso zzso zzso was zzso and shown to contain zzso zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso organized in three zzso repeated zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and one, truncated from its 3' end, of zzso zzso Each unit contains an identical pair of a zzso gene and a zzso both having the same zzso The zzso sequence of the gene appears zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso primary zzso All three genes are efficiently transcribed in zzso nuclear extract giving two primary zzso The zzso longer primary transcripts have each an extremely long 3' trailer of about 100 zzso the structure of which is specific only for zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso of the studied tandem (but not for other zzso genes of the yellow zzso zzso as it has been shown by Southern zzso This distinctive feature allowed to isolate putative zzso zzso zzso by at least one of the three zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso
