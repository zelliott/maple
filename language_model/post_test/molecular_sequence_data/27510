Alternative zzso zzso adjusts the zzso output of the zzso by generating related zzso from a single primary transcript, thereby expanding protein zzso A fundamental unanswered question is how zzso factors achieve specificity in the selection of target zzso despite the recognition of zzso sequence zzso The zzso zzso regulator plays a key role in the brain zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, the sequence motifs zzso by this factor for specific target zzso selection and its role in zzso zzso are not zzso Here, we use chemical modification zzso to map the contact sites of zzso to zzso motifs closely positioned at the boundaries of the branch sites of the zzso zzso and we demonstrate a zzso role for this specific arrangement of motifs for the regulation of zzso zzso General support for a branch zzso model is indicated by the identification of a group of novel target zzso with a similar zzso of motifs that are silenced by zzso These results reveal an zzso role for zzso as indicated by its direct interaction with functionally significant zzso motifs surrounding the branch sites upstream of zzso 6 of the zzso transcript zzso The zzso model explains how zzso can effectively embrace the branch site region to achieve the specificity needed for the selection of zzso targets and the zzso of alternative zzso zzso
