Two new zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso fungus zzso zzso using zzso chain reaction based on zzso acid sequences from the zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso and is located on the same zzso zzso that contains the genes of zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso with low activity against zzso and no activity against zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were constructed by targeted gene zzso zzso with multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also constructed by sequential disruption and by zzso Total zzso zzso activity in culture zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was reduced by approximately zzso Total zzso activity was reduced by 10, 54, and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The quadruple zzso showed only a modest decrease in growth on zzso or zzso zzso None of the zzso showed any decrease in zzso
