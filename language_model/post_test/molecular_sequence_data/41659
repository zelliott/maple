We have developed a novel zzso zzso prepared from the assembly of zzso quantum dot zzso and gold zzso zzso in which zzso was zzso with a specifically designed zzso zzso zzso zzso which was allowed to bind to the zzso zzso modified zzso zzso This zzso binding of the zzso with zzso zzso via zzso zzso interaction resulted in highly efficient zzso of zzso zzso through a zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso The zzso zzso assembly recovered the zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso after incubation in zzso The high zzso efficiency of zzso and robust zzso zzso signal recovery upon zzso zzso zzso enabled us to zzso zzso activity in living cells, which further allowed us to generate the half zzso zzso concentration zzso values for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso utilizing a high zzso system zzso These results suggest the potential application of zzso assembly toward the zzso drug screening system as a robust and efficient probe to identify active molecules in zzso diseases such as Alzheimer's zzso
