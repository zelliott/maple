The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso reduce zzso zzso with opposite zzso Modeling of zzso and zzso showed that zzso zzso acids previously correlated with production of alternative alcohol zzso lie in the active zzso zzso zzso zzso at these positions showed an altered zzso outcome in reduction of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain exclusively gave the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso while the double zzso zzso zzso gave only the zzso zzso zzso a switch of the alcohol zzso zzso of the zzso domain, in contrast, greatly increased the proportion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These data confirm the role of key zzso in zzso and suggest an additional way to make rational zzso in zzso zzso zzso
