The structure of sexual contact networks plays a key role in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections, and their reconstruction from interview data has provided valuable insights into the spread of zzso For zzso the long period of zzso has made the interpretation of contact networks more difficult, and major discrepancies have been observed between the contact network and the transmission network revealed by viral zzso The high rate of zzso evolution in principle allows for detailed reconstruction of links between virus from different individuals, but often sampling has been too sparse to describe the structure of the transmission zzso The aim of this study was to analyze a zzso sample of an zzso population using recently developed techniques in zzso to zzso the short-term dynamics of the epidemic among men who have sex with men zzso 

zzso of the zzso and reverse zzso coding regions from zzso patients, predominantly zzso from London were zzso 402 of these showed a close match to at least one other zzso B zzso Nine large clusters were identified on the basis of genetic distance; all were confirmed by zzso zzso Carlo zzso chain zzso zzso zzso Overall, zzso of individuals with a close match with one sequence are linked to 10 or more zzso zzso zzso of the clusters using a relaxed clock indicated that zzso of the transmissions within clusters took place between 1995 and 2000, and zzso occurred within 6 zzso after zzso The likelihood that not all members of the clusters have been identified renders the latter observation zzso 

Reconstruction of the zzso transmission network using a dated zzso approach has revealed the zzso epidemic among zzso in London to have been zzso with evidence of multiple clusters of transmissions dating to the late 1990s, a period when zzso prevalence is known to have doubled in this zzso The quantitative description of the transmission dynamics among zzso will be important for zzso of zzso models and in designing intervention zzso
