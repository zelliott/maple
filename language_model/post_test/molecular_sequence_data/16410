Heat shock zzso factor zzso and zzso are members of the heat shock factor zzso protein family involved in heat shock protein zzso gene regulation, a regulation that is critical for the ability of cells to survive exposure to stress zzso Although the role of zzso in binding and zzso zzso of zzso gene promoters in response to cell stress is well established, how zzso enhances zzso zzso expression is not zzso To gain an insight into the critical zzso features of the regulation and function of zzso we have identified and characterized the zzso protein from zzso zzso We found that, similar to its human counterpart, zzso zzso is zzso at zzso 82 and that, as it does in human zzso the modification event of the small zzso modifier 1 functions to increase the zzso zzso activity of this zzso factor in zzso These results indicate that zzso is an zzso zzso modification of zzso zzso supporting the position of this modification as a critical regulator of zzso zzso
