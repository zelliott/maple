In most zzso tissue typing techniques the zzso amplification is followed by a zzso specificity zzso In typing by zzso amplification with zzso zzso zzso typing specificity is part of the amplification step, which makes the technique almost as fast as zzso tissue zzso In the present study zzso were designed for DR zzso typing by zzso zzso identifying zzso corresponding to the zzso defined series zzso This resolution was achieved by performing 19 zzso reactions per individual, 17 for assigning zzso and 2 for the zzso and zzso zzso Thirty cell lines and 121 individuals were typed by the DR zzso zzso technique, zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso The zzso between zzso typing and zzso analysis was zzso The zzso was zzso in 40 samples typed on two separate zzso No zzso or zzso typing results were zzso All zzso and zzso combinations of zzso could be zzso zzso patterns zzso according to dominant zzso zzso DNA preparation, zzso amplification and zzso processing, including gel zzso documentation and zzso were performed in 2 zzso In conclusion, zzso is an accurate typing technique with high sensitivity, specificity and zzso The method is rapid and zzso DR zzso typing by the zzso technique is zzso suited for analyzing small numbers of samples simultaneously and is an alternative to zzso DR typing in routine clinical practice including zzso matching in zzso zzso
