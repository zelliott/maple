zzso chronic zzso diseases are associated with failures in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Such failures invariably result from defects in selective zzso and zzso in surface zzso zzso Recently, we described an zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso with diffuse zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso characterized by increased blood zzso zzso zzso and urinary zzso leads to zzso before zzso usually within the first 6 months or year of zzso Here, we demonstrate that the first four zzso of zzso zzso which encodes a member of the zzso family of tight junction zzso were deleted in zzso zzso zzso was expressed zzso in zzso of normal zzso but transcripts were totally absent in affected zzso This observation suggests that the lack of zzso protein contributes to the dysfunction of zzso zzso transport zzso
