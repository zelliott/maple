The crystal structure of zzso 1, a potent zzso inhibitor from green zzso snake zzso has been solved by the multiple zzso replacement method zzso with anomalous scattering and subsequently refined at zzso zzso The overall structure of zzso is similar to those of the short zzso and zzso with a dense core rich in zzso bridges and three long zzso disposed as the central fingers of a zzso A comparison of these three zzso toxin types shows that zzso 1 has structural features that are intermediate between those of the other two zzso Its core region, which can be defined as a continuous stretch of zzso zzso is very similar to that of zzso zzso whereas the orientation of its long zzso resembles that of zzso zzso This result introduces a new element in the study of zzso relationships of snake toxins and suggests that, after zzso from an ancestral zzso zzso evolution may have played an important factor in the evolution of these zzso In zzso 1, several zzso and zzso zzso are well ordered and relatively exposed to the zzso medium and may play a role in the binding to the peripheral site of zzso
