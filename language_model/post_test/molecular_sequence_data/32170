zzso zzso which is a zzso yellow zzso containing a zzso zzso is one of the secondary zzso under the control of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso production is also induced by zzso zzso The whole zzso gene cluster for zzso was cloned and zzso The gene cluster consisting of 13 genes contained six zzso units, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso During zzso in a zzso zzso the six promoters were activated in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso which encodes a zzso family zzso regulator, abolished the zzso zzso of all other genes in the zzso In addition, zzso expression of zzso from a zzso active promoter resulted in zzso overproduction even in the absence of zzso a key zzso zzso in the zzso regulatory zzso and in the presence of zzso at a high zzso zzso zzso bound direct repeat sequences in the zzso and zzso promoters in a cooperative zzso zzso the early active genes zzso and zzso all of which, except for zzso (which encodes a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso were directly activated by zzso The zzso of zzso was greatly reduced in the presence of zzso at a high concentration and was hardly detected in the absence of zzso These findings showed that both zzso and zzso depletion signals were required for zzso zzso and both signals were transmitted to the zzso zzso genes solely via the zzso zzso
