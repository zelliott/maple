The zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso is maintained as an zzso zzso by a zzso motif at the N zzso Based on resistance to zzso and expression as a discrete domain in zzso coli, this motif is defined as zzso zzso This motif is zzso zzso and zzso zzso The two zzso zzso zzso bonds between zzso and zzso in zzso are extremely resistant to reduction even in 8 M zzso indicating that they are well zzso from the reducing environment of the zzso The zzso bonds were present in zzso zzso as well as when the zzso domain alone was expressed in zzso coli, emphasizing the unusual stability of this motif and the zzso zzso Although 100 zzso zzso was sufficient to reduce the zzso bonds, it did not abolish zzso In addition, a stable zzso also still formed when zzso was replaced with zzso confirming zzso the original zzso alignment of the zzso zzso Thus, both in zzso and in zzso zzso bonds are not required for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain indicated a high content of a zzso zzso Based on the CD data, zzso resistance of the fragment, location of the zzso bonds, and zzso zzso predictions, potential models are zzso A new alignment of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso fundamental similarities as well as significant differences among these three zzso
