A zzso zzso system was developed that allows for the construction of hybrid zzso with partially overlapping zzso employing the effects of zzso zzso to zzso expression of cloned zzso in zzso zzso In this zzso system zzso zzso the coding region of a foreign gene is attached to the zzso zzso situated on the zzso to form the hybrid zzso transcribed from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The cloned gene is the zzso zzso of this hybrid zzso zzso The efficiently translated zzso hybrid zzso is zzso to the zzso The coding region of this artificial fused zzso zzso length of the corresponding open reading frame is about 120 zzso acids zzso includes the zzso the zzso portions of zzso zzso zzso protein (20 zzso the zzso protein of zzso coli zzso zzso and 3' zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso gene zzso At the zzso of the zzso fused zzso there is a region for efficient translation zzso a zzso sequence of the zzso coli zzso gene and the overlapping stop and start zzso zzso In this zzso the last G is the first zzso of the unique zzso site zzso decreases zzso and so integration of the structural part of the foreign gene into the zzso zzso may be performed using zzso DNA linking after the treatment of zzso with zzso and zzso coli DNA zzso I or its zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
