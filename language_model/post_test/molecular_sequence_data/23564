The zzso zzso zzso is extremely resistant to high levels of zzso agents, including gamma rays and ultraviolet light that can lead to zzso DNA zzso Surprisingly, the zzso does not appear to have a zzso zzso an zzso that is critical for zzso break repair in many other zzso The zzso zzso zzso does zzso a protein whose closest characterized zzso are zzso zzso of zzso zzso in other zzso We have zzso this novel zzso zzso zzso protein and characterized its zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein is a DNA zzso that zzso short (20 base zzso DNA duplexes with either a zzso tail or a zzso end, but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso are good unwinding zzso and are bound zzso while DNA with shorter tails zzso zzso are poor unwinding zzso and are bound much less zzso The zzso protein is much less efficient at unwinding slightly longer zzso zzso or 76 base pairs, with 12 zzso zzso zzso of the longer zzso is zzso somewhat zzso by the zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso These results show that the zzso zzso zzso protein is a DNA zzso with zzso polarity and low zzso
