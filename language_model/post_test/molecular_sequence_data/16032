The utility of zzso zzso in the identification of the primary structures of zzso zzso is zzso Unlike zzso zzso where the chemical shifts reflect multiple zzso and long-range effects, the chemical shifts of zzso zzso are dependent largely upon short-range effects classified as zzso zzso and substitution zzso These effects are zzso for zzso composed of zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of this program to zzso sets of experimental chemical shifts for the zzso of zzso zzso gave the following zzso zzso This program can be used to produce a zzso of possible structures inclusive of the zzso zzso zzso For other than simple zzso it is unlikely that a single structure is consistent with the data for zzso zzso alone, even when the linkage composition of the zzso has been assessed from other spectral zzso zzso When used in conjunction with other chemical techniques, this program can provide a powerful tool for primary analysis of the structure of zzso zzso
