The zzso zzso are an emerging family of genes that have zzso in their zzso halves a zzso domain zzso to the zzso acute phase protein zzso zzso protein and serum zzso P zzso and acquired novel zzso zzso In this report, a zzso zzso of zzso zzso from the human zzso zzso gene zzso is characterized as a promoter on tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso exposure in zzso zzso human zzso by zzso zzso and zzso protection zzso In the same cells, the zzso promoter does not respond to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso responsiveness is not seen in the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The minimal promoter contains one zzso element which is shown to be necessary for induction and able to bind zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso in this site lose the ability to bind zzso proteins and to respond to zzso and zzso in functional zzso zzso and zzso binding sites lying in proximity to the zzso site do not seem to play a major role for zzso zzso Finally, zzso experiments with expression zzso validate that the natural promoter contains a functional zzso zzso
