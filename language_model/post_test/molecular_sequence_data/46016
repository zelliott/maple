The major zzso complex zzso is an extremely dynamic region of the zzso characterized by high zzso and frequent gene zzso and zzso This has resulted in considerable differences in zzso organization and evolution among zzso zzso particularly between birds and zzso As zzso zzso are ancestral to both zzso and birds, they occupy an important zzso position for understanding these zzso However, little is known about zzso zzso zzso To address this, we have characterized zzso class I sequences from the zzso zzso zzso the last zzso of an ancient order of zzso zzso We isolated two different class I zzso zzso which share zzso sequence similarity with each other but are highly divergent from other zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso and zzso chain reaction amplification of class I sequences from seven adult zzso plus a family group indicate that these sequences represent at least two to three zzso zzso analysis of variation among individuals from an island population of zzso indicates that these zzso are highly zzso zzso likelihood analysis of zzso zzso class I sequences indicates that gene zzso has occurred within zzso zzso However, the evolutionary relationships among sequences from different zzso orders cannot be zzso reflecting the zzso of the major zzso zzso
