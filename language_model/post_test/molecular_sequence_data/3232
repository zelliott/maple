zzso zzso codes for a zzso zzso interacting protein zzso that interacts with both the zzso domain and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso via two separate zzso The zzso of zzso by Tip is considered as a key event in the transformation of human zzso during zzso zzso We investigated the interaction of zzso Tip peptides with the zzso domain starting with the structural characterization of the zzso interaction zzso The solution structure of the zzso was determined by zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso using 44 residual zzso zzso in addition to the conventional experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso proved that the zzso zzso of Tip is already formed prior to zzso binding and is zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments point out three major regions of the zzso interaction zzso the zzso loop, the zzso loop, and a zzso turn preceding the last strand of the zzso Further changes of the chemical shifts were observed for the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso domain, indicating additional contacts outside the zzso segment or subtle structural zzso transmitted from the binding site of the zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso shows that Tip binds to the zzso zzso of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibiting the highest affinities for zzso zzso and zzso
