zzso zzso zzso channels play important roles in the respiratory burst, in pH regulation, in zzso in zzso and in cancer zzso Unlike other zzso zzso channels, the zzso channel lacks a centrally located pore formed by the assembly of zzso Instead, the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso channel is within the zzso domain of each zzso The gating mechanism of this zzso is still zzso zzso and zzso studies suggest that the fourth zzso zzso segment zzso functions as a zzso sensor and that there is an outward movement of zzso during channel zzso Using zzso zzso cycle analysis, we find that the zzso positively charged zzso in zzso are stabilized by zzso in the other TM segments both in the closed and open zzso We constructed models of both the closed and open states of zzso channels that are consistent with the zzso cycle zzso These structural models suggest that zzso interactions between TM segments in the closed state pull zzso zzso together to form a zzso plug in the center of the zzso zzso zzso zzso movement during channel zzso zzso zzso changes that remove this zzso plug and instead insert zzso zzso in the center of the channel that, together with water zzso can form a hydrogen bond chain across the channel for zzso zzso This suggests that salt bridge networks and the zzso plug function as the gate in zzso channels and that outward movement of zzso leads to the opening of this zzso
