In order to design synthetic peptides with potent zzso activity but low zzso activity under zzso conditions, several zzso of the previously reported zzso A zzso zzso hybrid zzso zzso were zzso These zzso were designed by analysis of the zzso wheel zzso of zzso zzso activities were measured by growth zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso with human red blood cells, zzso zzso of zzso for zzso at position 18 and 19 of zzso caused a dramatic reduction in zzso zzso Two analogue peptides zzso I and zzso showed more potent zzso and lower zzso activity than the original zzso To study the zzso mechanism of these zzso zzso activated flow zzso and zzso laser scanning zzso were performed with the most powerful zzso analogue I zzso designed in the present zzso As determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso cells treated with analogue I or zzso showed higher zzso intensity than those treated with the weak zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso the analogue I was detected in the zzso region as well as the in cell zzso These facts suggested that the zzso function of this novel zzso analogue acts by pore formation in the cell zzso
