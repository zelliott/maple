A consortium of the newly isolated bacterial strains zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso acid for growth under zzso zzso zzso zzso converted zzso acid into zzso acid and used the zzso side chain for growth, with some formation of zzso as a dead-end side zzso In the presence of strain zzso complete zzso of zzso acid and release of zzso were zzso zzso of zzso acid by strain zzso occurred through a zzso mechanism and started with the formation of zzso A zzso as indicated by the presence of zzso zzso zzso for further transformation were detected in cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid by strain zzso proceeded via zzso which was converted by an zzso zzso
