zzso impulses in animals play essential roles in zzso an array of zzso functions including movement, zzso environmental sensing and zzso zzso many of these electrical signals is a fast zzso action potential that has been fully zzso only in cells associated with the zzso systems of zzso zzso Such rapid action zzso are thought to have evolved with the first zzso with zzso being the earliest zzso The present study demonstrates that a zzso zzso the marine zzso zzso zzso can also generate a fast zzso based action potential that has remarkably similar zzso and pharmacological properties to zzso and zzso cardiac and skeletal muscle zzso 

The zzso zzso and pharmacological properties of the rapid zzso action potential were examined using single zzso current and zzso clamp zzso Overall, the characteristics of the fast zzso currents most closely resemble those of zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso 

This is the first demonstration of zzso zzso channels and the capacity to generate fast zzso action zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso and pharmacological characteristics together with the presence of a zzso activated zzso channel zzso in the recently zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso provides direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that this rapid zzso mechanism arose in ancestral zzso zzso and has been retained in at least two zzso distant lineages of zzso zzso and the zzso The functional role of the fast zzso action potential in zzso remains to be zzso but is likely involved in rapid environmental sensing of these widespread and successful marine zzso
