zzso zzso aberrations and/or losses of zzso involving the short arm of zzso 3 in zzso of the zzso kidney and other zzso imply that multiple putative tumor zzso genes may be present on this zzso zzso To search for one of these zzso we determined DNA sequences in the zzso region at zzso where we had previously detected a zzso deletion in a lung cancer cell zzso The DNA sequence results of an about zzso region indicated that the size of the zzso deleted segment was zzso zzso in which we identified only four genes including the zzso alpha zzso and the zzso zzso zzso both reported zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of one of the two novel genes showed high zzso to zzso a human zzso zzso those of the other zzso termed zzso revealed significant zzso to zzso a hypothetical protein predicted from DNA sequences of zzso zzso The computer programs zzso or zzso were able to predict three-fourths of the zzso the smallest zzso predicted by either program was 46 base zzso zzso sequences contained in the zzso region included 151 copies of the zzso sequence (1 zzso zzso zzso 19 copies of the zzso sequence (1 zzso 36 zzso and 10 copies of the THE zzso
