To date six zzso binding proteins zzso have been zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence reveals that the zzso are clearly distinct but are sharing regions with strong zzso zzso the zzso zzso rich zzso region and to a lesser extend the zzso part are zzso The alignment of the zzso molecules is strongly zzso across the 6 zzso The middle one-third region, where no zzso are present (except for zzso is most zzso zzso and zzso are zzso whereas zzso and zzso contain an zzso sequence near the zzso zzso zzso of the number of zzso groups of zzso and zzso has revealed that most likely all zzso zzso are involved in zzso bond zzso All members of the zzso family bind zzso and zzso with about equal zzso Studies involving deletion zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso have suggested that the three-dimensional structure of the protein plays an important role in zzso zzso However at present it is unclear whether the zzso share one or more specific zzso binding zzso The zzso function of the zzso is to allocate zzso in the various body fluid compartments and zzso and to zzso zzso binding to zzso For this purpose there exists a very sophisticated control of the zzso of circulating zzso both from and to the zzso There is mounting evidence that the structure of the zzso proteins plays a key role in the regulation of zzso zzso by modulating its molecular size, zzso membrane zzso target tissue zzso cell membrane adherence and zzso zzso
