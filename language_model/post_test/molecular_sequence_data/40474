zzso exerts its zzso effect by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso at a specific zzso domain location is essential for high zzso sensitivity in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso sensitivity can be zzso on an zzso zzso by introducing a zzso at this zzso Furthermore, comparison of zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso receptors reveals that the presence of a zzso reliably predicts zzso zzso By providing a means of identifying zzso zzso this finding should help in zzso zzso mechanisms and identifying new zzso zzso
