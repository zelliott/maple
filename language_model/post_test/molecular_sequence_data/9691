The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso regulates zzso complexity during asexual reproduction by zzso the core zzso program that directs differentiation of zzso terminally differentiated spores from zzso zzso zzso zzso is also required for zzso and zzso development during sexual zzso zzso is a member of a family of zzso zzso factors that regulate development or cell cycle zzso Further, zzso characterizes a zzso possessing the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate for the first time that the zzso domain is a zzso zzso domain that can be modeled as a basic zzso zzso zzso We have found that zzso response elements zzso are located upstream of both critical zzso regulatory genes and cell cycle genes in zzso zzso is shown to act as a zzso zzso in zzso but as a weak zzso in budding zzso Our data suggest that the differentiation of zzso zzso cells during zzso zzso development requires correct zzso expression of both zzso and cell cycle genes in zzso The budding pattern of zzso may involve processes related to those controlling zzso growth in budding zzso
