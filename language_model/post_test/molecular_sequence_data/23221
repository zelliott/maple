A zzso zzso would be an effective tool for the detection of circulating zzso in the serum of patients with zzso but the traditional way of producing zzso zzso is not zzso The objective of this study was to find a new method for the large-scale production of zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso display zzso library for zzso was zzso To obtain a zzso variable zzso zzso zzso against zzso the library was screened with zzso zzso from adult zzso worms zzso using zzso zzso zzso The soluble zzso selected were used to detect zzso zzso in the serum of acute and chronic zzso zzso 

Six positive clones with good zzso to zzso were obtained from the zzso display zzso library of about zzso zzso zzso individual zzso Only two of these six clones bound specifically to zzso and were chosen for further zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso were produced by inducing the 2 clones with zzso The characteristics of the zzso were then zzso The results of Western zzso showed that these zzso could bind to zzso specifically and had a molecular weight of about 31 zzso When testing serum from zzso patients with one of the two specific zzso its sensitivity was found to be zzso and 37% in acute and chronic patients, respectively, with a specificity of zzso When the two specific zzso were combined, their sensitivity was found to be zzso and 57% in acute and chronic patients, respectively, with a specificity of zzso 

The results indicate that the zzso are potentially useful for the diagnosis of zzso The library construction also provides a useful tool for the further screening of other zzso for both diagnostic and zzso applications and for zzso analysis and vaccine zzso
