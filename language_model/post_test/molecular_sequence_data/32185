During the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso small nuclear zzso zzso zzso at specific sites are converted to zzso by zzso zzso particles zzso Each zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso and four common zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso contains at least one zzso zzso pocket, which is complementary to the sequences zzso the target zzso In this article, we show structural evidence that the zzso pocket can form the predicted base pairs with zzso zzso in the absence of protein zzso We report the solution structure of the complex between an zzso hairpin derived from the 3' zzso pocket of human zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex has a unique structure with two offset parallel pairs of stacked zzso and two unusual zzso three-way zzso which together organize the zzso for zzso into the active site of zzso The zzso zzso interacts on one face of the zzso in the complex, forming a structure that easily could be zzso in the zzso zzso and explains how successive zzso zzso could be loaded onto and unloaded from the zzso zzso in the zzso
