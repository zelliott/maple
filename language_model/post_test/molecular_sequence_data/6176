A zzso that encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso was cloned from human kidney with the use of the zzso chain zzso The predicted zzso protein consists of zzso zzso acids and shares zzso and zzso overall identity with the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso and rat kidney zzso zzso zzso respectively, with least similarity in the zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped by zzso in zzso zzso to zzso zzso at which region the gene responsible for familial zzso zzso has previously been localized by genetic linkage zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso in human zzso but not in brain, zzso liver, heart, skeletal muscle, or zzso
