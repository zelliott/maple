The zzso Desert contains one of the largest sets of inland saline lakes in Europe zzso a threatened landscape of great scientific and ecological value with large number of reported zzso We analyzed bacteria, zzso and microbial zzso from 11 saline lakes in winter and spring by zzso gene zzso and sequencing covering large zzso zzso and temperature ranges zzso zzso The highest ecological diversity zzso zzso was found in zzso and the lowest in zzso zzso showed higher ecological diversity at intermediate zzso whereas zzso and zzso did zzso The genetic diversity was broad and with remarkable zzso The highest novelty was found in zzso at the lowest saline zzso whereas for bacteria and zzso no differences were observed along the zzso zzso of the enigmatic group zzso and zzso zzso related to well-known zzso were present in several zzso zzso presence of bacterial zzso zzso related to zzso and zzso initially isolated from polar marine zzso was zzso zzso lakes contained zzso among other new groups, substantially different from green algae previously reported in marine or zzso The great scientific and ecological value found for zzso can be extended to the idiosyncratic zzso inhabiting such unique habitat in zzso
