The zzso family is a growing group of type I zzso proteins within the zzso zzso zzso They zzso to zzso complexes between zzso and zzso cells and seem to participate in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Here, we report the identification of a new member of the zzso zzso This zzso which was designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso membrane zzso is composed of zzso zzso acids including an zzso part containing a zzso and a zzso domain, a zzso region and a zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in a variety of both human and mouse zzso and cell zzso The protein migrated with an Mr of around 48 on zzso and was predominantly expressed in zzso cells within different zzso In cultured zzso cells, zzso was detected in areas of zzso zzso When zzso expressed in polarized zzso cells, zzso was restricted to the zzso area of the lateral cell surface, where it zzso with the tight junction markers zzso and zzso Also zzso zzso showed association with tight zzso as analyzed in polarized human zzso zzso This suggested a role for zzso in zzso zzso and indeed, zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cells showed significantly increased zzso resistance, indicating a role for zzso in zzso barrier zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso and a new component of zzso tight zzso We also suggest, based on zzso studies, that zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a new group of proteins within the zzso zzso
