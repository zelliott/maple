A novel gene was trapped in mouse embryonic stem cells with a zzso gene trap zzso zzso transcripts were isolated from the zzso by rapid amplification of zzso ends, which were used for full-length zzso zzso The protein predicted from the zzso consisting of zzso zzso comprises zzso zzso zzso which was confirmed by in zzso zzso zzso An zzso against the zzso zzso reacted with an approximate zzso protein on zzso A search of available databases revealed that this protein is a novel protein composed of 17 zzso repeats hooked to a zinc finger zzso which we named zzso zzso was observed on the zzso membrane on zzso microscopic zzso zzso belongs to a new zzso of double zinc finger proteins which may be involved in zzso or protein zzso zzso zzso and its protein were expressed zzso from embryonic day zzso to zzso
