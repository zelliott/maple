The zzso zzso zzso has been shown to bind and zzso a large number of protein zzso with biological importance such as the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso We recently identified zzso a new member of the zzso gene family, expressed in zzso zzso might contribute to the regulation of zzso through its zzso activity towards zzso of the zzso family, notably zzso The expression of zzso in zzso as well as its ability to zzso zzso was zzso 

In human zzso zzso is mainly expressed within the zzso layer of the zzso which gathers the most differentiated zzso as shown by zzso and zzso using two different zzso By using various experimental approaches, we show that the zzso binding domain of zzso zzso is specifically zzso into the zzso cell line zzso and zzso with zzso upon zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso binds zzso at the cell zzso zzso of zzso a universal inhibitor of zzso binding to zzso prevents zzso binding at the cell surface as well as zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso expression with specific zzso strongly reduces zzso zzso 

zzso of the upper differentiated layers of zzso express zzso as well as zzso Our study also reveals that zzso is a new zzso for zzso Our findings are consistent with zzso by zzso of complexes formed between zzso and zzso zzso may thus control zzso by regulating the zzso of zzso zzso
