zzso function is dictated by protein zzso For the protein zzso industry, therefore, it is important to have zzso tools that can detect changes in protein zzso zzso accurately, and with high zzso In this paper we show that zzso exchange mass zzso zzso can play an important role in fulfilling this need within the zzso zzso was used to assess both global and local zzso behavior of a zzso zzso zzso zzso a major class of zzso Analysis of exchange into the intact, zzso zzso (and the zzso and zzso regions zzso showed that the zzso was zzso highly stable, and highly amenable to analysis by this method using less than a zzso of zzso With improved zzso methods, zzso identification zzso and zzso steps, the analysis of zzso levels in zzso peptides produced after labeling was accomplished in 1-2 zzso On the basis of zzso zzso data, exchange was localized to specific regions of the zzso Changes to zzso zzso as a result of zzso were determined by comparing exchange into the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso Two regions of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to have altered exchange properties upon zzso These results are consistent with previous findings concerning the role of zzso in the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso Moreover, the data clearly illustrate how zzso can provide important characterization information on the higher order structure of zzso and zzso changes that these molecules may experience upon zzso
