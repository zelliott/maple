By expression cloning using zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso as a recipient cell line, we have isolated a zzso termed zzso zzso a novel protein required for the formation of zzso zzso zzso The zzso encodes a protein with zzso spanning zzso with a zzso zzso zzso It consists of zzso zzso acids and has a molecular mass of zzso zzso Although both zzso and zzso were barely zzso in recipient cells or cells zzso with the zzso alone, their amount increased significantly in zzso containing zzso When zzso cells prepared by treatment with zzso O were incubated with zzso increased incorporation of zzso was found in those cells zzso with zzso when compared with the mock zzso Northern zzso analysis showed two major transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso in all zzso zzso zzso study with an zzso specific to the zzso protein suggested that it is most probably expressed in the zzso zzso zzso Based on these results, the protein zzso by zzso is suggested to be an zzso zzso that is involved in the process of zzso
