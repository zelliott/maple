zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of bacterial leaf zzso one of the most serious diseases in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso race 6 zzso strains are unable to establish infection in rice lines expressing the resistance gene zzso Although the zzso zzso that triggers the zzso defense response zzso is unknown, six zzso zzso for zzso zzso genes zzso proteins involved in sulfur metabolism and Type I zzso were recently zzso Here, we report on the identification of two additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso which zzso a response regulator and a zzso protein zzso of zzso regulatory systems, zzso zzso zzso of zzso strain zzso that are impaired in either zzso zzso or both cause zzso significantly longer and grow to significantly higher levels than does the zzso strain in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso are zzso to zzso levels of zzso activity by introduction of expression zzso carrying zzso and zzso zzso These zzso zzso do not affect zzso and zzso activities, as observed in zzso experiments with zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso analyses confirmed zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso studies also suggest that the previously identified zzso zzso is a target for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso system provides new opportunities for understanding the specificity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction and may contribute to the identification of zzso
