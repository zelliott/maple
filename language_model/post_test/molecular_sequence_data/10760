zzso is a zzso present in wild rice zzso zzso in an extraordinary number of copies, and only a portion of the zzso sequence has been determined zzso Here, we isolated and zzso DNA segments of various portions of zzso revealing that the sequences of zzso and the internal region were zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The internal region shows zzso with the pol region in zzso a zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a zzso zzso The internal region of zzso contained an open reading frame coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso like zzso and zzso related to zzso A clone screened from a library of the zzso zzso zzso DNA contained solo zzso which was flanked by direct repeats of a zzso zzso This suggests that zzso generates a zzso of the target sequence of 5 zzso upon zzso We observed that many zzso members were zzso by another zzso zzso This indicates that these zzso members have received another zzso to make an extraordinary number of copies in the zzso zzso zzso without giving a deleterious effect on the growth of rice zzso
