A protein which promotes DNA strand transfer between linear zzso zzso DNA and zzso viral zzso DNA has been isolated from zzso zzso The protein is DNA zzso zzso Strand transfer activity zzso in the small zzso zzso the zzso zzso and can be detected using a zzso protein zzso the first 324 zzso acids zzso by zzso Either the zzso zzso zzso or intact DNA zzso I can catalyze joint zzso formation, in reactions requiring only zzso and zzso DNA zzso Both kinds of reactions are unaffected by added zzso zzso zzso shows that the joint molecules formed in these reactions bear displaced single strands and therefore this reaction is not simply promoted by zzso of zzso zzso The pairing reaction is also polar and zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso extending the zzso joint in a zzso direction relative to the displaced zzso Thus strand transfer occurs with the same polarity as zzso zzso These results show that zzso like many zzso possesses a protein which can promote zzso zzso reactions and raises questions concerning the possible biological role of this zzso
