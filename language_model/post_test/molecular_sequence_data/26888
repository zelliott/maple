Second zzso zzso from zzso stores plays a key role in a multitude of zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that trigger zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a cellular zzso that mediates zzso from zzso zzso While zzso zzso has been found in many zzso and cell types, the molecular identity of the zzso zzso this release remained elusive so zzso Here, we show that zzso a novel member of the zzso zzso channel family, displays the basic properties of native zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts are widely expressed in the body and zzso a zzso protein forming zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso after zzso with zzso zzso of zzso while it is zzso by zzso zzso of this second zzso and is insensitive to the zzso analog zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso is almost completely abolished when the capacity of zzso for storing zzso is zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso is unaffected by zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, these findings indicate that zzso is a major component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
