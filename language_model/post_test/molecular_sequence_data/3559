An zzso zzso protocol for parallel synthesis of up to 96 zzso zzso acids zzso or zzso zzso using zzso strategy has been developed using a robotic zzso The approach is illustrated by zzso zzso and zzso libraries varying between 15 and 27 zzso acid zzso The peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were attached to zzso of the zzso The method was found to be far superior to that based on the zzso protocol by which zzso zzso are zzso on a modified cellulose zzso On a zzso zzso scale the method typically yielded 2 zzso product of zzso purity by zzso zzso This approach is suitable for screening of a large number of zzso and/or zzso sequences for zzso and biological zzso
