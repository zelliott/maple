zzso structure and zzso analyses support the hypothesis that three groups of organisms originated from the primary zzso zzso between a zzso and a zzso zzso green plants zzso algae + land zzso red algae and zzso (for example, zzso Although zzso based on several zzso genes support a specific green zzso algae relationship, the zzso analysis of zzso genes yields inconclusive, sometimes contradictory zzso To address this problem, we have zzso an alternative nuclear marker, zzso factor 2, and included new red algae and zzso zzso Here we provide significant support for a sisterhood of green plants and red zzso This sisterhood is also significantly supported by a zzso analysis of a fusion of 13 nuclear markers zzso zzso zzso In addition, the analysis of an alternative fusion of 6 nuclear markers zzso zzso zzso indicates that zzso may be the closest relatives to the green zzso algae zzso Thus, our study provides evidence from nuclear markers for a single primary zzso at the origin of these groups, and supports a kingdom zzso zzso green plants, red algae and zzso
