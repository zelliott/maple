The recently identified zzso gene zzso consists of the zzso zzso gene located downstream from the alpha zzso zzso and several other members including at least one zzso processed zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso genes of the rabbit and zzso the structure of these genes in the orangutan and zzso and their zzso regions show no apparent defects that would prevent their zzso Both zzso zzso genes are split into three zzso with the potential to code for a zzso of length 141 zzso zzso Besides differing by zzso in zzso zzso the zzso 1 and alpha zzso genes of the orangutan and zzso also differ in their promoter structures, in the use of zzso versus zzso as the termination zzso and in the use of zzso versus zzso as the zzso zzso In contrast, the two zzso zzso genes from primates only differ by zzso in the zzso zzso Here we present the complete DNA sequence of a cloned zzso zzso gene of humans, and show that it contains no apparent defects that would abolish its zzso Furthermore, by primer extension of zzso zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso gene of humans is transcribed in an zzso cell line zzso Three zzso zzso species were zzso with zzso mapping to approximately 70 base pairs zzso downstream from a zzso promoter zzso at 8 zzso downstream from a zzso promoter sequence and at 40 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of the zzso cells slightly enhances the level of the longest zzso zzso Our results provide strong evidence that the zzso zzso gene of humans is zzso active in cells of zzso origin, and suggests the presence of a functional zzso zzso in specific cells, possibly those of early zzso zzso
