zzso zzso has been studied in the zzso zzso zzso by cloning and sequence analysis of zzso from its three subspecies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso of extremely high extent was shown for the zzso gene by the 248 segregation sites among coding region sequences of its zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso showed variable theoretical zzso zzso which might constitute molecular basis for their zzso zzso Positive selection was zzso by the zzso ratios larger than 1 in partial zzso lineages which was subsequently confirmed by likelihood simulation under neutral or selection zzso Furthermore, the correspondent sites to these selected zzso were collectively located at two planes in the zzso structure of rabbit zzso which suggested that the rapid evolution of zzso zzso zzso might correlate to its adaptation to variable environmental elements such as oxygen zzso The minimal 26 zzso events were detected among coding sequences of zzso zzso zzso with partial mosaic sequences and zzso identified by identity scanning and information site zzso zzso analyses revealed multiple antique zzso lineages of zzso which was estimated to diverge zzso to zzso zzso All these features strongly suggested the role of balancing selection in long persistence of high zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso to its particular evolutionary backgrounds, the silver zzso carp might possess a distinctive balancing selection zzso
