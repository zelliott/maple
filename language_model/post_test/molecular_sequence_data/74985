Of 17 zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso rat zzso 2 contained zzso in zzso In one of these tumors the observed zzso was not due to the zzso of an intact zzso zzso The rearranged zzso DNA zzso from this zzso was cloned and examined by restriction zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso DNA zzso and DNA sequence zzso These analyses revealed that the zzso zzso in this tumor was due to the presence of a partially duplicated zzso long terminal repeat zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The orientation of this zzso structure was opposite to the zzso orientation of zzso The sequences at the 3' zzso side of the zzso structure were derived from a cellular DNA region which maps to the same zzso as zzso zzso zzso although to a site distant from this zzso These findings present evidence for a zzso zzso event occurring between sequences of two zzso integrated on the same zzso one of which was inserted near the zzso zzso The zzso product contains three copies of the zzso zzso zzso direct repeat and is associated with a high level of zzso zzso The zzso product of this zzso was not zzso We propose that zzso between zzso sequences may play a significant role in the generation of zzso zzso and therefore in tumor induction and zzso
