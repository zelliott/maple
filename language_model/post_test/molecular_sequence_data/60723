zzso of zzso to zzso C virus zzso is widely used for monitoring the prevalence of zzso infections and to assess zzso zzso Among zzso individuals in the general population, the zzso between the detection of zzso zzso and the development of zzso zzso is usually 5 to 6 weeks, but in rare cases, zzso may be prolonged up to 6 to 9 zzso In this study, we tested for the presence of zzso zzso during the zzso period of 19 zzso zzso zzso to gain insight into the zzso carrier status in this zzso zzso zzso status was determined by testing the first and last serum samples obtained from each subject, using third-generation zzso screening and confirmation zzso zzso samples were tested for zzso zzso to establish the moment of zzso and zzso zzso by single reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso in zzso Plasma and peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were independently collected and tested for zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by Southern zzso zzso and sequencing of serial zzso The 19 zzso zzso had a mean follow-up of 5 years zzso 1 to 8 zzso Of the 19, 4 were human zzso virus zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in serum before zzso in 12 zzso of the 19 zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso In 7 of these 12, the zzso period was relatively short (2 to 10 zzso The other 5, who were all zzso before zzso zzso had intermittent low levels of zzso zzso before zzso for a period of more than 12 months, with a mean of zzso months zzso 13 to 94 zzso In all 5 individuals, independent repeats of the experiments confirmed the presence of zzso zzso in serum, and in 3 of these individuals, zzso was confirmed in independently collected plasma and zzso zzso Low levels of zzso zzso may be present during prolonged zzso periods before zzso in a number of injecting drug zzso Independent of zzso status, their immune system appears to be unable to respond to these low zzso zzso levels and was sometimes only activated after zzso with distinct zzso zzso These results indicate that primary zzso infection may not always elicit the rapid emergence of zzso zzso and suggests that persistent low levels of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso may not elicit at all or delay zzso responses for prolonged periods of zzso
