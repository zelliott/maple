A zzso slightly zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a surface water sample from the eastern Mediterranean zzso zzso analysis based on its zzso zzso gene zzso retrieved from the zzso zzso demonstrated that this isolate is unique, showing zzso % sequence similarity to species of the families zzso and zzso The polar zzso profile of the novel strain consisted of zzso zzso an unknown zzso and zzso Major fatty acids are 16 : zzso iso zzso zzso % relative zzso 18 : zzso zzso zzso 16 : 0 zzso zzso 10 : 0 zzso zzso zzso and 18 : 0 zzso zzso zzso carbon sources are organic acids and zzso zzso The DNA zzso content is zzso zzso Based on a zzso zzso and zzso zzso it is proposed that this marine zzso represents a novel zzso and species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
