The Y zzso gene zzso is one of the key genes involved in human sex zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso factor that plays a key role in sexual differentiation and development in males and is located on the zzso region of the short arm of the Y zzso zzso in zzso gene result in zzso sex reversal and pure zzso zzso zzso expression zzso a network of gene activity that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso in the zzso gene have been considered to account for only zzso of zzso zzso zzso cases, whereas the majority of the remaining cases may have zzso in the zzso regulatory elements or other genes involved in the sex differentiation zzso Patients both with zzso zzso and zzso presence are at high risk of developing zzso Using zzso single strand zzso zzso zzso and automated DNA sequencing, we zzso the zzso in the zzso gene in three zzso sex reversal zzso Two patients demonstrated zzso substitution zzso within the open reading frame just outside and upstream of the zzso zzso motif called the zzso group zzso box, replacing zzso at zzso 57 with zzso zzso zzso patterns were also observed in these zzso zzso examination of zzso in patient 1 revealed the formation of zzso Patient 3 demonstrated zzso substitution which replaces zzso at zzso 143 with zzso just outside but downstream of the zzso zzso zzso suggest the involvement of zzso gene in sex reversal which further supports the relationship between zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or primary zzso
