zzso growth factor 1 zzso mediates the zzso activities of growth zzso How zzso expression is regulated zzso is zzso zzso zzso muscle excess 3 zzso is involved in cell fate zzso during early embryonic development through regulating zzso involved in specifying cell zzso The function of its zzso zzso zzso is zzso Here we show that zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice causes zzso growth zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in growth plates is significantly zzso zzso and bone local production of zzso are both decreased in zzso zzso zzso zzso is strongly expressed in the zzso and the brain, and highly expressed in resting and zzso zzso of the growth zzso zzso is able to enrich multiple zzso species from tissue zzso including zzso zzso expression in bone is decreased at the protein level but not at the zzso level, indicating zzso zzso We propose that zzso protein plays an important role in enhancing the translation of zzso zzso which explains the zzso zzso and growth zzso observed in zzso zzso
