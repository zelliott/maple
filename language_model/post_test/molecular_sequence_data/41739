Prior studies of zzso zzso metabolism in zzso zzso zzso leaf zzso during shoot zzso revealed the presence of an abundant unidentified BA zzso The BA zzso compound C, made up to zzso of the total pool of BA zzso in two zzso lines and was associated with an increased shoot zzso response when compared with a third zzso line that did not produce any compound zzso zzso analysis of compound C utilizing fast atom zzso mass zzso two methods of zzso analysis, ultraviolet zzso zzso and zzso transform infrared zzso identified it as a new zzso zzso zzso Based on our prior biological studies and the similarity of this compound to related zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso may be part of the zzso pool of zzso active in zzso shoot zzso
