zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso alpha constant region zzso and T cell zzso beta constant region zzso were obtained using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso These zzso products were used to screen a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library, resulting in the isolation of clones containing the complete coding regions for zzso and zzso These constitute the first zzso T cell zzso sequences to have been zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso constant region revealed a considerable level of sequence identity with zzso of other species, particularly zzso zzso at both the zzso acid and zzso acid zzso At the zzso level, zzso sequence identity was calculated for the zzso zzso and human zzso zzso with zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso For zzso the zzso zzso and human zzso sequence identity at the zzso level was zzso and at the zzso acid level, zzso zzso analyses based on the zzso zzso sequences indicated that these sequences are zzso to, but also most closely related with, zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso consistent with the current views of both zzso and zzso zzso
