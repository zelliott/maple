The induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso released zzso is a critical, early step in the formation of the zzso zzso zzso a component of the muscle fiber zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso We find that induction of zzso zzso in C2 zzso is specific for zzso neither zzso zzso nor zzso (a zzso zzso are zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso by a zzso that is independent of that used by neural zzso The effects of zzso and zzso are strictly additive and occur with different time zzso Most importantly, zzso zzso zzso does not require zzso a zzso zzso zzso that is part of the zzso complex for zzso zzso does not cause zzso zzso of zzso in C2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso from zzso mice that do not respond to zzso In contrast to zzso zzso also does not induce zzso zzso of the zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso zzso is not required for zzso in zzso zzso thus acts by a mechanism that is independent of that used by zzso and may provide a supplemental zzso for zzso zzso during zzso
