zzso factors are zzso zzso in cell walls of bacteria belonging to zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso They induce zzso formation in the lung and zzso zzso associated with production of zzso zzso We studied how zzso factors induce biological activities in the zzso zzso factors isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso enhanced protein zzso C zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso activated zzso alpha more strongly than zzso beta or gamma under the same zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso in response to zzso zzso revealed that zzso increased the apparent affinity of zzso to zzso in the presence of both zzso and zzso Although this is similar to observations with zzso fatty zzso such as zzso acid, zzso was synergistic with zzso for zzso zzso but zzso acid was zzso zzso was also different as regards zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso A single zzso administration of zzso to mouse induced tumor necrosis zzso zzso in serum and in the zzso which is a unique target tissue of zzso zzso Based on our recent finding that zzso is an zzso tumor promoter, the correlation between lung cancer and pulmonary tuberculosis is zzso
