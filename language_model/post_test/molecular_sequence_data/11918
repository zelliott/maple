To evaluate components of pulmonary zzso and identify zzso in the zzso protein B gene zzso of a term infant with severe respiratory distress and chronic lung zzso zzso AND zzso Respiratory distress developed in an infant delivered at term, and he required zzso bypass support for 2 zzso Until his unexpected death at zzso months, he was zzso and oxygen dependent and required continual zzso zzso zzso zzso samples were analyzed for content of zzso proteins zzso and DNA from blood samples were zzso and analyzed by zzso chain reaction restriction analysis for the presence of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso composition and function, the contents of zzso and their zzso zzso zzso and the zzso pattern for zzso were determined in zzso lung zzso 

The zzso sample contained zzso but not zzso and DNA restriction analysis indicated that the patient and his mother were zzso for the previously described zzso zzso of zzso zzso lung tissue contained normal levels of zzso and its zzso a low but zzso level of zzso and near normal content of zzso zzso zzso was abundant on zzso and some zzso precursor was present in zzso A zzso fraction was deficient in zzso and was not surface zzso On DNA sequencing, a point zzso was found in zzso 7 of the patient's zzso gene zzso without the zzso zzso resulting in a zzso for zzso zzso and the father was a carrier for the same zzso 

We describe a patient who is a compound zzso with a new zzso and only a partial zzso of zzso Some forms of inherited zzso zzso may have low expression of zzso and possibly functional zzso with milder lung disease and longer zzso These infants may benefit from zzso therapy and may not develop zzso to zzso after either lung transplant or gene zzso
