In zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso factors of the zzso family specify the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso play important roles in generating this primary germ zzso zzso is the earliest expressed zzso gene known in zzso zzso and appears to initiate the program of gene expression required for zzso zzso including a cascade of zzso factors required for development and maintenance of the zzso Among zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso regulates aspects of late zzso development, but a role for zzso factors in establishing the zzso is zzso We show here that zzso binds to the zzso target DNA sequence zzso with specificity similar to that of zzso zzso and zzso and that it functions as a zzso zzso We exploited this activity of zzso to demonstrate that establishment of the zzso zzso like that of zzso species, also appears to involve zzso zzso zzso Like the known zzso zzso regulators zzso and zzso zzso is a potent zzso of zzso differentiation in isolated zzso zzso Moreover, a dominant zzso zzso fusion protein abrogates zzso differentiation in intact zzso By examining these effects in conjunction with those of zzso and zzso and dominant zzso zzso we further establish the likely relationships between zzso activity and these regulators in early development of the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso factors may function zzso to regulate zzso differentiation in both zzso and zzso
