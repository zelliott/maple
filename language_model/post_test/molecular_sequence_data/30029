A synthetic rev gene containing zzso which introduced unique restriction sites but did not alter the deduced zzso acid sequence was used as a vehicle to construct zzso in zzso zzso or substitution zzso within a domain of Rev resulted in proteins able to inhibit the function of Rev protein in zzso Rev function was monitored in a cell line, zzso which contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso cells require the presence of rev for virus production, which was zzso monitored by zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso were identified after expression in bacteria and delivery into zzso cells by zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso was verified by expression of the zzso proteins in zzso cells after zzso These studies define a region between zzso acid zzso 81 and 88 of zzso in which different zzso result in proteins capable of zzso Rev zzso
