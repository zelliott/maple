In this study, we have characterized the zzso zzso replication complexes present in cells early after zzso infection, using zzso zzso zzso and zzso Six hours after zzso infection, a zzso zzso replication complex zzso as a large structure zzso This replication complex was zzso by zzso to three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso protein zzso and to cellular zzso but not to the major zzso protein zzso This replication complex was not associated with cell zzso and could not be zzso into smaller discrete zzso using zzso Nuclear extracts from the same zzso infection contained a smaller zzso complex that lacked reverse zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso replication complexes from a zzso virus infection zzso as zzso structures under identical conditions, as previously zzso Our results indicate that, following zzso transmission of zzso all the zzso pol gene products, the zzso protein zzso and cellular zzso are present in zzso replication complexes that are taking part in or have completed reverse zzso Transportation of the zzso replication complex to the nucleus is associated with structural changes, including a reduction in size and altered protein zzso
