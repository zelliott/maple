The zzso zzso zzso promoter from the rat zzso zzso A zzso gene zzso zzso is associated with a zzso negative regulatory element zzso that zzso inherent zzso and zzso promoter zzso The element is of zzso zzso consisting of a zzso sequence with two zzso zzso It zzso the expression of an zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter gene in a zzso zzso and zzso fashion, suggesting that it is a true zzso zzso zzso it selectively zzso zzso element zzso zzso but has no effect on promoters lacking a zzso zzso The zzso action of zzso could be overcome by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso containing either the zzso or zzso zzso This suggests that the reversal of repression was caused by the removal of functional active, limiting zzso factors which associate with zzso as well as with zzso zzso mobility shift, zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of a zzso protein with specific binding activity for zzso Additionally, gel zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso indicate the presence of zzso and zzso or zzso closely related proteins with the zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso functionally interact to achieve negative zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso
