Several members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family demonstrate an unusual ability to zzso zzso as well as the zzso (including those from zzso and zzso zzso Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for such zzso zzso are starting to emerge, the full understanding of these complex zzso is far from zzso In the present paper, we describe six distinct zzso zzso identified through zzso approaches, four of which demonstrate the unprecedented characteristic of activity towards a broad spectrum of zzso including zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using structural analysis and zzso zzso we have identified the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso that determine the unusual zzso specificity of one of these zzso zzso The results may open up new research avenues into comparative zzso models, structural and zzso studies, and zzso applications of zzso zzso
