DNA zzso in zzso coli plays a role in many key cellular zzso including DNA zzso repair, zzso and zzso However, several zzso bacterial strains exist which are deficient in DNA zzso zzso Thus, it has been suggested that zzso produced by the dam zzso zzso zzso gene is required for the viability of zzso coli and that zzso strains still produce low levels of zzso Current experimental methods are not sensitive enough to detect a few potentially essential zzso sites per zzso Here we describe a method for the detection of zzso at specific sites with a sensitivity of one site in more than 10 zzso We show that zzso produced by both the dam and zzso zzso genes is not required for the growth of zzso coli and identify the site of zzso zzso Minor adaptations of the technique should enable the identification of other rare DNA zzso
