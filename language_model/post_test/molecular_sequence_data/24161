When we think of zzso organisms adapted to extreme zzso zzso come to mind zzso However, the zzso red zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that can represent up to zzso of the biomass in extreme zzso such as hot sulfur springs with pH values of zzso and temperatures of up to 56 degrees zzso This red zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso on more than 50 different carbon sources, including a number of rare zzso and sugar zzso This zzso versatility suggests a large repertoire of zzso zzso rivaled by few organisms and a potentially rich source of zzso zzso for zzso The temperatures under which this zzso carries out photosynthesis are at the high end of the range for this process, making zzso zzso a valuable model for physical studies on the zzso zzso In addition, the gene sequences of this living fossil reveal much about the evolution of modern zzso Finally, the zzso zzso high zzso of toxic metal zzso such as cadmium, mercury, aluminum, and nickel, suggesting potential application in zzso To begin to explore the unique biology of zzso zzso , zzso expressed sequence tags from two different zzso libraries have been zzso and zzso zzso emphasis has been placed on the reconstruction of zzso pathways present in this zzso For example, we provide evidence for zzso a complete zzso for zzso A zzso zzso export of zzso from zzso zzso and absence of zzso zzso zzso data and additional information are available at zzso
