zzso zzso zzso are a group of zzso zzso widely distributed in nature, that cleave zzso acid zzso from the zzso components of zzso All of the zzso zzso thus far characterized share an zzso block, repeated three to five times in the primary structure, and an zzso sequence motif that is part of the active zzso Using a sequence zzso approach, we have identified a novel human zzso named zzso mapping to zzso zzso The zzso sequence analysis of the gene has shown that it contains only one zzso of about zzso zzso and the longest open reading frame encodes a protein of 380 zzso zzso with a zzso block consensus, and the zzso zzso In the putative promoter sequence there are a classical zzso box and four E boxes, which are consensus binding sites for zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed expression of the zzso transcript only in skeletal zzso
