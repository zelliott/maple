We have zzso cloned and zzso the mouse zzso zzso zzso The zzso contained zzso bases with one large open reading frame of zzso zzso which is one more than in the corresponding human zzso zzso of the predicted mouse and human zzso proteins revealed the very zzso nature of this zzso with an overall zzso acid identity of more than zzso A dramatic example of this is the presence of 331 zzso zzso predicted in the mouse zzso of which zzso are zzso zzso relative to zzso
