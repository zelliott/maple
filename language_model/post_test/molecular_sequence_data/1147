In bacteria, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are involved in numerous processes including electron transfer, zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulation of gene zzso In humans, zzso diseases such as zzso zzso anemia and zzso are caused by defects in zzso cluster zzso The zzso of zzso clusters involves several zzso and in bacteria, the zzso zzso has been shown to play a vital role in zzso zzso and repair during zzso zzso Although zzso proteins play vital roles in plants, zzso cluster zzso and maintenance and zzso consequences of dysfunctional zzso cluster assembly remains zzso Here we report that zzso plants deficient for the zzso zzso zzso show zzso at the zzso stage of zzso zzso is expressed in developing zzso and in zzso zzso and floral zzso and encodes an zzso zzso that can partially rescue growth defects in an zzso coli zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso zzso contain abnormal developing zzso with zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso can interact with zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and because zzso zzso also harbor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso probably contain a complete zzso zzso Our results imply that zzso represents a zzso zzso protein involved in the zzso and/or repair of zzso damaged zzso clusters and suggest an important role for zzso zzso cluster maintenance and repair during zzso zzso
