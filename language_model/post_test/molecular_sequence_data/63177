zzso belongs to the zzso protein family, which was observed to have high level expression in the entire zzso Although it exists in zzso population, its zzso function is poorly zzso This study shows that zzso is a key factor in the zzso signaling zzso based on an analysis of global gene zzso By using zzso technology to zzso expression of zzso we found distinct zzso changes in neural stem cell line zzso More important, zzso confirmed that zzso zzso of zzso decreased expression of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and slightly increased expression of zzso Further, zzso zzso indicated that zzso of zzso increased the tendency of zzso cells to zzso These data strongly suggest that zzso plays a key role in the differentiation of neural stem zzso
