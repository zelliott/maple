The core embryonic stem cell zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in germ cell tumors zzso and have been proposed to play a regulatory role in zzso However, little is known about the mechanism of regulation of zzso by the complicated network of these zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso factor that is expressed in zzso cells as well as zzso To understand the molecular and functional role of human zzso zzso in germ cells, zzso of the zzso domain zzso of zzso and transient zzso zzso in zzso human embryonic zzso cells were carried out to identify critical zzso zzso We divided the CD into three putative functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso WR zzso and zzso independently contained zzso potential and, in zzso had a synergistic effect on zzso activity, while zzso was zzso zzso The zzso zzso motif in WR zzso and multiple zzso zzso in zzso were required for zzso and synergistic zzso zzso by the zzso zzso The results of the current study contribute to a better understanding of the complicated molecular machinery of stem cell zzso factors and their role in zzso proliferation in germ cell zzso
