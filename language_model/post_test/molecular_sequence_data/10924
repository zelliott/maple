To identify the retinal zzso zzso zzso surface zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso complementary DNA zzso expression library, representing the rat zzso cell line zzso was constructed and screened with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of tissue sections or cultured cells, and Western zzso analyses of tissue and cell zzso extracts served to prove that the protein resulting from expression of the zzso is the zzso zzso 

Three independent zzso were cloned that shared overlapping zzso zzso alignment with zzso database entries revealed identity to the published zzso of zzso a member of the zzso zzso One of the clones zzso the entire open reading frame of zzso The expression pattern of the zzso zzso matched that of zzso which is widely zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with the zzso zzso produced a zzso protein that was recognized by zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso recognizes the zzso gene product, a zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso to results reported earlier, zzso zzso is widely distributed among different rat zzso liver, and zzso In zzso other than the adult zzso it is confined to the zzso plasma zzso Its zzso polarization in the zzso of adult rats supports earlier findings that some proteins that are zzso in other zzso exhibit reversed polarity in the zzso
