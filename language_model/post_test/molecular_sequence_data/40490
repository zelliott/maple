The human zzso gene 1 zzso encodes the zzso zzso of the rapidly zzso delayed zzso zzso zzso Several zzso zzso with different zzso and zzso ends have been zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain the full-length C zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso and zzso lack most of the zzso domain and contain a unique zzso zzso The mechanisms underlying the generation of zzso zzso are not zzso We show that zzso zzso with different zzso ends are generated by alternative zzso and zzso of zzso zzso We identified an zzso weak, zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso 9 of zzso that zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the strong, zzso zzso signal zzso resulted in the zzso production of zzso and a marked decrease in zzso zzso In contrast, eliminating the zzso 9 zzso signal or increasing the strength of zzso zzso site led to the zzso production of zzso and a significant increase in zzso zzso We found significant variation in the relative abundance of zzso zzso zzso in different human zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso regulation of zzso zzso may represent a novel mechanism to zzso the expression and function of zzso zzso
