Although there have been many molecular studies of zzso zzso generated in the laboratory, it is unclear how these are related to zzso in natural zzso where the constraints of natural selection and breeding structure are quite zzso Here we characterize a naturally occurring zzso of zzso zzso originally described more than 250 years ago by zzso in which the fundamental symmetry of the flower is changed from bilateral to zzso We show that the zzso carries a zzso in zzso a zzso of the zzso gene which controls zzso asymmetry in zzso The zzso gene is extensively zzso and zzso silent in the zzso This modification is zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso Occasionally the zzso reverts zzso during zzso development, zzso with zzso of zzso and restoration of gene zzso It is surprising that the first natural zzso zzso to be characterized should trace to zzso given the rarity of this zzso mechanism in the zzso This indicates that zzso zzso may play a more significant role in evolution than has zzso been zzso
