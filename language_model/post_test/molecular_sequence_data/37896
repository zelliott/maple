Members of the death zzso family may play a prominent role in zzso and pathological zzso cell zzso We report the expression of the zzso and zzso death receptors in the adult human and rat central nervous zzso Whereas expression of zzso appears to be high in the human zzso with lower levels in other brain regions, robust expression is observed in many regions of the rat zzso We also analyzed zzso of death zzso expression in an in zzso rat model of acute zzso In contrast to tumor necrosis factor zzso 1, zzso and zzso which all show zzso specifically in zzso zzso of the permanent middle cerebral artery zzso model of zzso zzso shows a rapid global increase in both zzso and zzso zzso In comparison, the recently described death zzso zzso shows no change in this zzso These data indicate that the death receptors show clear differences in patterns of expression in response to zzso zzso zzso 2000 zzso Published by zzso Science zzso
