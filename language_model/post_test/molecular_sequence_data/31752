The zzso hawk zzso Sphinx zzso belongs to the zzso family zzso that has long been studied as a family of model insects in a diverse zzso In this study, we describe the complete zzso zzso zzso sequences of the species in terms of general zzso features and characteristic short repetitive sequences found in the A + zzso zzso The zzso zzso consisted of a typical set of genes (13 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and 22 zzso zzso and one major zzso A + zzso region, with the typical arrangement found in zzso The zzso A + zzso region located between zzso and zzso zzso the zzso sequence blocks that are typically found in zzso zzso Additionally, the A + zzso region of zzso zzso contained three characteristic repeat sequences that are rarely found in zzso two identical zzso zzso three identical zzso tandem zzso and six nearly identical 5-6 zzso long repeat zzso
