Conventional zzso generation usually requires active zzso with zzso immediately prior to the preparation zzso zzso zzso library technology offers the possibility of cloning a range of zzso zzso at a single point in time and then zzso these zzso at zzso Here we show that human zzso zzso zzso fragments against a plethora of infectious agents can be readily derived from a single zzso Further examination of a number of libraries shows that whenever zzso against a pathogen can be detected in the serum of the zzso then specific zzso can be derived from the corresponding zzso We describe the generation of human zzso fragments against zzso zzso virus types 1 and 2, human zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso human zzso virus type 1, and respiratory zzso zzso The zzso are shown to be highly specific and a number are effective in zzso virus in zzso
