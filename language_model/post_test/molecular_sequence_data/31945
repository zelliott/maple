zzso zzso a zzso bacterial zzso known to affect a wide range of domestic as well as wild animal and avian species throughout the world by causing either systemic or localized infections termed as zzso zzso zzso zzso are known to possess type IV zzso zzso as one of the major zzso factors based on their role in zzso to host surfaces and subsequent zzso In the present study, zzso gene of Indian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) originated from different animal zzso zzso zzso zzso and avian host species zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and compared with available zzso protein sequences in zzso zzso zzso zzso to understand its zzso with respect to zzso specific zzso Multiple sequence alignment revealed highly zzso zzso zzso zzso region and zzso zzso zzso zzso comprised of zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso two pairs of zzso zzso Interestingly, an existence of absolute zzso among the zzso zzso zzso that caused zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in sheep and zzso was zzso Pig zzso had zzso zzso On contrary, more diversity zzso was observed among zzso that caused zzso zzso in zzso irrespective of identical zzso zzso and similar host zzso zzso analysis based on zzso sequences of zzso gene revealed formation of mixed clusters with zzso representing different disease conditions as well as zzso irrespective of country of origin which indicated the possible role of zzso transmission among different zzso zzso The study indicated highly zzso and host specific zzso among animal species than relatively divergent zzso among avian zzso
