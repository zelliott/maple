The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined and found to comprise zzso bases with a zzso content of zzso It contained 181 putative genes of 150 zzso or greater that showed minimal zzso zzso of these putative zzso which collectively accounted for zzso of the zzso are zzso of genes previously identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso showed on average zzso zzso acid sequence identity to those from zzso Several genes reported to have major roles in zzso biology including zzso zzso and zzso were not found in the zzso zzso However, open reading frames with zzso to DNA zzso two DNA zzso (one similar to a zzso zzso zzso and the other to a putative zzso zzso and four zzso zzso enhancing zzso were zzso In addition, several zzso are zzso there are 7 genes related to zzso zzso 4 genes related to zzso zzso and a number of repeated genes unique to zzso Eight major repeated sequences zzso zzso that are similar to sequences found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso
