zzso zzso zzso encodes an outer membrane protein that binds to zzso Lewis b blood group zzso We analyzed a panel of 35 zzso zzso strains and identified three possible zzso zzso for zzso There was a significant association between the presence of zzso and the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed two divergent families of signal zzso Among 17 strains in which an intact zzso zzso zzso was identified, 10 expressed a zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso protein and the Lewis zzso zzso were not dependent on the zzso locus of zzso These data indicate that there is marked zzso among zzso zzso strains in zzso genetic content and zzso zzso
