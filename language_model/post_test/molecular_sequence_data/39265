A zzso zzso zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the surface of a marine zzso zzso zzso at Friday Harbor, WA, zzso The DNA zzso content of this strain was zzso zzso The zzso fatty acids were zzso : 0, zzso : 0, zzso : 1, zzso : 0, zzso : 0 zzso 17 : 0 zzso and summed feature 3, zzso zzso : 0 zzso and/or 16 : zzso zzso representing zzso % of the total fatty zzso zzso was the only respiratory zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the closest relatives of zzso were members of the zzso zzso with sequence similarities of zzso zzso zzso zzso differed from its closest relatives by 11 to 18 zzso zzso zzso evidence and zzso characteristics suggest that strain zzso represents a novel species within the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
