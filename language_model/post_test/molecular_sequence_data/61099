zzso and zzso with an zzso group at zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso for zzso zzso of bovine zzso to establish a system where hydrogen bonding interaction between the zzso zzso and zzso can be altered by changing zzso zzso Two zzso zzso showed nearly identical zzso spectral pattern for resolved zzso peripheral zzso and zzso acid zzso signals and similar two-dimensional zzso zzso irrespective of zzso and zzso states, indicating that the zzso electronic structure and the molecular structure of the active site are not affected by a difference in one zzso group at the zzso zzso Chemical exchange rate of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is larger than that of zzso zzso zzso by at least two orders of zzso suggesting a considerable difference in the strength of hydrogen bond between the zzso zzso and zzso due to the differential zzso distance between the two zzso Thus a comparative study between the two proteins provides an ideal system to delineate a relationship between the stabilization of zzso by the hydrogen bond and zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed a faster zzso of zzso zzso from zzso than the zzso by over zzso Similarly, oxygen zzso is faster in the zzso than in the zzso by approximately zzso Association of cyanide zzso to the zzso zzso was accelerated by changing zzso to zzso by a zzso Likewise, oxygen binding was accelerated by approximately zzso by the above zzso The present findings confirm that hydrogen bonding with the zzso zzso is a dominant factor for determining the zzso zzso rate, whereas zzso hindrance exerted by the zzso zzso is a primary zzso for the zzso zzso
