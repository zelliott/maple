zzso glue is used in the zzso therapy of bleeding zzso zzso closure of zzso has been documented for this treatment in comparison with other injection zzso the biological reason, however, remains zzso 

In an in zzso model the effects of zzso glue on the expression and zzso of growth factors by gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso as well as their zzso response and their interaction were compared with those of other zzso 

Native zzso glue does not release vascular zzso growth factor zzso but is able to bind this growth factor in biologically relevant zzso of zzso zzso The addition of zzso glue to a collagen type I zzso led to an increased proliferation rate of gastric wall zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso was significantly increased in zzso zzso zzso of zzso grown on zzso glue containing zzso and zzso cells resulted in an increased zzso of zzso by both cell zzso 

zzso glue leads to increased proliferation of zzso and local zzso of zzso These findings might at least partly explain the accelerated closure of bleeding zzso treated by zzso glue zzso
