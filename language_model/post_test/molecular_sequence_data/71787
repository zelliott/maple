The human nuclear gene zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso repeat within the coding zzso We have investigated the frequency of different zzso zzso in populations of diseased and healthy zzso The zzso zzso of 10 zzso repeats was found at a very similar frequency zzso zzso in both Finnish and ethnically mixed population samples, with zzso close to the equilibrium zzso Other zzso of between 5 and 13 repeat units were zzso but no larger, expanded zzso were zzso A series of 51 British zzso zzso patients showed no significant variation from controls, indicating an absence of zzso zzso repeat zzso Patients with a variety of molecular zzso in zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso inherited point zzso zzso transmitted zzso depletion and zzso dominant multiple deletions showed no differences in zzso zzso zzso distribution from zzso These findings rule out zzso repeat expansion as a common zzso mechanism in disorders zzso by zzso zzso zzso
