African wild dog populations have declined zzso during the last 100 years in eastern zzso The possible causes of this decline include a reduction in prey abundance and zzso zzso and loss of genetic zzso accompanied by zzso zzso We examined the levels of genetic zzso and distinctiveness among populations of African wild dogs using zzso DNA zzso restriction site and sequence analyses and zzso analysis of zzso and dental zzso Our results indicate that the genetic zzso of eastern African wild dog populations is comparable to that of southern Africa and similar to levels of zzso found in other large zzso Southern and eastern populations of wild dogs show about zzso divergence in zzso sequence and form two zzso zzso containing three zzso zzso zzso No zzso are shared between the two zzso With one exception, all wild dogs examined from zzso had southern African zzso zzso analysis supports the distinction of eastern and southern African wild dog zzso and we suggest they should be considered separate zzso An eastern African wild dog breeding program should be initiated to ensure preservation of the eastern African form and to slow the loss of genetic zzso that, while not yet apparent, will inevitably occur if wild populations continue to zzso Finally, we examined the zzso relationships of wild dogs to other zzso zzso through analysis of zzso base pairs zzso of zzso b sequence and showed wild dogs to belong to a zzso distinct lineage of the zzso zzso
