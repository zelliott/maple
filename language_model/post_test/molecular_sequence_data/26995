As part of an zzso zzso an zzso strain zzso was isolated from a sample collected from the base of a translucent zzso rock in Miers Valley, eastern zzso The isolate produced branching zzso zzso that was characteristic of zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of the strain suggested that zzso should be classified as a member of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the strain was closely related to members of the zzso zzso which supports the zzso of this strain within the family zzso zzso and zzso results allowed strain zzso to be differentiated from known zzso zzso zzso data also showed that strain zzso could be differentiated from its nearest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
