We examined partial zzso zzso DNA zzso sequences of zzso zzso cultured in a study of microbial zzso in Hong zzso zzso differences were sufficient to distinguish closely related strains and were used to examine links between strains obtained from zzso scrape zzso contact lenses, lens cases, lens case solutions, and home zzso zzso of patients with zzso We also looked for evidence of mixed zzso Identification of zzso zzso zzso was based on sequences of approximately 113 zzso within the zzso zzso zzso This permitted zzso identification by using zzso zzso Of 13 specimens obtained from zzso zzso contact lenses, lens cases, or lens case solutions, 12 were zzso zzso T4 and the remaining one was zzso zzso zzso The sequences of zzso scrape specimens of two patients also were the same as those obtained from their contact zzso or lens case zzso A possible zzso infection was indicated by three different T4 sequences in cultures from one patient's zzso Although zzso water used by patients to clean their zzso is a possible source of infections, specimens isolated from the zzso at two zzso zzso patients' homes differed from their zzso scrape or lens zzso The overall results demonstrate the potential of this zzso region for tracking zzso zzso strains in infections and for distinguishing zzso and closely related zzso infections even when other zzso might be present with the cultured zzso They also confirm the predominance of zzso zzso T4 strains in zzso zzso zzso
