The present study was aimed to demonstrate zzso diversity of zzso zzso in infected beef zzso grazing within zzso endemic zzso The zzso diversity was identified among different zzso within each zzso and also within single zzso The Israeli strains revealed unique characteristics of zzso repeats and, in addition to the published repeats, six new tandem repeats designated zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso of individual zzso zzso vaccinated animals with two zzso different zzso zzso strains were zzso Six out of 43 vaccinated animals in the G zzso were each infected with two zzso zzso strains carrying two distinct zzso in this zzso the follow-up during years zzso demonstrated that several animals carried different zzso zzso at different time zzso zzso with two different zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso vaccinated cattle was observed in another zzso as zzso It appears that zzso zzso is composed of a zzso changing bacterial population that zzso in the host or, the zzso diversity implies high transmission intensity by the zzso or zzso Learning how this diversity is generated and identification of distinct zzso zzso strains coupled with high sequence variation of zzso will aid in understanding zzso transmission and disease zzso
