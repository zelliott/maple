Using a combination of zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso techniques zzso we have analyzed 78 brain tumor samples zzso primary and 8 zzso for the presence of zzso in the zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have found that only two groups, zzso zzso in zzso and zzso displayed zzso zzso Three of eight zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso accompanied by loss of the normal zzso In contrast, the frequency of zzso zzso in the primary brain tumors examined was lower zzso Although we have examined different types of primary brain tumors, zzso zzso were exclusively observed in both, low and high-grade zzso (four of zzso The zzso zzso detected in zzso tumors appear to be correlated with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso for the zzso whereas the high-grade zzso had affected the two zzso zzso suggesting a zzso model for zzso of the zzso gene in zzso Thus, single zzso zzso seems to occur in initial stages of zzso zzso the later lost of the remaining zzso zzso appears associated with the progression towards a more zzso zzso
