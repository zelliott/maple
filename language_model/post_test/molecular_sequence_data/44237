zzso is the zzso of a family of mouse zzso factors that share the same zzso DNA binding domain zzso zzso and are widely expressed in adult zzso At least one member of this family is expressed at the beginning of mouse development, because zzso zzso factor activity was not detected in zzso but first appeared at the zzso stage in development, zzso with the onset of zzso gene zzso Since zzso survive until day 11 in the absence of zzso zzso another family member likely accounts for this zzso zzso an zzso cell zzso library yielded zzso 2 and 3 zzso zzso detected zzso from all three of these genes in zzso but upon zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso initially present at zzso 5,000 copies per egg, decreased to zzso 2,000 copies in zzso zzso before accumulating to zzso 100,000 copies in zzso consistent with degradation of maternal zzso zzso followed by selective zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso In zzso zzso did not detect zzso zzso in zzso and only zzso was detected in zzso zzso Northern analysis detected all three zzso at varying levels in zzso zzso and in various adult zzso A fourth zzso zzso recently cloned from a zzso zzso library, was not detected by zzso in either zzso or zzso zzso Together, these results reveal that zzso is selectively expressed for the first 7 days of embryonic development, and is therefore most likely responsible for the zzso zzso factor activity that appears upon zzso gene zzso
