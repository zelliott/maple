zzso is a zzso zinc finger protein that binds zzso and zzso hybrids with high affinity and in a zzso zzso The protein consists of a basic zzso region with seven zzso zinc finger motifs and an zzso zzso region that is not required for zzso The last four zinc finger zzso and the zzso that join them, are nearly identical repeats, while the first three motifs and their zzso are each zzso To identify which regions of the protein are involved in zzso acid zzso we examined the ability of five protein fragments to bind zzso and zzso zzso Our studies reveal that a zzso encompassing the three zzso unique zinc finger motifs and another encompassing the last three of the nearly identical motifs have binding properties similar to the full-length zzso Since these two fragments do not share zinc finger motifs of the same zzso zzso must contain more than one type of zinc finger motif capable of binding zzso As with the full-length zzso zzso and DNA do not significantly compete for zzso binding by the zzso
