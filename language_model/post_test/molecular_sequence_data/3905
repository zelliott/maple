In seeking genetic factors that may control the extended zzso maturation of adult zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in brains of zzso newly emerged bees and experienced zzso DNA sequencing yielded a zzso of zzso zzso spanning the zzso zzso locus and a 3' zzso gene similar to a zzso factor zzso The zzso locus gives rise to three zzso expressed major transcripts produced by alternative zzso that zzso proteins with zzso highly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The type A transcript is dominant in the adult brain and its level of expression increases zzso during the first 4 days of adult zzso The type B message is expressed in brains of zzso zzso but is also found in the zzso and abdomen, whereas transcript C is expressed largely in zzso zzso and in the zzso In contrast to type A message, the brain levels of transcript B decrease during the first 4 days of adult zzso Our data are evaluated in the context of the contrasting zzso zzso of immature and experienced worker zzso
