We obtained the skeletal muscle of rats exposed to zzso conditions during a zzso zzso By using a differential display technique, we identified 6 zzso and 3 zzso genes in the zzso muscle of the zzso rats, as compared to the ground zzso The zzso genes included those coding zzso zzso zzso insulin growth factor binding zzso zzso and zzso gene 16 S zzso and two novel genes zzso zzso The zzso genes included those zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one novel gene zzso zzso In the present study, we isolated and characterized one of two novel muscle genes that were remarkably zzso by zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene zzso comprises 86 zzso acid zzso and is well zzso from zzso to Homo zzso A putative zzso structure located at the zzso region of zzso suggests that this gene may zzso a zzso zzso The zzso expression of this zzso confirmed by Northern zzso analysis, was observed not only in the muscles of zzso rats but also in the muscles of zzso rats, especially in the early stage of zzso when zzso muscle zzso zzso The gene was predominantly expressed in the zzso liver, small zzso and zzso When rat zzso zzso cells were grown to zzso zzso in the cell culture system, the expression of zzso was detected regardless of the cell differentiation zzso These results suggest that zzso has many genetic effects on rat skeletal zzso
