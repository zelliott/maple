The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the transfer of the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso to form zzso A new zzso procedure for zzso zzso from zzso zzso provided sufficient amounts of zzso for zzso zzso Through zzso search a full matching was found between the sequence of zzso fragments and the sequence of a hypothetical protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso number zzso The zzso gene was isolated, cloned into a zzso zzso and successfully expressed in zzso coli zzso cells, yielding a high level of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso resulted in a single zzso of 48 zzso under zzso in agreement with the molecular mass of the hypothetical protein zzso by zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso exactly zzso to the predicted zzso zzso and kinetic properties of zzso zzso zzso are reported and compared with those already known for the zzso obtained from different zzso
