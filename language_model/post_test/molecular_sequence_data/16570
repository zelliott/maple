To increase the numbers of zzso available for use in constructing a genetic map, and facilitate the use of functional zzso to zzso fiber development and breeding in cotton, we sampled zzso sequences from expressed sequence tags zzso transcribed during fiber zzso in the zzso species zzso zzso to evaluate their frequency of zzso level of zzso and distribution in the At and zzso zzso of zzso zzso From among zzso derived from zzso zzso fibers at zzso days post zzso zzso 931 zzso were found to contain simple sequence repeats zzso 544 zzso zzso primer pairs were developed, and zzso zzso amplified zzso products from zzso cotton zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, only 99 zzso of these were found to be zzso and segregating in our zzso zzso mapping population zzso In these amplified and zzso zzso zzso and zzso repeat motifs were the most zzso representing zzso and zzso respectively, of the zzso A total of 111 zzso detected with these 99 zzso were integrated into our backbone map including zzso zzso zzso The distribution of the zzso appeared to be zzso since 72 zzso were anchored to the At and 37 to the zzso zzso of zzso cotton based on linkage zzso Interestingly, out of the 10 pairs of duplicate zzso zzso seven were mapped to the corresponding zzso linkage groups and/or zzso zzso analysis revealed that 69 of the 99 zzso showed significant similarities to known zzso Some genes important for fiber development, such as zzso zzso were mapped to corresponding zzso These zzso provide structural and functional zzso information that will be useful for understanding cotton fiber zzso
