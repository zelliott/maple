Members of the zzso zzso are among the most abundant bacteria in zzso Although they have been characterized as versatile zzso it is unclear if the types and availability of organic resources influence their distribution in zzso The potential for organic resources to select for different zzso was assessed using molecular and zzso approaches with agricultural and managed zzso zzso in zzso The distribution of zzso varied with the carbon content of zzso the proportion of subdivision 4 sequences was highest in agricultural zzso zzso zzso that contained less carbon than zzso soils, where the proportions of subdivision 1, 3, 4, and 6 sequences were zzso Either readily zzso carbon or plant zzso were used as the sole carbon and energy source to isolate zzso bacteria from these zzso Plant zzso increased the diversity of zzso cultivated but decreased the total number of zzso recovered compared to readily zzso zzso Two zzso novel zzso strains isolated on the plant zzso medium were zzso zzso zzso 83 zzso 1) and zzso 96 zzso 3) are moderate zzso with pH zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Both strains grew slowly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso either 1 zzso zzso zzso or 2 zzso zzso zzso copies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristic typical of zzso zzso zzso 83 is a zzso growing zzso at zzso zzso These zzso characteristics help delineate the niches that zzso occupy in soil and are consistent with their widespread distribution and zzso
