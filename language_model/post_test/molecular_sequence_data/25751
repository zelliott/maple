zzso is the zzso present in the seeds of zzso zzso which specifically binds the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso The zzso is composed of a single type of zzso with Mr zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso (Mr zzso zzso and zzso laser light scattering (Mr zzso zzso methods have been used to zzso establish the native zzso structure of zzso as a zzso These absolute molecular weight methods and the calculated zzso radius zzso zzso indicate that the zzso zzso is highly compact relative to typical zzso zzso and thus, anomalous molecular weight values are obtained when simple size exclusion zzso is used to determine the molecular weight of zzso Studies with a zzso zzso zzso and zzso further support the existence of a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso binding was determined to be one zzso site per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso properties as indicated by binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 X zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso does not appear to be present in the stems or leaves of the zzso zzso plant, nor were there any indications for the presence of zzso zzso
