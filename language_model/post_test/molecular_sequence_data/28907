The 46 zzso of zzso zzso have different zzso and each is thought to have a specific form of the zzso zzso zzso of the 145 zzso of zzso B revealed much more zzso genetic diversity than zzso The zzso factor, due to an alpha zzso linkage between O units in place of the more common alpha 1-2 linkage and previously thought to be due to a converting zzso is now shown to be due to a zzso gene located within the major gene zzso zzso a remnant of this gene in all zzso zzso shows that the zzso was zzso There are six distinct gene cluster forms, five apparently derived by a series of deletions and one by an zzso from an ancestral zzso form present in 57 zzso The history of the gene cluster and movement between subspecies I and II can be zzso Two of the zzso forms still have a functional zzso zzso while in three it has been zzso by deletion or zzso Two of the forms lacking a functional zzso gene have the zzso gene first described for strain zzso as zzso whereas for the third the zzso gene has not been zzso
