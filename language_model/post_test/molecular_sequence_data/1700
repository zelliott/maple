A novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso shows zzso times greater sensitivity to ethanol compared to the wild type, while it grows normally in the absence of ethanol, and responds normally to other alcohols and to environmental stresses such as heat shock and high zzso zzso of the zzso locus indicated it is a previously zzso zzso In order to address the zzso function, we identified the zzso gene by means of zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a novel protein without any known functional zzso zzso zzso plants zzso zzso displayed an enhanced tolerance to ethanol and zzso suggesting that zzso is directly involved in the tolerance to those zzso By contrast, expression of zzso in zzso coli and zzso did not increase their tolerance to ethanol or zzso Interestingly, a similarity search revealed that zzso genes are zzso only in plants and zzso These results might suggest that plants, and presumably zzso have a novel mechanism for protection from zzso zzso
