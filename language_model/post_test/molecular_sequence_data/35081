zzso DNA maintenance zzso is an important process in molecular breeding and for various applications in the construction of genetically engineered zzso Here we describe a novel zzso zzso gene involved in zzso function called zzso (formerly zzso zzso gene regions were identified using molecular zzso zzso We found that zzso is a zzso protein that is crucial for zzso We also determined that zzso can change a zzso zzso with an unstable zzso and zzso segregation into one with zzso zzso suggesting that the protein functions in the zzso and/or zzso of zzso zzso has two distinct zzso an zzso zzso domain and a zzso assembly zzso structure, and zzso analysis of zzso revealed that both zzso are essential for zzso Further studies using cells of zzso zzso and zzso (formerly zzso gene implied that zzso has potential as a molecular probe for exploring novel zzso zzso
