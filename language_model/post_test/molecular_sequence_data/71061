As components of a zzso zzso zzso system, zzso and zzso globally regulate expression of multiple zzso zzso as well as the second zzso zzso zzso zzso To date, no information exists on negative regulation of the zzso cascade in zzso zzso Here we describe a novel zzso zzso which is located downstream from zzso and transcribed zzso relative to zzso In zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in reduced zzso expression and decreased zzso zzso With the use of a zzso protein fusion system, we demonstrate that zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso levels in cultures and studies utilizing zzso coli zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso specifically zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso repressive effect on zzso and the associated decrease in zzso activity have important implications for the expression of all zzso zzso genes and the overall zzso of zzso zzso
