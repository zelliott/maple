zzso application of zzso acid zzso was able to reverse the zzso effect of salt, zzso and heat stresses in the zzso and zzso establishment of zzso zzso zzso this effect being accompanied by an increase in salicylic acid zzso levels, a hormone that in recent years has been implicated in plant responses to zzso zzso Furthermore, this treatment induced an increase in the expression levels of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso and action, zzso In addition, we proved that transgenic plants zzso a zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso coding for a member of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso family zzso showed a reduced zzso dependence for growth and improved responses to salt, zzso and heat stress at the level of seed zzso and zzso zzso In zzso seeds, the improved behavior under zzso stress was accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso zzso All these data taken together suggest that this zzso gene and zzso addition of zzso are able to counteract the zzso effects of these adverse environmental conditions in seed zzso and zzso growth through zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, this hypothesis is supported by the fact that zzso zzso impaired in zzso zzso are more sensitive to salt stress than wild type and are not affected by zzso application of zzso
