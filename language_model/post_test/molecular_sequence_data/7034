zzso in the repeat length of zzso have been identified recently in tumors arising in patients with zzso zzso colon cancer and in several human sporadic zzso We examined 40 sporadic zzso and their corresponding zzso skin for zzso instability zzso and loss of zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were amplified by zzso chain reaction, zzso on zzso gels, transferred onto nylon zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso was observed in eight of 40 zzso zzso at one of 10 zzso zzso zzso was found at zzso region zzso in zzso at zzso in zzso and at zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso between zzso features of patients with and without zzso revealed no obvious zzso zzso at zzso was observed only in zzso greater than zzso zzso in depth, suggesting that it does not represent an early event in sporadic zzso Our results indicate that 1) zzso is a genetic zzso in a proportion of sporadic melanoma, which may reflect a zzso in genes involved in DNA replication zzso and 2) zzso at zzso region zzso is a significant event in sporadic zzso The latter finding further supports the hypothesis that the zzso region may contain one or more tumor zzso genes zzso zzso involved in the zzso of zzso
