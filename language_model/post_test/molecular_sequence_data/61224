zzso zzso of zzso is required for cellular zzso zzso Multiple zzso mechanisms have been identified that can fulfill this role in a variety of zzso cell types, including zzso cells, with and without zzso zzso The zzso of dietary zzso also relies on the function of a zzso system in mature zzso zzso of small zzso The various zzso systems can be distinguished by their preferences for various folate compounds as zzso as well as by differences in temperature and pH zzso The widely studied zzso zzso transport system is zzso by a zzso zzso by the newly discovered zzso zzso zzso zzso The characteristics of this gene in zzso and human cells are similar, consistent with the close similarity between these species of folate transport zzso by this zzso However, differences occur in the form of zzso zzso alternate zzso and zzso end zzso zzso as well as in promoter zzso regulating zzso zzso gene expression also appears to regulate zzso zzso cell folate zzso in small zzso However, the properties of zzso folate transport in these cells is anomalous when compared with that seen in zzso cell zzso zzso mechanisms as to the regulation of zzso zzso are now emerging along with other information on structure and function of the zzso and its zzso following zzso
