In the light of the poor zzso of zzso and zzso species, zzso real-time zzso systems were developed based on the zzso zzso gene sequences from zzso representatives of both zzso The number of DNA targets from three different groups, zzso zzso zzso group 8) and zzso and zzso zzso subdivision 1, was determined in DNA extracts from different zzso zzso zzso zzso soil compartments and from bulk soil with the aim to determine the distribution of the three bacterial groups in the zzso zzso The specificity of the designed zzso was evaluated in three zzso First, in zzso tests were performed which demonstrated that all designed zzso zzso matched with database sequences of their respective groups, whereas lower matches with other zzso bacterial groups were zzso Second, zzso amplification with the different primer sets was performed on zzso DNA extracts from target and from zzso zzso This test demonstrated specificity of the designed zzso for the target groups, as single zzso of expected sizes were found only for the target zzso Third, the zzso systems were tested for specific zzso from soil DNA extracts and 48 zzso from each primer system were zzso All sequences were zzso similar to database sequences of the respective target zzso zzso cell numbers based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso subdivision zzso zzso from zzso zzso compartments and bulk zzso demonstrated higher preference for one or both zzso compartments above bulk soil for all three bacterial zzso
