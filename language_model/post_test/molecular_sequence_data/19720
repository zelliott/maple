In the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso 24 of zzso protein zzso zzso occupies the first position in a zzso motif that coordinates a zinc zzso The structural and functional importance of zzso 24, which is widely zzso from bacteria to humans, was studied by its replacement with zzso and by incorporating the resulting zzso into zzso coli zzso The capability of such modified zzso in binding zzso at the P and zzso was equal to that obtained with zzso incorporating zzso zzso In fact, both zzso zzso species exhibited zzso lower zzso affinity compared with native zzso coli zzso In addition, replacement of the native zzso coli zzso by zzso and particularly by zzso zzso resulted in reduced capability of the zzso zzso for association with zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso from transformed cells zzso normally and had a full complement of zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso was much lower than that measured in zzso incorporating zzso zzso The zzso center of the zzso is located within the zzso zzso and, therefore, it is unlikely to be directly affected by changes in the structure of zzso More probably, the zzso effects of zzso zzso on the zzso center seem to be zzso by adjacent zzso bridges or the zzso zzso zzso resulting in weak zzso zzso This hypothesis was verified by molecular dynamics simulation zzso
