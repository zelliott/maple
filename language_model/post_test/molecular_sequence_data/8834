zzso is a zzso of the hypoxic genes of zzso zzso It binds to a specific hypoxic consensus sequence in the upstream region of these genes and zzso zzso in conjunction with the general repression complex zzso In this study, we demonstrated that the first 100 zzso acids zzso the zzso domain of zzso were responsible for DNA binding and that when bound, zzso bent DNA at an angle of 90 zzso A zzso analysis resulted in the isolation of seven zzso zzso all located within the zzso domain, that caused loss of DNA zzso The effect of these zzso on the structure of zzso was evaluated on the basis of the zzso between zzso and the human male zzso protein zzso for which a structural model is zzso The failure to isolate zzso zzso in the zzso three-quarters of the protein prompted a deletion analysis of this zzso The results suggested that this region was responsible for the repression function of zzso and that the repression information was zzso This hypothesis was confirmed by using a set of zzso between sequences zzso the zzso zzso domain and portions of zzso Those zzso containing either the entire zzso region or either half of it were capable of zzso zzso by selected zzso was demonstrated to be dependent on zzso
