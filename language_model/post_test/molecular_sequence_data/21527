zzso interactions are often part of complex networks of zzso relationships that have evolved in biological zzso Despite many years of work on the evolution of zzso the likelihood that sister zzso of zzso can zzso with their hosts to specifically zzso two related zzso even when those hosts occur zzso is still zzso Furthermore, when these specific interactions occur, the molecular and zzso basis of this specificity is still largely zzso The presence of these specific zzso relationships can now be tested using molecular markers such as DNA sequence zzso Here we test for specific zzso relationships in an emerging zzso model, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fish are intermediate hosts for zzso zzso zzso that are zzso very similar and have nearly identical life cycles through zzso zzso and avian zzso We analyzed over 2000 base pairs of zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequences in 48 zzso individuals collected from zzso and zzso zzso hosts from disparate geographic regions distributed across the Northern zzso Our data strongly support the presence of two distinct zzso of zzso each of which exclusively zzso either zzso or zzso zzso These zzso most likely represent different species that zzso soon after the zzso of their zzso zzso In addition, genetic structuring exists among zzso taken from zzso zzso hosts from Alaska, Oregon and Wales, although it is much less than the divergence between zzso Our findings emphasize that biological communities may be even more complex than they first appear, and zzso the question of what are the zzso zzso and genetic factors that maintain the specificity of the zzso zzso and their zzso zzso
