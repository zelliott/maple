zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso peptides isolated from the skin of the African clawed zzso zzso zzso They protect the zzso from infection and exhibit a zzso zzso activity in zzso The mechanism of this activity involves the interaction of zzso with microbial zzso We have measured the secondary structure and zzso ability of these peptides to obtain information about this zzso Our results show that zzso forms a zzso with an average length of less than 20 A upon binding to zzso At high zzso zzso zzso zzso spontaneously zzso zzso zzso at temperatures above the zzso phase zzso zzso appears to bind to the surface of zzso made of zzso charged lipids without spontaneously penetrating the zzso Finally, zzso and zzso interact together with zzso in a synergistic way that enhances the zzso content of one or both of the peptides and allows the peptides to more easily penetrate the zzso zzso mixed with a small zzso amount of zzso 2 zzso is zzso times as potent as zzso alone at inducing the release of zzso from zzso The results suggest that the mechanism of zzso activity does not involve a channel formed by zzso zzso zzso
