zzso protein A zzso first identified as a component of the lung zzso system, is now recognized to be an important contributor to host zzso zzso zzso can facilitate zzso by zzso bacteria, zzso and zzso stimulate the zzso burst by zzso and zzso zzso zzso production by zzso zzso zzso can also provide a link between innate and zzso immune responses by promoting differentiation and zzso of zzso zzso Because of the obvious relevance of these mechanisms to the host zzso and zzso zzso functions of the lower zzso zzso we examined human zzso zzso for zzso protein and transcripts and zzso zzso zzso fluid for zzso By zzso zzso was identified in two layers of the zzso zzso the deep intermediate layer (the site of newly differentiated zzso zzso and the superficial layer zzso dead zzso zzso where zzso is probably zzso and associated with a zzso zzso of zzso were identified by Northern zzso analysis in zzso isolated from zzso wall and zzso by sequencing of reverse zzso chain reaction products, to be derived from each of the two closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso fluid by two-dimensional gel zzso and confirmed by mass zzso This study provides evidence, for the first time, that zzso is produced in a zzso zzso namely the zzso zzso and has a zzso that would allow it to contribute to both the innate and zzso immune zzso The findings support the hypothesis that in the zzso as in zzso zzso is an essential component of the zzso zzso A zzso hypothesis is that qualitative and quantitative zzso of normal zzso may play a role in the zzso of lower zzso tract inflammatory zzso
