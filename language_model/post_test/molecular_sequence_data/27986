The zzso zzso zzso the outer membrane zzso complex zzso was cloned in two pieces from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso gene included a promoter zzso as indicated by its zzso expression in zzso zzso Attempts to reconstruct an intact zzso gene were zzso suggesting that expression of the complete zzso protein was toxic to zzso zzso Complete sequence determination revealed a coding sequence of zzso zzso the deduced zzso acid sequence indicated a mature protein of 687 zzso acids with an zzso signal zzso of 24 zzso zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence revealed that the zzso half of zzso is generally zzso while the zzso portion contains alternating zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso portion of zzso is exposed on the zzso surface and the zzso portion is membrane zzso
