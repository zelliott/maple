Avoiding zzso of immunity to zzso proteins is critical to the safe and effective use of zzso viral zzso zzso for gene zzso While commonly used zzso such as zzso zzso 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9, are often associated with minimal and/or dysfunctional zzso T cell responses in mice, the threshold for immune zzso appears to be lower in zzso zzso We have modeled this zzso within the mouse by identifying two zzso zzso with differential immune zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso and a hybrid between natural zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we aimed to characterize the structural zzso of the zzso zzso that augment cellular immunity to zzso proteins or those of zzso that may induce zzso We hypothesized that the structural domain responsible for differential immune zzso could be mapped to zzso regions of the zzso such as zzso regions zzso I to IX of zzso To test this, a series of hybrid zzso zzso was constructed by swapping zzso between zzso and zzso By comparing their ability to generate zzso T cells in zzso versus the stability of zzso expression in the muscle, we confirmed that the functional domain lies within the zzso portion of the zzso Our studies were able to exclude the regions of zzso which are not sufficient for zzso the cellular immune response, notably, zzso I, II, and zzso We have also identified zzso IV as a region of interest in zzso the efficiency and stability of muscle zzso to zzso
