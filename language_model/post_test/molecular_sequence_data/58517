zzso zzso virus zzso represents the zzso virus of a new zzso in the zzso zzso Its zzso consists of six segments of zzso zzso zzso We have cloned and zzso the fifth zzso segment, which codes for the viral zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows zzso similarity to the zzso of zzso virus, a related zzso zzso and about zzso sequence similarity to those of the influenza zzso To reveal the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso we characterized the zzso ends of the zzso zzso zzso were recognized by a zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso are zzso Surprisingly, no large zzso extensions were found at the zzso end, as would have been expected if zzso were using a classical zzso zzso We therefore propose that zzso is stealing only the cap structure with one or two additional zzso from cellular zzso to generate appropriate zzso for initiation of viral zzso zzso
