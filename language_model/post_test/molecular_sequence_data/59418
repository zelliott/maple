We have cloned zzso that zzso a complete open reading frame for a calcium channel zzso zzso from zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso acid protein belongs to the zzso of zzso sodium and calcium zzso zzso analysis shows that the sequence of this zzso is relatively distant from sodium channel alpha zzso and most similar to genes zzso the A, B, and E zzso of calcium channel zzso zzso To indicate its similarity to this zzso of zzso zzso we name this protein zzso for zzso zzso calcium channel zzso zzso type zzso Northern zzso analysis detected a single zzso 5 zzso transcript class that is regulated zzso with expression zzso in the first zzso zzso zzso and late zzso zzso In late-stage zzso zzso is expressed zzso in the nervous zzso zzso transcripts are generated by alternative zzso In addition, single zzso variations between zzso and zzso sequence are consistent with zzso zzso zzso maps to a zzso region implicated in, and is the likely candidate for, the gene involved in the generation of zzso zzso and lethal zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
