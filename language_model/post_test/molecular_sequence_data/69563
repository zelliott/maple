zzso and zzso transplantation zzso can be expressed zzso at the zzso level and in response to zzso zzso To determine which DNA control elements and nuclear factors are responsible for these differences, zzso and zzso upstream regulatory regions were used in expression and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to contain two zzso zzso zzso binding zzso while the zzso zzso has only one and is zzso less well by zzso of the zzso B zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso response element mediates a much stronger induction by zzso and has a higher affinity for zzso and zzso which are zzso factors implicated in the regulation of major zzso complex class I zzso These results suggest a molecular basis for the way in which zzso and zzso zzso have adapted to be zzso expressed and to respond to different sets of zzso zzso
