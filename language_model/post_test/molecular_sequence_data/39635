zzso zzso constitute a protein module family found associated with specific zzso and proteins involved in zzso zzso In addition, a small number of animal zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso and zzso E virus, zzso zzso zzso for which, however, structural and functional information is extremely zzso Here, we characterized the zzso zzso from zzso E virus, zzso Forest virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain was determined at zzso resolution in complex with zzso Information derived from zzso zzso and sequence analyses suggests a close zzso and, most probably, functional relationship between viral and cellular zzso domain zzso The data revealed that viral zzso zzso have relatively poor zzso zzso activities (which were previously proposed to be their biologically relevant zzso but bind efficiently free and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso these results suggest to further evaluate the role of viral zzso zzso in host response to viral zzso
