zzso zzso apparently account for the presence of a zzso gene zzso zzso 3) in zzso zzso This gene zzso as the result of alternative zzso both zzso and zzso zzso Whereas zzso is known to be a pancreatic zzso neither the chemical nature nor biological function of zzso 4 has been explored zzso The zzso 4 sequence contains two predicted translation initiation sites: an zzso site that codes for a zzso leader zzso on zzso A, and a zzso site that codes for a zzso leader zzso on zzso zzso We report studies that provide evidence for the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso 4 and the possible mechanism of expression of this protein in human brain and zzso zzso zzso We raised zzso against a zzso acid synthetic zzso representing the leader sequence of zzso B and against zzso zzso zzso By using these zzso we isolated and chemically identified zzso 4 from extracts of both post zzso human brain and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso B, with a zzso N zzso is the zzso (if not zzso form of the zzso in post zzso human brain, but that both zzso are expressed in zzso zzso zzso On the basis of our studies on the expression of a series of zzso 4 zzso in two different cell lines, we propose that unconventional translation initiation at a zzso with a zzso rather than a zzso N zzso may serve as a means to regulate protein zzso
