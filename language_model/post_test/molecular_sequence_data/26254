zzso resistance in the zzso is zzso by a number of genetically zzso usually zzso zzso which specify an zzso system involving an inner membrane zzso zzso Attempts to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli by cloning the structural gene zzso downstream of the zzso zzso promoter under regulation by zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso induction at 42 degrees C resulted in zzso zzso cells containing little zzso overproduction of the zzso However, cells containing zzso fused to zzso were resistant to zzso at 30 degrees C and zzso modest amounts of a large fusion protein when induced at 42 degrees zzso Fusion of the zzso half or the first 38 zzso acids of zzso to zzso did lead to increased production of fusion zzso zzso could be zzso by size or by zzso zzso or zzso zzso In the latter method, selected zzso were required to counteract zzso binding of zzso to the zzso zzso acid sequencing of the zzso of zzso fusion proteins indicated that most molecules were blocked at this zzso The sequence of an zzso zzso was consistent with that expected from the zzso zzso A collagen zzso zzso genetically placed between zzso and zzso allowed recovery of zzso zzso protein after zzso treatment of the zzso fusion zzso
