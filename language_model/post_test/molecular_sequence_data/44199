Genes of the zzso zzso gene cluster localized on zzso zzso are implicated in many zzso and zzso zzso We present here a high-resolution physical map of this region between markers zzso and zzso An integrated zzso zzso and a partial zzso map were constructed by zzso mapping using the zzso zzso library and three zzso zzso A total of 3 zzso 34 zzso and 56 zzso were zzso 33 newly generated zzso to zzso end zzso 9 zzso and 4 zzso zzso 5 known zzso 4 expressed sequence zzso and 1 zzso Within the map, a complete zzso zzso of zzso 1 zzso encompasses the zzso gene cluster and zzso a zzso zzso This allowed us to define the zzso orientation of zzso zzso and zzso and to show that zzso is localized outside the zzso gene zzso FISH analysis localized zzso clones containing the zzso gene cluster to zzso The data provide the basis for further characterization of the zzso gene cluster and for the construction of a zzso zzso zzso of this zzso
