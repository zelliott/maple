A synthetic zzso was used to isolate mouse brain zzso clones coding for a brain zzso of the alpha 1 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Twenty-six independent zzso clones were isolated and zzso All the zzso clones reported here showed high zzso to the rat brain class C zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso Tomlinson, zzso zzso Leonard, zzso zzso and Gilbert, zzso zzso (1991) zzso 7, zzso zzso of the individual mouse brain class C zzso zzso sequences indicated the presence of four regions within the alpha 1 zzso coding sequence where alternative zzso can take place in mouse brain and raise the possibility that zzso arrangement of these zzso zzso could give rise to a zzso class of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso sequences could be detected in highest abundance in mouse heart, at lower levels in mouse brain and spinal cord, and not at all in liver or skeletal zzso An expression zzso for one zzso of the zzso alpha 1 zzso zzso was constructed using the human zzso promoter to direct zzso and this expression zzso was used in a novel zzso zzso of primary cultures of bovine adrenal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso alpha 1 zzso expression zzso increased the zzso of human growth hormone derived from a zzso human growth hormone expression zzso after stimulation with elevated zzso or the zzso zzso Bay zzso These experiments suggest that this zzso of the zzso alpha 1 zzso is functional in the zzso zzso cells and that the number of zzso channels is a limiting component in the zzso from zzso cells in zzso
