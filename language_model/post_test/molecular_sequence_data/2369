Human zzso DNA contains two major zzso one for zzso of each strand of the zzso Previous mapping and zzso data have localized these regulatory elements and have suggested regions important to their zzso In order to zzso at high resolution, the sequences critical for accurate and efficient zzso zzso a zzso substitution analysis of the entire promoter region was zzso Each promoter was shown to consist of approximately 50 base pairs zzso two functionally distinct zzso These and previous data strongly support a mode of zzso initiation requiring minimal sequences surrounding the initiation sites that are likely interactive with core zzso and upstream regulatory zzso capable of binding a zzso factor that zzso the efficiency of zzso zzso Furthermore, in at least one case, this upstream regulatory domain is capable of operating zzso
