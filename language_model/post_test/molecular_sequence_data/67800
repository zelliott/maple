zzso proteins zzso are defined by their sequence zzso to zzso from barley and are present zzso in zzso zzso of corresponding genes have revealed diverse functions of zzso in plant development and zzso and zzso zzso This study describes the identification of a family of 14 zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and investigated potential functions of zzso in plant defense against the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso alignment and zzso analyses zzso the 14 zzso into four groups, which were clearly distinguished from known zzso zzso acid zzso zzso responses of the zzso genes to zzso zzso infection was determined by comparing zzso of susceptible zzso zzso zzso and partially resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the 14 zzso genes tested, zzso was zzso zzso in both zzso zzso zzso at zzso after zzso zzso infection, while zzso of zzso was restricted to resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of five representative zzso members identified a zzso zzso zzso activity only for higher molecular weight complexes of zzso and zzso By zzso zzso formation at infected leaf sites increased after zzso with even higher zzso production in zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso application of zzso significantly reduced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that early induction of zzso and zzso zzso in an zzso burst that may play a pivotal role in zzso of zzso zzso against zzso zzso
