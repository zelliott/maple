The zzso of zzso zzso exist as a single circular zzso of approximately zzso base zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso have been described which contain two zzso defective DNA zzso These zzso which form a zzso zzso structure, contain either the viral early region or the late zzso The zzso have the unique property of being able to tolerate variable sized reiterations of regulatory and zzso region zzso and portions of the coding zzso They can also exchange coding region sequences with other zzso It has been suggested that the zzso zzso structure might be a stage in the evolution of zzso which can uniquely sustain zzso and sequence zzso However, it is not known if the regulatory and zzso region sequences are highly zzso Also, it is not known if the zzso zzso structure is zzso and what the conditions might be which would favor restoration of the zzso zzso zzso We addressed the first question by sequencing the reiterated regulatory and zzso regions of zzso and zzso zzso This revealed a large number of zzso in the regulatory regions of the defective zzso including zzso zzso zzso and base zzso We also detected insertions and base zzso in the zzso zzso We addressed the second question by introducing into zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso which had been engineered to contain only a single regulatory zzso Analysis of viral DNA from zzso cells demonstrated zzso zzso containing a wild type zzso DNA zzso However, the complete zzso containing reiterated regulatory regions, could often compete away the wild type zzso The zzso zzso zzso were isolated, cloned and found to be zzso All of the DNA zzso identified in one of the regulatory regions of zzso DNA were present in the zzso zzso zzso These and other findings indicate that the zzso zzso state can sustain many zzso which zzso cannot directly zzso However, the zzso can later be introduced into the wild type zzso when the zzso and zzso zzso recombine to generate a new zzso zzso zzso
