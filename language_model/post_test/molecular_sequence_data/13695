zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the production of zzso II and the breakdown of zzso leading to increased blood pressure zzso induction of vascular smooth muscle cell zzso and the stimulation of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 16 of the zzso gene was examined by zzso chain reaction in a zzso study of 35 patients with idiopathic zzso zzso zzso and 35 patients with normally functioning hearts zzso Compared with the zzso zzso frequency in the control population, the frequency of the deletion zzso was zzso in zzso patients and zzso in zzso the difference between observed zzso in all subjects in each group was significant zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The data thus provide evidence in favor of an association between idiopathic zzso zzso and a zzso at the zzso locus zzso thus implicating this zzso and possibly a genetic zzso of zzso itself, in human idiopathic zzso zzso
