zzso E is an zzso that plays a central role in zzso processing and degradation in zzso zzso Like its zzso coli zzso zzso G, zzso E shows a marked preference for zzso zzso that bear a zzso rather than a zzso or zzso at the zzso zzso To investigate the mechanism by which zzso zzso can influence distant zzso events, we have developed zzso zzso zzso that allow the activity of zzso E and zzso G to be zzso much more accurately and easily than zzso zzso analysis of the zzso of these zzso by zzso E and zzso G has revealed that zzso zzso zzso the reaction not by improving zzso zzso but rather by enhancing the zzso potency of these zzso Furthermore, the presence of a zzso zzso can increase the specificity of zzso site selection within an zzso Although zzso forms of zzso E and zzso G can cut zzso the ability of these zzso to discriminate between zzso zzso on the basis of their zzso zzso state requires the formation of protein zzso Among the molecular mechanisms that could account for these properties are those in which zzso binding by one zzso zzso zzso a protein structural change that zzso zzso zzso by another zzso
