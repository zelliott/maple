zzso zzso plays a role in zzso growth zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso The specifics of the zzso are, however, zzso In a current model, zzso zzso of zzso zzso the binding of zzso zzso zzso enhances signaling induced by zzso binding to zzso We recently reported that zzso directly binds to zzso and zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is defective in inducing zzso complex formation and zzso zzso but it still binds to zzso Like zzso zzso zzso is zzso in many zzso and is implicated in cancer zzso Here, we discovered that zzso directly bound to zzso but not to zzso zzso the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso which zzso to the specificity loop of zzso to zzso zzso markedly enhanced zzso binding to zzso suggesting that the zzso sequence is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso complex formation, whereas zzso did zzso When cells were attached to zzso zzso zzso or zzso expression had little or no effect on zzso zzso When zzso zzso was reduced (in zzso zzso plates), zzso induced zzso signaling and enhanced cell survival in an zzso zzso Also zzso enhanced colony formation in soft zzso in an zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso binding to zzso plays a major role in zzso signaling in zzso conditions, which mimic the in zzso environment, and is a novel therapeutic zzso
