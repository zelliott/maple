zzso is one of the most employed zzso drugs, but its efficacy is limited by the onset of adverse effects such as drug resistance, due to the drug zzso via zzso zzso Several factors are associated to a high zzso activity, including the amount of cholesterol in plasma zzso which is essential to maintain the pump zzso In this work we started from the following zzso 1) the drug-resistant colon cancer zzso cells had a higher content of cholesterol in plasma membrane than zzso zzso cells and a higher activity of zzso which was decreased by the cholesterol-lowering agent zzso 2) zzso cells showed a higher synthesis of zzso cholesterol and a higher expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) the zzso drug zzso reduced the cholesterol zzso increased the synthesis of zzso and lowered the zzso activity in resistant zzso In order to circumvent drug resistance we designed a new zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso from human zzso this zzso zzso zzso was efficiently zzso by a zzso zzso and induced zzso effects in zzso cells, reversing their drug zzso Its efficacy was further increased by zzso which zzso the zzso levels and zzso reduces the zzso activity, thus increasing the zzso zzso and limiting the drug zzso We propose that the association of zzso zzso and statins may be a future promising strategy to reverse zzso in human cancer zzso
