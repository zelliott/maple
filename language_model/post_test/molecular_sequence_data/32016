zzso of zzso fetal DNA by zzso DNA discrimination has been used in zzso prenatal testing of fetal zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso member zzso zzso zzso located on zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso and completely zzso in maternal blood zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of zzso detection of fetal zzso 18 using the zzso zzso gene as a zzso fetal DNA marker and the zzso zzso gene as a zzso total DNA marker in the first zzso of zzso 

A zzso zzso study was conducted using maternal plasma collected from 66 pregnant women, 11 carrying fetuses with zzso 18 and 55 carrying normal zzso Median zzso zzso were significantly elevated in women with zzso 18 fetuses compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Median zzso zzso were also significantly higher in women with zzso 18 fetuses than in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso fetal zzso 18 detection were zzso and zzso respectively, with a sensitivity of zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso may be useful as potential zzso for zzso detection of fetal zzso 18 in the first zzso of pregnancy, irrespective of the sex and genetic variations of the zzso
