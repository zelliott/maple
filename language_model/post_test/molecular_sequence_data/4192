zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a type III zzso protein required for zzso of zzso In this study zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences of the corresponding zzso gene from different zzso strains were zzso The zzso zzso differed significantly among zzso of zzso zzso These differences might be attributable to variations in the zzso sequence and their consequences on zzso secondary zzso An zzso signal hypothesis has been proposed for zzso predicting the zzso of translation and zzso via an zzso zzso This hypothesis claims a strictly zzso zzso of zzso without its zzso zzso The presence of zzso in the zzso even with a closed zzso apparatus, is zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso could be zzso These findings do not support the zzso signal hypothesis for zzso zzso
