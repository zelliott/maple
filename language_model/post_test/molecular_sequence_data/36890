The zzso virus zzso gene encodes a 90 zzso early protein that is essential for viral DNA zzso In this report we map and explore the zzso of the temperature sensitive zzso bearing zzso in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA synthesis was virtually zzso during zzso infections performed with zzso and incorporation of zzso ceased rapidly when cultures were shifted to the zzso temperature in the midst of zzso The zzso protein may therefore be involved in DNA synthesis at the replication zzso The zzso of the four zzso were localized within the zzso zzso by marker rescue, and the single zzso changes responsible for the zzso zzso of the three WR zzso were zzso zzso the three zzso with zzso zzso were impaired in marker rescue when zzso zzso with small zzso 2 zzso zzso DNA fragments at zzso degrees C was zzso This zzso was not due to degradation of zzso DNA under zzso zzso zzso marker rescue could be restored by incubation at the zzso temperature for a brief period after zzso suggesting a requirement for functional zzso in zzso zzso zzso rescue under zzso conditions could alternatively be restored by zzso of zzso but zzso DNA zzso
