zzso derived growth inhibitor zzso is a member of the family of zzso fatty acid binding proteins zzso which bind zzso zzso such as fatty zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and an 11 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth of normal zzso zzso cells in tissue and organ culture, but fails to inhibit proliferation of many breast cancer cell lines in zzso Here, the effects of zzso zzso on tumor growth of zzso zzso and zzso human breast cancer cell lines in nude mice were zzso To deliver zzso into tumors, a novel zzso production system was applied for expression and zzso of small zzso peptides in zzso zzso zzso differentiation was observed in zzso and zzso cells upon zzso zzso In addition, zzso colony formation in soft zzso by zzso cells was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso growth in zzso nude mice was suppressed in all three cell lines zzso Furthermore, zzso expressed by zzso cells caused zzso tumor growth zzso of zzso zzso These results indicate that breast cancer zzso by zzso is independent of binding to zzso zzso and is perhaps zzso by interference with zzso signaling zzso
