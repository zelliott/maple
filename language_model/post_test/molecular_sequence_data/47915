zzso is an zzso protein and its plasma levels increase consistently in response to infection and zzso Some evidence has demonstrated that zzso is involved in the immune zzso In this study, we established a novel zzso liquid zzso zzso procedure for zzso plasma zzso The procedure required an ammonium zzso zzso and a zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso possessed one heavy zzso and light chain zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso under reducing conditions, with a zzso zzso zzso of about 42,000 and 14,000 for heavy zzso and light chains zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso heavy chain of zzso has never been reported zzso the analyses of zzso zzso acid sequence showed a great sequence similarity to that of human and other animal zzso In addition, Western zzso using our specific zzso prepared against zzso zzso 42,000 chain did react with human zzso and likewise, the zzso against human zzso also zzso with zzso zzso zzso 42,000 zzso Thus, it confirmed that the identity of the zzso protein zzso from our procedures was as zzso
