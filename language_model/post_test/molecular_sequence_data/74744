A zzso study was carried out on strain zzso a moderately zzso zzso isolated from activated sludge samples collected in zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso with highest sequence similarity of zzso and zzso % to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso gene sequence similarity between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was respectively zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso trees based on these zzso genes showed that strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso form a zzso at the periphery of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso value between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The combined zzso and zzso data show that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
