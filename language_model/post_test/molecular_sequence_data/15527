zzso and zzso classes of zzso proteins catalyze zzso transfer from zzso to zzso of zzso to zzso zzso which is essential for normal microbial physiology and zzso zzso proteins additionally catalyze the zzso of zzso We have earlier demonstrated that although both catalyze identical the zzso synthesis reaction, they exhibit a differential response to zzso due to a unique charge reversal in the synthesis zzso an zzso motif in the synthesis domain of zzso protein is zzso by an zzso motif in that of the zzso zzso Here, we show that these motifs also determine zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulation of zzso activities at the zzso region through the zzso zzso Most importantly, a zzso zzso zzso carrying an zzso zzso a novel zzso reaction, resulting in the synthesis of zzso by an independent zzso of the zzso bond of zzso or zzso Further experiments with zzso from zzso coli wherein zzso is naturally present also revealed the presence of zzso albeit at low zzso This work brings out the biological significance of zzso motif conservation in zzso proteins and reveals an additional zzso activity for the zzso zzso prompting an extensive investigation for the possible existence and role of zzso in the biological zzso
