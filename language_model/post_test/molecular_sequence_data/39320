To further our understanding of the structure and function of zzso zzso zzso we developed and characterized a library of zzso zzso zzso directed against this zzso One of these zzso zzso which is specific for the zzso domain, was found to inhibit zzso IN processing activity in zzso a corresponding zzso zzso was able to inhibit zzso integration in zzso Our subsequent studies, using zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso identified six zzso accessible zzso on the surface of the zzso domain that were immobilized upon binding of the zzso which were proposed to comprise the zzso Here we test this hypothesis by measuring the affinity of zzso to zzso proteins that contain Ala zzso in each of these zzso To gain additional insight into the mode of zzso we also measured the DNA binding capacity and zzso activities of the Ala zzso zzso 

We found that Ala substitution of any one of five of the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused a decrease in the affinity of the zzso for zzso zzso confirming the prediction from zzso zzso Although IN derivatives with Ala zzso in or near the zzso zzso exhibited decreased zzso activity, none of the zzso zzso compromised DNA binding to full length zzso zzso as measured by surface zzso resonance zzso Two of these zzso IN zzso and IN zzso exhibited both increased DNA binding affinity and zzso zzso zzso these proteins also exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso from these investigations are discussed in the context of current models for how the zzso domain interacts with zzso zzso 

It is unlikely that zzso of zzso IN activity by zzso is caused by direct interaction with zzso that are essential for zzso zzso Rather our findings are most consistent with a model zzso zzso binding zzso or zzso the structure of the zzso domain and/or blocks zzso binding zzso The DNA binding properties and zzso zzso activity of the zzso derivatives suggest that the zzso domain of IN normally plays an important role in aligning the viral DNA end for proper zzso
