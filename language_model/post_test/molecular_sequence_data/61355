zzso of zzso zzso zzso motif zzso zzso complexes on a variety of cells leads to their zzso through the sequential triggering of protein zzso zzso Recently, zzso has been identified as an zzso signaling zzso that is zzso associated with zzso zzso of zzso class I receptors on natural killer zzso In addition to natural killer cells, zzso is expressed in peripheral blood zzso zzso and zzso cells, suggesting association with other receptors present in these cell zzso In the present study, we report the molecular cloning of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso membrane zzso expressed exclusively in zzso and zzso zzso is a type II zzso protein belonging to the C type zzso zzso and contains a charged zzso in the zzso region that enables it to pair with zzso zzso of zzso complexes in zzso mouse zzso cells resulted in calcium zzso These findings suggest that signaling via zzso complexes may constitute a significant zzso zzso in zzso zzso
