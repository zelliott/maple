A method for the simultaneous determination of the ratios of the three aromatic zzso zzso in peptides was set up in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso acids were prepared, and zzso and zzso zzso then calculated from their zzso zzso resolution zzso between 240 and 320 zzso Certain spectral bands were chosen to differentiate zzso from zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso Variation of the zzso of the chosen bands was shown to be a linear function of the ratio of the aromatic zzso acids in the zzso This technique was validated with peptides whose sequence was zzso The difference between theoretical and zzso determined ratios was lower than zzso Since the results are obtained as ratios, neither the concentration nor the nature of the zzso has to be zzso The feasibility of application using a zzso array detector with high resolution in zzso zzso liquid zzso is zzso
