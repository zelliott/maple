zzso zzso is often isolated from zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso soil as zzso of zzso In model systems, zzso shows attachment to the zzso zzso source, which is considered to be a particular adaptation to low zzso as it results into increased zzso flux to the zzso To examine whether zzso zzso in real zzso soils, in zzso with model systems, are zzso associated with zzso soil zzso the distribution of zzso of the zzso capacity and of zzso over different zzso of a soil with an aged zzso contamination was zzso The clay fraction contained the majority of the zzso and showed immediate zzso and zzso activity upon addition of zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, the sand and zzso zzso showed a lag time of zzso h for zzso and 3-6 days for zzso zzso The maximum zzso and zzso zzso rates of the clay fraction expressed per gram fraction were three to six times higher than those of the sand and zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction demonstrated that zzso represented about zzso of the zzso in the clay zzso while this was only about zzso in the sand and zzso zzso indicating zzso of zzso in the zzso clay zzso The zzso community composition in the clay fraction represented all dominant zzso populations of the bulk soil and included especially species related to zzso zzso which was also recovered as one of the dominant species in the zzso communities of the bulk soil and the clay zzso Moreover, zzso could be identified among the major zzso zzso populations in both the bulk soil and the clay zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso are mainly associated with the zzso clay fraction of the examined zzso soil and zzso that also in the environmental setting of a zzso soil, zzso might experience advantages connected to zzso source zzso
