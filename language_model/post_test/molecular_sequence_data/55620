The zzso zzso of zzso virus WR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1983) has been mapped by marker rescue to the zzso open reading frame located within the zzso zzso I DNA zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso growth was attributed to an zzso acid zzso zzso in the predicted zzso zzso A normal zzso pattern of viral protein synthesis was zzso in cells infected with zzso at the zzso temperature (40 degrees zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso in zzso assembly at 40 degrees zzso zzso was arrested at a stage subsequent to formation of zzso immature zzso Western zzso analysis with zzso directed against the zzso zzso demonstrated an zzso zzso zzso accumulating during the late phase of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso of extracts of zzso zzso showed that the zzso protein is zzso within the virus zzso The zzso zzso displays zzso acid sequence similarity to the type II DNA zzso of zzso zzso
