In zzso zzso containing fragments of the zzso disease protein zzso zzso the zzso 17 zzso acid zzso segment serves as the core of zzso zzso whose zzso assembly locally concentrates the zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso zzso A variety of zzso zzso have been described that achieve their effects by zzso this concentrating function of the zzso zzso In this paper we characterize the nature and limits of this zzso for three means of suppressing zzso zzso We show that the previously described action of zzso zzso zzso is solely due to their ability to suppress the zzso zzso zzso That is, under zzso zzso nucleation of zzso zzso formation by a previously described alternative nucleation mechanism proceeds unabated and zzso dominates the zzso zzso zzso of the bulk of the zzso segment by zzso or zzso also blocks the zzso pathway, allowing the alternative nucleation zzso to zzso In contrast, the previously described zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively blocks both zzso zzso leading to stable zzso of zzso zzso These data show that the zzso and zzso pathways of zzso nucleation in zzso zzso fragments are in direct kinetic zzso The results illustrate how zzso zzso depends on assembly mechanism and zzso and have implications for how the zzso environment can influence zzso zzso
