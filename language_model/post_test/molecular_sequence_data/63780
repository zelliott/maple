zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in zzso cell lung cancer zzso and have also been clinically correlated with patient sensitivity to targeted zzso zzso 

To describe a technique for determining zzso zzso status on archival fine needle zzso zzso specimens from advanced zzso zzso 

Eleven archival zzso slides from patients with advanced zzso were examined for diagnostic material to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso status was determined using a zzso DNA extraction protocol of selected zzso cell regions on the zzso zzso followed by real time zzso and high resolution melt analysis zzso of zzso zzso 18, 19, 20, and 21, followed by sequence zzso 

All DNA samples were successfully amplified by zzso Three zzso patient samples contained zzso zzso in zzso 19 zzso One of the three had an additional zzso 19 zzso zzso 

zzso zzso slides from patients with zzso can be used to determine zzso zzso status by zzso zzso and zzso The ability to use archival zzso slides greatly increases the potential material available for molecular analysis in diagnosis and selection of patients for targeted therapeutic zzso
