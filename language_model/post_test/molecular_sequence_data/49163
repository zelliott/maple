The structure of the zzso sensor and the detailed physical basis of zzso zzso in zzso channels have not been zzso We now have identified zzso molecular zzso underlying two major zzso zzso changes during zzso of divergent zzso channels, zzso zzso and zzso Two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sensor move zzso into an zzso gating pocket, where they interact with an zzso zzso in zzso In zzso these transitions are modulated by a zzso zzso that binds in the gating zzso Conservation of key molecular details in the zzso mechanism confirms that zzso sensors in divergent zzso channels share a common zzso zzso modeling reveals that structural constraints derived from zzso and Shaker specify the unique packing arrangement of zzso segments zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso zzso
