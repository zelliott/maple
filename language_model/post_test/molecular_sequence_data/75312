The zzso and zzso zzso zzso have very similar three-dimensional structures but can be distinguished by various zzso zzso The primary structures of six zzso and three zzso zzso zzso are zzso Analysis of the aligned zzso acid sequences of these zzso taken together with structural data from X-ray zzso studies demonstrates that the two classes of zzso can be distinguished on the basis of a small number of zzso zzso that are positioned in and close to the active site of the zzso
