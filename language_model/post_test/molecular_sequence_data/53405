zzso is the scaffold of a protein complex, disrupted in inherited muscular zzso At the last 3' zzso of the zzso a protein domain is zzso where zzso are tightly zzso These are a family of zzso peripheral membrane zzso Three genes have been described zzso one zzso zzso and two basic zzso and zzso proteins of approximately zzso zzso Here, we describe the characterization of two novel putative members of the zzso family, named zzso and zzso The human zzso gene is composed of 19 zzso and encodes a zzso protein of 517 zzso zzso The human zzso gene is composed of at least 17 zzso and its transcript is expressed in brain and, to a lesser degree, in other zzso We mapped the zzso gene to human zzso zzso and the zzso gene to zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments and pull-down studies showed that both proteins can bind the zzso region of zzso and related zzso We raised zzso against these proteins and recognized expression in both rat and human central zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso of adjacent zzso Our present findings suggest a differentiated role of a modified zzso complex in the central nervous zzso
