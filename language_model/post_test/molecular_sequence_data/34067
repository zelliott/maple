zzso zzso zzso are renowned for their prolific use of zzso These organisms spin silk to construct elaborate networks of tubes in which they live, zzso and zzso The silken galleries are essential for protecting these zzso insects from predators and other environmental zzso Despite the ecological importance of zzso silk, very little is known about its constituent zzso Here, we characterize the silk protein zzso from four zzso species to better understand the function and evolution of these zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso are highly repetitive in sequence and possess several zzso zzso despite differences in habitat preferences across zzso The most striking similarities are in the zzso usage biases of the zzso zzso particularly in the repetitive regions, as well as sequence conservation of the zzso regions of the zzso Based on analyses of the silk zzso we propose hypotheses regarding zzso bias and its effect on the translation and replication of these unusual zzso Furthermore, we discuss the significance of specific zzso motifs to the mechanical and structural characteristics of silk zzso Lastly, we report that the conservation of zzso zzso zzso regions suggests that fiber formation may occur through a mechanism analogous to that found in zzso From these results, insight is gained into the tempo and mode of evolution that has shaped zzso zzso
