When zzso is used as a zzso managing an acceptable zzso throughout the water distribution systems particularly once zzso has set in is zzso Managing zzso zzso prior to the onset of zzso through effective control strategies is important and zzso the strategies developed around zzso has been zzso This study aimed at developing a more holistic knowledge on how zzso zzso and zzso zzso impact microbial communities in zzso zzso Five zzso zzso zzso in series) were operated to simulate a zzso zzso distribution zzso Culture independent techniques zzso and zzso were used to zzso and zzso the mixed microbial communities in zzso maintaining a residual of high to low zzso zzso The study for the first time associates zzso zzso and zzso zzso to different microbial zzso zzso classes zzso zzso zzso and zzso dominated at low zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso dominated at higher zzso zzso Prior to the onset of zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be dominant and zzso in particular increased with the onset of zzso zzso zzso zzso and two other novel zzso bacteria were detected once the zzso zzso had dropped below zzso zzso zzso zzso alone failed to explain zzso zzso rates observed in these zzso The finding of this study is expected to zzso the focus from zzso to zzso bacteria, which the authors believe could hold the key towards developing a control strategy that would enable better management of zzso zzso
