Four zzso cell clones with zzso zzso chains were recovered from individual leaky zzso mice by transformation of bone zzso or zzso cells with zzso zzso leukemia zzso Three clones were derived from independent bone zzso cell zzso These express the defective zzso zzso activity and contain truncated zzso chains resulting from abnormal and/or incomplete zzso to J only) gene zzso A fourth clone was obtained from a zzso cell culture and may represent a zzso It expresses a zzso activity indistinguishable from that of zzso zzso one of its rearranged zzso zzso zzso encodes a normal size zzso chain, the other is zzso rearranged zzso
