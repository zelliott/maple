The zzso is a zzso database of protein families for proteins that function in the eye and their zzso zzso The resource clusters proteins at different levels of zzso in order to facilitate functional zzso of sequences and zzso of proteins from structural zzso Eye proteins are organized into the tissue types in which they function and are clustered into zzso families using a novel protocol employing the zzso zzso zzso families are further subdivided into sequence clusters for which multiple sequence alignments are zzso zzso zzso from the zzso domain database are provided for nearly zzso of the zzso and protein family zzso from the zzso database for approximately zzso zzso models have also been generated where zzso The zzso is stored in a zzso database and is extensively linked to other online zzso resources to help relate zzso zzso zzso and clinical details to the derived data in the zzso The zzso is available for online search, sequence information and model retrieval at zzso
