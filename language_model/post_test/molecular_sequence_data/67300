zzso Head zzso zzso is one of the most damaging diseases of sunflower in Europe, Argentina, and USA, causing average yield reductions of 10 to zzso but leading to total production loss under favorable environmental conditions for the zzso Association zzso zzso is a promising choice for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as it detects relationships between zzso variation and gene zzso in existing zzso without development of mapping zzso This article reports the identification of zzso for resistance to zzso based on candidate gene zzso 

A collection of 94 sunflower zzso lines were tested for zzso under field conditions using assisted zzso with the zzso pathogen zzso zzso Given that no biological mechanisms or zzso pathways have been clearly identified for zzso 43 candidate genes were selected based on previous transcript profiling studies in sunflower and zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 16 candidate genes were tested using Mixed Linear Models zzso that account for population structure and kinship zzso This approach allowed detection of a significant association between the candidate gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso accounting for a zzso zzso reduction of about zzso 

These results suggest that AM will be useful in zzso other complex traits in zzso thus providing a valuable tool to assist in crop zzso
