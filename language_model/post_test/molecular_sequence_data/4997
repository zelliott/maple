For proteins in solution the zzso of certain zzso parameters can be zzso by a combination of zzso zzso simulations and zzso zzso Using the laser zzso zzso induced dynamic nuclear zzso technique as a measure for surface accessibility of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of bovine zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are readily zzso with the zzso data for these two zzso The results zzso the role of zzso for zzso binding in bovine zzso zzso and of zzso in zzso zzso This feature derived from the crystal structure of bovine zzso is maintained in solution for the zzso human zzso two avian zzso and the zzso zzso zzso as the zzso corroborate the zzso spatial parameters of the four calculated models for zzso zzso In zzso zzso are constituents of the extended combining pocket, which can be zzso in solution by zzso zzso zzso between results from zzso and zzso zzso concern primarily the lack of zzso of zzso zzso for human and avian zzso zzso and of zzso of the plant zzso zzso zzso of zzso is assumed to provide information on the role of a certain zzso for functional zzso When zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso simulations, the apparent surface zzso even of zzso separated zzso acid side chains could zzso be zzso This conclusion is supported by the assessment of the zzso for the zzso zzso On the basis of these zzso zzso of the zzso architecture of the zzso indicates the occurrence of notable zzso in the orientation of zzso zzso zzso The implied potential effect of zzso zzso on zzso features of a protein will deserve attention for the interpretation of studies comparing zzso and zzso zzso
