zzso are key regulators of the cell cycle in all zzso In zzso we have previously isolated three zzso zzso The closely related zzso and zzso genes are expressed primarily during the zzso and M zzso and are most likely zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene is induced in the zzso transition, when cells zzso the cell zzso By zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells, a novel alfalfa zzso designated zzso was zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene is most similar to that of the zzso zzso delta 3 zzso zzso and zzso delta 3 belong to the class of zzso zzso and contain zzso regions and a zzso binding zzso When comparing expression levels in different zzso zzso transcripts were present predominantly in zzso Whereas expression of the zzso gene was cell zzso in zzso cells, zzso in roots was observed to depend also on the zzso context of the zzso When differentiated zzso leaf cells were induced to resume cell division by treatment with plant hormones, zzso zzso was induced before the onset of DNA zzso Whereas this induction was preceded by that of the zzso zzso zzso expression occurred later and at the same time as zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso plays a role in the zzso transition and provide a model to investigate the plant cell cycle at the molecular zzso
