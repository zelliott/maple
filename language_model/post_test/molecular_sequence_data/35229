In multiple zzso there has been little progress in the specific therapeutic targeting of zzso zzso zzso sequencing data have recently revealed that a subset of patients carry an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso To uncover the clinical relevance of this zzso in multiple zzso we correlated the zzso status in primary tumor samples from zzso patients with myeloma with disease zzso We found a significantly higher zzso of zzso disease and a shorter overall survival in zzso carriers when compared with zzso Most importantly, we report on a patient with confirmed zzso zzso zzso and relapsed myeloma with extensive zzso disease, zzso to all approved therapeutic options, who has rapidly and zzso responded to low doses of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso we provide evidence for the development of the zzso zzso zzso in the context of zzso evolution and describe the zzso and therapeutic relevance of this zzso zzso
