zzso of zzso zzso to zzso coli zzso and an zzso zzso based on the zzso stem and zzso of zzso was investigated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso labeled with zzso by incorporation of zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso into the zzso stem of the zzso More than one zzso zzso binding site is found in the zzso zzso the strongest between base pairs zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso exists in solution as a 12 zzso stem and a zzso zzso zzso zzso no longer zzso between base pairs corresponding to the zzso zzso stem in this zzso Instead, it zzso between base pairs at the bottom of the long zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso has a preferred zzso site close to the base of an zzso zzso zzso
