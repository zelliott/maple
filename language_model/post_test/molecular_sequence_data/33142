DNA zzso is a vital zzso mark that zzso in establishing and maintaining zzso structures and regulates gene zzso during zzso development and cellular zzso zzso in zzso patterns between individuals may contribute to zzso variation and disease zzso however, little is known about the extent of such variation or how different zzso patterns are zzso Here we have compared DNA zzso profiles of zzso from two zzso mouse strains zzso and zzso at 181 large zzso intervals that were selected based on differential gene expression zzso Using a DNA zzso zzso approach based on a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we identified several hundred zzso zzso regions, and simultaneously uncovered previously zzso genetic zzso between both mouse strains at the studied zzso DNA sequence and zzso differences were validated by DNA sequencing and mass zzso analysis of zzso DNA for a subset of zzso zzso we show that in F1 hybrids, the majority of zzso zzso patterns in zzso cells were maintained on the parental zzso regardless of their status in the male germ zzso The common association of zzso zzso regions with sequence zzso suggests that the zzso context determines the zzso regulated zzso status at most zzso regions of zzso zzso
