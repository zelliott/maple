zzso zzso disease zzso is characterized by the failure of activated zzso to generate zzso zzso in at least four different genes lead to zzso Patients with the zzso form of zzso have zzso in the gene for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Patients with a rare zzso zzso form of zzso have zzso in the gene for the zzso of this zzso zzso Usually, this leads to the absence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We studied the molecular zzso in five European patients from three unrelated families with this type of zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the coding region was amplified by zzso in one zzso and zzso Three patients from one family, with parents that were first cousins, were zzso for a single base substitution zzso resulting in a zzso zzso acid change zzso This zzso was previously found in a compound zzso zzso zzso zzso Another patient, also from zzso parents, was zzso for an zzso zzso in the open reading frame that predicts a zzso zzso acid replacement zzso The fifth patient was also born from a zzso marriage and was shown to be zzso for the absence of zzso 4 from the zzso In this patient, a zzso substitution was found at position 1 of zzso 4 in the zzso zzso zzso the absence of zzso 4 in the zzso of this patient is due to a zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
