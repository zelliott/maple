zzso factor zzso was first identified in zzso cells, but was later shown to also be expressed in zzso cells of the mouse zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso from a different first zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso To begin to address the question of how expression of zzso might be zzso regulated in zzso and zzso cells, we have cloned and determined the structure of the IT promoters of both the rat and mouse zzso zzso The zzso regulatory zzso controlling the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso was investigated by zzso of zzso and zzso reporter zzso with and without zzso zzso factor expression zzso into either zzso or zzso cell zzso Two zzso binding sites in the IT promoter were found to be required for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso reporter gene expression was activated only after zzso with zzso zzso that zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso might be at least partially zzso through these zzso regulatory zzso We also found that the zzso zzso gene was silent in primary culture and two different zzso cell lines, and that the repression of zzso zzso reporter genes could not be relieved by forced expression of zzso in zzso zzso Thus the zzso promoter may be under the control of a regulatory network in zzso cells which involves both positive and negative regulation of transcription, and zzso zzso motifs found in the IT promoter may be required for zzso these zzso
