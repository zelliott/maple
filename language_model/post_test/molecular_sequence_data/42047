zzso zzso was used to detect transcripts induced both by zzso and by zzso infection in tomato zzso A zzso clone zzso a putative zzso was isolated and zzso DNA sequencing revealed high zzso with a zzso from zzso Northern zzso analysis showed specific induction of this zzso gene in zzso zzso An increase in the level of zzso zzso is obtained by zzso treatment, reinforcing the idea that zzso is a zzso in the response of tomato plants to zzso zzso
