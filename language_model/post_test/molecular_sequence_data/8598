In rat zzso leukemia cells zzso zzso of the high affinity zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso We carried out solid phase synthesis of 15 zzso acid long zzso corresponding to the sequences around each of the 19 zzso zzso in zzso zzso Only three zzso corresponding to zzso 52, zzso and zzso were zzso when exposed to zzso zzso Single zzso in each of these three zzso zzso of zzso delta were zzso Upon expression in the zzso cells, only the zzso in zzso 52 showed abolition of the zzso induced zzso zzso
