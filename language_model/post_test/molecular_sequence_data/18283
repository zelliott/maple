An effective method for the artificial attachment of zzso anchors to zzso proteins has been zzso zzso molecules are modified by a zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso in a zzso zzso The resulting fatty zzso proteins are able to zzso across zzso zzso and penetrate intact zzso This makes possible the transport of modified zzso zzso across the zzso barrier into the brain and hence virus suppression in infected zzso The effect is illustrated by the marked zzso increase in biological activity of zzso zzso zzso A after fatty zzso These phenomena are discussed in relation to in zzso data indicating that the zzso modification of proteins by fatty acids and zzso is very common in nature, and that the zzso modification of proteins may be a step in protein transport in zzso
