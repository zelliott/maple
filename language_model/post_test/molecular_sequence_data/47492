All zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zinc zzso and at least two zinc atoms are present per zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zinc binding and the functional role of zinc zzso in the zzso mechanism or zzso structure are zzso Here, we locate four zzso zzso in the zzso coli zzso largest zzso zzso that coordinate one of the two zinc zzso tightly associated with the zzso In the absence of zzso or when zinc binding is prevented by zzso the in zzso zzso retains the proper zzso zzso but is not zzso We demonstrate that zinc acts as a molecular zzso converting zzso zzso into a compact zzso that zzso associates with other zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zinc are zzso throughout zzso and zzso but are absent from zzso from zzso and zzso Thus, the involvement of zinc in the zzso assembly may be a unique feature of zzso zzso
