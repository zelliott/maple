The possibilities of characterizing the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso by liquid zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso with zzso mass zzso zzso were zzso The B zzso from zzso zzso coli zzso in zzso zzso can be detected by zzso expressed in zzso zzso and the charge envelope signals can be zzso zzso and zzso analysis allowed the acquisition of zzso toxin zzso B zzso molecular weight and preliminary structural characterization of zzso zzso zzso analysis after reduction and zzso of the protein evidenced the presence of one zzso bond in the structure of the zzso zzso analysis was carried out by detection of most of the zzso fragments of the B zzso by zzso obtaining total coverage of the protein zzso zzso zzso in the toxin can mostly be determined by sequencing, where an increase of molecular mass in the zzso side of the protein was zzso This modification may be due to an zzso
