zzso is known to exhibit a jerky zzso as zzso zzso motion, on zzso zzso time zzso is punctuated by zzso structural zzso on much longer time zzso zzso from zzso zzso up to a few minutes or even zzso These rare zzso events zzso to the formation or zzso of entire stems through cooperative base zzso zzso Such a clear separation of time scales in zzso dynamics has made it possible to implement coarse zzso zzso simulations, which predict zzso folding and unfolding pathways including zzso trapped structures on biologically relevant time scales of seconds to zzso zzso folding simulations also enable to predict the formation of zzso that is, zzso interior to zzso which mechanically restrain the relative zzso of other zzso zzso But beyond zzso structural constraints, zzso can also strongly affect the folding and unfolding dynamics of zzso as the order by which successive zzso are formed and zzso can lead to zzso blocked transition zzso The resulting zzso dynamics can enhance the stability of zzso zzso improve the efficacy of zzso folding pathways and lead to unusual zzso properties of zzso
