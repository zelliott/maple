zzso DNA control region sequences were analyzed from 162 wolves at 27 localities worldwide and from 140 domestic dogs representing 67 zzso zzso from both dogs and wolves showed considerable diversity and supported the hypothesis that wolves were the ancestors of zzso Most dog sequences belonged to a divergent zzso zzso sharing no sequences with zzso The sequence divergence within this zzso suggested that dogs originated more than 100,000 years before the zzso zzso of dog zzso with other wolf lineages indicated episodes of zzso between wolves and zzso zzso genetic exchange between dog and wolf populations may have been an important source of variation for artificial zzso
