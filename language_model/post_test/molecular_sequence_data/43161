In the process of zzso cloning a candidate gene responsible for zzso zzso zzso we constructed a zzso transcript map of the region of human zzso zzso that lies zzso zzso zzso to zzso A combination of three zzso techniques, direct zzso selection, zzso zzso and sample sequencing, were used initially for a zzso screening of the zzso region for expressed sequence zzso As genetic analysis further narrowed the zzso candidate zzso we zzso completely zzso zzso of zzso DNA as a final measure to identify all zzso Besides the novel zzso class zzso zzso candidate gene zzso we identified a family of five zzso zzso two genes with structural similarity to a type 1 sodium zzso zzso 12 novel zzso zzso and a gene we named zzso based on its strong similarity to the zzso zzso lupus and zzso syndrome zzso and the zzso finger zzso Several members of the zzso family and the zzso gene share an zzso of common evolutionary origin called zzso The zzso zzso was originally isolated from the zzso class 1 region, yet has apparently zzso into several genes along the zzso zzso to the zzso The conservation of the zzso zzso in several novel genes and the previously described zzso acid zzso of zzso to zzso class 1 molecules provide further support that this zzso region of zzso is related to the zzso Finally, we performed an analysis of the four approaches for gene finding and conclude that direct selection provides the most effective zzso for zzso zzso and that as much as zzso of zzso in this zzso region may be derived from zzso zzso zzso
