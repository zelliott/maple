zzso K is a highly potent zzso in zzso and is responsible for bone zzso We have previously demonstrated that its unique zzso activity is modulated by zzso that form high molecular weight complexes with the zzso However, zzso analysis of a specific zzso K binding site only led to a zzso reduction of the zzso activity suggesting additional zzso binding sites or other zzso controlling this zzso We identified eight zzso K specific zzso zzso that form three positively charged clusters at the bottom part of the zzso opposing the active zzso These zzso are highly zzso among zzso zzso and zzso zzso K zzso and to a lesser degree in zzso and fish zzso zzso analysis of these zzso revealed an approximately 50% reduction of the zzso activity when the basic zzso acids in cluster 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso into zzso zzso and resulted in a zzso loss of this activity when the zzso were expanded into cluster 3 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso had no zzso A partial rescue effect was observed when the zzso zzso was combined with three zzso in the previously identified zzso binding site zzso zzso zzso indicating the relevance of at least two independent interaction zzso zzso acid zzso in all sites had no effect on the zzso efficacy of the zzso zzso as reflected in their zzso zzso and zzso activities and their overall protein zzso This study suggests that the basic zzso acid clusters in zzso K are involved in alternative zzso binding sites, play other roles in the formation of zzso active zzso complexes, or contribute in a yet unknown manner to the specific binding to zzso
