zzso of the zzso of the human zzso virus zzso zzso during zzso assembly is zzso by interactions between the zzso zzso zzso of assembling zzso zzso and a approximately 110 zzso segment of the zzso known as the zzso The zzso zzso contains four zzso zzso through zzso all of which are important for zzso zzso Recent zzso zzso zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that zzso and zzso are capable of binding NC with high affinity zzso approximately 140 zzso consistent with proposals for zzso functions during zzso To determine if zzso may have a similar function, zzso studies were conducted by zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to previous reports, we find that zzso binds zzso to NC zzso zzso suggesting an alternative zzso zzso studies indicate that the zzso zzso of zzso adopts a classical zzso fold zzso zzso C, A or U), a motif that zzso zzso zzso structures in other zzso In combination with previously reported gel mobility studies of zzso deletion zzso these findings suggest that zzso functions in zzso recognition not by binding to zzso but by stabilizing the structure of the zzso zzso in the affinities of NC for zzso zzso and zzso zzso can now be rationalized in terms of the different structural properties of stem zzso that contain zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso
