zzso is one of the strongest selective pressures in recent human zzso African populations have been and continue to be at risk for zzso zzso However, few studies have zzso malaria zzso zzso across geographically and genetically diverse groups in zzso We examined zzso diversity at zzso zzso zzso zzso a malaria zzso candidate zzso in a number of human populations with a specific focus on diverse African ethnic zzso We used tests of neutrality to assess whether natural selection has impacted this locus and tested whether zzso variation at zzso is correlated with malaria zzso We observe differing patterns of zzso and zzso variation in global populations and higher levels of diversity in zzso Although we do not observe a zzso from neutrality based on the zzso frequency distribution, we do observe several zzso at zzso including the zzso zzso zzso that are correlated with malaria zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso which is common in Africa and Asia, exists on distinct zzso backgrounds and is likely to have arisen more recently in zzso Our results suggest that correlation analyses of zzso zzso and malaria zzso may be useful for identifying candidate functional zzso that play a role in malaria resistance and zzso
