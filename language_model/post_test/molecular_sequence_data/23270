The zzso zzso zzso are rapidly evolving proteins found in zzso clusters that are unique to each zzso zzso Of the 15 independent genes in the zzso zzso zzso only zzso 1 and 2 are expressed at significant levels at zzso Here we characterize the expression of zzso 6 in the liver and zzso in mice in response to infection with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso 6 is not directly related to the elevated levels of serum zzso or tissue zzso characteristic of this disease, as no zzso 6 transcripts were detected in the liver or the zzso from zzso zzso zzso The coding sequence of zzso 6 has zzso under positive selection pressure zzso zzso zzso and has a unique zzso zzso near the zzso of the zzso The high zzso efficiency of zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar to that of the zzso closest human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso we have identified zzso 6 as one of only two zzso A zzso zzso known to be expressed specifically in response to zzso stress in zzso
