zzso embryonic stem cells, embryonic zzso cells and zzso zzso were found to be extremely sensitive to zzso by normal human serum as compared to matured zzso The zzso activity to embryonic cells was not removed by zzso of serum with zzso zzso zzso which block both complement zzso pathways or, zzso the alternative zzso completely zzso the activity of human serum against embryonic cells whereas the activity was retained under conditions which block the classical complement pathway, indicating that embryonic cells activate the alternative complement system zzso The zzso effect to zzso embryonic cells was reproduced using zzso zzso zzso zzso the mechanism of zzso the expression of regulators of complement zzso and of membrane bound zzso acid was zzso zzso cells express zzso for zzso similarly to other cells but additionally express zzso not found in most adult zzso zzso cells have zzso low levels of zzso zzso acid compared to adult zzso
