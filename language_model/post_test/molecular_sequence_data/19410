zzso DNA zzso initiate repair of zzso and zzso zzso bases in zzso We demonstrate by comparative zzso that zzso zzso zzso belongs to a new, zzso structural zzso of DNA zzso with an zzso zzso fold zzso six zzso zzso The structure reveals a zzso positively charged groove, including a putative base recognition zzso This groove appears to be suitable for the accommodation of zzso DNA with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the recognition pocket identified several zzso essential for zzso zzso The results suggest that the aromatic side chain of a zzso zzso recognizes zzso zzso bases through stacking zzso while an interacting zzso pair is essential for removal of the damaged zzso A structural model of zzso bound to DNA with a zzso zzso zzso gives insight into the zzso machinery for this new class of DNA zzso
