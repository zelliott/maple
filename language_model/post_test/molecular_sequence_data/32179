zzso zzso C is a major cause of liver zzso leading to chronic liver failure and zzso zzso Different zzso C virus zzso proteins have been associated with resistance to zzso zzso However, the exact mechanisms of zzso zzso resistance are not completely zzso The importance of zzso acid zzso variations within the zzso zzso zzso protein for replication efficiency and viral decline during the therapy is zzso We investigated zzso zzso from 42 patients with known outcome to zzso zzso The complete zzso gene was amplified and zzso zzso analyses of predicted zzso functional, structural and zzso properties of the deduced zzso sequences were zzso The complete zzso protein was highly zzso with a median frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso exchanges zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Especially within the predicted zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the mean number of zzso variations was low zzso frequency, zzso zzso zzso Neither the number of zzso variations nor specific zzso exchanges were correlated with zzso zzso serum concentration at zzso A rapid initial zzso zzso decline of zzso zzso zzso at week 2 of zzso therapy was associated with a higher frequency of zzso zzso exchanges within the complete zzso protein in comparison with patients with a zzso zzso zzso decline zzso frequency, zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Overall, the zzso sequence of the zzso protein was highly zzso indicating an important role for replication in zzso zzso acid variations with relevant changes of zzso properties may influence replication efficiency, associated with a rapid early zzso zzso
