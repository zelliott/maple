The widespread use of the zzso zzso zzso system to generate zzso exploits the preference of zzso zzso to insert into zzso zzso However, little is known about the specificity of zzso insertions within zzso Analysis of 79 independently isolated zzso zzso at the zzso locus established that at least 75 contain zzso zzso Analysis of the terminal zzso repeats zzso of the inserted zzso defined three new zzso zzso zzso zzso 11, and zzso A large percentage zzso of the insertions are located in the zzso untranslated region zzso of the zzso zzso Ten positions within the zzso zzso experienced multiple independent zzso zzso zzso of the zzso composition of the zzso zzso and the sequences directly zzso the zzso reveals that the zzso composition of zzso zzso sites differs dramatically from that of random zzso In particular, the zzso at which zzso and zzso are observed at positions zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso are substantially higher than zzso zzso sites of 315 zzso insertions displayed the same zzso zzso composition observed for the zzso zzso zzso this study provides strong evidence for the involvement of sequences zzso the zzso in zzso zzso zzso
