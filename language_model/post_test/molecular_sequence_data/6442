zzso administration of zzso hormone zzso increases zzso gene expression in rat liver by enhancing zzso zzso but reduces zzso zzso synthesis to 50% of zzso To gain insight into the inverse relation of zzso maturation and zzso zzso we measured zzso in zzso of control and zzso rats zzso zzso g body weight for 7 zzso by nuclear zzso zzso using overlapping zzso zzso zzso encompassing the zzso zzso In control rats, after zzso for zzso efficiency and probe zzso the zzso signals with zzso 3 zzso were reduced to zzso of those obtained with zzso 1 to zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating zzso arrest or pausing close to the zzso zzso 3 border or 450 to 650 zzso downstream of the zzso start zzso In zzso rats, the zzso block was nearly twice as effective, while the rate of zzso initiation was similar to zzso In contrast, the distribution of nascent transcripts across the zzso gene was zzso and zzso suppressed zzso zzso synthesis by processes operating in the zzso region such as zzso zzso Thus, conditional transcript zzso contributes to the regulation of zzso gene expression in rat zzso
