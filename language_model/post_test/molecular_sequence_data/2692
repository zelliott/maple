zzso zzso is a key zzso in photosynthesis in some plants that exploit the C4 zzso zzso for the fixation of zzso We cloned the gene for this zzso from zzso zzso libraries and analyzed its complete primary zzso The sequence of the cloned gene spans zzso zzso and consists of 10 zzso and 9 zzso The site of initiation of zzso is located 84 zzso upstream from the first zzso of the initiation zzso zzso zzso as determined by the method of zzso zzso The analysis suggests that there is another initiation site located at position zzso The zzso region of the gene lacks typical zzso and zzso elements in the anticipated regions, but there is a zzso sequence zzso around the zzso regions as well as sequence zzso to the zzso zzso site zzso Six long, direct repeated sequences and a zzso element are also present in the zzso zzso The results of Southern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso gene exists as a small zzso family, but the zzso that is expressed at high levels in green leaves and is involved in C4 photosynthesis is zzso by a zzso gene in the zzso zzso
