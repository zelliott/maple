zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are known to play important roles in maintaining the zzso of the zzso and in controlling zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to identify a factor or factors that would stimulate zzso cells to zzso 

To isolate such a factor, 100 L of zzso medium underwent zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The zzso activity of the factor was examined in a human zzso zzso cell line and human primary zzso zzso 

The different zzso processes isolated a zzso factor that had zzso cell zzso zzso This factor, which we have named zzso cell factor zzso promotes growth of zzso cells but not of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso The zzso sequence and molecular cloned zzso of zzso were identical with those of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso a family of zzso and zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso with zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells confirmed the zzso activity for zzso zzso The major component of the zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells had a molecular mass of 31 zzso and exerted zzso activity in zzso cells but not in human zzso cells and zzso in zzso zzso also had zzso zzso zzso The other family factor, zzso did not promote zzso cell zzso 

zzso is a novel zzso factor for zzso cells but not for zzso cells and zzso Its properties make it potentially beneficial for zzso therapy for the repair and maintenance of zzso zzso
