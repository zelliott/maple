zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was found to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene for this zzso from the zzso was cloned and zzso for the first zzso The structural gene contained a zzso open reading frame zzso 345 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso showed very low similarity to those of known zzso zzso with zzso zzso the loop regions were very short and the zzso acid usage in the parallel zzso core structure was considerably zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso properties of zzso were different from those of other zzso reported so zzso zzso was a very basic protein with an zzso point close to pH zzso and had optimal activity at zzso degrees C and at pH as high as zzso However, zzso appeared to have a similar core and active site zzso to the zzso of known structure from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the gene for zzso in zzso zzso resulted in high zzso zzso activity in the culture zzso zzso with the appearance of a main protein band on an zzso gel at 33 zzso
