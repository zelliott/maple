The zzso locus of zzso zzso consists of four open reading zzso The derived zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso exhibit zzso to zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso The functions of zzso and zzso remain zzso zzso contains multiple tandem repeats of the zzso DNA sequence zzso near the zzso zzso Two possible zzso starts zzso and zzso lie zzso We have used zzso zzso to investigate whether changes in the number of zzso repeats in conjunction with differential usage of the upstream frames control the expression of zzso zzso expression of zzso was observed for individual colonies and could be related to variable numbers of zzso zzso Of the three possible upstream zzso only one, containing the more downstream of the two possible zzso start zzso zzso is used for strong expression of zzso zzso of the more upstream zzso zzso or zzso was observed with zzso zzso while zzso of any of the three possible frames was observed when zzso was expressed at low to zzso levels, indicating that other mechanisms may affect zzso To investigate this, zzso was fused in frame with zzso of zzso with zzso deletion of the zzso zzso expression was still observed, supporting the view that an alternative level of control operates in conjunction with the repeat zzso
