At least two zzso zzso of zzso are expressed by rat brain zzso albeit in different membrane zzso There is at present only limited data available as to the spatial relationship of such zzso relative to the location of zzso and their functional zzso We have characterized the transport properties of zzso in a zzso expression system and conclude that its transport properties are similar to those of the originally described form of zzso namely zzso We demonstrate that zzso is localized to zzso zzso some of which are zzso between multiple zzso types, including zzso zzso whereas zzso is expressed by zzso zzso at sites not zzso between zzso Both zzso zzso can be expressed by a single zzso but such expression is not uniform over the surface of the zzso Neither zzso zzso of zzso is evident in brain zzso but both are abundantly expressed in some retinal zzso We conclude that zzso may not be involved in shaping the zzso of synaptic signaling in the brain, but may be critical in preventing zzso of zzso between adjacent zzso thereby regulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso may be crucial in ensuring that low levels of zzso are maintained at zzso locations, especially in pathological conditions such as zzso motor zzso disease, and zzso
