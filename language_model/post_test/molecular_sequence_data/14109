Variation in the DNA sequence and level of alcohol zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso have been studied to determine what types of DNA zzso contribute to zzso variation in natural zzso The zzso zzso like many others, shows a high level of zzso in both DNA sequence and quantitative level of zzso A number of zzso element insertions occur in the zzso region and one of these, a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region, is associated with unusually low zzso zzso To determine whether this zzso (called zzso causes the low expression level, the zzso was excised from the cloned zzso zzso gene and the effect was assessed by zzso zzso zzso of this zzso causes a zzso increase in the level of zzso clearly showing that it contributes to the naturally occurring variation in expression at this zzso zzso of all but one zzso also causes a zzso increase, indicating that the mechanism is not a simple sequence zzso Furthermore, this zzso zzso which is located between the two zzso promoters and their upstream zzso zzso has differential effects on the levels of zzso and zzso zzso Finally, a test for the possible zzso effects of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso on this zzso zzso was negative, in contrast to a previous report in the zzso
