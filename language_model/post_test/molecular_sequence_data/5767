zzso oxide zzso zzso in the snail zzso zzso was characterized by zzso and molecular biological techniques and localized by zzso zzso Central zzso contained particulate zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity zzso with zzso zzso The activity of zzso was dependent on zzso and zzso and was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso affinity zzso were separated by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and migrated at zzso 60, 40, and 30 zzso An zzso to zzso zzso exclusively labeled the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso protein revealed no sequence zzso with any known zzso zzso The zzso protein exhibited zzso and zzso zzso activity, which was partially inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso activity in discrete regions of the central and peripheral nervous zzso About zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso material detected by zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed the highest zzso activity in the nervous system, whereas moderate activity was present in muscle zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our study suggests the presence of zzso and a putative zzso protein in zzso nervous zzso
