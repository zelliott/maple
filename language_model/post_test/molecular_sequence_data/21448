zzso that recognized either zzso zzso or canine red blood cell zzso zzso zzso protein were detected in serum from acutely and chronically zzso zzso In those zzso zzso that reacted with zzso zzso zzso and canine heat shock protein 70 zzso and zzso were zzso therefore, zzso zzso and canine zzso zzso proteins seemed to be zzso and zzso zzso In infected dogs, the amounts of these zzso increased after zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso raised against zzso in two rabbits reacted not only with zzso but also with zzso and native zzso from canine zzso Because zzso showed high zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso might zzso with zzso Additionally, the zzso of both zzso and zzso were observed by indirect zzso zzso As a result, zzso was not found on the membrane surface of zzso suggesting that zzso would not be targets of zzso zzso Meanwhile, only zzso zzso were stained by zzso zzso This result showed that zzso would be expressed on the surface of zzso during the zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso was a highly zzso protein in canine zzso zzso infection, and that zzso zzso might be targets of zzso zzso
