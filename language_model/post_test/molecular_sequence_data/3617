zzso necrosis virus zzso proteins can package zzso from zzso related zzso leukemia virus zzso whereas zzso proteins cannot package zzso zzso zzso We used this zzso recognition to investigate regions of packaging signals that influence viral zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso and zzso packaging signals zzso and zzso zzso do not contain significant sequence zzso they both contain a pair of zzso This hairpin pair was previously proposed to be the core element in zzso zzso In the present study, zzso zzso were generated to contain zzso zzso packaging signals in which the zzso were replaced with the zzso zzso The interactions between these zzso and zzso or zzso proteins were examined by virus replication and zzso zzso zzso proteins recognized all of the zzso indicating that these zzso were zzso We found that replacing the hairpin pair did not drastically alter the ability of zzso proteins to package these zzso These results indicate that, despite the important role of the hairpin pair in zzso packaging, it is not the major motif responsible for the ability of zzso proteins to discriminate between the zzso and zzso packaging zzso To determine the role of sequences zzso the zzso in zzso packaging zzso zzso with swapped zzso regions were generated and zzso zzso proteins packaged all of these zzso zzso In contrast, zzso proteins strongly favored zzso with the zzso zzso zzso These data indicated that zzso zzso recognizes multiple elements in the viral packaging zzso including the hairpin structure and zzso zzso
