An zzso sequence zzso element of zzso zzso named zzso was isolated and its complete zzso sequence zzso zzso is zzso zzso in length and occurs zzso times in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso times in other zzso zzso Analysis of the junctions at the sites of zzso revealed a small target site zzso of four bases and zzso repeats of 17 zzso with one zzso zzso presents significant similarity zzso with zzso identified in zzso zzso suggesting a common ancestral zzso A long zzso of zzso zzso was identified zzso a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 26 zzso and sharing sequence identity with the hypothetical protein 1 of zzso zzso and with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is present in all zzso strains we have zzso zzso zzso length zzso of reference and field strains of two species zzso zzso and zzso zzso was studied using either zzso field gel zzso zzso on zzso DNA or zzso of zzso DNA using zzso as a zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 contains about 10 IS copies per zzso and field strains of the same species could not be distinguished either by IS zzso or by zzso zzso restriction zzso In contrast, the number of IS copies in the zzso zzso zzso is around 30 and the different field strains can be differentiated by both zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
