A growing number of pathogens are being found to possess specialized zzso systems which they use in various ways to zzso host zzso One class, called type IV, are defined as having zzso to the zzso transfer systems of naturally occurring zzso It has been proposed that pathogens with type IV zzso systems have acquired and adapted the zzso transfer systems of plasmids and now use them to export zzso Several zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain type IV systems which are known or suspected to be of critical importance in their ability to cause zzso Specifically, these systems are believed to be the key factors determining zzso fate, and thus the ability to replicate and cause zzso
