The zzso gene of zzso zzso was isolated as an zzso high copy zzso of zzso within the basic region of the zzso protein zzso The gene is essential for viability and encodes a zzso zzso zzso The first 300 zzso of the zzso protein exhibit significant sequence similarity to the zzso zzso II zzso factor zzso However, zzso is required for zzso zzso III zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso specific for zzso or zzso react with the zzso complex, indicating that both proteins are components of the zzso zzso III initiation zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso II and III initiation mechanisms are extremely similar, and they explain how the zzso protein can function in both zzso
