zzso coli DNA zzso is comprised of two zzso zzso and zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso a regulatory factor of DNA zzso activity, zzso the zzso activity of DNA zzso and that both zzso and zzso expression of the zzso gene suppress cell zzso Here we have analyzed the interaction of zzso with DNA zzso using two zzso First, zzso experiments revealed that zzso interacts zzso with the zzso in an zzso manner, although a weak interaction was also detected between zzso and the individual zzso and zzso zzso Second, surface zzso resonance experiments indicated that zzso binds to the zzso zzso with higher affinity than to either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso was not effective in stabilizing the zzso complex consisting of zzso and zzso Further, we identified an zzso synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso of zzso which zzso zzso activity in an in zzso zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance analysis of the zzso zzso interaction indicated a high association constant for this zzso These results suggest that zzso acids zzso of zzso are essential for its interaction with, and zzso of, DNA zzso
