The zzso is identified by routine zzso in less than zzso of pediatric acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso This zzso encodes a zzso zzso product zzso the zzso domain of zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso factors, fused to zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso beta zzso factor zzso Both zzso and zzso are involved in several zzso zzso zzso with zzso beta being altered in zzso of de zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso We now demonstrate that a zzso zzso transcript zzso by a cryptic zzso is observed in zzso of pediatric zzso making it the most common genetic zzso in these zzso Moreover, zzso expression defined a distinct zzso of patients characterized by an age between 1 and 10 years, B lineage zzso zzso DNA content and an excellent zzso These data demonstrate that molecular diagnostic approaches are invaluable in identifying clinically distinct subgroups, and that the zzso beta zzso complex is the most frequent target of zzso zzso in human zzso
