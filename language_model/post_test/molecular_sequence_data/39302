In the current study, we attempt to find a new zzso material based on zzso to improve zzso selectivity for heavy metals, so that the zzso zzso zzso with zzso as template zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso The effects on zzso capacities such as amount of zzso agent, degree of substitution of zzso pH value of the initial solution and zzso time were zzso The zzso experiments demonstrated the zzso zzso template has high zzso selectivity for zzso zzso in solution containing single metal zzso or coexistence of three metals zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, it was investigated that the zzso zzso template has a good zzso and stability as compared to zzso Finally, we studied the zzso mechanism by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results reveal that the zzso of zzso zzso template and zzso for zzso is a zzso zzso
