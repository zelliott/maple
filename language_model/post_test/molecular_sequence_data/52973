The compartments involved in polarized zzso of membrane proteins are not well zzso In this study we hypothesized that newly zzso zzso zzso receptors are targeted from the zzso network to zzso prior to their appearance on the zzso cell surface of polarized zzso canine kidney zzso To examine this hypothesis, we have used an zzso designed to measure the meeting of newly zzso receptors with a selective population of zzso or zzso zzso loaded with zzso zzso We found that in the course of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is targeted from the zzso network to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in the zzso tail of the zzso is implicated in this zzso The zzso zzso of zzso sorted zzso zzso zzso zzso similarly traversed zzso zzso raising the possibility that zzso receptors are zzso from zzso receptors in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and recycling receptors also passed through zzso zzso Together, these observations are consistent with the possibility that the zzso and zzso routes merge into zzso and justify a model suggesting that zzso recycling processes govern polarized trafficking of proteins traveling in both zzso
