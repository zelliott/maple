Gene zzso in zzso coli K-12 and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso are inactive due to zzso or nonsense zzso zzso These inactive genes have been suggested to be part of zzso genetic systems which are defined as being of long-term regulatory and evolutionary zzso We have shown that the nonsense zzso in zzso is present only in derivatives of the laboratory strain zzso zzso zzso All natural zzso of zzso examined have an zzso zzso at the corresponding location of their zzso zzso Further, two randomly selected natural zzso of zzso zzso are shown to each have an active ALS III zzso Our findings strongly suggest that the only zzso strains which lack a functional zzso locus are zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso leading to zzso of both zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso coli K-12 are more likely to have been acquired during laboratory storage and/or zzso rather than representing cryptic systems of gene zzso
