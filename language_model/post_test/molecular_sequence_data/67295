zzso zzso a significant zzso zzso has evolved resistance to almost all conventional zzso zzso zzso therapy is a potential alternative treatment for zzso bacterial zzso In this study, one zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso and has a broad host range, was selected for zzso 

zzso zzso and 3 of its natural zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso and zzso are described in this zzso The 3 strains have different sensitivities to zzso but they have the same sensitivity to zzso They are resistant to almost all of the antibiotics tested, except for zzso Several aspects of the life cycle of zzso were investigated using the sensitive strain zzso under optimal growth zzso zzso is highly infectious with a short zzso period (9 zzso and a large burst size zzso zzso It exhibited the most powerful zzso activity at temperatures ranging from zzso to zzso Moreover, when zzso alone was incubated at different zzso and different temperatures, the zzso was stable over a wide pH range (4 to 9) and at extreme temperatures (between zzso and zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso head containing zzso DNA with a total length of zzso zzso and a zzso long zzso zzso zzso it could be classified as a member of the zzso family and the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso whole zzso sequence further suggested that zzso was more likely to be a new member of the zzso zzso Most of the predicted zzso of the zzso were similar to the predicted zzso from other zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso has a relatively broad zzso spectrum, high pH stability, strong heat resistance, and efficient zzso potential at body zzso These characteristics greatly increase the utility of this zzso as an zzso zzso thus, it should be further zzso
