zzso is a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso and is a key signaling zzso expressed by zzso cells of the immune zzso In a previous paper, we demonstrated that the expression of zzso is regulated by both zzso and zzso zzso In this paper, we show that zzso zzso zzso gene expression is regulated by a zzso promoter, with zzso as a key zzso zzso Two zzso binding regions were identified in the mouse zzso promoter at positions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso was reduced following zzso stimulation and was associated with a zzso reduction in zzso DNA binding zzso This reduction seemed to be zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso We also show here that zzso expression in zzso cells is zzso by zzso through two distinct zzso One of these sites zzso to zzso was shown to bind zzso and zzso members of the zzso family, while the other site zzso to zzso bound only zzso zzso of zzso were generated using zzso 264 cells, and it was shown that the zzso of zzso zzso expression was dependent on the presence of the zzso zzso
