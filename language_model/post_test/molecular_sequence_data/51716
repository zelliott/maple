Based on zzso acid sequence and computer zzso two conflicting three-dimensional models of the zzso zzso zzso have been zzso One model zzso et zzso 1991, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 88, zzso suggests that zzso interacts with zzso 80 of zzso zzso 2 and zzso 390 of zzso with the zzso arranged in a zzso manner, while a second model zzso et zzso 1991, zzso zzso 40, 8) suggests that zzso interacts with zzso 114 of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso arranged in a zzso manner when viewed from the zzso zzso The present study tests the latter model by selectively mutating zzso 114 and zzso zzso and 197 of the human zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso In addition, two zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to evaluate whether zzso near zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are critical in zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of the negative charge with the zzso of zzso zzso to either zzso or zzso led to a total loss of both zzso and zzso zzso Individual or dual zzso zzso in positions 116 and zzso to make the zzso zzso binding pocket more closely resemble the beta zzso did not result in a change in selectivity toward zzso zzso or zzso The zzso zzso revealed interesting differences between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso In particular, zzso 197 appeared more important than zzso zzso for zzso zzso In addition, the binding of one zzso zzso was unaffected by individual zzso zzso while the binding of some antagonists, such as zzso and zzso was significantly zzso These findings are discussed in relation to zzso structure and their interactions with the putative binding zzso
