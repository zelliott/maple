zzso zzso virus 1 establishes a zzso infection in sensory zzso zzso of zzso During a zzso infection zzso related zzso transcripts are the only zzso viral zzso DNA sequences in the zzso promoter are positively regulated by neural zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso infected bovine cells is zzso zzso downstream from two overlapping zzso like zzso In contrast, the major start sites of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso infected cattle was zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso were zzso to identify regions of the zzso promoter that specifically bind factors present in zzso root zzso of zzso Nuclear extracts from zzso root zzso of cattle or rat zzso cells zzso contain abundant factors which specifically bind to a 72 zzso zzso zzso The 72 zzso zzso is adjacent to the major start sites of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso infected zzso In contrast, nuclear extracts from zzso cells, bovine zzso or zzso did not exhibit similar binding patterns suggesting these factors were not abundant, had reduced binding zzso or were absent in zzso zzso zzso was localized to a 20 zzso region of the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso III zzso When the zzso zzso was deleted, zzso promoter activity was zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, we conclude the zzso zzso is important for zzso expression in zzso
