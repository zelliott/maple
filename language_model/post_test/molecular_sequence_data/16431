zzso are plant hormones involved in the essential processes of plant growth and zzso They bind with receptors known as zzso zzso and zzso which possess zzso zzso zzso Recently, the sensor domain zzso zzso associated sensory zzso zzso was identified in those proteins but little is known about its structure and interaction with zzso Distant zzso detection methods developed in our laboratory and molecular zzso enabled the prediction of the structure of the zzso domain as similar to the zzso yellow zzso sensor zzso We have identified the active site pocket and zzso acids that are involved in zzso zzso We also show that fold evolution of zzso receptors is very important for a full understanding of the signal zzso mechanism in zzso
