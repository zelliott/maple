The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso zzso has been recognized as a negative feedback zzso of zzso responses in fish and zzso However, the repressive mechanism by the zzso has not been investigated in other zzso To understand the molecular mechanism of zzso toxicity and the evolutionary history of the zzso signaling zzso in avian species, the present study addresses chicken zzso zzso The complementary DNA sequence of zzso encodes an zzso protein sharing zzso identities with other zzso High levels of zzso zzso zzso were recorded in the kidney and zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso zzso 50% effective concentration value for zzso induction zzso was the same as that for chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a shared zzso regulation of zzso and zzso by chicken zzso zzso In zzso transient zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that basic zzso A zzso of zzso particularly zzso zzso acid zzso are indispensable for the repression, but the zzso nuclear zzso zzso by zzso and zzso of zzso are not involved in its repressive zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso of zzso green fluorescent protein fusion protein showed that zzso did not affect nuclear zzso of the zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso cross zzso Taken together, the function of zzso is zzso in chicken in terms of the negative regulation of zzso and zzso activities, but its functional mechanism is likely distinct from those of the zzso and fish zzso
