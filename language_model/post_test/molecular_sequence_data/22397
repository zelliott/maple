zzso are a family of membrane skeleton proteins composed of zzso zzso and zzso that promote zzso and zzso association in zzso The zzso and zzso are expressed zzso while the zzso is found in brain and zzso zzso The brain zzso protein is similar in size to that of zzso but the zzso transcript is a zzso one that has not been yet zzso having an estimated length of zzso zzso instead of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Here, we show the molecular basis for these differences by determining the structure of the zzso zzso transcript in rats, mice and zzso We identified a zzso promoter in zzso that, apparently, was not zzso in zzso In addition, we present evidence that the zzso are formed by a common mechanism consisting in the zzso use of alternative zzso sites generating unusually long zzso region of up to zzso zzso This hypothesis is supported by the presence of zzso regions zzso the zzso zzso site that suggest the involvement of these sequences in the zzso regulation, stability and/or zzso zzso of the zzso transcript in the zzso
