We evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of 11 previously described species differentiation and zzso zzso protocols for detection of zzso zzso zzso DNA from three species of zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2 of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso two zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to evaluate the specificity of zzso Furthermore, the sensitivity of the zzso zzso was tested by using zzso DNA isolated from known numbers of zzso obtained from a zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification was repeated at least three times with all of the primer zzso Of the 11 protocols zzso 10 amplified zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2, and the expected zzso sizes were zzso Our results indicate that two zzso protocols are not zzso specific, as the zzso used in these protocols also amplified the DNA of zzso zzso The sensitivity studies revealed that two zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso protocols based on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes are more sensitive than zzso zzso or zzso zzso
