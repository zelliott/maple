zzso in zzso junction and membrane zzso proteins may zzso some of the zzso invasive and zzso properties of zzso zzso a zzso protein that functions in zzso zzso interactions at zzso zzso is linked to the membrane zzso zzso through interactions with zzso and zzso We have carried out studies of zzso and zzso and zzso in 18 breast cancer cell lines to determine the prevalence and nature of zzso in these genes in breast zzso Ten lines failed to express zzso protein at zzso levels and seven failed to produce zzso levels of zzso zzso In a line lacking zzso expression zzso a zzso deletion of a large portion of the zzso gene was zzso zzso sequence zzso in zzso transcripts were not identified in any zzso In contrast to the results of a previous study, no relationship was identified between zzso expression and zzso zzso Two of the 18 lines had no zzso zzso protein and six others had reduced zzso The two lines lacking zzso protein had reduced or zzso levels of zzso zzso while no consistent changes in zzso transcript levels were seen in the lines with reduced, but zzso levels of zzso zzso Similarly, although two lines lacked zzso zzso in most lines the levels of zzso transcripts and protein were not well correlated with one zzso Our findings suggest that zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso expression are frequent in human breast zzso cell lines, and that in some cases the decreased expression may result from zzso in the zzso Furthermore, the frequent zzso in the expression of these proteins argue that loss of function in the zzso zzso may be critical in the development of many breast zzso
