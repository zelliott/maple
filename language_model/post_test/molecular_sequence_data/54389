Genes of the major zzso complex zzso have been a source of considerable research interest, zzso in large part to the growing body of evidence that they may be subject to both natural and sexual zzso However, much remains to be learned about the dynamics of zzso genes in subdivided zzso particularly those characterized by divergent ecological zzso In this study, we attempt to zzso the relative roles of both zzso selection and zzso mate choice in an open zzso system inhabited by two zzso zzso divergent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso the putative zzso region zzso of an estimated four Class zzso zzso from zzso individuals, identifying zzso sequence zzso zzso translated zzso acid zzso zzso differed significantly both in the frequency of zzso zzso and in the communities of zzso zzso infecting resident zzso Strong signatures of natural selection were zzso from analyses of zzso zzso particularly in the derived zzso rather than the ancestral zzso zzso zzso between zzso load and zzso diversity were indicative of balancing selection, but only within the freshwater zzso zzso of zzso mate choice were weak and differed significantly between zzso Moreover, zzso mate choice was significantly influenced by environmental zzso and appeared of secondary importance to tendencies towards zzso zzso We discuss the implications of these findings in respect to ecological adaptation and the potential demographic consequences of possible outcomes of zzso mate zzso
