zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in both the assembly of zzso zzso structure and zzso zzso The zzso zzso shadow domain zzso of zzso is responsible for zzso and interaction with a number of zzso zzso zzso including zzso which is a zzso protein that has been implicated in the development of breast and zzso zzso We have determined the crystal structure of the zzso zzso in complex with the zzso domain of zzso at zzso A zzso Surprisingly, the structure reveals that zzso is bound by two zzso zzso zzso and the binding sequences differ from the consensus zzso binding motif zzso This structural information expands our understanding of zzso binding specificity and provides insights into interactions between zzso zzso that are likely to be important for zzso zzso
