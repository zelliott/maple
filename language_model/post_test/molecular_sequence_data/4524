The zzso zzso zzso the major zzso from a zzso isolate zzso zzso zzso was cloned by zzso into a zzso zzso zzso coli zzso strain zzso The zzso for zzso consisted of zzso zzso with a higher degree of identity with typical Cat from zzso than zzso zzso zzso exchange with a zzso gene bearing an zzso of a zzso cassette into the zzso site of zzso generated a zzso zzso zzso This zzso and another zzso zzso derived by zzso zzso were highly sensitive to hydrogen zzso zzso activity and resistance to hydrogen zzso were restored in both zzso by zzso zzso to the 3' end of zzso was a potential zzso of zzso zzso that had high zzso with other zzso genes that zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis of the zzso gene from zzso revealed a transcript of approximately 500 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the same size restriction fragments in zzso zzso from other zzso and plant zzso zzso Thus, the genes for an zzso protein and the zzso Cat appear to be zzso in adjacent zzso in certain zzso
