A rapid and simple method was developed to detect zzso and zzso A virus zzso in sewage and ocean zzso zzso samples were concentrated by zzso and zzso at 1,000 zzso zzso zzso collected from zzso and zzso surf zone ocean water in Southern California were concentrated by vortex flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was used to detect zzso or zzso in all concentrated zzso A zzso internal probe was used to confirm the amplified zzso zzso of seeding experiments indicated that at 4 degrees C, zzso was more persistent than zzso in seawater and both zzso and zzso persisted longer at 4 degrees C than at 25 degrees zzso zzso was at least zzso more sensitive than cell zzso zzso were obtained within 5 h by zzso in contrast with the 5 days to 3 weeks required for cell zzso
