Despite the extensive molecular information on zzso human zzso B viruses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have remained largely zzso We have examined the sequences of the entire core zzso zzso of zzso zzso in 15 different zzso zzso zzso fide zzso rather than zzso zzso have been identified based on the zzso occurrence of structural differences from wild type at the highly zzso zzso positions, instead of at the positions known to contain genetic zzso among different zzso from different geographic zzso The distribution of these naturally occurring zzso of zzso core gene appears to be zzso and is found predominantly within three major zzso IV, and zzso and four minor zzso zzso III, zzso and zzso In general, domain IV zzso correlate with domain V zzso The zzso zzso zzso tend to accumulate a higher number of zzso core zzso than the integrated zzso zzso At the domain level, there is no significant difference in zzso core zzso zzso between the liver tumors and the adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso I, III, and V coincide with three major known T cell zzso within the core protein in acute and chronic zzso B zzso Furthermore, these zzso coincide with zzso class zzso T cell zzso rather than with the conventional zzso class zzso zzso of zzso T zzso Our results support the hypothesis that zzso core zzso zzso can accomplish zzso via accumulated escape zzso In addition, they also provide a potential molecular explanation for the maintenance of persistent infection of human zzso B virus in chronic zzso
