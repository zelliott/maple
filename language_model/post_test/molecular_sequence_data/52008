A zzso screening approach was used to isolate six zzso artificial zzso zzso clones containing segments of the human alpha zzso collagen gene zzso This gene is located at zzso and is known to be involved in the kidney disorder known as zzso syndrome zzso By analyzing zzso sites, zzso content, and zzso restriction site patterns in these zzso zzso a zzso that spans the entirety of the alpha zzso gene was zzso This zzso may contain as much as zzso zzso of DNA from the alpha zzso zzso On the basis of the information obtained from these zzso zzso the zzso map and gene structure of the alpha zzso gene have been zzso This study has also provided a valuable resource for subsequent studies of the alpha zzso gene and its zzso DNA zzso
