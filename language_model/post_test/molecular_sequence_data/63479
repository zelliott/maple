New zzso compounds are of major importance because of the growing problem of bacterial zzso In this context, zzso peptides have received a lot of zzso Their mechanism of action, however, is often zzso Here, the structures of two zzso zzso peptides from the family of zzso and zzso peptides determined in a zzso environment are zzso The sequence of the peptides has been obtained from a zzso parent zzso by scrambling the zzso zzso While the activity of the peptides is similar to that of the parent zzso the structures are zzso The peptides do, however, all adopt an zzso zzso A comparison between the structures helps to define the requirements for the activity of these zzso
