Blood zzso can result in survival of donor zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of donor zzso in the zzso recipient is termed zzso zzso likely reflects zzso of the recipient with donor zzso stem cells and is very uncommon with zzso for zzso surgery, zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso We have found, however, that zzso may be more common in trauma zzso 

To determine how frequently zzso after trauma is associated with zzso 

We zzso enrolled 45 trauma patients who were zzso zzso or zzso units of zzso We sampled blood before hospital discharge and determined zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso analysis of specimens using quantitative zzso zzso DR zzso to detect zzso zzso Data are expressed as median with zzso zzso 

Patients had a median age of 38 zzso range 25, zzso years, zzso of 19 (13, 29), and mortality of zzso zzso percent were men, and zzso had blunt zzso Patients received a median of 6 zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso units of zzso Of the 45 patients, 24 zzso had evidence of zzso Compared with patients without evidence of zzso these patients had no difference in mean age, zzso zzso units of zzso zzso time from zzso to blood zzso or proportion that underwent zzso zzso of the 24 patients with zzso had only 1 or 2 zzso DR zzso identified by zzso 

zzso after trauma is associated with over half of recipients having evidence of zzso Age, sex, zzso and zzso of the recipient and the number of zzso units did not correlate with zzso Because the median time from zzso to sampling for zzso analysis was not longer in the group without zzso it is unlikely zzso is due merely to failure of the recipient to clear zzso donor zzso
