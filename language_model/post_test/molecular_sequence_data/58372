Although zzso receptors are localized throughout the zzso central nervous system zzso the specific cellular zzso of the various zzso zzso zzso throughout human brain remains largely zzso zzso fragments to human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were cloned and used as zzso for in zzso zzso in order to examine the anatomical and cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene expression in dissected regions of human zzso brain zzso Although zzso was observed throughout the zzso results indicated that the highest levels of zzso were in the zzso with zzso primarily to cells in the zzso cell layer of the zzso region, and the zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso also was observed in the medium to large zzso of the zzso cortex, zzso zzso zzso and amygdala, as well as in scattered zzso in the thalamus, cerebral cortex, and zzso A striking pattern of differential zzso was observed within the zzso zzso demonstrated light zzso along the zzso zzso layer, with zzso and zzso demonstrating zzso to zzso cells, and zzso also to cells within the molecular layer, previously identified as zzso zzso Changes in zzso zzso function have been shown to be important in the zzso of a number of neurological zzso zzso an examination of zzso zzso expression in human zzso brain tissue may provide important information on the molecular basis of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders of the zzso
