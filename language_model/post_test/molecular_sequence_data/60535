The zzso zzso conveys the ability for the zzso to avoid destruction in diverse host zzso During its life cycle within the sand fly zzso the zzso zzso from a dividing zzso zzso stage that avoids expulsion from the zzso by attaching to the gut wall, to a zzso zzso zzso stage that is unable to attach to the zzso and zzso to the mouth parts for zzso of a zzso zzso zzso plays an integral role during this zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso whose zzso among species lie in the backbone zzso zzso zzso repeating units and the zzso zzso We have characterized the zzso from an Indian zzso zzso zzso Unlike East African zzso which express zzso repeats and a zzso and zzso cap, zzso zzso from the Indian isolate consists of zzso zzso zzso that branch off the backbone repeats zzso approximately 17) and also terminate the zzso Of biological significance, zzso zzso lacks the zzso zzso while doubling the number of zzso The importance of these zzso modifications in zzso structure was determined using binding experiments to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were able to bind to sand fly zzso in zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso lost this zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso adapts the synthesis of terminally exposed zzso of its zzso to manipulate zzso fly zzso
