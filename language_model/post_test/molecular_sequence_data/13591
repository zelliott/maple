zzso of zzso gene expression by the zzso zzso is dependent on an zzso regulatory element located downstream of the zzso initiation site known as zzso To characterize cellular factors that bind to zzso zzso and are involved in the regulation of zzso transcription, zzso nuclear extract was zzso and zzso zzso analysis was zzso This analysis indicated that only two cellular factors, zzso zzso II and the previously characterized zzso zzso loop binding protein zzso were capable of binding specifically to zzso zzso To zzso the function of zzso it was zzso from zzso nuclear zzso zzso acid zzso analysis was performed and a zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso is a novel protein of zzso zzso acids which contains a zzso zzso and potentially a novel zzso binding zzso In zzso zzso the binding of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso II was dependent on the presence of an additional group of proteins designated cellular zzso Both the zzso zzso loop and zzso sequences were critical for zzso zzso II zzso while zzso binding was dependent only on zzso zzso loop zzso Since binding of zzso and zzso zzso II to zzso zzso was found to be mutually zzso our results suggest that zzso may function either alone or in conjunction with zzso to disengage zzso zzso II which is stalled upon binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso
