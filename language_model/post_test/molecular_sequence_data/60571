We have identified a novel member of the zzso zzso and zzso neurotransmitter zzso family from zzso zzso This zzso named bloated zzso zzso shows significant sequence similarity to a zzso of zzso orphan zzso zzso transcripts are zzso supplied and during zzso exhibit a complex and dynamic pattern in a subset of zzso derived zzso notably in the zzso zzso and in the nervous zzso Animals zzso for this gene are zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso cells are distended with an enlarged and zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the maternal component of zzso expression die during early stages of zzso They show an inability to form zzso filaments in the zzso cortex, resulting in impaired zzso nuclear zzso severe defects in the zzso of the cortical zzso and a failure to zzso For the first time, a neurotransmitter zzso protein has been implicated in a function outside the nervous zzso The isolation of zzso thus provides the basis for an analysis of the relationship between the function of this putative zzso and zzso zzso
