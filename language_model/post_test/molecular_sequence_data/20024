The functions of the human zzso zzso zzso protein are zzso as it can both activate and repress viral gene expression through interaction with the promoter zzso Although the mechanism for these functions is not clearly zzso it appears that a combination of direct DNA binding and zzso interactions is zzso Multiple sequence alignment of several zzso zzso zzso reveals that the zzso acids zzso are zzso between all zzso and zzso zzso In the context of a bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso to zzso zzso results in a zzso zzso The defective zzso zzso does not undergo DNA zzso although the zzso zzso zzso protein appears to be zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein is able to zzso zzso zzso from the major zzso zzso promoter and was recruited to the zzso promoter in a zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso protein was unable to zzso early viral genes and was not recruited to the early viral zzso and zzso promoters in a zzso zzso From these data, we conclude that the zzso and repressive functions of the zzso zzso protein can be separated and must occur through independent zzso
