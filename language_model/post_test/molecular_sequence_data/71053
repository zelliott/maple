In the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have identified three genes zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso proteins containing two zzso zzso binding zzso The proteins zzso by two of the genes belong to the previously described zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso however, encodes a member of a new zzso protein family that is characterized by a short zzso domain including a putative zinc binding domain zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein as well as of the two proteins zzso by zzso was strongly induced by heat shock and, while zzso zzso synthesis was moderately induced by heat, we were unable to identify the zzso zzso When we analyzed zzso with disruptions in zzso zzso or zzso we found that although the genes are part of the zzso zzso heat shock zzso the zzso responded like zzso cells to heat and salt zzso However, when exposed to zzso a zzso analogue that results in the synthesis of zzso randomly folded zzso zzso zzso cells formed smaller colonies than zzso cells and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, our data suggest that zzso along with zzso which recently was shown to participate in the degradation of randomly folded proteins in zzso zzso could be necessary for degrading proteins generated by certain types of zzso
