zzso secondary zzso constitute a wide variety of compounds which either play a vital role in zzso pharmaceutical and industrial zzso or have devastating effects on agriculture, animal and human affairs by virtue of their zzso zzso to their beneficial and deleterious zzso these complex compounds and the genes responsible for their synthesis have been the subjects of extensive investigation by zzso and zzso A majority of the zzso secondary zzso genes are classified as type I zzso zzso zzso which are often clustered with other secondary metabolism related zzso In this review we discuss on the significance of our recent discovery of zzso zzso zzso genes belonging to the type III zzso zzso in an industrially important zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are known to play a vital role in the zzso of zzso in zzso A comparative zzso analyses revealed the unique character of zzso zzso with four zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso amongst other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which contained none of the zzso zzso Some other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also contained putative type III zzso with a zzso distinction from bacteria and zzso The zzso active nature of these newly discovered zzso is expected zzso to the conservation in the zzso zzso across the different species of plants and zzso and also by the fact that a majority of these genes zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso While this finding brings zzso zzso closer to plants and bacteria which until recently were the only ones considered to possess the type III zzso the presence of putative genes zzso other principal zzso involved in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso undoubtedly prove the extent of its zzso zzso Since many of these genes have not been identified earlier, knowledge on their corresponding products or activities remain zzso In future, it is anticipated that these zzso may be reasonable targets for zzso engineering in zzso to produce zzso and nutritionally important zzso
