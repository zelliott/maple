The zzso from the snail zzso zzso is widely used for zzso zzso We have investigated the content of zzso in zzso zzso using a zzso and a molecular zzso A zzso protein from the zzso juice of zzso zzso zzso with zzso activity when zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the protein was similar to one of three zzso motifs defined by sequence alignment of known zzso zzso zzso designed from the motifs and the zzso zzso acid sequence obtained were used to generate zzso fragments and to isolate both a full-length and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso acids and shows zzso identity to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso identical with zzso Both zzso and zzso contain the zzso zzso zzso in the active site of many zzso which is known to be zzso modified into zzso in zzso zzso However, the zzso and zzso zzso do not code for the protein zzso This indicates the presence of at least three zzso genes in zzso zzso
