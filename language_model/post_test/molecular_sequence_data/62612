Secondary structure models of the zzso zzso and both internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso are proposed for zzso zzso and are also plausible for other zzso The secondary structure of the zzso zzso zzso to previously developed models, with two internal paired regions and at least one zzso zzso zzso zzso A general secondary structure model of zzso for zzso (and other zzso consisting of an open zzso loop with three major zzso is zzso The zzso of these paired regions with those found in other zzso published in previous studies zzso zzso green algae and zzso remains to be zzso Finally, a general secondary structure model of zzso for zzso (and other zzso is zzso Based on the zzso zzso zzso interaction, it consists of a closed zzso loop, with four major zzso At least zzso III and IV have zzso with paired regions found in other zzso zzso zzso zzso green algae and zzso Since the secondary structures of both ITS regions are more zzso than the zzso zzso their analysis helps in understanding molecular evolution and increases the number of structural zzso Thus, the structure models developed in this study may be generally useful for future zzso zzso
