The acute phase response zzso has a long evolutionary history, but it remains to be characterized fully in lower zzso To study the acute phase proteins of a zzso rainbow trout zzso zzso we induced an zzso by injecting zzso zzso zzso in zzso In samples taken over the next 3 weeks, the total plasma protein profile changed consistently as seen in one and two-dimensional zzso zzso One zzso zzso zzso protein was isolated from zzso gels and an zzso sequence zzso Using reverse zzso a 700 zzso zzso sequence was zzso The sequence is zzso similar at the zzso acid level with rat zzso zzso zzso zzso from trout and zzso zzso zzso and zzso similar with the zzso portion of the human B chain of the first complement component zzso However, it lacks the collagen portion of zzso with its characteristic zzso zzso The isolated protein seems to be involved in the inflammatory response but its zzso function is zzso
