The zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared from the zzso zzso zzso zzso to introduce an zzso site immediately in front of the zzso start zzso and inserted into the zzso zzso downstream to the zzso promoter to yield the zzso zzso Upon induction with zzso zzso coli zzso cells zzso zzso to a level corresponding to zzso of total cell zzso This high level of gene expression zzso large scale preparation of zzso for physical studies, detection of in zzso degradation of zzso forms of zzso and comparative zzso of zzso by zzso formation and by zzso formation for the purpose of zzso zzso Finally, since zzso could complement the zzso zzso zzso on zzso coli zzso zzso cells, defective zzso of the zzso gene on zzso would be deductible on the basis of zzso zzso
