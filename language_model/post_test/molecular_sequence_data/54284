An zzso intermediate during zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso duplex, from which the mature zzso is zzso incorporated into a zzso zzso Its partner zzso species is generally regarded as a passenger zzso whose regulatory capacity has not been systematically examined in zzso Our zzso analyses demonstrate that a substantial fraction of zzso species are zzso zzso over zzso evolution, collectively exhibit greatest conservation in their seed regions, and define complementary motifs whose conservation across zzso zzso evolution is statistically zzso zzso tests of 22 zzso expression zzso revealed that a majority could repress both zzso and zzso perfect match reporters, and the ratio of zzso sensor repression was correlated with the zzso ratio of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso data provided zzso evidence for the regulation of zzso targets for both mature and star strand species of several zzso relevant to zzso including zzso zzso and zzso Finally, zzso sensor zzso and zzso tests confirmed direct repression of five zzso targets via star seed zzso Overall, our data demonstrate that zzso species have zzso impact on zzso regulatory networks and should be taken into account in studies of zzso functions and their contribution to disease zzso
