Identification of putative new zzso factors as additional targets for therapeutic approaches alternative to zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso coding for a putative zzso zzso was identified by the analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso cell wall anchor surface protein zzso A zzso zzso gene deletion zzso in the zzso zzso zzso human clinical isolate was zzso The wild type and the zzso zzso strain were investigated for zzso formation, adherence to zzso cells, survival in human zzso and a zzso zzso infection zzso The zzso portion of the zzso protein was zzso in zzso coli to obtain mouse zzso zzso for use in Western zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso gene has an unusually high zzso content zzso zzso an average of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids that presents a series of 14 imperfect repeats of 90 zzso acids covering almost the entire length of the zzso Its global organization is similar to the zzso protein family of group B zzso zzso surface protein zzso and zzso associated protein zzso from zzso zzso The zzso gene was always present and specific for zzso zzso strains of human, food and animal zzso zzso in size depended on variable numbers of repeats in the repetitive zzso 

zzso is a newly zzso surface exposed protein that contributes to the zzso properties of zzso zzso
