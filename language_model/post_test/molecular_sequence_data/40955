Sox zzso a family of genes related to the zzso zzso region Y zzso zzso are found throughout the animal kingdom, and involved in diverse zzso processes including sex determination and zzso Previously, we have identified one zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso In the present study, another zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the zzso The zzso grouper zzso contained the signature features of zzso zzso zzso except the zzso rich region, was clustered with zzso zzso of other zzso in the zzso tree, and shared higher zzso with zzso of other species than the duplicated copy zzso Interestingly, significant conservation was observed in the zzso of zzso but not zzso transcripts when compared with zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso was detected in a wide range of zzso with higher zzso in the central nervous zzso During zzso and zzso development, the expression of zzso zzso remained at considerably high levels at all stages zzso from newly zzso eggs, through zzso to the larvae zzso zzso Together, these results indicated that the zzso grouper zzso was zzso more zzso than zzso and may play important roles in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
