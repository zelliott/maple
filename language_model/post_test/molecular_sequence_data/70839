Using the zzso of the cauliflower zzso as a source of tissue and a series of zzso zzso and amplification zzso we have constructed a zzso library highly enriched in zzso expressed in zzso zzso The analysis of a sample of 250 clones from this library identified 22 zzso clones corresponding to genes specifically expressed in these cauliflower zzso Apart from two clones that corresponded to zzso and two other ones showing similarity to different zzso zzso the remaining clones showed no similarity to any sequence in the databases and may zzso to novel zzso One of these zzso zzso was further characterized and found to zzso to a gene zzso a protein with features of regulatory proteins that follows a expression pattern very similar to the zzso zzso
