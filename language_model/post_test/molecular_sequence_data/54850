zzso M zzso zzso zzso coli cells by zzso zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso To identify zzso functional zzso we isolated 54 point zzso and small deletion zzso and examined their zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were distinguished by zzso zzso which transfers zzso into the zzso independent of the specific zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which extends from the compact zzso structure, abolished interference with the zzso zzso which is transported across the outer membrane by the same system as zzso thereby identifying zzso as the zzso site that binds to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso strongly reduced zzso zzso across the outer membrane after binding to zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso or Ala zzso zzso zzso is exposed at the zzso surface and is surrounded by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso replacement of each with zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso directly zzso in zzso zzso zzso and that the surrounding zzso contribute to the active zzso These zzso are strongly zzso in zzso proteins of other zzso Replacement of other zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso these zzso probably altered the zzso structure, as particularly apparent for zzso in the unique open zzso of zzso which were isolated in lower zzso Our results identify regions in zzso responsible for zzso and activity and support the concept of a zzso arrangement of zzso
