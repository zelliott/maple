zzso repeats zzso as zzso or zzso in zzso and zzso organisms are zzso zzso While zzso in zzso zzso are zzso the cell surface zzso of bacteria often contain the zzso zzso repeats, zzso the zzso acid pair of zzso especially in zzso zzso However, their relationship to biological functions is still zzso In this study, effort was made to uncover the copy number variations of zzso repeats by zzso analysis and to detect changes in zzso repeats during a zzso zzso as a first step to understand its biological zzso The zzso repeats were found to be mainly present in the cell surface zzso The zzso repeats were genetically unstable and zzso in terms of copy numbers and sequence zzso Unlike zzso the change of its copy number was zzso without frame zzso More significantly, a zzso hot spot, the zzso site, was found to be mainly responsible for the instability and zzso of zzso zzso These characteristics of zzso repeats may facilitate bacteria to respond to environmental changes, with low cost, low risk and high zzso
