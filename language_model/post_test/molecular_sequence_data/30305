Human zzso virus zzso vaccines targeted at blocking zzso interactions are expected to be less affected by the sequence zzso of zzso than those targeted at variable regions of the envelope zzso zzso zzso All potential zzso binding sites identified thus far in zzso are localized in the zzso region of zzso In this study we demonstrate that the zzso region of zzso also contains zzso zzso critical for binding to zzso and that zzso interactions can be blocked by an zzso with binding specificity to an zzso region of zzso These results suggest that not all potential zzso binding sites are present in the zzso region of zzso and that an alternative zzso vaccine development strategy may have to include the zzso zzso region as a component to raise effective zzso zzso
