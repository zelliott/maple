zzso a protein belonging to the zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso family, is a global regulator of secondary metabolism in zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of three major functional zzso an zzso zzso domain, a central zzso domain, and a zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso Two truncated zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso containing only the zzso domain, exhibited the same zzso specificity as that of full-length zzso Two zzso bound zzso to a direct repeat located eight zzso zzso to the zzso element of the zzso zzso Both truncated zzso zzso as well as full-length zzso were able to form zzso complexes with the zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso although zzso alone could not bind to the zzso The zzso complex was capable of initiating zzso zzso in zzso indicating that the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso for the basic function of zzso as a zzso zzso However, the zzso domain was required to fully compensate for the zzso in zzso production in an zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso domain exerts a regulatory function on the basic zzso zzso zzso or addition of even a single zzso between the zzso site and the zzso element of the zzso promoter abolished zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso indicating that the recruitment of zzso by zzso to the correct location relative to the zzso element is critical for zzso zzso Since zzso sites with similar direct repeats are located at the same position relative to the zzso element of their target promoters as is the zzso binding site, the zzso family members presumably activate zzso of their targets by recruiting zzso to the promoter, where a zzso zzso complex competent for zzso initiation is zzso
