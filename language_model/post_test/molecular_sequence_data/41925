A novel zzso zzso has been isolated from the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso From the results of compositional analysis, zzso analysis, zzso zzso acid zzso fast atom zzso mass zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso analysis, its structure was concluded to be zzso see zzso This is the first report of a zzso with a novel zzso structure which is characterized by zzso the occurrence of a penultimate zzso zzso attached to the reducing end zzso through a beta 1-3 linkage and zzso the presence of a zzso attached to a zzso through an alpha 1-3 zzso The zzso contained zzso or zzso and either a zzso fatty acid with 16, 18, 26, or 28 carbon zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the chemical species of both the long chain base and fatty acid zzso affect the chemical shifts of the zzso zzso zzso of not only the reducing terminal zzso but also the penultimate zzso
