The zzso zzso disease resistance genes zzso and zzso belong to a class of plant disease resistance genes that zzso proteins that contain an zzso zzso zzso binding site zzso and a zzso tandem array of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resistance to strains of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso In these zzso zzso it has been proposed that pathogen zzso genes generate specific zzso that are recognized by zzso receptors zzso by the corresponding plant resistance zzso To test this hypothesis, it is crucial to know the site of the potential molecular zzso zzso analysis of zzso protein and in zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso protein is localized in the plant zzso To determine whether zzso gene products themselves are the zzso for resistance zzso we expressed the zzso and zzso genes directly in plant cell using a novel quantitative transient expression zzso and found that expression of zzso and zzso zzso a resistance response in plants carrying the corresponding resistance zzso This observation indicates that no bacterial factors other than the zzso gene products are required for the specific resistance response as long as the zzso gene products are correctly zzso We propose that molecular recognition of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso resistance occurs inside of plant zzso
