The main purpose of this study is to explore the zzso nature of common zzso acids in their contribution to the partition zzso of small zzso 

The zzso P values and other zzso parameters of the peptides studied are taken from the zzso The frequency of appearance zzso of each individual zzso acid is calculated as the number of the zzso acids in a given zzso 

The partition zzso zzso zzso at pH 7) of 87 zzso have been correlated with the frequency of appearance of zzso zzso From the correlation zzso the de zzso zzso contribution zzso of 19 zzso acid zzso are derived for the first zzso The contribution zzso are extended to 59 unmodified regular peptides with the inclusion of the zzso values of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The models thus obtained have been validated with additional 27 peptides (both zzso and zzso 

The zzso P of zzso is very well correlated with the de zzso zzso contribution zzso of zzso zzso The models we have derived are reasonably accurate in predicting the zzso of new zzso zzso or zzso zzso at a fixed pH zzso zzso
