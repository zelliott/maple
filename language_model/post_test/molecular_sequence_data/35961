Secondary structure and zzso zzso methods have been applied to the sequences of human and bovine zzso in order to have some insight into the molecular structure of its zzso counterpart, zzso zzso For both zzso all the predictions yielded 11 major regions, in which the zzso zzso was zzso separated by 10 strong zzso segments of various lengths located within zzso rich regions of the zzso The overall zzso of human and bovine zzso were estimated to contain 18 zzso zzso zzso 63 zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso and 6 zzso zzso random zzso For both zzso zzso predictions indicated the presence of seven synthetic zzso corresponding to continuous linear zzso of the zzso Some of the predicted zzso are located in the same regions in both species while others are zzso These predictions have allowed us to propose an zzso zzso for zzso Therefore this zzso zzso zzso might be more structured (10 zzso segments for about zzso of the overall zzso than previously zzso
