The mouse zzso complex zzso locus zzso is centrally involved in the phenomenon of zzso transmission ratio distortion zzso through its action in zzso germ zzso Previously, we identified a candidate zzso zzso whose zzso zzso generates alternatively spliced zzso The full-length zzso transcript is present in zzso and zzso germ cells and encodes a product that is virtually identical with that zzso by the zzso zzso The alternatively spliced zzso transcript is observed in zzso zzso zzso and would zzso an altered zzso that could convey the zzso zzso To assess their function, we have introduced zzso representing each zzso transcript into transgenic zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that these two zzso alter the transmission ratios of zzso zzso from male mice, but in opposite zzso The results provide support for the hypothesis that zzso is a component of the zzso zzso
