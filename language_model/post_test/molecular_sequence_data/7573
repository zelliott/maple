zzso zzso zzso have been used to inhibit zzso expression and have potential therapeutic zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression and cellular proliferation is studied in two cell lines with zzso zzso a colon cancer cell line zzso 320 zzso and a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso transcript is performed by competitive reverse zzso chain reaction zzso This zzso an zzso competitive reference standard zzso zzso template that is identical to the native zzso zzso except for a short segment deletion to allow for differentiation of the two by gel zzso A fixed quantity of test zzso and a series of known zzso of zzso zzso template placed in the same test tubes under identical conditions are reverse transcribed and amplified by zzso Since the reaction is competitive, the ratio of the zzso products reflects the ratio of the initial zzso of the two zzso After gel zzso the two zzso products are zzso zzso Treating Colo 320 zzso and zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso and zzso results in a zzso to zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is dose dependent and sequence specific zzso sense and zzso zzso have no zzso The quantitative decrease in zzso zzso is associated with corresponding zzso of zzso zzso synthesis as demonstrated by flow zzso and Western zzso Furthermore, there is zzso of cellular proliferation of the respective cell zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
