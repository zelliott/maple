zzso virus 40 zzso sequences for large tumor zzso zzso were recently detected in a significant fraction of certain human brain tumors of early childhood zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we sought to determine whether authentic zzso was present in the zzso zzso and zzso tumors previously zzso zzso chain reaction and DNA sequence analysis revealed authentic zzso regulatory region and major zzso zzso sequences in 14 of 17 tumors zzso Only one zzso element was detected in the zzso zzso region of positive tumor samples, an arrangement designated as zzso The C zzso of the zzso gene was detected in the same 14 tumors and was zzso from 5 zzso some zzso changes were found that would result in zzso acid changes in zzso zzso zzso was isolated from one sample after zzso of tumor DNA into monkey kidney zzso zzso analysis of the rescued virus zzso revealed zzso an zzso regulatory region, zzso zzso changes in the C zzso of the zzso gene that distinguished it from zzso laboratory strains zzso and zzso and from human isolate zzso and zzso identity with previous human brain tumor isolate zzso in the three zzso regions zzso No zzso distinguishing features were detected among the viral sequences zzso Thus, authentic zzso is present in humans and associated with two tumor types known to be induced zzso by the zzso
