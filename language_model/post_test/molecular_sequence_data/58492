The promoter for the rat zzso hormone zzso zzso gene contains a zzso consensus E box sequence and an zzso region zzso zzso zzso analysis and transient zzso showed that a zzso pair region zzso to zzso that encompasses the E box and the zzso was sufficient for greater than zzso of promoter zzso zzso I footprint analysis showed that the E box and zzso were protected by nuclear proteins from rat zzso cells, and the E box region was shown by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso to be a site of zzso protein zzso zzso in the E box disrupted these interactions and reduced zzso promoter zzso zzso of the inhibitor of DNA binding zzso with an zzso construct into mouse zzso 1 cells reduced zzso promoter zzso Using zzso the upstream zzso factor was shown to be a component of the complexes that zzso with the E box in the zzso zzso zzso of proteins from rat zzso cells to the zzso was demonstrated using zzso Also, an zzso that represented the sequence of the terminal zzso zzso displaced the complexes at the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso resulted in a significant reduction of zzso promoter zzso
