zzso T4 DNA zzso effectively joins two zzso short synthetic zzso zzso as guided by complementary zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso When a single zzso mismatch exists at either side of the zzso zzso the efficiency of the zzso to zzso the two zzso zzso zzso zzso is approximately zzso greater if the mismatch occurs at the 3' side rather than at the zzso side of the zzso During mismatch zzso the zzso zzso of the 3' zzso accumulates in the zzso The level of the zzso formation zzso closely with the level of the mismatch zzso Both mismatch zzso and zzso formation are suppressed at elevated temperatures and in the presence of 200 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The apparent zzso for the zzso template in the absence of salt is zzso zzso whereas the zzso increases to zzso zzso in the presence of 200 zzso of zzso In this report, we demonstrate these properties of T4 DNA zzso for zzso pairs complementary to the zzso gene at the sequence surrounding the single zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso Because of the highly specific nature of the zzso reaction, zzso of short zzso with DNA zzso can be used to distinguish two DNA templates differing by a single zzso
