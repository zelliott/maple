The four zzso proteins zzso of zzso virus zzso play important roles involving zzso activities and specific interactions with both viral and host zzso during different stages of viral zzso zzso of the presence and/or absence of interactions among zzso in a systematic manner is thus of scientific zzso In the current study, each zzso combination among the four zzso proteins of zzso was systematically analyzed for possible zzso Six novel protein interactions were identified for zzso using systems such as zzso zzso zzso pull down and zzso three of which have not been previously reported for the zzso zzso These interactions form a network of organized associations that suggest the spatial arrangement of zzso proteins in the late zzso zzso The study identified novel interactions as well as concurred with previously described associations in related zzso
