The zzso zzso cave system hosts an zzso subsurface microbial zzso including extremely zzso zzso zzso viscous zzso zzso hanging from the cave zzso We investigated the diversity and population structure of zzso from three locations in the cave system using full cycle zzso methods and zzso The zzso were composed primarily of bacteria related to zzso zzso Other populations present in the zzso included zzso group zzso bacteria related to zzso zzso and the proposed bacterial lineage zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on zzso in zzso zzso population counts, zzso are key members of the zzso communities, accompanied in some cases by smaller numbers of zzso related to zzso and other zzso Diversity estimates show that the zzso zzso are among the zzso natural microbial communities known, with one to six zzso zzso observed depending on the zzso This study represents the first in-depth molecular survey of cave zzso microbial diversity and population structure, and contributes to understanding of rapid limestone dissolution and cave formation by zzso zzso zzso acid zzso
