The zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of bacterial zzso with distinct functional zzso The zzso coli zzso zzso comprises nine zzso whose zzso operators vary in both sequence and, most significantly, spacing between the recognition zzso This suggests a strong likelihood that protein folding would be coupled to DNA binding as a mechanism to accommodate the variety of different operator zzso to which zzso is zzso Such zzso is a common feature of zzso zzso zzso including the zzso family zzso however, there are no significant structural zzso upon DNA binding within the zzso zzso zzso zzso studied to zzso We used nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso to characterize the zzso zzso free in solution and to determine the high-resolution structure of a zzso zzso zzso bound specifically to one DNA zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We find that the free zzso populates multiple distinct zzso distinguished by up to four sets of zzso zzso per zzso This structural zzso is previously unknown in the zzso zzso These stable structures coalesce into a single, more stable zzso form that features a zzso bundle containing a zzso zzso zzso However, this structure differs from all other zzso family members whose structures are known with regard to the packing of the zzso and consequently their relative zzso Aspects of zzso activity are unique among zzso we identify here structural properties that are also distinct and that might zzso the different functional zzso
