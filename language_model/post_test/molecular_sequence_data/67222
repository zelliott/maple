Plants exhibit various defense responses after recognizing zzso molecules derived from zzso zzso and host zzso In this study, we developed an improved zzso zzso for zzso the generation of zzso in plant cells, one of the defense responses, to evaluate zzso activity zzso zzso is detected using a zzso zzso sodium salt zzso which can be measured by conventional zzso in a highly sensitive and quantitative zzso Using this method, we successfully measured the zzso activity of zzso peptides in cultured tobacco cells, and identified several structural features of the peptides important for the zzso zzso The results suggest that the structural factors required for expression of the zzso activity differ slightly among plant zzso The efficient and sensitive zzso developed in this study should be useful not only for studying zzso zzso but also for the screening of novel compounds that can induce defense zzso
