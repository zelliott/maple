In a minority of zzso zzso a small functional upstream zzso zzso often performing a regulatory role, precedes the translation start site for the main zzso Here, zzso zzso in numerous zzso zzso zzso are identified from zzso to zzso Most have zzso zzso zzso start zzso the main one being zzso which has not been known as an zzso for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso present in mouse zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso mediates zzso repression of the downstream main zzso This repression is part of an zzso circuit, and one of its sensors is the zzso zzso which suggests that translation initiation zzso identity is likely used for regulation in zzso
