zzso transfer signals carry information specifying zzso by either a zzso or delta zzso protein zzso in the zzso zzso zzso yet all resemble classical signal peptides in overall structural zzso zzso of known transfer signals reveals two zzso zzso signals for the delta zzso system invariably contain a critical zzso zzso motif prior to the zzso zzso domain, whereas known zzso signals contain zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso signals are generally zzso Previous work has shown that a zzso motif before the zzso is critical for targeting by the delta zzso zzso in this report we show that the charge characteristics of this region are not important for sorting by the zzso zzso zzso zzso or single zzso are all acceptable to the zzso system, although single zzso is zzso The single zzso in zzso can even be replaced by an zzso zzso without apparent zzso We have also generated a zzso zzso containing an zzso which, in terms of zzso profile, is identical to that of a delta zzso zzso This zzso is also transported efficiently by the zzso system, demonstrating that zzso per zzso is not a key sorting zzso However, the characteristics of the zzso may be important in avoiding a different form of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso signal peptides have undergone substantial structural changes during the evolution of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals contain zzso that are highly zzso and enriched in zzso and aromatic zzso whereas zzso counterparts are zzso and far less zzso We speculate that this trend may reflect a need to avoid zzso through recognition by zzso signal recognition zzso which zzso interacts with more zzso signal zzso
