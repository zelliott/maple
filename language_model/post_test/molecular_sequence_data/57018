We report that the human zzso zzso zzso gene is a zzso gene located zzso to the zzso zzso alpha chain gene zzso An zzso zzso likely corresponding to a zzso maps to zzso zzso The zzso gene is transcribed from the zzso to the zzso and contains in its first zzso a zzso island mapped zzso zzso from the zzso This gene is transcribed from the Y zzso and from the active and inactive X zzso This gene thus escapes zzso as predicted for genes belonging to the zzso zzso
