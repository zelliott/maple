Recently, we demonstrated that the four known zzso zzso zzso zzso of Cancer zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso distributed in zzso patterns among individual zzso This finding strongly supported the presence of multiple zzso zzso hormone zzso transcripts in each zzso as well as the translation and processing of the zzso zzso Whether these transcripts contained common or distinct zzso of zzso remained zzso To address this question, molecular analyses of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Using a zzso cloning strategy, four zzso zzso were zzso one zzso zzso I, one zzso zzso III zzso to possess zzso rather than zzso as reported zzso and two zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso zzso IV was zzso The deduced zzso present in the zzso containing zzso I and III were identical zzso I) and differed from that zzso zzso present in the two zzso containing zzso II at a single zzso a zzso for zzso zzso As both zzso zzso possess zzso at position 1, a zzso of this zzso to zzso is likely as the peptides mature, as has been seen for the zzso of other zzso zzso Likewise, zzso to other zzso suggests all zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso These zzso modifications would result in four zzso zzso of zzso zzso I, zzso I, zzso II, and zzso zzso Southern zzso supported the hypothesis that at least three zzso transcripts are present in each zzso while dual in zzso zzso localized the transcripts to previously mapped zzso zzso zzso in the zzso the major source of zzso to the zzso
