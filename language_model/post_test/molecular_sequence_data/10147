The zzso gene family of zzso factors belongs to the zzso zzso class of zzso zzso Today over 40 members of this gene family have been zzso zzso genes have been shown to be involved in embryonic development, zzso and direction of tissue specificity of gene zzso Here we describe a new human zzso gene called zzso zzso symbol zzso zzso A combination of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell hybrids zzso zzso to the zzso region of zzso zzso to a panel consisting of zzso derived from 50 different zzso shows that zzso is transcribed predominantly in the zzso thus having a unique expression pattern compared with other zzso zzso zzso comparison reveals a striking zzso over the zzso DNA binding region, to a zzso zzso zzso We zzso based on sequence differences in the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso domain and a clear difference in expression pattern between zzso and zzso that zzso represents a novel member of this gene zzso
