The zzso zzso family comprises hundreds of diverse proteins and a multitude of zzso none have been zzso bound to zzso The structure of the zzso restriction zzso zzso has been solved both alone and bound to its target zzso The protein displays a zzso zzso structure with several extended surface zzso zzso the zzso Only three side chains from each protein zzso contact DNA zzso two directly and one via a bridging zzso zzso Both zzso zzso within the zzso motif are positioned in the zzso center near a putative zzso zzso the remainder of the active site resembles the zzso zzso zzso The structure illustrates how the zzso scaffold has been adapted for the highly specific recognition of a DNA restriction site, in contrast to zzso DNA zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso by DNA repair zzso such as zzso
