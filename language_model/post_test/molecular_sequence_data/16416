zzso a group of proteins that are defective in patients with Barth syndrome, are produced by alternate zzso of the gene zzso or zzso zzso and zzso in zzso translation analysis were undertaken to determine the expression of alternatively spliced zzso zzso in mouse zzso and human cell zzso Only two zzso zzso both lacking zzso 5, were expressed in zzso zzso whereas four zzso zzso all lacking zzso 5, were observed in human zzso vein vascular zzso cells and zzso human zzso indicating a zzso difference in the expression of zzso zzso in mouse and zzso Only zzso lacking zzso 5 was expressed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso human zzso into zzso did not alter expression of the zzso transcripts indicating that zzso expression is independent of zzso zzso Cloning and in zzso expression of both zzso and human zzso zzso revealed two prominent protein bands that corresponded to the expected sizes of alternative zzso A novel fifth zzso identified as critical for the zzso zzso family, was observed in human zzso The presence of a zzso in this region in Barth syndrome patients indicates that this motif is essential for zzso zzso
