We have cloned a novel zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differential display was used in conjunction with a modified zzso liquid culture zzso zzso were enriched for early precursors of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were isolated after induction with erythropoietin, zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the enriched cells was subjected to differential display analysis to identify zzso expressed zzso One clone specifically induced by zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso clone of zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso translating into a protein of 510 zzso acids with a signal zzso and six zzso zzso zzso The protein sequence of zzso showed it to be a zzso of the zzso family, which includes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes show characteristic zzso patterns of zzso the specific zzso expressing these genes differ among the family zzso zzso was strongly expressed in the zzso small zzso and zzso moderately expressed in the bone zzso and stomach, and not zzso in other zzso In zzso translation and ex zzso expression showed zzso to be an zzso zzso The zzso gene locus mapped to zzso zzso Together, our findings indicate that zzso is primarily expressed as an zzso zzso zzso during normal zzso lineage zzso suggesting the possibility of a zzso function for zzso in zzso
