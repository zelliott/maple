zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso protein zzso that is expressed from a family of four genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We have documented the three-dimensional structures and the zzso and zzso properties of the four gene zzso zzso analyses showed that each zzso assembles into zzso forms and their three-dimensional structures at 21-25 A revealed that all four zzso were zzso with similar but highly unusual zzso A zzso core zzso the association domain has the zzso zzso zzso on zzso six of which extend from both ends of the zzso At this level of resolution, we can discern no zzso differences in zzso of the zzso zzso analyses showed that the zzso were similar in their zzso for zzso and the zzso zzso zzso but showed significant differences in their interactions with zzso as assessed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, the rank order of zzso binding affinity zzso zzso beta zzso delta zzso zzso does not directly correlate with the rank order of their zzso dependence for zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso delta zzso zzso zzso utilizing this data revealed that the measured differences in zzso binding affinities play a minor role in the zzso of the zzso which is largely dictated by the rate of zzso for each zzso
