The acquisition of zzso fertility genes has been proposed to be an important process in human Y zzso zzso For example, the zzso fertility factor zzso zzso in zzso appears to have arisen after the zzso and tandem amplification of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso Y zzso contains zzso repeated zzso units that are thought to affect male fertility as zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the detection of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that appears to be an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso Its putative zzso shares extensive zzso zzso with the genuine zzso of zzso and retains the zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso maps within region zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We present evidence that zzso was derived from the genuine zzso gene by reverse zzso This event resulted in the loss of the first three zzso in the coding region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso has evolved under selective pressure at the zzso zzso Its zzso especially in the 3' region, is much closer to the zzso zzso tandem repeats than to the zzso zzso These results suggest that the acquisition of zzso zzso genes may be important for the evolution of zzso as well as human Y zzso
