The sensitivity of detection of zzso virus DNA in clinical specimens was evaluated by comparing the results of single zzso and zzso zzso zzso with or without subsequent Southern zzso zzso to a zzso zzso DNA zzso The zzso activity of human serum components on zzso reaction was also zzso The sensitivity of zzso virus DNA detection decreased by a factor of zzso in the presence of zzso serum in the single zzso reaction mixture, and of zzso for zzso zzso When zzso zzso products were zzso by Southern zzso zzso to a zzso radioactive DNA probe, the sensitivity of the zzso increased to such a level of zzso DNA detection that the reaction was no longer influenced by the presence of serum zzso in the original zzso Less than ten zzso zzso copies could thus be detected in a zzso zzso A panel of 38 clinical samples, originating from patients with possibility of zzso virus infection, were zzso by this zzso Only one sample was found to be positive after single zzso whereas seven samples (including the zzso gave a positive signal after zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso zzso products was controlled by zzso to the zzso DNA probe and DNA zzso No zzso in the results was observed between zzso zzso alone and zzso zzso followed by Southern zzso zzso
