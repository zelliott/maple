In a species with a large distribution relative to its zzso capacity, geographic variation in traits may be explained by gene flow, selection, or the combined effects of zzso Studies of genetic diversity using neutral molecular markers show that patterns of isolation by distance zzso or barrier effect may be evident for geographic variation at the molecular level in zzso zzso However, selective factors such as habitat, zzso or zzso interactions may be critical for geographic variation in sexual zzso We studied geographic variation in advertisement calls in the tree zzso zzso zzso to understand patterns of variation in these traits across Korea and provide clues about the underlying forces for zzso 

We recorded calls of zzso zzso in three breeding seasons from 17 localities including localities in remote zzso zzso Call characters analyzed were note repetition rate zzso note duration zzso and dominant frequency zzso along with zzso zzso 

The findings of a barrier effect on zzso and a zzso variation in zzso seemed to suggest that an open sea between the mainland and zzso Island and mountain ranges dominated by the zzso zzso Mountains were related to geographic variation in call zzso Furthermore, there was a pattern of zzso in zzso DNA zzso However, no comparable pattern of zzso was found between geographic distance and call zzso We also failed to detect any effects of habitat or zzso interaction on call zzso 

zzso variations in call characters as well as zzso DNA sequences were largely zzso by geographic factors such as distance and barriers in Korean populations of zzso zzso Although we did not detect effects of habitat or zzso interaction, some other selective factors such as sexual selection might still be operating on call characters in conjunction with restricted gene zzso
