zzso zzso factor 2 zzso is a large protein of more than 800 zzso acids which establishes complex interactions with the zzso in order to catalyze the zzso changes needed for translation zzso Unlike other zzso the zzso fungus zzso zzso was found to have a single gene zzso this factor per zzso zzso located on zzso zzso zzso of this locus is essential for zzso growth, as evidenced by placing it under the control of a zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso named zzso was cloned and zzso zzso zzso number zzso zzso and zzso sequence analysis identified common zzso initiation and termination signals and an zzso zzso acid open reading frame zzso which is interrupted by a single zzso Despite some genetic differences, zzso was capable of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which lacks zzso zzso indicating that zzso can be expressed from its own promoter and its zzso can be correctly spliced in zzso zzso
