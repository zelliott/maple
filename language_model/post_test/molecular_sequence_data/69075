A new type of A alpha zzso to zzso substitution has been identified in a zzso abnormal zzso zzso zzso II, derived from a 14-year-old female suffering from easy bruising since zzso Plasma of the patient and zzso zzso zzso were found to zzso slowly by zzso but in a normal fashion by zzso a zzso snake zzso zzso The zzso zzso gels were normally solid and zzso whereas the zzso gels were initially fragile and transparent but became gradually zzso during further zzso On zzso zzso liquid zzso there was an additional zzso group zzso distinctly later than the corresponding normal zzso A in the zzso of the patient's zzso zzso analysis of these zzso peptides and isolated A alpha chains of the patient's zzso showed that zzso at position 11 of the abnormal A alpha chain had been replaced by zzso Studies using zzso zzso showed that the binding with zzso was evidently reduced for her zzso and the zzso zzso A as compared with that for the normal controls, indicating that A alpha zzso may be critical for the zzso zzso Indeed, A alpha zzso of zzso has recently been proposed to stabilize the local zzso including the zzso and to form a salt bridge between its zzso zzso group and the zzso group of zzso of zzso based on zzso analyses using zzso of zzso A zzso with zzso zzso et zzso zzso J zzso zzso 1992 and Martin et zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso
