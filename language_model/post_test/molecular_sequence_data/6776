We have isolated and characterized a zzso clone zzso human zzso of zzso marker zzso zzso a calcium binding protein also called zzso zzso This clone zzso has zzso base pairs zzso and contains an open reading frame of 897 zzso which encodes 299 zzso zzso The estimated molecular weight of the deduced zzso is zzso and zzso is zzso The zzso of zzso acid sequences between human zzso and rat zzso is zzso Using zzso as a probe, the zzso location of the human zzso of zzso gene was zzso The results of regional mapping using a panel of 11 zzso zzso hybrids indicated that the gene is located in the zzso segment of the X zzso This gene thus could be a candidate for one of the zzso diseases mapped to this zzso
