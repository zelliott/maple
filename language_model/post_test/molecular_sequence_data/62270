A recent zzso scanning of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that this domain can zzso zzso gating zzso zzso Santiago, zzso Ricardo, zzso zzso zzso Rojas, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 42, zzso Here we extend the study of the zzso domain to the zzso zzso by examining functional consequences of single zzso zzso at five zzso positions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso positions that were recently characterized in the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are presumed to face the interior of the zzso did not exhibit functional channel zzso Nevertheless, significant expression levels of these zzso were observed at the zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso substitution at positions zzso zzso and zzso produces a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso recordings at low zzso concentration revealed that the increase in zzso sensitivity for the zzso zzso and zzso is due to an increase in the mean open zzso These results suggest that zzso substitution directly affects channel zzso primarily the channel closing zzso Our results suggest that zzso facing the interior of the protein zzso zzso and zzso may similarly affect channel gating in zzso and zzso zzso However, equivalent zzso zzso zzso and zzso presumably facing the zzso environment display a very different functional response between these two zzso zzso
