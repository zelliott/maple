A multiplex zzso was developed for simultaneous detection of the zzso zzso toxin zzso genes of zzso zzso Three primer pairs targeting each one of the zzso zzso and zzso genes were designed and combined in the same zzso zzso The zzso was evaluated with 100 zzso zzso strains recovered from humans and animals and it was found to be rapid and zzso Two zzso presented several deletions affecting both zzso and zzso zzso High prevalence zzso of the three zzso genes was found among zzso of different geographic zzso
