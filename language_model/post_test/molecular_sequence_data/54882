zzso receptors zzso zzso are indispensable components of zzso zzso cassette zzso in zzso Here, we report on the characterization and crystal structures in the closed and open zzso of zzso the zzso zzso of the putative zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified zzso as a zzso zzso protein with a zzso constant zzso for zzso of zzso Neither zzso zzso and zzso such as zzso and zzso nor zzso including zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso for binding to zzso Moreover, zzso does not bind zzso which is a common property of all but one zzso proteins characterized to zzso zzso determination of the X-ray structure revealed that zzso is structurally zzso to zzso proteins rather than to zzso zzso Two zzso are inserted in the zzso pocket, which reduces the cavity size and allows the exclusive binding of zzso specifically zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of three zzso from the binding pocket zzso zzso and zzso that interact with the zzso oriented zzso zzso of the bound zzso and subsequent functional analysis indicated that these zzso are crucial for zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of the zzso structure of a zzso zzso with exclusive affinity for zzso The putative role of a zzso import system in the context of zzso metabolism in zzso zzso is zzso
