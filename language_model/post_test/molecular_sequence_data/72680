We have zzso a zzso protein fused to the zzso virus 40 large T zzso zzso The fusion protein was targeted to the nucleus in transgenic tobacco plants with high zzso By contrast, authentic zzso was not enriched in the zzso of plant cells expressing comparable amounts of zzso For detailed zzso of the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso a nearly identical protein was expressed in zzso coli and zzso to zzso This protein was found to bind to zzso DNA with the same zzso and to promote the exchange of zzso DNA strands with the same zzso as authentic zzso It was concluded that the zzso modification did not alter any of the essential properties of zzso and that the fusion protein is a fully functional zzso zzso However, the zzso activity of this protein was 20 times greater than that of zzso in the absence of zzso zzso As with zzso this activity was further zzso by the addition of zzso zzso Since zzso activity is correlated with the ability of zzso to assume its high affinity state for DNA, the zzso zzso protein might be regarded as a zzso zzso zzso zzso fully functional in promoting zzso zzso
