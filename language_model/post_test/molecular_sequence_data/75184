Studies on New World zzso zzso have revealed interesting structural zzso in the zzso hormones of the zzso of zzso particularly with respect to insulin and zzso zzso we report the isolation and sequencing of a zzso zzso the precursor of pancreatic zzso zzso from a guinea pig zzso zzso zzso The zzso precursor sequence is predicted to include a zzso zzso signal zzso followed by the zzso acid zzso hormonal sequence and a large zzso zzso The sequence identity between guinea pig and human zzso is zzso zzso zzso and the predicted sequence is in agreement with that reported by zzso et zzso zzso zzso Huang, zzso Pan, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso In contrast, the zzso domain in the guinea pig precursor exhibits only zzso zzso identity with the corresponding human precursor domain, and the zzso extension differs greatly in both sequence and zzso The guinea pig precursor lacks the zzso processing site zzso found at the zzso zzso of the zzso domain in human, zzso zzso and zzso zzso An zzso is thus not likely to be liberated as such from this zzso Of particular interest in guinea pig zzso is the substitution of zzso for zzso at the zzso zzso acid processing site on the zzso side of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso protein zzso from a guinea pig zzso extract indicate that efficient zzso zzso takes place at this zzso site and that mature guinea pig zzso is normally zzso
