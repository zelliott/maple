Recently, we have proposed that the combination of zzso and zzso zzso is responsible for the association of the zzso class II region with zzso arthritis zzso According to this model, some zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso carriers to severe zzso but a self zzso of sequence zzso from the third zzso zzso region of some zzso zzso including zzso can protect from the disease if presented by zzso zzso This model implies that zzso zzso zzso and zzso should be able to present a set of common zzso despite zzso in their zzso binding zzso In the present study, we have further analyzed the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We found that the motif zzso guarantees zzso zzso and that R is the main anchor zzso for binding of the zzso zzso to zzso Interestingly, the zzso pocket that probably controls binding of the R zzso is identical in all four zzso zzso zzso Our results imply that the association of zzso with some DR zzso can be explained by their linkage with zzso zzso displaying a binding site for similar zzso zzso
