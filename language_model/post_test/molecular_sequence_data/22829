zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso pathogen that causes leaf zzso on tomato zzso zzso The fungus grows exclusively in the tomato leaf zzso where it zzso several small zzso zzso zzso proteins that are thought to play a role in disease zzso To investigate the role of these zzso and to identify their in zzso targets, a targeted zzso approach was zzso zzso zzso proteins were expressed as zzso fusion proteins carrying various zzso at either their zzso or zzso Although these fusion proteins were correctly expressed and zzso into the leaf zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso proteins failed, and affinity zzso did not result in the recovery of these zzso However, when using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific signals were obtained for the different zzso It is concluded that the stability of the in zzso expressed zzso fusion proteins is insufficient, which results in removal of the zzso from the fusion zzso irrespective of the zzso or zzso fusion or the nature of the zzso Similar phenomena were observed when the fusion proteins were expressed in other zzso species, but not when expressed in zzso zzso
