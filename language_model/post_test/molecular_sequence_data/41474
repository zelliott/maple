The small zzso related modifier zzso zzso protein modification is widely zzso among zzso Similar to zzso zzso modifications are attached to the zzso protein through three reaction steps by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso To date, multiple families of zzso zzso zzso have been reported in zzso and animals, but only two types of zzso zzso have been identified in zzso zzso and zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso protein 21 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso referred to as zzso Both proteins possess characteristic motifs termed zzso zzso zzso zzso and these motifs are zzso throughout the plant zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso zzso in zzso or zzso cause dwarf zzso and that the zzso of zzso is caused by the zzso of salicylic acid zzso However, we demonstrate here that the zzso of zzso does not depend on zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso driven by the zzso promoter does not complement the zzso zzso indicating that they are not functional zzso Lastly, we show that the zzso and zzso double zzso results in embryonic zzso supporting the hypothesis that they have zzso roles during zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso and zzso function independently and that their combined zzso is essential for plant zzso
