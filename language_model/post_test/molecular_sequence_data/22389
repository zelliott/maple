zzso at the zzso can influence zzso substitution patterns for zzso zzso which in turn can affect their performance as zzso zzso In this study, we compare two zzso nuclear genes that appear to have evolved under markedly different selective constraints and evaluate how selection has shaped their zzso zzso We zzso zzso zzso of zzso 6 of the gene zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso from most of the currently recognized zzso of New World zzso zzso zzso and compared these data to an existing zzso of sequences from the zzso zzso protein gene zzso and zzso zzso In comparison to zzso zzso has far fewer sites under strong zzso selection and exhibits a number of sites under positive directional zzso Furthermore, selection on the zzso protein appears to conserve short, zzso zzso zzso rather than primary zzso acid zzso as a result, zzso has significantly different zzso substitution patterns from zzso Using zzso methods, we determined that zzso zzso almost zzso faster than zzso has zzso times more variable sites, has less zzso rate zzso is skewed toward A and away from CT zzso has relatively even base zzso and has a significantly lower rate of change between zzso and any other zzso Despite these different zzso substitution patterns, estimates of zzso relationships based on separate zzso analyses of these genes are remarkably zzso whether patterns of zzso substitution are explicitly modeled or zzso Nonetheless, zzso contains more zzso zzso characters per unit sequence and resolves more zzso with higher support than does zzso Thus, for these two zzso relaxed functional constraints and positive selection appear to improve the efficiency of zzso zzso without compromising its zzso
