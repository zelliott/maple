Four kinds of circular zzso DNA, designated zzso zzso B3 and zzso have been found in the zzso of rice zzso zzso zzso We analyzed the distribution of families of zzso zzso zzso to those of zzso zzso in 40 strains of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed only strains having zzso zzso and zzso zzso The distribution patterns of strains with AA zzso were highly zzso We amplified the zzso zzso from strains with the AA zzso by zzso and examined restriction fragments length zzso zzso zzso were detected among families of zzso DNA amplified from different zzso This result indicated that some zzso such as base zzso and the zzso or deletion of a small zzso of DNA, had occurred and had accumulated during the differentiation of strains with an AA zzso
