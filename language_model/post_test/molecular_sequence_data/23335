An zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed based on newly derived sequences from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as several previously described sequences of zzso zzso and sequences of zzso zzso zzso of the marine zzso zzso zzso This zzso is specific for the targeted organisms, which represent a zzso zzso zzso and can detect as few as 50 cells in a standard zzso when it is used as a reverse primer together with the zzso and zzso forward primer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Use of this primer pair in the zzso allowed analysis of the distribution of marine zzso zzso zzso along a zzso following the 67 degrees E zzso from Victoria, zzso to Muscat, zzso zzso degrees S to 26 degrees N) in the Arabian zzso These organisms were found to be zzso located in warm zzso degrees zzso zzso subsurface waters between 0 and 7 degrees zzso but they were also found at a station north of zzso at 26 degrees zzso 56 degrees zzso where similar water column conditions zzso zzso cooler zzso waters zzso degrees zzso did not contain these organisms or the numbers were considerably reduced, suggesting that temperature is a key factor in dictating the abundance of this zzso zzso zzso lineage in marine zzso
