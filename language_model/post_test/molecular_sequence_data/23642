We have isolated a zzso from zzso zzso that encodes a predicted zzso channel zzso zzso Secondary structure predictions and database searches reveal that zzso is zzso related to zzso zzso channels, such as the zzso zzso though there are marked differences in the sequences of the putative channel forming zzso zzso has zzso sequence identity to the zzso zzso predicted zzso zzso zzso trees show that these two zzso are the most divergent members of the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso No close zzso are present in zzso suggesting that their function may be specific to zzso zzso experiments using a zzso of zzso with zzso zzso failed to reveal any obvious zzso so the function of these channels remains zzso
