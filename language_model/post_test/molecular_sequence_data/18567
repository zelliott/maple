zzso zzso zzso is a zzso modification regulating proteins involved in a variety of cellular processes and zzso Unfortunately, zzso remains challenging to detect and zzso by shotgun mass zzso zzso where it is time-consuming and zzso Here, we investigate the potential of Multiple zzso Monitoring Mass zzso zzso a targeted zzso method, to detect and zzso native zzso modified peptides without extensive labeling and zzso We report the ability of zzso to detect a standard zzso zzso and show that the method is robust to zzso the amount of zzso zzso with a method detection limit of 3 zzso In addition, when diluted by zzso in a zzso whole cell zzso the zzso zzso remains zzso Next, we apply this strategy to study zzso zzso zzso beta zzso a zzso able to compete with zzso zzso and modify identical site on zzso We demonstrate that zzso is itself modified by zzso in human embryonic stem cells zzso Indeed, by only using gel zzso to zzso enrich zzso from whole cell zzso we discover by zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso bearing 3 potential zzso zzso We confirm our finding by zzso the increase of zzso following zzso treatment with an zzso zzso zzso This novel zzso could potentially be involved in an zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report utilizing zzso to detect native zzso modified zzso This could potentially facilitate rapid discovery and zzso of new zzso zzso
