zzso is a ubiquitous and highly zzso zzso protein that is hypothesized to play a mechanical zzso role in the unusual gliding zzso of zzso zzso and their active penetration of host zzso We have identified and isolated an zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso library by random zzso The complete zzso sequence of the zzso gene is zzso zzso a single open reading frame encodes a zzso of 377 zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed a high zzso with zzso from other species, especially with reported zzso zzso The zzso against zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli recognizes a zzso native zzso which is consistent with its expected zzso zzso and zzso microscopic observation revealed that the protein is zzso distributed throughout the zzso zzso zzso
