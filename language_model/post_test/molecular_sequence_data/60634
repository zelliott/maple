zzso zzso plays a key role in the zzso 2 type immune zzso In domestic animal species no sequence information is available for the zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation and sequencing of the cattle zzso zzso Since a zzso zzso probe failed to zzso to cattle zzso DNA the gene was identified by a zzso sequencing zzso In human and mouse both zzso are located within a region of about 30 zzso zzso Therefore the region upstream of the cattle zzso gene has been zzso by a shotgun zzso The cattle zzso gene was found to be located about 20 zzso upstream of zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso structure and the promoter region is well zzso across zzso The alignment of the zzso sequences from different species allowed the identification of highly zzso zzso acid positions and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso acid positions zzso and zzso are most probably zzso to the zzso zzso zzso One of the potential binding sites for zzso factors is located at position zzso to zzso and is closely related to the P elements of the zzso zzso Nevertheless, the overall identity of the promoter sequences of zzso and zzso is zzso Therefore we conclude that both zzso use diverse regulatory zzso There is evidence that zzso but not zzso is the key zzso in allergic zzso zzso zzso is involved in resistance to some zzso Therefore zzso is of interest for disease association studies in domestic zzso
