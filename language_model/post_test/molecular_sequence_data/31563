zzso replacement is the method of choice for X-ray zzso structure determination provided that suitable structural zzso are available in the zzso zzso there are zzso structures in the zzso zzso were deposited in the year 2012 zzso of which zzso have been solved by molecular zzso For successful molecular replacement the model must cover at least 50% of the total structure and the zzso zzso between the core model and the structure to be solved must be less than 2 zzso Here, an approach originally implemented in the zzso server zzso based on zzso zzso to search for a zzso solution is zzso How the use of as much information as possible from different sources can improve the zzso is briefly zzso The combination of structural information with zzso related sequences is crucial to zzso the multiple alignment that will define the boundaries of the core zzso zzso clusters zzso with zzso identical zzso can also provide information on the eventual changes in zzso and will help to explore the relative zzso assumed by protein zzso zzso analysis can also help in generating series of zzso models in the search for a zzso zzso Of course, finding a correct solution is only the first step and the accuracy of the identified solution is as important as the data quality to proceed through zzso Here, some possible reasons for failure are discussed and solutions are proposed using a set of successful zzso
