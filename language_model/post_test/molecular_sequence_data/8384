The zzso zzso coli strain 536 zzso carries two unstable DNA regions on its zzso which were termed zzso islands zzso Both zzso islands, zzso I and zzso II, are incorporated into zzso specific zzso zzso I is located in the zzso gene for zzso zzso and zzso II is integrated in the zzso zzso locus zzso zzso strain zzso has lost the two zzso islands together with the intact zzso zzso While 536 is a virulent strain, zzso has lost a number of properties, including in zzso zzso In previous publications we reported that the genes coding for two zzso zzso I, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are located on the zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that the expression of other gene products influencing zzso properties in addition to in zzso zzso are strongly dependent on the intact zzso zzso zzso and zzso In order to determine the influence of the two zzso on the expression of these properties, the genes zzso and zzso were cloned from the zzso of strain 536 and then introduced into the zzso zzso Our results clearly show that the zzso zzso zzso directly influences the ability of the bacteria to grow under zzso conditions, because zzso is part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is involved in mixed acid zzso The rare zzso zzso zzso by zzso influences a number if properties including type 1 zzso production, zzso and zzso production of zzso and serum resistance, and is also necessary for full in zzso zzso While the zzso is directly involved in the production of zzso the zzso specific zzso appears to influence the expression of various factors through specific zzso or zzso control zzso
