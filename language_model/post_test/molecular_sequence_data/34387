Analysis of protein zzso is an effective means to understand their zzso zzso display is an approach that allows large numbers of zzso of a protein to be selected based on their activity, but only a handful with zzso activity have been traditionally identified for subsequent functional zzso However, the recent application of zzso sequencing zzso to protein display and selection has enabled simultaneous assessment of the function of hundreds of thousands of zzso that span the activity range from high to zzso Such deep zzso scanning approaches are rapid and inexpensive with the potential for broad zzso In this review, we discuss the emergence of deep zzso zzso the challenges associated with its use and some of its exciting zzso
