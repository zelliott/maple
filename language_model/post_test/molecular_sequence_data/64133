zzso zzso of zzso zzso isolated from zzso collected from eastern zzso zzso zzso zzso inhabiting an Australian water zzso revealed that this host was susceptible to three types of zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso wall protein zzso and a zzso heat shock protein zzso identified an isolate identical to the described zzso zzso zzso A second isolate had less than zzso variation, compared to the described zzso zzso zzso within the sequences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso variation in the internal transcribed zzso 1 zzso zzso analysis of the third zzso revealed a novel zzso that had a degree of genetic variation, at the four zzso zzso which was greater than or equivalent to that used to discriminate between currently zzso zzso zzso These findings have increased our current understanding on the molecular epidemiology of zzso in Australian wildlife and have provided information on the types of zzso zzso may shed into the zzso
