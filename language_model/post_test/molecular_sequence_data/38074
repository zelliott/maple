zzso zzso are the only zzso that can zzso their limbs throughout their zzso The critical feature of limb zzso is the formation of a zzso a process that requires an intact nerve zzso Nerves appear to provide an unidentified factor, known as the zzso factor zzso which stimulates cycling of zzso zzso One candidate zzso is zzso growth factor zzso a member of the zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso are both survival factors and zzso to zzso cells, including zzso zzso All forms of zzso contain an zzso domain that is sufficient to activate zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso To investigate the involvement of zzso in zzso limb zzso we cloned and characterized one zzso zzso a zzso with a zzso domain zzso from zzso zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso of in zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso root zzso and spinal zzso zzso that zzso the zzso We also demonstrated the biological activity of zzso human zzso zzso in zzso limb zzso When zzso was injected into zzso zzso zzso zzso the labeling index zzso of zzso cells was maintained at a level near to that of control, zzso zzso whereas without zzso the zzso decreased zzso In another experiment, zzso was delivered into zzso zzso zzso either by direct infusion into zzso or by injection into the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were rescued into a zzso zzso
