zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso 25, which belongs to the group II of zzso bacteria, is able to zzso the zzso of methanol to zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso by a 5 step procedure to zzso zzso After cell disruption by French press, about zzso of zzso was found in the soluble zzso The relative molecular mass of the native zzso has been estimated to be 122 zzso by gel zzso and 115 zzso by the method of zzso and Smith zzso It seems to be composed of two identical zzso with a relative molecular mass of 62 zzso zzso by zzso gel zzso The zzso point was found to be about zzso The zzso terminal sequence shows a strong similarity to the zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the probable prosthetic group of zzso could be detected in the zzso of the culture by using the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso but not absolutely in the zzso zzso of the zzso after zzso The zzso zzso has an optimum activity at pH zzso and at 45 degrees zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso only primary alcohols from methanol to zzso and zzso from zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso The estimated zzso show no dependence upon the chain length of zzso
