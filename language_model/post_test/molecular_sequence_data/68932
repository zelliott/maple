We have analyzed the T cell zzso zzso repertoire found in the major zzso complex class zzso zzso T zzso zzso response to the protein zzso zzso Despite skewing towards the expression of V beta zzso by zzso zzso from zzso mice, we found a relatively high degree of diversity in zzso usage in both zzso zzso and zzso Closer examination showed that the majority of these sequences zzso zzso and positively charged zzso at their respective zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso These junctions form the third zzso regions zzso of the zzso zzso involved in the direct interaction with the class zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso complexes predict that the major zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two exposed charged side chains which can contact the zzso These are the zzso charged zzso acid at zzso position 6 zzso and the positively charged zzso at zzso To examine whether the zzso zzso makes contact with zzso zzso we established a single chain zzso transgenic zzso mouse line where all T cells express a zzso zzso derived from the V beta zzso clone zzso zzso T cells derived from in zzso primed transgenic mice zzso expressed zzso zzso that also contained zzso charged zzso zzso despite some further variation in V alpha and J alpha zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso transgenic T cells with a zzso substitution zzso analogue induced a T cell response that was no longer zzso with the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso from the T cell clone B3 can determine the specificity for this zzso zzso these results reveal the existence of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso specific for zzso and identify their possible orientation over the zzso I zzso
