Full length zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cloned and characterized from the German zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that both genes possess all the typical features of ace, and that zzso is zzso to the insect zzso whereas zzso is to the insect zzso zzso level of zzso was significantly higher zzso 10 zzso than that of zzso in all 11 zzso zzso suggesting that zzso likely encodes a zzso zzso Multiple zzso bands were identified by native zzso gel zzso and zzso from various tissue zzso among which zzso produced distinct two major and two minor zzso bands, indicative of the presence of at least two active zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to be mainly localized in the central nervous system as demonstrated by zzso activity zzso together with quantitative analysis of zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso of the 1st zzso zzso confirmed that zzso is predominantly transcribed and further showed that its transcript is found in almost entire region of zzso or motor zzso including the cell bodies and zzso zzso zzso transcript is found only in the subset of zzso particularly in the cell zzso In addition, certain zzso were observed to express zzso zzso
