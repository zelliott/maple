The zzso zzso zzso zzso associated zzso finger motif is characteristically defined by a zzso and seven zzso that are zzso arranged in a zzso consensus zzso This unique zinc finger, found primarily in a wide variety of zzso zzso is considered to mediate zzso zzso We have isolated a novel human zzso zzso zzso (for zzso B virus zzso associated zzso zzso has three alternatively spliced zzso We also identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Based on alignment of four different zzso we found a novel zzso domain in zzso that we designated the zzso zzso domain zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso when recruited to DNA via the DNA binding of zzso Furthermore, the zzso finger alone zzso to repress transcription, thus zzso a functional role to this zzso The gene zzso is localized to the long arm of human zzso 11 between zzso and zzso This region is amplified and rearranged in many tumors, suggesting a role for zzso in zzso similar to that of other zzso zzso
