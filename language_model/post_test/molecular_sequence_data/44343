The structure of a zzso binding domain from mouse zzso modifier protein 1 zzso was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso The protein consists of an zzso zzso zzso zzso which folds against a zzso zzso The structure reveals an unexpected zzso to two zzso DNA binding proteins which are also involved in zzso zzso zzso comparisons suggest that zzso zzso of which more than 40 are now known, act as protein interaction motifs and that the zzso protein acts as an zzso zzso interactions between different zzso
