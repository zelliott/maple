The zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and its sequence zzso The open reading frame consists of 825 zzso specifying a protein of 275 zzso acid zzso corresponding to a predicted molecular weight of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso did not share significant zzso acid sequence similarity with any other zzso zzso of the zzso zzso coding sequence in zzso coli under control of the zzso coli zzso promoter resulted in the production of zzso active protein with an affinity constant similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso This is the first zzso sequence report of the zzso zzso an zzso involved in the zzso bond zzso
