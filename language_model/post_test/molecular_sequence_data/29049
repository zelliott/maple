The viral protein zzso linked to the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso can be an zzso zzso in incompatible zzso combinations in which the resistance prevents systemic virus zzso The mechanism is not well zzso This study shows that virus zzso resistance to systemic infection with zzso virus A zzso in zzso zzso is overcome by a single zzso acid zzso zzso zzso in the viral zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and other experiments revealed that zzso controls zzso loading of zzso The critical boundary may be constituted in zzso zzso companion cells, or zzso zzso also controls the cellular level of virus zzso in infected leaves, including zzso zzso zzso acid zzso at three additional positions of the central part zzso zzso and C zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and of the N zzso of the zzso protein zzso 5) affect virus zzso and rate of systemic infection but are not sufficient for zzso loading of zzso These data, together with previous studies, indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso crucial for systemic infection are host zzso Also, our data and previous studies on other zzso species combinations indicate that the central part of the zzso is a domain with universal importance to zzso interactions required for systemic invasion of plants with zzso
