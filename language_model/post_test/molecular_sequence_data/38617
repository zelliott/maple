Since the work done by zzso Emerson in the 1930s, zzso of zzso zzso has been recognized as a zzso genetic modifier of zzso in zzso leaf zzso zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso We have shown that zzso specifically zzso proliferation and differentiation of zzso defective cells in zzso zzso Leaf narrowing is due to loss of intermediate veins and ground tissue located at leaf margins, and the few remaining zzso defective cells are of irregular size and zzso zzso The zzso gene has been cloned by targeted zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed throughout young leaves, but zzso zzso indicate that the expression of zzso at leaf margins is sufficient to suppress both the lateral expansion of zzso leaves and the extent of zzso zzso protein appears to zzso a zzso protein with sequence similarity to a family of bacterial zzso involved in carbon zzso repression or in carbon zzso We propose that the action of zzso in nuclear and zzso communication could be triggered by carbon zzso
