zzso zzso from five zzso forest zzso zzso zzso from spruce zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso from jack pine zzso zzso zzso zzso and western spruce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from large zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the forest tent zzso zzso zzso were compared based on their small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Four of the species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have a high zzso zzso sequence identity zzso and are members of the zzso zzso zzso They all showed the reverse arrangement of the zzso zzso zzso transcribed zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The fifth species, zzso zzso has the usual zzso arrangement and is not a member of this zzso showing only an zzso sequence zzso We speculate, therefore, that a genetic reversal may have occurred in the common zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the mechanism for zzso of the zzso gene zzso is not known we provide a possible explanation for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso CO clustered together on the zzso zzso zzso The high sequence similarities, the reverse arrangement in the zzso gene zzso and the zzso zzso suggest that these three species are closely related but separate zzso
