We have discovered a distinct zzso boundary at a site between 650 and 800 zzso upstream of the zzso repeat in the first zzso of the human zzso zzso This boundary, identified by zzso sequencing, is present in all human cell lines and cell types, irrespective of age, zzso and zzso zzso The same boundary is found also in different mouse zzso although sequence zzso between human and mouse in this region is only zzso This boundary zzso in both the zzso and the zzso zzso binds specifically to nuclear proteins from human zzso We interpret this boundary as carrying a specific zzso structure that zzso a zzso area in the zzso from the zzso zzso promoter and protecting it from the spreading of DNA zzso In individuals with the fragile X syndrome zzso the zzso boundary is zzso zzso has penetrated into the zzso promoter and zzso the zzso zzso In one zzso zzso the upstream zzso of the zzso boundary region exhibits decreased zzso as compared to that of healthy zzso This finding suggests changes in zzso sequence and zzso structure in the boundary region of this zzso zzso In the completely de zzso zzso zzso promoter, there are isolated zzso zzso zzso that are, however, not found when the zzso promoter and upstream sequences are zzso in zzso with the bacterial zzso DNA zzso They may arise during de zzso zzso only in DNA that is organized in zzso and be due to the binding of specific zzso
