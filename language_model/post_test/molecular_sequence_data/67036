zzso zzso is a zzso process that influences cell growth, zzso and zzso How zzso zzso impacts development, however, is poorly zzso Here, we establish a link between zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso that affects zzso proliferation and zzso Previously, we determined that zzso is required in the zzso the zzso zzso promote normal proliferation and prevent zzso tumor zzso Here, we report that zzso like its zzso zzso zzso influences zzso zzso zzso tumors are suppressed by zzso in zzso or zzso both of which elevate zzso zzso Thus, in this context, zzso acts as a zzso zzso tumor zzso We further report the characterization of two additional genes identified for their zzso tumor zzso zzso and zzso and find that they, too, zzso zzso of proteins involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that depletion of additional zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso factors display zzso similar to depletion of zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso sheath is particularly sensitive to zzso in zzso zzso and that zzso zzso defects in one tissue can zzso influence proliferation in an adjacent zzso
