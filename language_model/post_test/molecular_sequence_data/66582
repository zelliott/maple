Human zzso virus type 1 zzso exclusively selects zzso as the primer for the initiation of reverse transcription, even though both zzso and zzso are found in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso site (PBS) to be complementary to alternate zzso results in the use of those zzso for zzso indicating that primer zzso with the PBS is an important zzso of primer zzso In previous studies, we have exploited this fact to develop a system in which zzso zzso zzso zzso is provided in trans to complement the replication of zzso with a PBS complementary to zzso zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that the presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso might account for the preference for the selection of zzso in zzso zzso To establish a zzso system more reflective of zzso primer selection, we have altered the zzso PBS to be complementary to the zzso coli zzso which shares near identity with zzso zzso except in the zzso zzso sequence that binds to the zzso zzso coli zzso expressed from a zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso of cells with a zzso that encodes zzso coli zzso and a zzso zzso an zzso zzso with a PBS complementary to zzso coli zzso resulted in the production of infectious zzso A comparison of the two zzso systems revealed that higher levels of zzso zzso coli zzso than of zzso zzso were needed to achieve equal levels of infectious virus, indicating that there was no preferential selection of zzso coli zzso To examine the specificity of zzso selection, zzso coli zzso was modified to zzso This zzso was also zzso when expressed in zzso cells and zzso the zzso of zzso at levels similar to those seen for zzso coli zzso Additional zzso in the zzso of zzso coli zzso were zzso these zzso did not significantly correlate with the capacity of the zzso primer to complement zzso of zzso even though they had a drastic effect on the zzso of the zzso The results of these studies demonstrate that zzso coli zzso provided in trans can complement zzso zzso with the PBS altered to zzso coli zzso However, the capacity of zzso to interact with zzso zzso does not entirely explain the enhanced preference for selection of zzso for the replication of zzso
