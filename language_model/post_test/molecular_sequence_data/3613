A selection strategy, the zzso zzso was used in order to identify genes of human zzso zzso that zzso strong zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This approach is based on the isolation of zzso zzso from a zzso fusion library by means of selective zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso cells by a zzso T zzso zzso With this screening strategy, we were able to isolate two types of plasmids zzso zzso fusion proteins from a library of random zzso DNA zzso One zzso contained the zzso 3 of the zzso zzso gene region, which has previously been identified as a strong zzso zzso zzso In the second type of zzso the open reading frame zzso zzso of zzso was fused to the zzso zzso zzso By quantitative zzso mapping using zzso zzso analysis, we were able to zzso zzso as a strong zzso zzso domain with no apparent zzso to characterized zzso zzso Western zzso analysis with a specific zzso zzso raised against a zzso zzso fusion protein revealed that two protein zzso of 21 and 27 zzso are derived from the zzso zzso in both infected and zzso zzso Both protein zzso which arise via alternative usage of two zzso zzso start zzso showed a nuclear zzso and could be detected as early as 6 h after infection of primary human zzso By performing Western zzso analysis with zzso zzso combined with zzso experiments, we provide evidence that zzso is a novel zzso protein of zzso that is imported during viral zzso Furthermore, we observed zzso of the zzso major zzso zzso by zzso whereas several early and late promoters were not zzso Our data suggest that zzso is a novel zzso protein of zzso with a strong zzso zzso domain that could play an important role during initiation of the viral zzso zzso
