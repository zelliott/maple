zzso calcium channels are classified into low zzso and high zzso zzso We have investigated the molecular basis for this difference in zzso dependence of zzso by constructing zzso between a low zzso channel zzso and a high zzso channel zzso focusing on zzso zzso zzso Wild type and zzso were expressed in zzso and zzso zzso clamp recordings were made of calcium channel zzso Replacement of zzso I, III, or IV of the zzso zzso channel with the corresponding domain of zzso led zzso high zzso zzso for these zzso the zzso zzso zzso were similar to those for zzso wild zzso However, replacement of domain II gave only a small shift to the right of the zzso curve and zzso of the zzso zzso but did not lead to a high zzso channel with an zzso curve like zzso zzso We also investigated the role of the zzso sensor zzso by replacing the zzso segment of zzso with that of zzso zzso For domain I, there was no shift in the zzso curve zzso compared with zzso and there were relatively small shifts to the right for zzso III and zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso I, III, and IV (rather than domain zzso are apparently critical for channel opening and, therefore, contribute strongly to the difference in zzso dependence of zzso between zzso zzso and zzso However, the zzso segments in zzso I, zzso and IV did not account for this difference in zzso zzso
