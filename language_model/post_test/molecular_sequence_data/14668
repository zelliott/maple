zzso zzso examinations were performed, and zzso DNA was isolated with standard methods for genetic zzso All 14 zzso of zzso were amplified with zzso and screened for zzso with direct DNA zzso Two hundred unrelated healthy Chinese subjects were screened to exclude zzso zzso Multiple alignments of eight zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

A total of 101 zzso patients, drawn from 100 unrelated families, were selected for zzso screening in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified in two affected sisters and zzso with their zzso Four previously reported zzso were identified in this zzso No other zzso zzso was zzso The frequency spectrum of variations in the zzso gene was estimated to be zzso zzso in this cohort of Chinese patients with zzso The two patients showed classical signs of zzso with relatively preserved central vision and retinal zzso 

The zzso zzso is a rare cause of zzso in the Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are related to a relatively mild zzso zzso zzso characterization of patients with zzso zzso is important for future rational zzso
