Development of the zzso eye requires a series of steps including zzso of the anterior neural plate, zzso of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and the cellular differentiation of the lens and zzso zzso zzso especially the zzso regulator zzso play a critical role in zzso and zzso eye zzso zzso in zzso function result in eye zzso known as zzso in humans and Small eye syndrome in zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is also necessary for correct zzso eye development, and its zzso leads to formation of zzso eyes in zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for normal eye development, and that its zzso has profound effects on eye zzso zzso zzso injected with synthetic zzso zzso develop zzso retinal tissue and display zzso in the zzso Mouse zzso carrying a zzso zzso of this gene do not form zzso cups and so do not develop zzso The zzso gene family plays an important role in the establishment and/or proliferation of retinal zzso zzso
