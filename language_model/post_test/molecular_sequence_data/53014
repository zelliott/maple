We have determined the crystal structure of the zzso coli zzso recycling factor zzso which zzso the zzso of the termination complex in protein zzso The L-shaped zzso consists of two zzso a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso The zzso domain has a zzso shape and zzso charged surface, which are reminiscent of the zzso arm of zzso and domain IV of zzso factor zzso We suggest that zzso binds to the zzso zzso through its zzso domain, which is a zzso zzso The relative position of the two zzso is changed about an axis along the zzso zzso in the hinge where the zzso chain of a zzso zzso is zzso The zzso mimicry and the domain movement observed in zzso provide a structural basis for understanding the role of zzso in protein zzso
