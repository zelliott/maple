Previously the analysis of promoters regulated by zzso zzso zzso stress identified a composite promoter element, zzso that interacts with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This prompted us to investigate the underlying mechanism by which zzso a zzso binding zzso factor, specifically controls zzso zzso during zzso zzso The in zzso DNA binding study performed using zzso zzso proteins revealed that zzso specifically recruits zzso to zzso DNA but it does not interact with zzso in absence of DNA zzso zzso of zzso binding resulted in a significant reduction of optimal zzso zzso of cellular genes during zzso zzso Analysis of cellular promoters by zzso demonstrated that zzso is needed for recruitment of both zzso and zzso but not for either zzso of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso during zzso zzso Together these study results reveal that zzso controls zzso zzso zzso through recruitment of both zzso and zzso but not through zzso zzso Our observations are in agreement with the results of recently published studies that have shown that zzso controls zzso of varieties of zzso promoters through recruitment of general zzso factors but not through zzso of zzso zzso These findings provide a paradigm of the function of zzso in zzso zzso
