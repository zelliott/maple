A gene zzso the universal stress protein zzso was cloned from zzso coli zzso isolated from a zzso zzso The zzso sequence was determined and the zzso acid sequence zzso The gene was found to be highly zzso and shared zzso zzso with the same gene of zzso coli zzso Within an zzso pair zzso region zzso a zzso mismatch existed between zzso coli K-12 and zzso of which 11 base pairs were internal to the structural gene of zzso However, only an area with a zzso mismatch caused an zzso acid zzso changing an zzso to an zzso at position zzso
