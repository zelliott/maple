zzso of zzso zzso is indispensable for the treatment of acute zzso zzso zzso We have previously reported the synthesis of a highly constrained zzso zzso that incorporates the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding to human zzso zzso We have tested the safety and efficacy of the zzso on the zzso induced carotid artery zzso experimental rabbit zzso The zzso effects on carotid blood flow, zzso weight, zzso and ex zzso zzso zzso and bleeding and zzso parameters were zzso The zzso was administered via the zzso zzso zzso blood flow was continuously monitored for zzso after electrical zzso zzso The zzso at zzso prevented total artery zzso and significantly preserved carotid zzso zzso compared with zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso administration at zzso reduced zzso weight, whereas it inhibited ex zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso presented significantly higher zzso effects on AA and zzso ex zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso The zzso at any dose did not affect the zzso zzso the bleeding times or the zzso response of the zzso Thus highly constrained zzso peptides like zzso zzso that incorporate the zzso motif and zzso certain zzso criteria represent novel compounds that zzso inhibit zzso formation, ex zzso zzso zzso and carotid artery zzso zzso to other zzso zzso such as zzso without causing zzso complications in a rabbit model of zzso zzso
