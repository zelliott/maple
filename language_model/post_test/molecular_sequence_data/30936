zzso clones of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated using the corresponding zzso clones zzso zzso et zzso zzso White et zzso zzso The site corresponding to the initiation of zzso was defined by primer extension for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sequences of the zzso clones revealed the presence of zzso in each of the zzso The zzso gene has three zzso one immediately following the initiation zzso one between zzso acids 26 and 27 zzso and zzso and one between zzso acids 64 and 65 zzso and zzso The zzso gene has two zzso the positions of which are identical to the first two zzso of the zzso zzso The chicken zzso zzso gene has been recently zzso and it contains four zzso zzso et zzso zzso The first three of these are in the same positions as the zzso in the zzso zzso The fourth zzso interrupts zzso acid 108 zzso In all cases the sizes and the sequences of the zzso are zzso However, the fact that they are in zzso positions suggests that at least two of the zzso were present in the ancestral zzso A zzso tree constructed from the sequences of the zzso and major cell zzso zzso zzso proteins from several species indicates that the zzso zzso proteins are zzso separate and distinct from the major cell zzso zzso zzso zzso The ancestral zzso gene must have duplicated and zzso before zzso and zzso zzso from the rest of the zzso zzso In addition, it appears that the zzso zzso zzso proteins analyzed here are more zzso than the major zzso zzso zzso
