The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with high affinity for its primary zzso Its role as a zzso zzso makes it an important zzso both in cell zzso to the basement membrane and in zzso zzso following this binding zzso The protein also plays critical roles in the zzso of zzso zzso Isolation of the protein from either normal or zzso cells results in a product with an zzso molecular mass of 67 zzso This protein is believed to be derived from a smaller zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the precise mechanism by which zzso zzso becomes zzso zzso is zzso The process may involve zzso fatty zzso of the protein combined with either zzso or zzso possibly with a zzso zzso Furthermore, it has become clear that acting as a zzso for zzso is not the only function of this zzso zzso also acts as a zzso for zzso such as zzso virus and dengue virus, and is involved with zzso of the prion zzso Interestingly, unmodified zzso is a zzso component and zzso of this protein are found in all five zzso In addition, it appears to be strongly associated with zzso in the zzso cell nucleus, although the precise role of these interactions is not zzso Here we review the current understanding of the structure and function of this zzso as well as highlighting areas requiring further zzso
