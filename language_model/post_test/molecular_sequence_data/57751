The zzso gene product is a positive regulatory factor required for the synthesis of the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso by the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis has suggested that zzso may be the signal zzso zzso however, the zzso function of the zzso gene product is not zzso We have cloned the zzso gene and zzso the zzso A zzso fusion was shown to be a valid reporter since its expression is regulated by the level of zzso zzso and is controlled by the same regulatory factors that regulate zzso zzso To zzso the mechanism by which zzso functions, we have isolated and cloned dominant zzso in the zzso gene which zzso zzso synthesis of acid zzso We have demonstrated that zzso of the negative regulatory factor, zzso but not the negative regulatory factor zzso partially blocks the zzso acid zzso synthesis in a strain containing a dominant zzso zzso of zzso This suggests that zzso may function by interacting with zzso or that these molecules compete for the same zzso
