zzso is a zzso zzso that specifically zzso zzso 20 of zzso zzso zzso In this study we attempted to identify zzso proteins reasoning that these proteins would provide important insights into the role of zzso in zzso zzso Using an unbiased zzso zzso approach, we discovered that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This interaction was confirmed in human cells and we demonstrated that zzso was zzso modified with zzso in zzso Further in zzso studies revealed that zzso directly binds zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Two putative zzso consensus sites were identified in this region and both were capable of being zzso in zzso The absence of either or both zzso sites did not zzso nuclear zzso of zzso By employing whole zzso expression zzso we identified a panel of genes whose expression was significantly altered in the absence of zzso The vast majority of these genes displayed increased expression strongly suggesting that zzso predominantly functions as a zzso zzso zzso the reduction of zzso resulted in the consistent zzso of several of these newly identified genes regulated by zzso Our findings indicate that direct interaction with zzso zzso the repressive effects of zzso at specific target zzso most likely by zzso zzso
