zzso zzso corresponding to consensus sequences of third and sixth zzso zzso of G zzso zzso zzso were used for the zzso chain reaction amplification and consecutive characterization of G zzso receptors present in cultured rabbit zzso smooth muscle zzso One of the isolated resulting fragments was highly zzso to the corresponding region of the zzso zzso B2 zzso cloned in other zzso The zzso chain reaction zzso was used to screen a rabbit zzso library, which allowed the identification of an zzso zzso open reading frame which codes for a zzso acid zzso zzso The rabbit B2 zzso sequence is more than zzso identical to the ones determined in three other species and retain putative zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the rabbit zzso zzso an zzso zzso sequence was found 8 base pairs upstream of the start zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a high expression of a major transcript zzso zzso in the rabbit kidney and zzso and a less abundant expression in other zzso Southern zzso experiments suggest that a single copy of this gene exists in the rabbit zzso The cloned rabbit B2 zzso expressed in zzso cells binds zzso in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso and this zzso competes with a series of zzso zzso and zzso with a rank order consistent with the B2 zzso zzso The insurmountable character of the antagonism exerted by zzso 140 against BK on the rabbit B2 zzso previously shown in pharmacological experiments, was confirmed in binding experiments with the cloned zzso expressed in a controlled zzso By contrast, zzso 140 zzso with zzso in a zzso manner for the human B2 zzso expressed in zzso zzso The cloning of the rabbit B2 zzso will be useful notably for the study of the structural basis of zzso binding and for studies on zzso regulation in a relatively large zzso
