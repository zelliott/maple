We have determined the DNA sequence for the zzso end of the zzso gene of zzso zzso including part of the coding region and the 200 zzso immediately zzso A zzso zzso was found to have lost all of the sequence lying normally in front of the gene except for the 33 zzso preceding the zzso zzso The role of the zzso domain in initiation and regulation of zzso zzso was assessed by a gene fusion zzso The zzso coli zzso zzso was truncated of the eight zzso zzso zzso in zzso on a zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso regions of zzso leaving only the first 19 zzso zzso and approximately 1600 zzso of the region preceding zzso on the zzso zzso The fused gene was expressed in phase and was still submitted to the two mechanisms regulating the zzso zzso zzso the general, probably zzso control of zzso acid zzso and the specific, apparently zzso control zzso by the products of the zzso zzso These results suggest a determining role for the zzso end portion of the zzso zzso in the specific zzso control zzso
