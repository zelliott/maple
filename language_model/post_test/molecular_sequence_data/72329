The sea zzso early zzso repeating unit contains one copy of each of the five zzso genes whose coordinate expression during development is regulated by zzso zzso To learn how within the zzso repeating unit a zzso zzso can be prevented to communicate with the zzso zzso we searched for domain boundaries by using the zzso blocking zzso We focused on the region near the 3' end of the zzso gene where zzso zzso zzso sites appear upon zzso of the early zzso zzso We demonstrated that a DNA zzso of 265 zzso in zzso defined as zzso (for zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso activity of the zzso zzso in zzso sea zzso zzso only when placed between the zzso elements and the zzso We also found that zzso silenced the zzso elements even when placed at zzso zzso from the zzso By contrast, the zzso activity of the zzso zzso located downstream to the coding region, was not affected when zzso was positioned in close proximity to the zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso placed between the zzso virus 40 zzso region and the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso human cell zzso We conclude that 3' end of the zzso gene contains sequence elements that behave as functional barriers of zzso function in the zzso blocking zzso Furthermore, our results also indicate that the zzso blocking function of zzso lacks zzso and species specificity and that it can act in transient zzso
