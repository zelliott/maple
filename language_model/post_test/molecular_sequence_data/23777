zzso peptides zzso are produced by a sequential zzso of zzso precursor protein zzso by zzso and zzso The lack of zzso production in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice suggests that zzso is the principal zzso in zzso zzso zzso of human zzso and zzso into zzso derived from zzso and zzso mice supports zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso However, these studies also revealed an alternative zzso zzso site in zzso designated as zzso resulting in zzso peptides starting at zzso The apparent inability of human zzso to make this zzso in zzso zzso and vice versa, led to the hypothesis that this alternative zzso was zzso In contrast, the results from human zzso transgenic mice demonstrated that the human zzso is able to cleave the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso To address this zzso we designed fluorescent resonance energy transfer zzso zzso containing the zzso and zzso sites within human and zzso zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso binding zzso of a zzso active site inhibitor zzso and zzso the pharmacological profiles for human and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso were able to cleave zzso at the zzso and zzso although with different zzso Moreover, the zzso potency of zzso toward zzso human and native zzso from mouse or guinea pig was zzso In zzso we have demonstrated, for the first time, that zzso zzso can recognize and cleave zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso It does not appear to be a significant species specificity to this zzso
