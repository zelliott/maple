zzso is a protein zzso modification that zzso in the regulation of numerous biological processes within the zzso Small zzso modifier zzso proteins are members of the zzso protein family and, similarly to zzso are zzso linked to a zzso zzso on a target protein via a zzso zzso To assess the specific mechanism triggered by zzso the identification of zzso protein zzso and of the precise zzso site to which zzso is bound is of critical zzso Despite hundreds of zzso proteins have been described as targets of zzso the identification of the precise zzso sites still represents an important zzso challenge because of the relatively low zzso in zzso and the highly dynamic nature of this zzso Moreover, mass zzso identification of zzso sites is hampered by the large zzso remnant of zzso proteins that are left on the modified zzso zzso upon zzso zzso The present review provides a survey of the strategies that have been exploited in order to zzso purify and identify zzso zzso and zzso sites in human cells on a large-scale zzso The success of the presented strategies helped to unravel the numerous activities of this zzso as it was shown by the exemplary case of the zzso protein family, whose zzso is here zzso
