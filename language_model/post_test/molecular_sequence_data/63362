Three types of full-length zzso zzso chicken zzso zzso were identified and their expression in the embryonic chicken brain was zzso The longest type of zzso is closely similar to that of other classic zzso and the predicted protein shows a high similarity to rat and human zzso The second type of zzso is considerably zzso The deduced protein lacks the zzso tail and the zzso domain, and contains a truncated fifth zzso repeat in the zzso domain zzso 68 zzso zzso suggesting that it is a soluble zzso The third type resembles the second one but is even shorter zzso 30 zzso acids in zzso All types contain unique short sequences at their C zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that all of the three zzso zzso are located on zzso 11, and consist of 12, 10, and 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed that the zzso of the three zzso zzso was temporally and zzso regulated in different parts of the embryonic chicken zzso The distinct regulation of gene expression suggested that the three zzso likely play different roles during brain zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the zzso of the long zzso was much stronger than that of the two shorter zzso In zzso zzso showed that the long zzso of zzso is expressed by a specific subset of brain zzso regions and layers in all major parts of the zzso
