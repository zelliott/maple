A group of zzso acid zzso were zzso zzso and evaluated as potential zzso of soybean zzso zzso on the basis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the best zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All compounds were zzso in zzso active site and showed that zzso group of compounds is oriented toward the zzso zzso in the active site of zzso and fixed by hydrogen bonding with zzso zzso It is assumed that zzso interaction of zzso would be in charge of zzso the zzso zzso The selectivity of the synthetic zzso in zzso of zzso was also compared with zzso by molecular modeling and multiple alignment zzso
