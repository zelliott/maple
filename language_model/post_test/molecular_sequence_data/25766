We present here experimental evidence that zzso zzso DNA molecules form an zzso structure in the presence of zzso zzso mobility and chemical and zzso zzso experiments on a zzso zzso DNA zzso formed from three zzso strands are zzso The zzso zzso of three species of a zzso junction in which pairs of arms are extended are found to differ in the presence of zzso one combination of zzso arms zzso significantly faster than the other zzso This effect is eliminated in the absence of zzso leading us to suggest that the zzso DNA junction forms an zzso structure due to preferential stacking of two of the arms at the junction in the presence of zzso The pattern of zzso of each zzso strand of the core complex exposed to zzso and zzso I zzso is unique, consistent with formation of an zzso structure in the presence of zzso We conclude that zzso junctions resemble zzso junctions in showing preferential stacking effects at the branch zzso zzso of the zzso patterns of linear duplexes and the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso further indicates that the branch point represents a site of enhanced binding for drugs, as it does in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso a zzso probe sensitive to zzso is enhanced at the branch site, consistent with loosening of base pairing or zzso at this zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
