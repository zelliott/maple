The zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso 4 zzso 20 zzso plays important roles in cell cycle control and zzso zzso By employing zzso zzso we have shown that it has a long recognition sequence motif covering seven zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso array zzso studies confirmed specific zzso of zzso and revealed that the zzso and zzso zzso on zzso of the zzso tail zzso zzso on zzso Similarly, zzso of the R located at the zzso position also reduced zzso of zzso zzso which had been shown previously to be zzso by zzso Based on the derived specificity profile, we identified 4 potential zzso zzso zzso After relaxing the specificity profile, we identified several more candidate zzso and showed efficient zzso of 20 novel zzso peptides by zzso However, apart from zzso and zzso none of the identified novel zzso targets was zzso at the protein zzso Since zzso and zzso both contain the target zzso in an zzso part of the zzso we conclude that the long recognition sequence of zzso makes it difficult to zzso a zzso in a folded region of a zzso because zzso acid side chains essential for recognition will be zzso
