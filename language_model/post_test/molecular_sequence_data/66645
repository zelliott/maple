The human zzso zzso binding protein 1 zzso has been reported to be involved in DNA zzso in DNA damage checkpoints and in zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter revealed that the early growth response zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso promoter was determined to region zzso to zzso using zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, deletion of the zzso zzso factor binding sites or zzso of the zzso zzso factor binding sites lead to reduced stimulation of the zzso promoter by zzso These data indicate a cooperative regulation of the zzso promoter by zzso and zzso
