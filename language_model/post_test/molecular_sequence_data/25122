zzso necrosis zzso zzso a protein released by activated zzso is involved in a wide variety of human diseases including septic zzso zzso and chronic zzso zzso binding protein zzso a zzso with high affinity to zzso isolated from zzso acts as an inhibitor of zzso by competing with the zzso zzso zzso We report here the partial zzso acid sequencing of human zzso as well as the isolation, zzso and expression of zzso clones zzso a human and rat zzso zzso The calculated Mr of the mature human and rat zzso zzso chains is zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso binding domain represents the soluble zzso which is released by zzso zzso zzso contains 24 zzso zzso and three potential zzso sites and shows sequence zzso to the zzso portions of zzso zzso chain and nerve growth factor zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells resulted in increased binding capacity for zzso and increased zzso with a zzso zzso directed against the human zzso zzso chain zzso When a stop zzso was introduced into the zzso at the site corresponding to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso a protein that reacted with zzso raised against natural zzso
