Cell surface zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of approximately 170 zzso found on a subset of zzso stem and zzso cells and on activated zzso and T zzso Although it has been suggested that zzso zzso may play a role in zzso zzso function and it is known that zzso zzso carries the Gov zzso system, the role of zzso in zzso cells remains largely zzso As a first step toward zzso the function of zzso we have isolated and characterized a human zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso The isolated zzso comprises a zzso zzso zzso frame zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso protein of approximately 162 zzso that contains a 21 zzso zzso leader zzso 17 potential zzso zzso sites, and a zzso zzso anchor zzso zzso We report that zzso is a novel member of the alpha 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso and we demonstrate that native zzso does indeed contain an intact zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso sequence suggests that zzso is likely activated by zzso zzso and thereby becomes capable of zzso zzso binding to adjacent molecules or zzso In addition, the predicted chemical zzso of the activated zzso zzso is zzso rather than resembling that of alpha zzso zzso Thus, not only is zzso potentially capable of zzso binding to zzso and protein targets, but the zzso of its activated zzso is likely extremely short, indicating that zzso action is highly restricted zzso to the site of its zzso
