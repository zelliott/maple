Natural killer zzso zzso zzso which recognize major zzso complex zzso proteins in humans, are known as killer zzso receptors zzso and are zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso In a screen for genes zzso expressed in the mouse zzso we discovered the first close zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family, which we named zzso Like zzso zzso shares zzso zzso acid identity with zzso zzso family members, with the majority of the zzso contained within the zzso zzso zzso is more similar to the zzso than to any other known member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This highly significant zzso suggests that the zzso family did not arise independently in zzso as has been previously suggested, but rather evolved from a primordial gene already present in the common zzso zzso zzso lacks the zzso protein motifs that mediate zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also lacks the zzso zzso signature (a zzso K zzso involved in association with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso found in some zzso Nevertheless, we zzso that zzso is functional, for the following reasons: zzso zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in immature zzso zzso zzso is regulated during zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is detected in zzso We also show that the mouse zzso contains a closely zzso transcribed zzso which we name zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso with three zzso zzso and also lacks zzso zzso motifs in its zzso zzso
