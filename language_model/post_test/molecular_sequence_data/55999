zzso growth zzso factor zzso is a potent zzso for zzso in primary zzso In response to liver damage, the levels of zzso zzso change in various zzso In this study, we isolated a zzso DNA zzso containing the promoter region of the rat zzso gene and analyzed zzso sites and their zzso in response to acute liver zzso zzso zzso synthesis starts from at least three sites in the liver, zzso and zzso One of these sites is zzso zzso in the liver and zzso in response to acute liver zzso In the zzso zzso region, several zzso sequence elements that might be involved in the regulation of zzso expression are located near the zzso zzso The effects of zzso related to these sequence elements on the production of zzso zzso were examined using a cell culture zzso zzso growth zzso 1 zzso 1) zzso the production of zzso zzso by Shay zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso element, one of the sequence elements present in the promoter zzso may mediate the zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso
