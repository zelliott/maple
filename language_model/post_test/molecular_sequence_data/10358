zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso of human zzso and of zzso of zzso and 24 zzso fish species, including 11 zzso and two temperate zzso were analyzed using maximum zzso Trees were derived for the zzso and zzso separately and for zzso arranged zzso using the human and zzso sequences as zzso in all zzso The zzso of the trees of the zzso and zzso are highly zzso and indicate a specific pattern of gene zzso and gene expression of zzso zzso which has not yet been investigated into more zzso The zzso fish generally contain a single major zzso and often a second minor zzso The zzso and zzso of the major components form a zzso group in all investigated trees, with the zzso zzso as their sister zzso The minor chains also are a zzso group and form an unresolved cluster with the major chains and the zzso of tuna and red zzso The zzso families zzso and zzso appear to be zzso
