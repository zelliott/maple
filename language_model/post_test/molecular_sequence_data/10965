Upon zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso in zzso coli, only the zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso to its zzso was achieved by transformation with a second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a coding sequence located immediately downstream of the second zzso gene present on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Due to this linkage, zzso was part of the cloned zzso DNA region and, consequently, zzso but not zzso was zzso as zzso in zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of 153 zzso acids and has a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso gene product contains zzso identical and zzso zzso zzso acids compared with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Although there is essentially no zzso region between zzso and zzso the zzso gene is autonomously expressed in zzso coli if flanked by 200 zzso of its zzso zzso zzso The structural independence of zzso was confirmed zzso as specific zzso react with the zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso allowed the in zzso zzso of zzso This zzso synthesis requires, in addition to zzso zzso and zzso and leads to a specific zzso activity comparable to that of natural zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the in zzso zzso was verified by the optical zzso zzso and by analysis of its in zzso zzso In agreement with the known overall zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene products, a zzso sequence is also observed at the C zzso of zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso this sequence is an integral part of the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso fatty acid zzso may be accomplished by distinct zzso zzso zzso and by intrinsic zzso zzso zzso
