The complete sequence of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso bacteria of zzso zzso has been zzso zzso which are found in a variety of zzso species, are of great interest due to their diverse interactions with different zzso which range from many forms of zzso zzso to zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso in particular zzso comparisons with other zzso bacteria, has revealed many insights into the biology and evolution of zzso and zzso in zzso For example, the zzso zzso is unique among zzso zzso zzso species in both being highly streamlined and containing very high levels of repetitive DNA and mobile DNA zzso This zzso coupled with multiple evolutionary zzso suggests that natural selection is somewhat inefficient in zzso most likely zzso to the occurrence of repeated population zzso Genome analysis predicts many zzso differences with the closely related zzso species, including the presence of intact zzso and zzso zzso which may compensate for an inability to obtain zzso directly from its host, as zzso zzso Other discoveries include the apparent inability of zzso to zzso zzso and the presence of the most genes zzso proteins with zzso repeat zzso of any zzso zzso yet zzso Despite the ability of zzso to zzso the zzso of its host, we find no evidence for either recent lateral gene transfer between zzso and zzso zzso or older transfers between zzso and any zzso zzso analysis further supports the hypothesis that zzso share a common zzso with the zzso but shows little support for the grouping of zzso with species in the order zzso With the availability of the complete zzso of both species and excellent genetic tools for the host, the zzso zzso zzso is now an ideal system for studying the biology and evolution of zzso zzso
