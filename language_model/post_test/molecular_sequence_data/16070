We have cloned and zzso the coding region of the period zzso gene from zzso zzso and zzso zzso A comparison with that of zzso zzso reveals that the conceptual translation products consist of zzso blocks of zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso portion, zzso approximately zzso of the protein zzso includes the perfect zzso repeat of zzso zzso which is absent from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on these observations and zzso transformation experiments, we suggest that the zzso zzso in the per primary zzso acid sequence contributes to the control of zzso zzso
