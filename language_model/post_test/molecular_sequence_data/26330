zzso We describe the results of a zzso study in which the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is compared with shorter zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso fragments of zzso The guinea-pig zzso was used in this study since it is the most sensitive preparation for zzso zzso thus far zzso zzso The biological results obtained with zzso zzso and zzso demonstrate that the zzso activity of the zzso zzso of zzso on the guinea-pig zzso depends on quite close structural requirements, strongly suggestive of a zzso zzso The following features appear to be essential for the biological activity: zzso the zzso free zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso function of zzso zzso the presence of zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso corresponding to the zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso was devoid of biological zzso This zzso might be related to the proposed existence of more than one zzso for the zzso family in the guinea-pig zzso
