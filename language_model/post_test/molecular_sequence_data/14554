The zzso or cellular depletion of protein zzso C zzso attendant to prolonged zzso by zzso zzso is a widely described property of this key family of signaling zzso However, neither the mechanism of zzso nor whether this mechanism occurs following stimulation by zzso zzso is zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso provides a timer for the lifetime of conventional zzso zzso converting the zzso into a species that can be zzso and zzso following zzso induced by either zzso zzso or natural zzso The regulation by zzso requires both the zzso activity of the zzso and the presence of a Pro immediately following the zzso zzso of the turn motif zzso site, one of two zzso sites that is zzso during the maturation of zzso zzso Furthermore, the second zzso zzso site, the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Our data are consistent with a model in which zzso binds the zzso motif of conventional zzso zzso to catalyze the zzso of the zzso zzso bond at the turn zzso thus converting these zzso zzso into species that can be efficiently zzso following zzso
