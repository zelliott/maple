Studies of zzso zzso continue to provide information about the evolution of zzso zzso viruses zzso and the origin and emergence of zzso since chimpanzees in west-central Africa zzso zzso zzso were recognized as the zzso of zzso zzso which have been related zzso to zzso Using in-house zzso zzso to study zzso zzso we tested 104 zzso captive chimpanzees from zzso and zzso We identified two new cases of zzso infection in zzso and characterized a new zzso strain, zzso The complete sequence zzso zzso was obtained by a zzso zzso zzso approach to generate 17 overlapping zzso zzso analyses of separated genes zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso is closely related to zzso and zzso No significant variation in viral load was observed during 3 years of zzso but a significantly lower zzso T cells count was found in infected than in zzso chimpanzees zzso No clinical symptoms of zzso infection were observed in the zzso zzso Further field studies with zzso methods are needed to determine the zzso geographic distribution, species association, and natural history of zzso strains in the zzso habitat in zzso
