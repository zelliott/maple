zzso of ever-increasing raw sequence information generated by modern zzso sequencing technologies faces multiple challenges, such as gene function analysis and zzso zzso Indeed, nearly zzso of genes in plants zzso proteins of unknown zzso zzso characterization of these genes is one of the main challenges in modern zzso In this regard, the availability of full-length zzso clones may fill in the gap created between sequence information and biological zzso zzso zzso clones facilitate functional analysis of the corresponding genes enabling manipulation of their expression in zzso systems and the generation of a variety of zzso versions of the native zzso In addition, the development of full-length zzso sequences has the power to improve the quality of zzso zzso 

We developed an integrated method to generate a new zzso zzso collection enriched in full-length and rare transcripts of different citrus species from multiple zzso and zzso zzso We constructed a total of 15 zzso libraries, from which we isolated zzso high-quality zzso representing zzso different zzso zzso of zzso and proportion of full-length clones range from 8 to 33, and 67 to 85, respectively, indicating good efficiency of the approach zzso The new zzso collection adds zzso new citrus zzso representing 1831 zzso to the collection of citrus genes available in the public zzso To facilitate functional analysis, zzso were introduced in a zzso cloning zzso for zzso functional analysis of genes in zzso zzso we describe the technical methods used in the library construction, sequence analysis of clones and the zzso of zzso a citrus zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso as an example of a practical application of the engineered Gateway zzso for functional zzso 

The new zzso collection denotes an important step towards the identification of all genes in the citrus zzso Furthermore, public availability of the zzso clones generated in this study, and not only their zzso enables testing of the biological function of the genes represented in the zzso zzso of the citrus zzso zzso zzso in zzso results in early zzso along with other zzso resembling the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the members of the zzso gene family play similar roles in these quite distant plant zzso
