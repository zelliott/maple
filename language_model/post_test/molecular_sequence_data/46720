The zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been completely zzso A total of 57 densely packed genes has been identified, including the basic set typically found in animals and zzso as well as seven genes characteristic of zzso and plant zzso and specifying zzso proteins and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso large zzso zzso gene contains two group II zzso that are extraordinarily similar to those found in the zzso zzso zzso suggesting a recent lateral zzso transfer between a bacterial and a zzso zzso zzso features of zzso zzso zzso include the presence of two zzso zzso repeats that likely mediate zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso and of numerous sequence zzso in the coding and zzso zzso Comparative analysis of red zzso zzso zzso from five different, zzso distant orders reveals that zzso zzso are unusually uniform in size and gene zzso Finally, zzso analyses provide strong evidence that red algae share a common ancestry with green algae and zzso
