The Wyoming strain of zzso infectious zzso virus zzso is a highly virulent field strain that replicates to high zzso in zzso only in primary zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso strains zzso zzso replicate in primary zzso zzso kidney and zzso zzso cells as well as in the cell lines zzso and zzso Wyoming and zzso viruses differ extensively both in long terminal repeat zzso and envelope region zzso We have compared the promoter activities of the Wyoming zzso with those of zzso derived from zzso viruses by examining their abilities to drive a zzso reporter gene as well as by construction of infectious molecular clones differing only in zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso sequences are a major restriction for growth of the Wyoming strain of zzso in zzso
