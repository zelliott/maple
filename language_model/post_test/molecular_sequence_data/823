zzso zzso receptors zzso are zzso zzso proteins belonging to the large family of zzso zzso zzso zzso possess various binding sites which interact with compounds of different chemical nature, including zzso Historically first peptides found to act on zzso were synthetic fragments of snake zzso competitive zzso zzso Later it was shown that fragments of zzso from rabies virus, having zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso pit zzso zzso zzso zzso bind in a similar way, zzso being efficient zzso of zzso zzso zzso substance P appears to interact with the channel zzso of zzso zzso a zzso forming senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease, also can bind to zzso although the mode of binding is still zzso However, the most well-studied peptides interacting with the zzso sites of zzso are so-called zzso zzso zzso from marine snails of zzso zzso First zzso were discovered in the late 1970s, and now it is a rapidly growing family due to isolation of peptides from multiple zzso species, as well as to zzso and chemical synthesis of new zzso Because of their unique selectivity towards distinct zzso zzso zzso became valuable tools in zzso zzso Recent X-ray structures of zzso complexes with zzso zzso a model of zzso zzso zzso revealed the details of the zzso zzso sites and provided the basis for design of novel zzso
