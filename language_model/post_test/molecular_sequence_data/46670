The zzso state of zzso can influence zzso zzso carried out by zzso such as zzso and zzso is commonly associated with zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso by the three known human zzso zzso 2 and 3, causes zzso zzso The known human zzso represent a single family and are zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Here we identify and characterize zzso a representative of a new human zzso zzso family, which is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso unlike other zzso zzso between the nucleus and the zzso in a process involving active nuclear zzso In the nucleus, zzso associates with the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso to zzso results in the repression of zzso zzso zzso a function that requires the zzso domain of zzso These results identify zzso as a nuclear target for zzso repression and suggests that zzso may be a novel mechanism for controlling the nuclear activity of this new family of zzso
