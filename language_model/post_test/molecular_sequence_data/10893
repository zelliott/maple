A genetic zzso of human serum zzso zzso is detected by zzso zzso zzso Two zzso peaks, which were in the ratio of approximately one, were clearly zzso One of the zzso had the same migration time as normal zzso zzso zzso and the other zzso zzso had a longer migration zzso zzso gel zzso of zzso fragments zzso of zzso X indicated that the zzso acid substitution was localized in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso because of anomalous migration of zzso in the zzso The zzso mapping of the zzso peptides from the zzso zzso revealed clearly the existence of a new zzso and the lack of two normal zzso The sequence analysis of the zzso zzso collected by zzso zzso showed that the zzso of the zzso zzso corresponded to that of zzso in zzso zzso The substitution site, zzso acid at the position zzso was revealed by sequence determination of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso
