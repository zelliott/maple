The zzso function zzso factor, zzso has been shown to play a critical role in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The previously zzso zzso system has been used to identify zzso zzso promoters recognized by zzso zzso containing zzso This method allowed identification of 34 zzso promoters that direct expression of 62 genes in zzso zzso 23 of which (including several specific for zzso zzso have not been identified previously to be dependent upon zzso in zzso zzso The promoters were confirmed in zzso zzso and zzso start points of the promoters were determined by zzso zzso All the promoters contained sequences highly similar to the consensus sequence of zzso zzso The identified genes belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins involved in primary zzso DNA repair systems and zzso zzso and regulatory zzso zzso zzso and folding factors, proposed zzso and zzso and zzso proteins with unknown zzso Several of these zzso genes have been shown to play a role in zzso of zzso zzso
