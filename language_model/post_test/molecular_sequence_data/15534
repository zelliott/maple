zzso is a functionally important component in transforming growth zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso as well as zzso zzso retention of zzso protein are zzso involved in gastric zzso Here, we examined the expression of zzso gene and protein in oral zzso cell zzso zzso and analyzed the zzso status of zzso promoter zzso 

About 10 normal oral zzso and 30 zzso were collected to examine zzso expression by zzso analysis and zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out on the same specimens to analyze the zzso status of zzso zzso In addition, the stored zzso zzso including 40 oral zzso zzso and 120 zzso were examined by zzso zzso 

zzso gene and protein were zzso in zzso due to promoter zzso zzso zzso occurred zzso Both zzso of zzso protein expression zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso zzso were correlated with the differentiation grades in zzso 

zzso plays an important role in oral zzso It may be a useful diagnostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for zzso
