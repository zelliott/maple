zzso zzso DNA zzso alpha zzso zzso was used to analyze primer zzso zzso On a chemically zzso 36 zzso DNA template, a part of upstream region of human zzso zzso the primer synthesis started from a zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso in DNA zzso zzso complex zzso zzso reaction product, while DNA zzso zzso zzso gave the similar products, zzso and zzso indicating that the site recognition was carried out by zzso itself and DNA zzso alpha zzso has an auxiliary role on zzso zzso analysis using DNA fragments carrying base zzso further revealed that the existence of zzso zzso around the starting sites was important for zzso zzso Competition analysis showed that the zzso was strongly zzso by zzso and to a much lesser extent by zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso could bind to the DNA template, and this complex formation was also zzso by zzso but not by zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso interacts with the starting site by binding directly with zzso zzso
