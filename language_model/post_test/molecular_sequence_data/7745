A compact region in the human class III major zzso locus contains the human genes for the fourth component of human complement zzso and steroid zzso zzso in one zzso orientation, while the gene for the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the last zzso of zzso on the opposite strand of DNA in the opposite zzso zzso This complex locus is duplicated into A and B zzso so that the organization is zzso Although this zzso event truncated the zzso zzso gene to a zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene is zzso active in the adrenal zzso To examine the basis of the zzso expression of zzso and zzso we cloned the zzso region that lies between the cap sites for zzso and zzso and analyzed its promoter activity in both the zzso and the C4 zzso zzso zzso sequences lie within the first 75 to 138 zzso from the zzso cap site, and weaker elements lie within 128 zzso of the zzso cap site that function in both liver and adrenal zzso Because these 128 zzso upstream from the zzso cap site are perfectly preserved in the zzso gene zzso zzso we sought to determine whether a transcript similar to zzso arises within the zzso zzso zzso protection zzso zzso zzso and zzso show that adrenal cells contain a novel transcript, termed short zzso zzso which has the same open reading frame as zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
