The zzso and zzso genes are the strongest zzso genes identified for breast cancer zzso However, zzso have been incompletely investigated due to their large size and the zzso zzso that occasionally occur within zzso Here we performed a comprehensive zzso analysis for zzso in 206 Korean patients with breast zzso We analyzed all zzso and zzso regions of zzso by direct sequencing and screened deletions or zzso involving zzso by multiplex zzso probe zzso We reconstructed zzso using zzso single zzso zzso zzso to investigate the possibility of a founder effect among zzso zzso In our series, 38 patients zzso had one or more zzso zzso including 10 novel zzso Three additional patients carried novel distinct zzso zzso with potentially harmful zzso No large deletions or zzso involving zzso were identified in our zzso zzso analyses and zzso separation suggested that the most frequent zzso in Koreans, zzso might have originated from a common zzso zzso zzso were more frequent in a group with family history, bilateral cancer or multiple site cancer than in a group without the risk factors described or an unknown risk zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in the zzso cancer group were not higher than in the unknown risk zzso Our results will be helpful to understand the zzso spectrum in zzso genes and establish a genetic screening zzso In addition, this study suggests the possibility of the first true founder zzso of zzso identified in the Korean zzso
