To date, two classes of mouse major urinary protein zzso genes have been zzso the expressed genes and the zzso zzso The data presented in this paper define a third class, the silent zzso zzso which are potentially functional but appear not to be expressed under normal zzso We describe a zzso zzso zzso containing two zzso zzso and zzso that are nearly zzso differing at only three positions zzso than zzso zzso over the entire zzso zzso zzso unit and approximately 1 zzso of zzso zzso The similarity between these two genes extends over greater than 35 zzso Using specific zzso we have shown that the zzso gene is expressed in zzso mice, primarily in the zzso zzso whereas the zzso gene is not zzso However, we found that when a zzso DNA zzso containing the zzso gene was introduced into the mouse germ line, mice in two of the four transgenic lines expressed this gene at a high level and with the zzso characteristic of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of the zzso zzso gene is due not to a lack of functional positive regulatory zzso but to zzso zzso position zzso
