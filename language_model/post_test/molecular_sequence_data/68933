Five to zzso percent of zzso B1 zzso cells from zzso mice produce zzso that bind zzso mouse red blood cells and the zzso zzso zzso The majority of these B cells express either of two zzso zzso gene combinations, zzso zzso 4 or zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso genes are rearranged to zzso and zzso third zzso determining regions zzso of restricted length and zzso These and other observations argue strongly that zzso B1 cells are zzso zzso To determine when selection of zzso B1 cells begins in mice we have used the zzso chain reaction to amplify zzso zzso from zzso of fetal and zzso mice, and determined the zzso zzso sequences of individual zzso We find an unusually low ratio of productive zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso at both zzso zzso P zzso in day 1 zzso are biased in D gene use and in the sequence and length of their deduced zzso These biases are similar to those of zzso B1 cells in the adult zzso D gene use and zzso length and sequence are significantly less biased among zzso P zzso 2 to 3 days earlier in the day 18 fetal zzso We suggest that this rapid change in repertoire is due to positive zzso selection that is dependent on the sequence of zzso We suggest further that the majority of zzso cells are not zzso selected and consequently undergo programmed cell zzso The evidence of restriction in day 1 zzso zzso and the low zzso ratio in the fetus suggests that selection of zzso cells begins before zzso
