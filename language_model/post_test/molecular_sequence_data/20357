We present a new approach to obtain details on the distribution and average structure and locations of zzso zzso The approach combines zzso pulse double zzso resonance zzso to determine zzso distances between zzso in spin labeled zzso zzso electron spin echo envelope zzso zzso experiments to measure water exposure and the direct interaction of spin labeled peptides with zzso zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Carlo zzso simulations to derive the zzso zzso zzso and average zzso of the native zzso and zzso mimicking the spin zzso To demonstrate the approach, we investigated the zzso and solution state of the well-known zzso zzso zzso used as a model zzso A good agreement was obtained between the experimental results and the zzso simulations regarding the distribution of distances between the labeled zzso zzso the side chain mobility, and the zzso zzso A good agreement in the extent of membrane penetration of zzso acids in the zzso core was obtained as well, but the zzso data reported a somewhat deeper membrane penetration of the zzso compared to the zzso Overall, zzso zzso on the membrane surface, in a zzso state, as an zzso zzso with its zzso zzso in the hydrocarbon region of the membrane and its charged and polar zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
